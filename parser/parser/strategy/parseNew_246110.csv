												Massive Chalice combines recent X-Com combat with a hero breeding system. When I first read about it I was really interested and excited, but only after a few hours, I came to the conclusion, that there is no life in this game.Let me explain that a little:The combat: An immersive game cant be shallow. If you played the recent X-Com titles you will have noticed that they watered down the combat compared to the old titles. Massive Chalice has a watered down recent X-Com combat system. It lacks any strategy, if you ask me. There is no flanking, no useful cover system. In the end, you will only care about the swiftest way to wipe away your enemies. And when it comes to wiping out, you will mostly care for the highest damage. I don't feel any synergy between the classes.Home/map screen: While waiting for the fast forward function to pop up any events, the game feels lifeless. Nothing will happen. Your map does not live. You wont see any changes in your nation within a hundred of years. While I do not care for graphic quality, I care for visuals. I do not like to stare at a lifeless map for a huge amount of time. This lifelessness continues:Research/castle: You have the possibility to research new stuff. Weapons, armors, items, whatever. The visuals for that are not appealing. They are mostly symbols and text. Some areas actually show a nice background, which helps your kingdom come alive, but mostly you will look at text and symbols. Spacebase DF-9 had a similar system, which is really not appealing.Levels: The levels are mostly tiny arenas or tunnel-like maps where you have to fight the Cadence. Combined with the shallow combat, this will rapidly feel like heavy repetition. No map is unique, nor interesting. Its always about search and destroy. In some events, you have to defend a castle and protect your breeders. There, you will fight in their castles. Man, those castles feel so dead, I would rather just jump down the castle tower. Everything is grey, lifeless, looks like a maze. Where are those libraries, dining rooms, stables, whatever? May be they are there and I just did not see them, but especially the castle maps do not look appealing. Depressing, to be honest.Death: Permadeath is great. That makes every decision important. But with all those deaths, with all this loss, there should be a place to worship your most important resource. At a certain point, I stopped caring about what color the heroes wear, wether they are male or female, which banner they carry. At a certain point, it was all about stats. They are a resource and that made me feel pretty lonely. No bonding to any fictional character. No caring for any hero. No favorite. I know that this not really avoidable, but there should be a way to truly honor and remember my heroes. Make them come alive for the short duration they will be with you.The Chalice, the voices: The voice acting is pretty good. I like it, but it wears off just too fast. The two talkers start to repeat themselves early and that is counter-immersive. Also: Since they are no persons, but a massive chalice, I felt pretty alone in the game. I could not bond with them, because they had no visuals I could stick to, no interaction. Nothing.In sum, it may sound a little drastic to some, but Massive Chalice was only entertaining for a short duration of time. The rest was depressing. It felt shallow, trivial and lonely so many times in my short duration of game  time. With no avatar, no continuing visible NPCs, no bonding with your brood, no life in the castle on the map, I felt like I entered a world of nothingness. Cold lonely nothingness. With two voices in my head, that kept entertaining each other like a dark circus show, somewhere in a lifeless void, doing the same old trick over and over and over again.I am sorry, but ~20€ or whatever the price may be now is way too much money for this game.  I can not recommend buying it unless you enjoy mind numbness, not caring for your party/characters, hollow design, 7 different enemies throughout the whole game and ... so ... on.			"

												Massive Chalice is a turn-based strategy game that has the player rule over a land that is under attack. The defense force consists of heroes, which battle in short, turn-based skirmishes against invading forces. Heroes live for 70 years on average, but the player has to defend the land for 300 years. Therefore the player has to marry off heroes so that they produce children, which get some of their genes and personality traits from their parents. This way, the player attempts to breed heroes of good stock, so that future generations are better able to defend the land against the invaders who get stronger all the time. Sometimes a hero may leave behind his weapon upon death, which then becomes a family relic, that gains better properties over time when it is used in combat.While the game has some original ideas and can be fun to play, it also has some very noticable flaws. What irks me the most is the lack of control that the player has over important parts of the game. Even on ""Normal"" mode, the game is really hard. Being hard is not a negative by itself, but Massive Chalice is hard because of randomness that is beyond the player's range of influence. The most prevalent example of the game's randomness are the events that occur regularly. An event is a story moment in which the player has to make one or more choices, picking from several textual options presented. Some of these choices lead to slightly beneficial results, some of them lead to very bad results. But what result you get is completely random! There is no way to influence the outcome. You pick and hope for the best. A hero gets a positive trait, or a negative one, or your best hero might die, or you might lose a relic, or you might lose part of your land to corruption (and once you go down that road, you are on the losing track).You also have relatively little influence over what genes the heroes get. Yes, they are likely to get some genes from their parents, but these might be good or bad, and they might get new genes that their gene pool did not contain before. Since parents only get a few children, it is not uncommon for a family of good stock, which you carefully bred, weeding out all the bad offspring by sending them into battle or to the Sagewright, to get wasted in one generation because the offspring gets inferior random genes or there is no more good partner available. There is almost nothing that the player can do to protect a family against that. Basically, the only thing that may help is calling forth new heroes, which takes about 5 years of research, and produces 5 new heroes with random attributes. Usually all of them are crap -- Infertile, Sickly, Clumsy, Nervous wrecks. Again, complete randomness.Finally, there is the issue of the combat. The enemies are relatively weak for the first half of the game, but after the halfway point they ramp up in difficulty in big strides. And then the combat rolls are really starting to get on your nerves, as a hero that gets attacked might evade the attack, or might lose one or two hitpoints, or lose all of his hitpoints in one go. There seems to be very little in between.The game has been compared to XCOM, and it definitely has a lot of similarities. But XCOM offers the player many more ways to mitigate the random effects of the game, both in strategic decisions and tactical approach.Making the player suffer badly from the whims of random events is a serious design flaw for any strategy game. I therefore cannot recommend Massive Chalice. I have had some fun with it, but I am always interested in seeing what Double Fine comes up with, and got the game at a big discount. It may be worth a couple of dollars or euros to you, but do not get it at full price.			"

												Bought this quite some time ago and patiently waited for the release. Played for 2 hours and honestly can't say i want to launch it ever again. Outright boring and plain the game simply forces you to breed your characters and constantly fight same enemies on same maps in turn based battles. There's barely any strategy involved and the game is shallow beyond any words.Breed, fight, build a building, wait, breed, fight, wait, breed, fight, wait, breed, fight, wait and so on and so forth. Where's the fun in that?The story is barely covered, the characters do not have any backgrounds or personalities and they die like flies anyway. There is no fun to be had here at all. I think the game is either unfinished and rushed just like DF9 or at least has a lot of wasted potential and bad design choices.Maybe they should've focused on building aspect more or maybe they should've focused on characters so each one was unique and interesting. Either way - its boring and no amount of love towards Double Fine and Tim Schafer can fix that. Also -50% in the first 3 weeks since the release is a pretty desperate move. Hopefully Double Fine can recover from DF9 and this game since apparently not enough people buy it.			"

												More like Massive Disappointment. This feels more like the start of an Early Access game rather than the end of it. Edited for clarification, and typos. It's not that this is a bad game per se, so much as there are better games at the same price point.I'll keep this short. I typically play on easy for those of you who actually care. Pro: The Generation concept is neat.Neutral: Apparently, if you make it past Year 150 'Advanced' enemies make the game more fun. This was not my experience, but if you like watching your heroes suffer increasingly horrible odds to placate a giant talking goblet, more power to you.Con: Due to the gameplay, if you don't get the baby train rolling immediately, you lose. Between age, 'traits' (Infertile), and combat, time is a far greater threat than the Cadence could ever hope to be.Con: You can breed, and you can fight. That's it. Despite the simplicity, Double Fine somehow managed to make the combat both incredibly boring and frustrating. Try not to get attached to your people.Con: Startling lack of endgame content. You've seen everything Massive Chalice has to offer by year 150 or so. The enemies have different varitions, there are hybrid classes (which mix/combine class skills and armor appearance).			"

												A very frustrating game. A full campaign took me a little under 22 hours to finish. There's too much I can complain about, so I've reduced this review to major grievances.Gameplay can get boring real quick. Prepare to fight in the same maps over and over again. With 3 classes (plus 6 breedable hybrids that have minor tweaks) there is not a lot of variety. I wish there was more to do in the game. I wish you could be more proactive in fighting the Cadence, in some way taking the fight to them. Staring at a timeline waiting for the Cadence to attack is a very dull experience. The random events in-between attacks do more harm than good. I constantly lost buildings, heroes, and gained negative traits. Each time the timeline stopped for a random event I dreaded it. There's practically no story, no lore. 300 years of defending against an enemy and I knew nothing about them. I was hoping that the ending would explain or at least give some insight into the Cadence, but of course it didn't. The ending is very short, vague, and feels like a cliffhanger.			"

												A good game that stops short of being great.Massive Chalice takes tactical turn-based games, and adds a new twist: a real sense of time.  This creates some interesting strategy: keep your best warrior fighting, turn her into a regent so that her children get her warrior genes, or retire her to a Standard so that all children get the benefit of her experience?  I've never had a game before where I've had to worry about where my next warriors come from when my current ones die of old age.  A veteran and skilled player of many strategy games, I got my butt handed to me my first game just because it requires such a new way of thinking.  Brilliant.Then it stops.  After about 100 years, it all becomes repetitive.  Each generation plays the same as the last.  Each choice is decided by exactly the same parameters as the one a generation before.   The enemies are the exact same, just with more health and attack power (you deal more damage and have more health, so it comes out the exact same).  You just do the same thing over and over again, and win. I didn't have to adapt my tactics once in the last 200 years of the game, which is a shame considering how fun the first 100 years were.  And in those last 200 years, there are over 20 battles of the same thing, again and again.I still enjoyed the last 200 years, but by the time I had beaten the game, I was done with it.  Tragic, really, because the game had so much promise.			"

												Read the other reviews for in depth content of this game, I might not get too in depth about mechanics and such, I'm just gonna blabber for a bit.I personally enjoyed this game and have played through it multiple times. It starts out as interesting considering it's initial concept involving heroes and trying to create and maintain bloodlines with good genes that can carry on to future generations, while hoping the bad ones don't... While it's true that heroes are bound to die, whether from time or battle, and thus you can't get ""too attached"" to them, you still can have favorites and favorite bloodlines. I've noticed a bunch of reviews whining about not being able to keep the same hero forever, but that's what happens over 300 years. People die. I always liked the system and felt it was pretty neat that my favorite heroes can live on in their kin with their genes and house name.Make your favorites advance in level through battle, do what it takes to keep them alive for multiple battles, then make them a regent before they're too old to make heroic babies that have potential to be your new favorite! It's not hard to understand. Hell, if they kill enough cadence and get enough xp, their weapon becomes a relic that can be passed down to others in their bloodline. Cool.I'd recommend playing this game on easy the first time around to get the swing of things, then try it on hard (if you feel confident about things), then try it on hard with IRON mode enabled (which just means you only get one save that's overwritten after each action you take)... I also played it on Brutal difficulty with IRON mode and I guess you could do that too, I just hope you don't start out that way.The different difficulties are there so that once you pick up on the game and figure things out, you can apply the strategies you've learned from a previous playthrough and make sure you don't repeat your mistakes, while having a greater challenge to keep things fun... The game is replayable, at least in my opinion. The combat system isn't the most exciting, and that's what makes it tough to want to play again, so I wouldn't recommend sitting down and marathoning it as if you had to beat it as soon as possible. Just take it easy.Think about your choices carefully and decide what would be the best course of action and things like that, and if you mess up, then load a save and learn from it (unless you're playing IRON mode, in which case try your best to not ♥♥♥♥ things up anymore). At first, I played for hours, but for my following playthroughs I played for maybe 30 minutes to an hour or two a day and got plenty of enjoyment out of it. I now currently have 100+ hours and I haven't played it in a while but I noticed it was on sale for only $7.99 right now and thought I'd write a quick review. It kinda makes me wanna play it again actually, and I think I might.Long story short, it's a pretty good game, though not without its faults, I'll admit. I do recommend it though, especially since it's on sale for less than half price... Give it a shot.This was my first review and I don't think I did a good job, but either way, I recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
								I Kickstarted the game and I am writing this review not of the full game, but the current early access version.And as it is now - I would not recommend anyone to get it. Yet.The game clearly has huge potential, but overall lacks in content.The turn based combat is rather fun. Not that many options, so sooner or later it will get repetetive, but unlockable skills help in that regard.Outside of combat, you are managing a very small group of lands, on which you can build one building, to improve the building times, hero training or just add keeps for your existing heroes to breed. As you pass years, not turns, your heroes will drop like flies. I personally don't like how fast that happens, making one generation of heroes fight from 1 to 4 times usually.When they die, they can leave a heirloom to improve other hero from thier house.The game is about limited resource management (heroes) and combat proficiency (again, heroes).Outside of that simple mechanic (to not die out...) there is nothing else to do. If you do that, your heroes will eventually level up and get stronger.He story wouldn't exist if not for the two ""voices"" of the Massive Chalice, that bring some falvour to the, otherwise lifeless world.Events (text + choices) happen, to help with that. So far, I've seen mostly negative outcomes though.I would say the game would be quite awesome, if there was more lands available, more building types (3!?), more hero types, customization of houses and heroes... Maybe item crafting? The game is begging for those,The game does provide a bit of fun, and while it certainly IS PLAYABLE and enjoyable (if for a short ammount of time), the potential for it is so, so much greater than what it currently is.So, no. I do not recommend the game at this point.Wait a little while, maybe they will improve the game in the places that it's lacking?If the game was already finished and the price was half what it is now, I would recommend it. But there is still time to release date.			"

												Did I get my money's worth because of the hours I have played? Yes. You will get your money's worth after one playthrough because it simply takes that long to beat it.  The thing that kept me going was the simple fact that I liked wanting to mate the houses and see what type of combination would spawn from my nests.  Pushing the time to complete a research was also nice.   Now for the bad part.  From year 1 day 1 until year 300, the enemies are all the same.  There are just a few types of enemies (7 in total) and then in the latter part of the game they are simply given more HP.  There's also no ""boss"" monster either... not even at the end.  The combat quickly felt tedious. At the end when I knew I was going to win no matter what, I skipped the last 2 combats and let my continent fall just so I can hurry it up.  Also you don't feel any connection to your heroes at all.  They are just as expendable as a lit match. Even if you get awesome ones, they may only end up in a few battles (maybe 5 at most).  The random events are totally RNG (but I feel as if it leans more on screwing you over than helping).  There's no hint or something to base any of your decisions on.  You pick one and it could end up badly or good.  Heck I've played games where at least there are ""advisors"" that give you the illusion of making the ""correct"" choice.  This is totally a close your eyes and pick.When I finally did beat the game, I decided to play a 2nd time.  However, again, I couldn't bring myself to continue after I saw the SAME MONSTER again doing the SAME thing but with lower HP this time around.  I understand that there are a lot of games that re-skin their models, but there has to be more for a game that is focused around combat.  Comparing this game to XCOM is a complete slap in the face where they offered 10 different aliens (I just looked it up and it would be 11 if you count the zombie)  Not counting the reskin for the Mutons and floater and sectoids. But at least the reskins did something DIFFERENT.

												1st off - you will spend most your time idle staring at the world map watching time go by not doing anything but waiting for an attack or research getting finished. This game works against itself in so many ways.  The parts that could be cool are ruined with only one fight every 10 years and the lack of being able to keep heroes around or leveled up.  It is enterly based on getting good marriages.  However when they added the class mixing it became infinately harder to get (and keep) the classes you'd like to use in combat.  So things seem much more random than I would like for a game about strategic planning and setting up matches for marriage.  Then most the people have bad traits you don't want but guess what your limited number of people means that you get even less of a choice in the type of people you get.  At one point in every game I run out of heroes and have to start over.  This game just doesn't do it for me.Yeaup still true today. 11-29-15			"

Product received for free
												As I made my way through the 300 years it takes to charge the chalice, I was originally planning to write a cautious positive review. This game deserves some praise for the solid mechanics it demonstrates. They make the game fun, even through plodding self-insert writing, repetitive gameplay, and general lack of refinement in several aspects of the game. I'd planned to say that the game was good, and would have been great, if only polished more. Unfortunately, after finishing, I find myself unable to give this recommendation.For context, everything in the game builds towards the charging of the chalice. You send crack teams of five controllable heros out to occasional battles, and decide the research, intercourse and economy of an upper class of those 'attuned to the chalice' in a nation beset by a sinister enemy, the Cadence. The rest of the time, you 'sleep'. The game builds the chalice as a mystical power, with dialogue-based time shenanigans and curative powers that spice up the 300 year wait.These 3 choice dialogues were actually a very necessary respite for the tedium of waiting 300 years, going through battles that because of the mildly varied but still quite limited classes and locations soon became a bit repetitive.So naturally, I expected something special for the final battle. Perhaps being able to use all of my heros in an epic final stand, or, going off the time shenanigans earlier, being able to choose my heros from all of those who'd passed away as well as those alive. So, I was somewhat disappointed that the selection was made normally. It turned out that there actually was something different about the final battle, the enemy attempted to attack the 500HP chalice instead of your heros, something that actually made it easier. Oh well, I'd been playing on normal, so perhaps it would have been more epic on greater difficulty. Dispatch the last of the enemies and... done!Only, the ending was a disappointment. A flop on the visual, emotional, and writing level. Not much worse than the starting cutscene, but after 300 years... you expect something a bit more. Drama, a last look at your kingdom, something. There *was* a grand reveal, but so hamhanded that it had very little impact, and didn't make the half-day that playing the game through takes worthwhile.So I retried the game on brutal hardcore difficulty, though it's worth noting that I never restored from save on my first game. Long story short, my heart was no longer in it. The whole game builds toward the end, and since I now knew that was no great shakes, it was just a slog. I made it maybe 50 years before my alchemists blew up, and even though I very well might persist, I no longer felt it.TL;DR Brilliant idea, but disappointing.			"

Early Access Review
								A EA review after a single playthrough (next to several failed attempts) which took just under 20 hours.Let's clear up things right away:-The game is titled Early Access, but according to the developer it's pretty much finished content-wise and they mainly intend to do open beta testing (in EA) and bugfixing, as well as UI improvements now.-Despite some... questionable history of this game's dev regarding other Early Access games, this one is fairly playable, so there's no threat of it being stopped before release.Now, on to the actual game. Imagine a crossover of a light dynasty-simulation, some light text-RPG, and a light turn-based tactical game. Yes, it's actually not very deep in any of it's components. And whilst the concept of mixing those is quite good (and the prime reason why I got this game), but it clearly has weak points.Effectively, the game comes down to managing your heroes and nation on a strategic view (not unlike managing your base in XCOM) and managing a crew of five heroes in a tactical turn-based battle, which is both affected by your strategical decisions and does affect your strategical situation.However, whilst the whole ""breed your heroes to genetically engineer the next clan of super-warriors"" is very interesting and the various mechanics like tutoring, personalities and inheritable 'relic' weapons definitely add onto that, the system still feels a tad flat when it comes to content. Most traits are just ""+X of stat Y"" (or, in negative form, the opposite). Personalities often are similar, albeit here we see some more interesting concepts, like boosts when sticking to the group, or opposed a buff when a hero is alone. But, across my entire gameplay, I felt like ignoring those traits was a good bet, given their actual impact was minimal compared to the additional movement it would have required to actually set up their situations. In the end it really came down to just breed ""whoever is the most fertile and has the most positive traits"" of the right class and then let RNG throw something useful at you. Across my entire game I tried to specifically create distinct classes (f.e. long-sight, high-dexteriy rangers and quick, extra-strength warriors) but somehow ended up with a wild mix of traits and 'Quick learner' on pretty much everyone. Which apparently was enough to beat the game with ease.Because, yeah, it took some failed starts, but that was mostly because the game does a rather bad job at explaining things to you. So, effectively you play, mess up horribly, are forced to restart, repeat a few times, until you grasp the basics. And then the same problem as XCOM kicks in: Past a certain point, you are either already dead or so absurdly strong that the tactical battles become tedious and uneventful.Which brings us to the second part of the game, the tactical battles.Rudamentary movement system with an occasionally clunky UI and initially confusing controls. Likewise goes for the 'cover' system and the AI. At some point you get into it, and it's not bad in itself, but again, casual players would probably need a tad more help early on.A big problem, in my oppinion, is the complete lack of a time limit and the fact you start with free stealth scouts (think of Mimetic Skin of XCOM) from the start of the game. It's trivial to sneak around, wait until a single enemy wanders off, then alphastrike him down. Rinse and repeat, unless you mess up it's not uncommon to end missions without even taking damage. This only gets worse as the game progresses (as mentioned) and your characters become more and more versatile and accurate (because, really, the only times where you take relevant damage is either because you make a big missplay or all 3 90% attacks miss).Shortly summarized, the game really needs some more balance tweaking, both in between little details like classes and weapons, as well as difficulty wise. Which is already on the list of the devs, according to the last info I read.And then there are a handful of bugs and weird design issues. F.e. hitting a group of Bulwarks with an acid vial of an alchemist. Bulwarks will form a layer of armor whenever they take damage, reducing all further damage in the same turn to 1. The problem is, that each hit bulwark will perform the 3-second 'IMA GROWING ARMORE!' animation SEQUENTIALLY. And then, once their turn starts, the armor will break, they take acid damage and the animation will PLAY AGAIN. There are other occasions where the game puts in dumb pauses (even within your own turn's movement) to point you at any kind of buff triggering or disappearing. Which definitely takes time and becomes annoying later in the game.As well, there are a few skills with issues, f.e. Flarrow not actually triggering the blinding explosion, or not revealing the map (or sometimes neither of both).But I'll assume that will be patched at some point.Now, would I recommend this game?Nnnnnnot sure. I got 20 hours out of it, but I got to say that I doubt I'll play the game again. Simply because the only 'fun' laid in figuring how the shallow, obfuscated gameplay mechanics work. It was a real drag to play through the last couple decades of the game, simply because one fight was as simple and boring as the next, all further research was legitly pointless... you get the point.Result : 6/10It's not bad, but it's not really good either, and despite heavy RNG it doesn't really feel replayable to me.I would really say this needs some more spice, in form of mutators or content, possibly steam workshop modding. Buying it won't feel like a complete waste, but for the price you can get better stuff elsewhere.			"

Early Access Review
								Alright. Giving credit where it's due, Massive Chalice is a pretty ambitious game. It takes the best qualities of XCOM: the R&D aspect, the top-down tactical combat system, and that fun little dance on the knife's edge as you try to level up your favorite character while avoiding that permadeath. All those qualities and throw it in with elements of a fantasy kingdom simulator with the whole 'kingdom in peril by a mysterious corruption that taints the land' plotline and the system of marrying off your heroes to produce heirs to continue your war on this corruption. All those things are great. Also? The Cadence enemies? Pretty sick designs and it totally showcases the unnatural corruption feel of what the Cadence is all about. All those things are what makes Massive Chalice a pretty interesting game to check out... But not for thirty dollars. The eugenics system feels like it creates a funnel where eventually you want to marry off all your heroes together to create better heirs with the right traits and personality and the right stats. (Hard enough as it is to find the right hero with the right traits and personality to marry off at the right time, but that's another thing.) Eventually the relationships between your later-gen heroes become incestous as in order to preserve the genes you want, you'll have to start marrying off cousins togeher. Which is something wrong that I can't seem to wrap my head around.Continuing on the subject of the eugenics system, let's talk about the bloodline relics. I haven't found the right pattern to create a relic reliably yet, but it seems to come from either the number of enemies you kill and the number of missions you do. Either way, trying to build a relic is frustrating as the Cadence attacks are infrequent through one hero's lifetime. It basically creates a weapon based on the stats of the hero's weapon that you can level up with the heroes that come afterwards. In the period of time you can level the relic, you can pretty much research the next tier of weapons and it would generally surpass the relic.Last thing I want to talk about are the Cadence Pawns, I have already acknowledged that the Pawns are pretty sick looking but then there's their performance in combat. You see, each of the Pawns have a special ability. Cradles have the ability to spawn more pawns to throw at you; wrinklers can age your heroes with an attack; Lapses can effectively drain your HP... You get the picture. Now my problem with the Pawns are that they are one-trick ponies. They have their little special ability and then the rest of their movesets are routine for every one of them. It makes combat monotonous and repetitive after a while and that's just a bummer.To recap. Cool and ambitious project, but it falls short of expectations. Nonetheless, it can't be called an XCOM clone because it does take a unique approach to the genre and I do hope that it can straighten itself out when it comes out of Early Access.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but in the end I did not.Family simulator 2015, the real meat of the game is not the battles, which are repetitive, easy and boring, but in marrying off families to the various thrones you set up.  Different men and women will have different traits listed.... but as there is no actual interaction the personalities of each person is just words on the screen.  Personality traits don't even matter in the handful of grab bag random events... which like the banner saga have unpredictable outcomes no matter what is chosen (making them random events where you have the illusion of choice.)Now as a strategy game where you pair off families and breed lots of children it works well.  But nothing can be customized so you never have any sort of investment in the dynastys you are building.  Plus, if you are any good at the game you will have so many children in each line that it doesn't really matter what happens to any individual.The soldiers you take in will only fight for a few battles before they will grow old and die, so you will never become attached to them.  In addition, every person you manage is so interchangeable it doesn't even really matter if a bunch of them die in a mission, there are a legion of bland replacements ready to fill in.  In addition, while the game has 9 ""classes"" which do have some slight variation, you are really just dealing with three... hand to hand single target, ranged single target, or ranged aoe.  The broad archetypes of which set of three classes a family has access to is set by the class of the founder of the family hundreds of years ago.Now, even with the boring battles, the fun of breeding families might in itself have made a fun game.... except for one major problem.  Like the latest XCom, the designers seem to think that interrupting you every few seconds makes for an exciting experience.  You have to make it through 300 years, but it felt like every few days I was being bothered with the death of someone, the finishing of research, a new useless invasion, etc.  Never did I really just get to let the clock run and watch the dynastys play out.  I loved XCom, but hated that the strategy map interrupts you constantly, and this game is even worse in this regard.It has some strong points.  The narration in particular is inspired.  And it CAN be fun to match up that 55 year old war hero with a 16 year old bride and see if they manage to breed.  But overall the experience was just an annoying slog filled with unrealized potential.  Without interaction between the people of any kind, all of the personalities and dynasties meant nothing more than ticks on a spreadsheet.  Maybe that is all life is in the end.4/10			"

												Pretty much a watered down, lame (new) X-Com. Combat is serviceable but not satisfying or interesting. The bloodline aspect is what drew me in but it's not that great as I never got invested in my generic characters/houses. The research tree is a joke, it just seemed really linear. Soundclips were repetitive, music was okay, the enemies were generic blob-like alien critters that each had predictable actions.The whole game just seems lazy, like they rushed it out or were satisfied with mediocrity. The bloodline system could've been cool, but even that wasn't interesting in the least.			"

								I still liked the game, just was not what I thought it could be.  Game could do so much more in terms of depth and customization of heroes, kingdom, research.  I will say the battles are okay.  Still it revolves around key traits and levels.  And the time lapse is so fast you can not really even create a character because by that time hes level 5 or so he is almost dead and old.  I was just expecting more and while on a simpler level it is fun.  Just very frustrating to really only worry about hero production and their training, which is by default.  Most things are just left to the decision of the program. "

TL;DR: Castrated version of Civilization meets medieval XCom meets Double Fine.Okay, I will try to make it short this time: this game was developed and released by Double Fine -- a company well-known for it's interesting concepts (Psychonauts, Broken Age, The Cave, Costume Quest, Brutal Legend, etc -- google it or use Steam search). One of the also well-known phenomenons with this company is that it abandons games after they're released (The Cave, Spacebase DF-9, some more, I think).Now, Massive Chalice is a pretty interesting concept -- it's a fun strategy game with turn-based ""medieval XCom""-ish battles. You have to actually raise your heroes -- firstly, you'll have to ""marry"" two of your heroes, then (if everything would go okay) a child will be born, then he (or she) will come of age, and only after that you'll be able to recruit him/her.Concept is interesting, because children are able to inherit traits and personalities of their parents. If father is a raging alcoholic (-speed in battle) and mother is insightful (+intuition) it would be wiser to take their children to the researches, assigning them as sages, instead of taking them to battles in your vanguard.On the strategic map you will build forts and assign regents (and choose their spouses) there, develop new weapons in your capital, intrude in your heroes' personal life from time to time by choosing a path which they should go. For example, one of your heroes find a hermit that wants to teach him to see the way of communicating with the corruption -- and it's your choice if he goes to live with the hermit for a few years, or stays with you.Your global mission is to win the war of 300 years. Your enemies are spawns of some sort of corruption that threatens to swallow the whole kingdod if not for your efforts. Now, this all sounds pretty fun, doesn't it? It actually does. And it actually is fun. The sad thing is, the game lacks content... and balance. Once you'll crack the code on how to beat the battles, the game would start to bore you. Your squad would be consisting of only one hero class (I won't spoil it to you, which one, but you'll get it yourself pretty fast). You would be equpping all of the heroes with the same items. You will be marrying your regents in the same manner, maxing only one parameter.You will basically repeat the same action 10-15 times before you beat the game.Don't get me wrong -- XCom was repetitive too, especially before the Enemy Within update. But developers were working with balance, so people won't be recruiting exclusively snipers with ghost armor, for example. Alas, I have my doubts that Massive Chalice would get any updates any time soon.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -The game is pretty good overall, it's definitely worth buying... on a sale. Paying $5-10 for this title is okay, game's definitely worth it. If it'd be updated with balance changes, new enemies, new items and new building (which I strongly doubt), it might be worth even more.Right now, I'd advise you to wait for the game to go on 50-75% sale and buy it. Then complete it one time on Normal difficulty with Iron Man option on (which implies that you won't have any saves, except for when you quit the game), and move on to the next game.Rating: 6.8 out of 10.0			"

								My major take away Massive Chalice is an interesting concept with disappointing Game Design. Key features, positive and negative:Positive:* Eugenics System is a cool innovation that adds kingdom management and troop management above that of its contemporaries.* Art style is fresh and looks good, with pretty readable and clear visual queues.* Some of the tough empire management decisions ala X-COM.Negative: * Tactical Combat is extremely lackluster, missing any interesting decision-making due to a lack of strong Systems. Without zone-of-control, cover, flanking, defending, or any other take on actions or positioning gameplay, it quickly boils down into ""what dudes are stronger"". Massive Chalice fails to deliver on a compelling tactical combat experience for any level of gamer who wants to engage with this (which is what you spend most of your time doing).* Enemy design follows a similar pattern. Instead of requiring unique tactics or approaches to beating, enemies (such as the one that drains XP, or ones that suicide when either killed or when they get into melee) are one-trick ponies whose tricks don't make the game richer. Enemies combine easy-to-solve gameplay with frustrating risk/reward structures.* Classes unfold into few customization options, with little way to distinguish characters and builds. While I think this is true of some other games as well, many other tactical battle games excel at this aspect, using a ""what can I make work"" model to provide gameplay variety. This may be a current content limitation though as well (pre-release only, maybe?)I Kickstarted and wanted to love Massive Chalice, but I feel the game misses on delivering what I want - a Fantasy Tactics game with interesting army/kingdom management to tie it all together. I'm pretty forgiving of minor issues in games, but I feel these ones are deal-breakers for what the game promises to be. "

												It's hard to put to words how disappointed I am with this game. Disregarding the, let's call it ""changes in the development plan"", in the kickstarter and all that, the game itself is painfully boring and generic.Take the tactical combat of the X-Com game, then strip it of all character(blank slate units) and meaningful tactical choices(range doesn't affect accuracy, no elevation or cover, etc) and you have 90% of the game. The other 10% are a poorly thought out ""management"" section that lets you fiddle with some things that don't matter(at best you get a 10% increase in something if you manage it well by placing keeps around the map), a marriage system that could be interesting if it had any other effect than just producing new generic heroes derived from 2 heroes you match up, and a barebones research system that gives you advantages that are, at best, boring. I couldn't force myself to play the game any longer than I did, since I have zero hope that it will change or get better. Nonetheless, I'm confident that my assessment of the game is quite accurate. Very unfortunate, I must say.			"

								Meh.  Starting ages of heroes is too old.  You have a generation gap by the time your newborns can fight and your initial heroes are senior citizens.  Game is against you and most random events take a regent out of the game instead of making babies or just kill them off before their bloodline can continue.  Had to restart frequently due to initial two keeps not producing babies or making all of one sex.  Some house tend to produce only male or female, but sometimes that is all you get anyway.  Combat is weak, time between fights is too long to progress any character to a decent fighting capability.  One starting enemy can actually sap a level from your character everytime it hits thus keeping beginning teams at a suck level.  Art work is okay, some sense of humor in the game, read one review comparing it to XCOM, big difference is XCOM is fun to play.  I love this game genre (XCOM, Jagged Alliance 2 and Dawn of War 2) but this game is just not fun to play.  Lots of cool elements, but not fun overall.			"

												Read The Massive Chalice wiki and forums to get an idea of the limited tactical battle, and minimalist strategic layer. It's an interesting effort to take some of the core gameplay from the X-com genre, and create a sort of mmo browser styled semi-casual experience. After being involved in the Beta, and seeing features I had hoped to see (that were more ""bad♥♥♥♥♥cool/unique"") in the final release being dropped from development may have soured me to the game. It is not a, bad game, but I don't know if I'd say that the final product remained competative with what is out there. The fantasy setting, as well as the bloodlines, are novel, and somewhat engaging features that can still draw empathy and involvement from the player's attachment to fictional character. But over time the somewhat limited number of random events, and the limitations on research optimization, have drained my interest in replaying the game. I will say, that the User Interface is now much more informative and the tutorial is perfectly clear. If there was an option to (MAYBE) recommend a game, instead of Yes/No, I would probably select it. However, as the development for the game is over, and DF won't be making any further tweaks, or possibly, patches for some time, I wouldn't want to recommend this game. I think there is more depth, setting, and mechanics, to be had elsewhere for the same amount of money.			"

												In Japan, there is a category of games called “Mazoge”, the contraction of MASOchistic GAmes - a genre in which the design and the rules are aimed at putting the player in the worst position. It is oftentimes a derogatory term.Just like Brütal Legend was an RTS under its ARPG guise, Massive Chalice advertises itself as an epic fantasy take on XCOM, while it really is such a “Mazoge”.The odds are so much against the player it can be intimidating at first, but it also eventually builds up a world view that while only outlined, is very grim - I personally digged that aspect of the game. This would yield very little rewards if the game didn't offer what I consider to be the best melding of strategic and tactical gameplay I have ever experienced. The family building, the research, the combat, the events - all tie up to create an absolutely chaotic and unfair experience, but a wonderfully creative one too. Never had I felt so tense in a strategy game, fearing that the difficulty might catch up to the progress of my families, or that a cataclysmic event might destroy one of the bloodlines I careful crafted. Unfair in a sense, yes, but those are the rules of the game and they create a really cohesive experience. Again, “Mazoge”.The randomness of it all also means, sometimes, all goes so well, the game turns mundane - until the next crisis, “hopefully”, if I may say so.I really, really like this game. But in all fairness, it asks a lot from the player : to play for 15 hours a couple of 'normal' games to grasp the rules ; to accept the randomness of what might happen to all your work thanks to odds turned against you ; to cope with the same limited recordings of the androgynous chalice...Here is hoping that when watching at that Chalice, you might consider it half-full as well!

								I can't say that the game is bad, rather that I expected more.  My greatest dissapointment comes from my expectations of the game being more akin to an Ogre Battle title with long term bloodlines.  What was delivered was a very blatant X-COM  clone changing the setting, and switching the time scale to years.  Becase of the small squad size, you would think you would get invested in the development of individual heroes. I found I tried to, but by the time I did, I had moved on to the next generation.  Fights only seem to happen every 4-8 years roughly,  heroes are viable from say ages 15-60, An active hero that you don't send to do another job might last 8 fights before dying of old age.I only saw 3 types of heroes, if there are more they were either difficult or unclear on how to unlock them.  Caberjacks, Alchemists, and Hunters.The game did not seem very well balanced between the classes.  Caberjacks are strong all around in offence and defense.Hunters hit a bit weaker, and can't take a hit, but at least have ranged attacks.  they seemed a bit weaker than the cabers, but on facing the exploding enemies, I saw a clear reason for using them.Alchemists have bombs, but they bombs tend to be embarrasingly inaccurate, short ranged, and mediocre in damage, not to mention limited in supply.  When they run out the have a mediocre melee attack, but no durablity to speak of.Game dynamics seemed like a stripped down Xcom engine.  They have similar controls, but with less classes, and lack of cover mechanics (best I could tell anyway) I found myself thinking If I get in the mood for this kind of game, I'll just fire up X-Com again, and play the better game.So in short, not a bad game, but an inferior X-Com clone.

												I was very disappointed with this game. I was hoping for something between X-Com and Final Fantasy Tactics. The play style is similar but everything is very limited and minimalist. There are 3 hero types and the combined/sub-classes are more or less the same thing. There are maybe 5 enemy types with the same flaw. You can research new items and equipment but they have very little impact on the game. There are text-side quests that come up, but the outcomes are totally random so your choices are meaningless. You characters will only live for maybe 10 minutes before they die of old age so you never really get attached to them like in X-Com or FFT. These characters will have children that carry on family traits and classes but once again they'll live about 10minutes before they die of old age. I had a lot of fun with this game for about 2-3 hours, then it got repetitive, not I'm just grinding out the last few hours and I'll probably never play it again. I would still be on board with this type of minimalist game if it had a great story like the Banner Saga, but sadly there is no story. Monsters attack, defend your kingdom, and I expect some sort of twist ending. Overall the worst part of this game is it's wasted potential.			"

								My feeling is that maps are boring. Sadly you got to explore those maps in order to win any encounter.Now, when it comes to exploring map within tactical setting, some games managed to make it right: Halfway, Fallout Tactics, Abomination Project Nemesis, Shadowrun Returns/Dragonfall etc.Either because exploration was done in real time, while combat was per turn, or simply because maps were filled with items to loot, quests, npcs etc.Or in some case, because AI was active and searching for you or doing random stuff (first XCOM, Xenonauts...).In some case (Xcom enemy Unknown), maps are just well designed with platformsm, levels and different kind of covers.A game is not simply tactical by its combat mechanics; its maps and level-design is what's going to support its gameplay.Many game developpers just forget that.In Massive chalice you are bound to explore meaningless maps, per turn, with a team of character that is almost put under your command randomly.I guess that toward the end of the game, it gets easier and easier to set-up your A team.But boring maps will still plague you.

												I had some fun playing with Massive Chalice when I first installed it. The bloodline ideas, Game of Thrones/Birthright vibes and X-Com style game play were engaging and the graphics, audio and interface were good enough to keep me in the game. Unfortunately, the more I played the more the veneer of an interactive world fell away and I was left with a puzzle game; moving the pegs, filling the holes and becoming painfully aware of the fact that it was all about figuring out the underlying equations. I know this is the essential reality of all single-person computer games and if I’m playing a game with no pretense of creating a living environment, that’s fine. But Massive Chalice does have pretenses and they just do not stand the test of time.  There’s real potential for a good game here especially in the concepts and with a bigger playing field, more randomness and most of all a greater sense of a living, breathing world, this could have been an outstanding title. When it comes to a thumbs up or thumbs down on Steam, I generally go by value for price. As the game stands right now at full price it’s about ten dollars short. "

												Slow and shallow.  I believe those two adjectives best describe this game. Which is really sad, since it has a lot of charming elements, but even with all that charm, it can't overcome its pacing and lack of content. Massive Chalice is made up of two parts. The combat is turn base squad game, where you move your squad of 5 (usually) through a map in order to kill everything. The other part is a meta game where you build structure, research, arrange marriages, and deal with random text adventure events.  Sadly, both these parts end up feeling slow and shallow. Combat feels dull due to the fact that every mission's objective is nothing more than to kill all the enemies on the map.  This is fun the first few times, but it quickly loses it charm, and ends up feeling like a loose collection of skirmish maps stringed together.The meta game on the other hand feels unbearably slow.  The premise of the game is that you have to hold out for 300 years in order to charge up a super weapon to win. And at first I found this interesting, but that quickly changed, and in the end, I felt like I was on a super long defend the npc while he opens a door really, really slowly mission. In the end, this game made me sad. Mainly due to the fact that I want to like this game, but ended up hating it instead. I like double fine (the company that made this game), a lot of their older games are great. However, I don't think the same about most of their newer ones, and that makes me kind of sad.*Note, i didn't finish this game, got about 75 years in before i couldn't take it anymore. So there always the chance that the latter half of the game is amazing, but even if it is, I don't want to have to play through the start of the game to get to it* "

												I don't understand the hatred for this game.Double FIne did that debacle for DF-9 so don't buy from them! It's an X-COM lite with worse strategy and tactical layer -- go get Klei's Invisible Inc instead! The artwork sucks -- what is this boxy polygon artwork thing? It's got no theme and I can't customize characters and they die too fast!So goes all the complaints.First off, I have to state I'm not Double Fine's typical customer -- I typically don't play anything in the adventure genre. Secondly, I love this game so far, and it's as good and interesting as XCOM and Invisible Inc (which is also brilliant).Why?Because the game is a great mechanically - the strategic and tactical layer intersect in really interesting ways. Particularly on higher difficulties and later in the game, small choices can have serious repercussions. For example, choose that ""passionless"" old vanguard for your crucible to pass on his experience and you will affect the kingdom's fertility bloodlines further down the road. Don't choose him and you might get outmatched by the Cadence levels. Spend time researching things you don't need and you will get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked on harder levels.You need to have enough bloodlines, enough technology (weapons and items), hopefully pass down enough relics, have enough vanguard experience to do well. Mechanically, it is a really interesting game.It took me some time to really get and love this game, which I guess is its biggest flaw. At first I thought it was a tad easy mid-game and there were not many options and hunters/alchemists were the best way to go. Suffice to say I was wrong and the late game really shines: Interesting valid tactical skills, difficult battles, difficult strategic decisions that have you second guessing yourself.Forward to later, after rebooting the game several times running on hard, all the classes are interesting, with interesting skills. Caberjacks are by no means useless. As a crowd control class, they really shine later in the game.To charge that the game has no depth because it has no overwatch, or cover doesn't cut it. It is different, and as a big lover of tactical games like XCOM and Invisible Inc, I will state that this game is good, just different. Another game to compare this to is King of Dragon Pass (the random events at least), which adds another unusual flavour to the game.In summary, I guess the hatred for this game is because of expectations. It doesn't feel like a Double Fine game at all.There is not much story or exposition, but as a strategic/tactical hybrid, this game is different, and a really good different: I've been enjoying it quite a bit.

Instead, it was lacking on all fronts.There is only a minimal amount of strategy to this game.  There is no cover or overwatch.  No bonsus for surprise or sneak attacks.  Instead its dancing to avoid enemy units charging you first and crossing your fingers that your Hunters don't miss their shots (they will).  Enemies like Ruptures will only frustrate you instead of giving you a challenge.As far as the lineage system, its there but it you dont feel the impact of it yet.  I think you may have to dedicate a lot of time to the game to see a noticeable effect but I'm simply unable to put myself up to doing so.I hope the game gets better next year but for now I don't think I can force myself to try it more.  I get more strategy out of XCOM on my iPad than this game.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Massive ChaliceDevelopers:  Double Fine ProductionsPublisher:  Double Fine ProductionsGenre:  Turn-based strategyGeneral ImpressionMassive Chalice is Double Fine Productions’ first foray into XCOM-style turn-based strategy. Having previous experience from developing the Costume Quest series, I think they managed to create even in Chalice’s case, a convincing fantasy world and equally intriguing storyline. Open-ended by its very nature, the story unfolds over the course of three centuries of warfare with a pestilence/horde type of enemy that reminded me of the Blights from Dragon Age. Massive Chalice has the Cadence, as the main antagonist. A corrupting force that shall threaten the integrity of any region it reaches on the game’s map. A very interesting gameplay mechanic revolves around forming dynasties (from your heroes) that shall hopefully grow and prosper while defending their newly acquired domains. Despite the apparent long war ahead, the in-game time can be sped up efficiently. As many years pass rapidly, your warriors age and eventually die, only to be replaced by new generations of recruits, either adopted by the Realm or direct descendants of the Houses you have formed when you gave away provinces.So Massive Chalice does have a slight taste of “A Song of Ice and Fire” to it, without the treachery and other atrocities between the Houses themselves. Afterall, the enemy is clear from the beginning and civil strife between your heroes is fortunately not an option or feature. Because the warriors and their Houses can be randomized, I’d say that diversity is right at home. Even the enemy types or weaponry & tactics used by your heroes has plenty of variation to it. From XCOM, this title was inspired when creating the research tree and abilty to defend one province at a time (while another shall have to suffer temporary setbacks). One thing is certain: if you enjoy strategy games, Massive Chalice shall not disappoint at all.Strong Points+ Beautiful art style.+ Original story and characters.+ Randomized and open-ended type of gameplay.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Perhaps the slightly repetitive sounds.Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												I really enjoyed this game, but at the same time, I couldn't stop thinking that it could be so much more with so little effort. Fighting mechanism is very similar to the one from XCOM or Shadowrun series and the gameplay revolves around taking care of various bloodlines and houses with the goal of creating better and better fighters each generations. It's not only about strength, there are a lot of character traits that make heroes more or less effective in the battlefield. Time is the most important factor - you have 300 years to prepare for final battle, you need to build keeps and other useful buildings, discover new technologies, items, armors and weapons, but everything takes tiiiime, so you better plan carefully, as, for sure, you won't be able to discover everything. Also, I liked how some of the most useful items are like doubled-edged swords (you put new armor on your alchemist, and suddenly, after one bad move, you killed your whole squad XD). There are only few types of enemies, but each of them feels unique and interesting. Now for the things, that are not impressive and could be much better.No customization. Seriously? This game seems like it was made for that. You have dozens of flags, family names, mottoes etc., but you can't customize it or even mix it a little bit. You are forced to chose from existing families, which doesn't seem reasonable. It's just limiting your gameplay options and feeling of immersion. Not to mention that it takes forever to find something that you may actually want or like.No mod support. I generally like mods for games, but in this particular case not having mods support seems like a wasted opportunity. Imagine this game with Game of Thrones mod or ""classic"" classes mod (mages, knights etc.) or mods that are adding new enemies, new gameplay mechanic, new random events, new maps, new challenges... This would gave this game so much more replayability. No fast-forward or double speed options on enemy's turns. You have few enemies around you? No problem. But once you have like 20 within your sight and each of them need to make move, and each attack and sometimes your heroes have some sort of reaction to that, which triggers another hero, who triggers someone else... It can take forever.Surprisingly low replayability. Obviously this is one of those games that you will replay at least few times, to learn mechanics, to fix mistakes from your previous gameplays that caused you to lose and so on. But other than that, there sadly isn't much to keep you excited. Battles get progressively harder, but at the same time they feel much more repetitive. There is never feel of something new or refreshing. After few tries you pretty much saw all of the random events (and honestly, those aren't very interested and add less to the game than they actually should have), you know all the enemies and their tactics, and so on. And since there isn't even something so small as customization option), there are no mods, there is nothing to really keep you interesting.Random events. They are there and it's good. But they bring absolutely nothing new to the table and most of the time they don't provide any good results - you either get something neutral or something bad and honestly I've almost flipped my table when, after one of those things, I lost my keep that I've been building for over 20 years.Still, for all the good stuff Massive Chalice deserves a recommendation.

												I would not recommend this game.  Gameplay is dull and gets extremely repetitive.  Units are boring and die of old age after a couple battles.  UI is horrible and convoluted.  Do not buy, its not any good.  I say this sadly, I normally love this type of game.			"

			Cosmic reviews Massive Chalice a turn based strategy game kickstarted and developed by Double Fine. Enjoy this video? please share and subscribe.		

Massive Chalice borrows from the popularity of Game of Thrones by putting in bloodline houses. Only people of special bloodlines can fight the cadence. These bloodlines come in the form of houses, each with their own name, banner, motto and castle name. Houses are completely cosmetic and at the start of the game you are able to choose five to be your vanguard at the start. It’s a nice little aesthetical feature that tries to make you care about your characters. The problem is it doesn’t work, because you progress through the game in years, passing ten years is nothing meaning that your characters die often of old age. In fact characters die so much that unlike a game like X-Com where you really care when someone dies because you have spent a lot of time investing in their abilities and appearance. In Massive chalice, the games time progression and lack of character customization means that you become numb to characters. It was to the point that I did not care to learn their names and rather solely based their usefulness on their age, level and traits.Permadeath by its nature is only an impacting mechanic if you care about the death. Massive Chalice’s core design almost forces you not to care about your units. Because time passes so quickly it means that characters never really level up to a significant point so they never become irreplaceable. In fact the game design makes units become as meaningful as pawns on a chess board. They are very useful but highly expendable and you don’t put much stock in them as you do the other pieces.Ruling your nation is very simplistic and keeps the focuses on making sure you have enough babies being born to provide soldiers in the coming years. It’s a case of building castles to house bloodlines and produce children, building the occasional building that helps with research or training and of course researching new technology. Researching tech allows you to unlock new weapons, items and armor, it’s also where you can recruit a batch of heroes if you’re running low on troops and it’s the tab where you build the few buildings available. There isn’t much in terms of choice when it comes to new weapons and armor, there’s a couple of interesting items that you can research once a certain number of enemies have been defeated. These items tend to share a trait that relate to the monsters it requires such as the boneshell armor that covers your soldier in a protective shell after one hit like the Bulwark monster.The UI in the overworld parts of the game looks and responds like a touch screen port. The UI is overly large, bulky and provides no feedback upon clicking it. It’s almost as if the overworld UI design was made with the thought of a mobile release in mind, and to be honest this wouldn’t be very surprising. It does however leave a negative impact on the game, it stands out as not being the correct UI for a PC game, the size of the menus is a perfect size for a touch screen, not for a 2080p monitor with a mouse a keyboard.Massive Chalices combat is modeled from similar games like X-Com. The game does not really do anything unique or particularly innovative with combat but it’s a solid tried and tested system that works well. There is a variety of factors in battle you must think about which usually comes from the combination of monster mechanics and the variety of armor and weapon effects. Sadly there is not a large amount of variety in enemies. Each enemy has a unique mechanic tied to it such as wrinklers who will add age onto a character if they successfully hit or lapses who if they hit you drain you of XP which can lower your level mid battle which will cause you to lose abilities. The problem with the enemies rears its head later on in the game when you’re just facing the same enemies over and over and the game just throws ever increasing numbers of them at you to try and make battles difficult. The game is just a characterless husk, it works sufficiently well in terms of stability but gives no immersive experience. Double fine tries to put in charm with the voice acting of the magical chalice but it fails to charm and instead only serves to annoy and make you cringe. Massive Chalice is light on its content which was surprising when you span three hundred years and it simply does not stand up to games like X-Com. It has promising ideas that were not explored properly which are also spoilt by conservative combat design and a garish aesthetic.  It is certainly not something I would play again and people looking for a X-Com like experience from this should instead just go play X-Com. It’s a sad, deflated disappointment from Double Fine, who have once again turned a promising idea into mind-numbing drudgery. "

												I wanted to love Massive Chalice, I really did; I'm a huge X-Com fan - even the reboot - and if anything, MC makes me appreciate some of the design decisions in the XC reboot more. Reading over articles about the latest FPS will invariably find a complaint about how simplified, decision-less games are becoming - Massive Chalice is an excellent lesson in why. Design decisions that are not fun in MC:  Poor early game decisions have no feedback mechanism besides the catastrophic failure of a game. Contrast with Civilization, or Invisible Ink - did the war go disasterously? Load a save from an hour ago, and maintain peace; or attack another city; or bide your time, or or or. Did you get caught? No prob - rewind to the previous turn. In MC, once you're in a failure state, you've gotten there through feedback loops and local failure may be avoidable, total failure is inescapable. Jazzing on that point, individual units are incredibly fragile and disposable - you really get a feel for mortality and sacrifice and so on. Great, right? Except that units must be shepherded (you set up families, breed them, ensure fertility, select for attributes, train them, equip them...) which is great at creating investment and tension... but then you fight three battles, tops, before any hero dies of old age. It is a great concept, but in execution, it is an exercise in frustration.  Because everything is random. Congrats, you've got a good hero who is the right class, right age, with the right stats, and now you're breeding him. Except you failed on the random rolls, so your next generation of heroes have lousy stats and traits. AND tying it all together, you have to retire a hero to a special structure that you have to build that will infuse new units with their starting XP. That is, if you fail to build and staff this building, you're going to have level 1 units every few battles against a progressively more difficult enemy. And of course, you want to take your strongest unit off the table because they'll provide the most benefit to the new units. He'll also confer his random traits that by now have rolled over to Unaccurate Teamkilling Jerk, by the way. Finally, if the game wasn't random and punishing enough, every so often events will pop up that properly model real life with a choice - there was an anti-war rally in front of your palace and two of your heroes, randomly selected (ha ha, the heck with you player and any decisions you'd like to be making!) accidentally killed someone and the public wants vengence. What do you do? Good news - no matter what you choose, there's the chance it will end well! or poorly. And it doesn't matter! Get a dipper bird to play the game instead of you!In closing, everything about this game sounds brilliant on paper; but spare yourself the lunch money and buy yourself a pair of dice. At least those, if you want to select ""easy,"" you can just weight.			"

												I played this for an hour. Very few of the mechanics are communicated at all, there's no narrative reason to be doing any of the things you're doing, and the two characters of the chalice talk for days without telling you anything of use. They aren't even being funny. (and I don't mean that their jokes aren't funny, I mean they aren't even telling jokes. They're clearly written as humor-based characters, except they don't ever deliver punchlines or clever wordplay)I could play more of it and give it a better chance, but honestly the gameplay is straight-forward. There's some vague threat of evil encroaching on your land and you have to fight random battles with it every now and then. The setup is much like XCOM, so the progression is clearly going to just be that. But XCOM offers a variety of strategies and tactics that let you approach situations in different ways, and the enemies are thoughtful and interesting. Here, your choice seems to be ""do damage up close"" or ""do damage from afar"" and there are no advantages to either except that some enemies explode if you're too close to them. The enemies are equally simple with no interesting mechanics. My characters seem to have special skills, but I have no reason to use any of them since the enemies are so easy.The character lineage system that sold me on this game boils down to having to pick two arbitrary people to marry off to make babies every time you build a keep. You can choose people with slightly different stats and they'll combine when they have a kid, but the stats aren't different enough to make that interesting, and the characters are faceless avatars that you have no reason to care about at all. And worse yet, you can't even develop any of them, because you'll get maybe one battle out of them before they get old and need to be forever retired into one of the keeps or other things you need to keep the kingdom running.And perhaps there are some interesting mechanics buried in here, but the chalice only ever talks about their memory of high school or that one time their friend did something funny. There's no introduction to what all is possible in this game. I might be missing something incredible, but far be it for the game to inform me of that.Save your money and your time, folks. Go play XCOM.			"

												Long story short, I would not recomend this game to somebody who is looking for a well thought out, strategic, and deep tactical video game. However, if you're looking for a simple game for cheap to get you INTO tactics games like XCOM and such, this might just be for you.I think I can say that I was severely disappointed... I'm enjoying myself yes, but I expected a whole lot more from it. I was expecting XCOM mixed with Crusader Kings 2 and Fire Emblem. But what I got was a very, very, lifeless, casual game. It's overall minimilistic look keeps me from being immersed in the world and differentiating the characters from one another, they all just form together into one blocky, ps1 grafix mess. The strategy is simplistic and I have no idea what they were thinking with the action point system. Usually your turn is subject to move-move, move-attack, attack-move. But this game says move-move-attack, move-attack, or attack. Which I guess could be tactical, but it doesn't play out that way. The rules are in favor of the candensce... candesce... condesce??? I don't know big bad evil copy pasties.I wanted a game where I could feel emotionally connected to my units, build up their heritage and watch them grow, but all I saw in them after couple hours were stats with faces attached. I barely cared when my characters died because one would always replace them instantaneusly. This could have been easily avoided had the game's timeline been shortened to let you get more in tune with the characters, and i don't know... CUSTOMIZATION??? I was so disappointed I couldn't customize the houses and sigils as well as name the characters. I know it was a kickstarter reward, but regardless, it's almost inexcusable to PURPOSEFULLY hinder your game to give more insentive for your backers... Also the chalice is annoying. At first it was quirky and interesting, but then the repeated lines made me irritated and kinda droning along.Overall... if your a tactical strategy fan who wants a challenge focusing on strategy, pick up Crusader Kings 2, especially XCOM if you haven't. But if you haven't played turn based strategies, you want something simple and easy to pick up with a bit of difficulty, for the price it isn't really bad. A rather solid entry level game. But veterans? Give it a pass.			"

												While Broken Age is probably seen as developer Double Fine’s most publicized Kickstarter-funded title, it’s not the only one, as Massive Chalice was also crowdfunded back in 2013. Considering that Double Fine has made some solid games in the past and previously dabbled in the strategy genre with Brutal Legend, there was good reason to look forward to this one. Unfortunately, while there are certainly some strong qualities to be found and some clever mechanics, the game is something of a mixed bag. The positives of certain aspects end up somewhat dulled by repetition and surprisingly lackluster presentation, making for a title that never quite achieves the greatness it may have been capable of.Story is sparse. The anonymous player character is chosen by the titular sentient chalice at the beginning of the game, which provides the only dialog to you periodically through both a male and a female personality. You’re tasked with defending a kingdom of multiple territories from a malicious force known as the Cadence, and while the chalice has the power to drive them away for good, it will take several centuries to build up such an attack.As a result, players are given the responsibility both to choose individual items and perks that can be unlocked through several years of research, as well as the ability to speed up the timeline so that years fly by in seconds. As time passes, you’ll have to recruit new warriors, build structures and appoint officials to each one for more unlockable perks, choose replacement fighters and officials as the previous ones die, and most importantly, lead a group of warriors into battle whenever Cadence forces threaten the land.The battles are turn-based on several different maps with a grid-like layout, along with features like a fog that obscures enemies until your own units venture further. Heroes fall into different classes with different strengths and abilities, from projectile weapons to the ability to hide in foliage. Individual units can also gain experience and level up by dealing the finishing blow to enemies, which tie into skill trees that unlock additional class-specific skills.All of the combat gameplay elements, while certainly competent, feel kind of dull as the game continues. Some additional issues also made it a bit difficult to appreciate some of the previously mentioned issues. For one, the fog element led to multiple times where I ventured a unit out and got ambushed by up to three hidden enemy units at once, and there’s also the fact that heroes defeated in battle stay dead and unavailable from that point forward, making it sometimes rather difficult to unlock more than a few skills for each one.Some of Massive Chalice‘s more interesting features actually come into play outside of battle. One feature available early on allows you to pair up two heroes for breeding future warriors that share both their abilities, adding a nice feature of customization and strategy to the mix. The center of the kingdom where the chalice is located also allows you to pick from a large assortment of unlockables for gradual research, including building new structures, recruiting new heroes, and enhancing the abilities for individual classes. As nice as this is, it feels a bit limited in that you can only unlock one at a time, which dulls the overall sense of progression.While the story and personality is strictly limited to the chalice’s dialog, this would be easier to deal with if there was also a sense of personality and appeal for the overall presentation. Unfortunately, Massive Chalice can be pretty ugly. The overall aesthetic for both characters and environments sports bland, muted colors and very low-detail, blocky models, and the soundtrack is forgettable to boot. This ends up feeling like Double Fine prioritized deep gameplay over a fleshed-out look, but considering the issues mentioned earlier, it doesn’t feel like an approach that fully paid off.While Massive Chalice is far from a bad game, it is a pretty uninspired one, with occasional moments of monotony and frustration for good measure. While Broken Age ended up being one of gaming’s biggest Kickstarter successes, Double Fine’s crowdfunded follow up has less of a happy ending from my point of view.			"

												Mhm. From the trailer and the screenshots I thought this was going to be a blast and i happily threw in some money to support fellow indies. Then well, i gotta be honest with my short review :* The turn based combat maps are fine. Not a mega cool UI but nicely playable once you understand the base mechanics. Classes seem interesting as far as I got to know them. As far as I could see the maps look a bit repetitive but well, all in all this part is Ok.* Everything else is definitely shallow and lacks depth. The main map is nice looking but as someone else said you really spend time staring at the idle map. Heroes come and go, but somehow the UI and the gameplay doesn't really give you time to get to know them and they are just ""troopers"" to use in the end.* Bloodline thingy is concept-wise very interesting, but it's also victim of the lack of depth of the UI and interaction, so somehow it feels quite hard to follow and exploit nicely.A massive work of improvement on the main map and UI could make a really cool game out of this, but till then, i can't really recommend it. Moreover if I dare clicking on the screen after launching it and before the main menu appears, it always crashes. I hope it will get better and not left as it is, as the amount of work made so far seems quite big, and it would be a pity to have the nice parts going to waste.			"

								The game is very promising, but not fun in the current state. The combat system needs more work to aquire a tactical dimension (currently it's mainly gambling: you hope that your unit will hit, and you hope that the enemy will miss...). There are only three classes for the moment and your prowess in the early game depends only on your luck. The late game is better but still lack a little smething that would make the tactical combat interesting (a special mechanics like there are in other tactical RPGs: the weaknesses triangle of Fire Emblem, the cover system of X-Com, the combos of Agarest...).

												While the combat is fun, the classes are clever twists on classic archetypes, and the writing is at least clever the first time you hear it, I struggled to get even part of the way through this game primarily due to poor execution of its primary game mechanics. For a game that wants you to manage bloodlines across generations and play a slightly creepy game of eugenics, there simply isn't enough information readily available to the player. It's a simulation game with intermittent turn-based combat, but it's next to impossible to keep track of everything without taking notes. It needed like 3-4 status screens I think. And what information is there is buried and not collected in anyway useful. Every time I play this I just end up getting too frustrated with how hands off it expects me to play and then how much it punishes me for doing just that.			"

												XCOM meets Game of Thrones? This should have been my favorite game ever. This is such a disapointment. Watered down tactical combat, the whole research/time mechanic is a copy paste from the XCOM game design, even when it doesnt make thematic sense. There's really nothing brand new here and for some reason, there's no customization at all. Can't even rename your own characters, or change their house name and sigil.I had high hopes for this one and they really dropped the ball.			"

Early Access Review
								I am very confused. I see a lot of people writing bad reviews. I spent a lot of time playing this game, and clearly it is not yet finished. HOWEVER to tell you ""this game is bad"" is stupid. Lemme break down what you can expect from this game.1. You will get a kingdom. you will have to decide what things you want, and how you want to play the game. do you want to focus on hunters? or maybe have a few Caberjacks backed up by Alchemists. its all up to you. all of your upgrades and buildings will need to be well timed.2. You will get an army.Though you may only take 5 units into battle, you will have a TON of other people to manage. in later game each house begins getting rediculously large. you will have to choose which people are worth being in the group of 5 and which arent. you will have to retire your heroes and have them train your next generation, or let them fight untill they die. Basically you get to be George R.R. Martin and this is your world, and these are your characters.3. You (can) get a story.NOW some people might dispute this. i disagree. The story you get IN the game is pretty much constricted to the very beginning and the very end. however, that is not to say you cant make up your own ledgends. a 16 year old girl took up an heirloom weapon went to battle, and defeated every last cadence on the feild... she ended up retireing at the age of 24 in order to bring up the next generation. NONE of that had to do with the chalice, but you can make some very interesting stories out of this game, if you want to.4. You will be entertained. I spent 16 hours or so in this game, 16 hours and its not even a finished game yet. there are still things being added, bugs being fixed, new bloodline effects being put in place. so to anyone who is thinking about buying it i suggest you keep an open mind, because this game will only get better.

												I've backed this game on Kickstarter because it looked fun and I liked Psychonauts and Brütal Legends.To make it short: It was not worth backing. If you can get it in a sale though, you might hit that buy button.That said, this game doesn't feel finished. The basics are there, and some of them are really fun and promising, but on a whole this feels more like a preview than a finished, polished game.The Kingdom: There's hardly any UIs to manage your kingdom, giving you infos about family trees, birthrates etc. You know, some dashboards giving you an overview of how well, or unwell, your kingdom is functioning. The nation building is very limited (3 different types of buildings), no politics, no managing your citizens (like happyness etc.) and absolutely no visible changes to your kingdom. There could have been different regions with different climates etc. like a harsh north breeding strong heroes or a desert or a swap-region that would benefit alchemists but maybe bring more sickly children forth... nothing of that sort.Combat: Take any turn-based strategy game, deduct most of their depth and you end up with Massive Chalice's combat system. The fights quickly become redundant, the different maps offering almost no distinctions. No environment that would impact your strategy (f.e. foggy weather that yould lower sight and hit-chance for hunter-types). hardly any interaction with the terrain, no cover, flanking, almost no buffs/debuffs. no summons etc. etc.tldr: If they had put DOUBLE the effort into this project, this could have become a FINE game. But probably 3/4 of the budget already went into another PRODUCTION :-(			"

												Fun... for the first 10 hours. Like every one else said, when it comes down to it, the heros are not relatable due to you having no agency over their name or apperance (also they die pretty quicky as they only last 3 waves before their 70), all the enemies are interesting but not fun, limited skill tree/abilities, and just generally repetitive.

								I really can'ty recommend anyone buy this game at any price.  The combat is highly derivated.  Just buy XCOM, it is 20 times better than the ripoff this game is trying to be.  The breeding system is poorly executed.  The graphics are bad by even mobile phone standards.  This game is nothing like Final Fantasy Tactics like promised in their kickstarter.  This game is just another Double Fine failure.   Spend your money elsewhere.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Double Fine ProductionsPublishers: Double Fine Productions Initial release: June 2015Genre: Tactical, RPG, Strategy, Turn-based #Worth/NotWorth: #NotWorth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationShort version – Massive Chalice is XCOM jr. Slightly longer version – Massive Chalice is a turn based strategy game. That is a lot like XCOM.You are charged with the task of removing “the cadence” from the world which for most intents and purposes is a enemy force filled with multiple types of creatures. This task is given to you by the aforementioned Chalice. The cadence threatens the world and the Chalice can stop it. The crux of the game runs on a timeline. With random events that take place as you go. You control territories in which you build things such as Keeps, Sageright Guilds and Crucibles. Each with their own purpose. Death is permanent for your party members. This aspect of the game differs from XCOM in that characters are created from assigning a regent and a partner to a keep for the purposes of siring an heir. There are only 3 main classes to begin with; CaberJack, the tank like melee character. The Hunter, ranged scout type and the Alchemist, a mid range AoE type of character. Through having children other types of classes can be made making a total of nine such as the ShadowJack, Enforcer, and Trickshot.As the timeline moves along, you must select a Vanguard to send into battle when the cadence attacks. They may attack in any region including the keeps you have constructed which can lead to difficult battles as your Vangaurd usually spawns on the opposite sides of the map of the regent. Making your timely selection to creating a good heir useless. The other thing is through worrying about genealogy is that people die from old age in your vanguard and as well as regents. This is just another added affect that causes stress. You can assign people to the sageright guild to increase research rates at the cost of never having them enter battle again. Research takes place as a passive affair. This is also an extreme similarity to XCOM in which you are developing armor and new weapons alongside constructing buildings in different territories. All while dealing with trying to gain XP for your vanguard members and trying to keep the cadence at bay as the timeline moves along. THE GISTAll of this is fine, its starts off pretty simple, easy to grasp. But its slow and the random progression makes it needlessly frustrating. While you can eventually make up to 9 classes, the initial 3 make it very shallow. Not to mention their tech tress feel rather limited. It all feels very been there and done that with nothing really super unique to offer and grab your attention. The music is good during the battles, the voice acting of the chalice often giving advice and narration to the events unfolding are well done. However, it just doesn't have the legs to hold any non extreme turn based strategy players attention.Follow my curation for more "

												Clearly not my chalice of fun.There are really two parts to this game: management and combat. First of these consists of queuing the next action up and waiting, and even though it's in theory exactly the same thing you do in XCOM games, entire thing felt pointless and extremely unrewarding to me.In the management view, main (and almost only) thing you do is combine lineages. This basically means matching two heroes with desired traits, retiring them permanently to one of the hero-incubator-buildings and waiting a couple of decades for new hero-babies to pop up and grow into adults.On the paper that might sound like a novel idea, but the execution is far from what I hoped it to be. It all boils down to constantly browsing through lists of throw-away heroes, comparing and never memorizing their skillsets, as they will in either case die of old age after a few fights (if they get to participate in one at all).And that's about it. There is nothing else to do in-between fights. There is no grand strategy. No politics or other factions. No exploration or conquest. Just a mindless queue-one-thing-up-and-wait-for-next-attack routine, where the things that one queues up don't even feel in any way impactful or interesting. Event the storyline is all about waiting.Oh, and then there is the turn-based-combat thing, too. It's alright, though a bit simplistic and monotonous. For me, it just does not feel worth spending any more time on.P.S. Voice acting for the chalice was great. Probably the best thing in the game.			"

												Edit: I played this game again after release, and everything in the original review stands. The game is frustratingly shallow, you'll never bond with your heroes since there's so many and they die fast anyway, and the AI is so dimwitted it has problems dealing with basic corners.----Original Review:I backed this game due to interesting core ideas. But the ideas didn't produce a worthy end result. Do not buy this game if you want or expect an interesting strategical or tactical challenge. The options you have are extremely reduced, flat and boring. (3 classes, extremely simple or no skill choices, extremely bland upgrades etc.) The game can be difficult, but mostly because you have so few factors you can influence or strategy routes you can take, which is the BAD kind of difficult.The biggest atrocity within this product is the straight, shortsighted copy of the (bad) 'activation' mechanic of XCOM: Enemy Unknown as soon as Line of Sight is established. The battles are supposed to feel like a wave of demons attacking one of your provinces. In a blatant failure of design, enemies are just standing around, akin to braindead animals standing around in a forest. (If you use the close combat class a lot, it's often impossible to avoid activating multiple groups at the same time, just by approaching an enemy, while the ranged class allows you to easily snipe them from afar).The one interesting aspect of the game, the management of families, is still interesting, but as far as I know can be exploited as soon as you understand how the system works.I was simple not able to stick around for later stages of the game. It was just such a MASSIVE FAILURE.			"

												Massive Chalice can at first seem a little one dimensional especially on the combat side. However, there are some very good ideas here especially with the way you have to breed better fighters through complex ""bloodlines"" where traits are passed down the line and you attempt to engineer superior characters. There is also the crucible where you can retire your finest middle-aged fighters to help with training up the next generation. I say middle aged because if you wait until they are too old then they will die of illness or old age before they actually have time to have an influence. Also, combat improves via new skill traits and better equipment invention giving your characters a multitude of new skills. Time passes very quickly though and you shouldn't go into this game expecting to hold onto some ""super-soldier"" for too long. The real idea is to BREED a sustainable influx of stronger characters rather than just pumping up lone figures. The learning curve is slow and you wont have seen much of how the game REALLY works until after at least your first 100 game years or so.There are many other nice touches that contribute to the variety of tactics when looking to sustain your nation but they are just too many to discuss in a short review. But I will add that a single campaign can take around 20 hours or so and no two will ever be the same due to the nature of the breeding system so there is plenty of replay value here. So to sum up, MC is a game which appears a lot more simplistic than it actually is because underneath its seemingly shallow surface is a very deep and original game - and one that I highly recommend to those of a persevering nature. If you can just keep in mind that it is a ""slow burner"" then you will have many enjoyable hours with it.			"

Early Access Review
								At this point, the game simply isn't fun. Heroes die off before you get any decent use out of them, combat is slow and uninteresting and the enemies feel cheap more than they feel challenging. This all bundled with weird control choices (left click should not be a 'move unit here?' prompt by default) and strange delays during combat just makes the game tedious. The only personality it has so far comes from the dialogue from the Chalice which is often drowned out by obnoxious UI noises. Massive Chalice has an incredible amount of potential but it just feels out of reach at the moment and given Double Fines' recent history, I'm not holding my breath to see it realised.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. If you like turn based strategy, managing bloodlines and fighting against impossible odds, you'll enjoy it too. The Positives: - Fun strategic combat with 3 main troop types, each with 2 subtypes. 9 classes in all, though you can only bring 5 with you for each battle.- Truly epic feel. Your kingdom must last for 300 years. That's 300 years of generation after generation of warriors fighting for you, having children, dying, and having those children fight for you. - Marry heroes to each other to produce strong bloodlines. You'll need generations of heroes to survive the cadence. There's even an option for same sex marriages. Just adopt kids to keep the bloodline going. - Random events and region bonuses make every playthrough feel different. I'd advise saving a lot, since random events can really hurt your kingdom.- Research options allow you to choose what is most important to you, and allow a level of customization (My advice, research Veil armor asap, so useful for archers)- So many houses and sigils to choose from. (I've spent wayyy too long just choosing my starting 5 houses)- Combat goes from tough, to kinda easy, to tough again, to ""you gotta be kidding me"" in the final battle. If you make it into the last 100 years, you'll notice the monsters are all tougher, with new tricks.- Lost of interesting ideas in this game, the developers definitely didn't want the stereotypical fantasy setting.Some negatives:- Chalice voices can get old fast, though they can be funny too.- Challenge level of fights can be uneven. Fights get easier once you get some research done and have enough fighters. Then challenge ramps back up round years 150-200, as enemies gain hp, damage, and extra abilitles. - Graphics are not everyone's cup of tea. Male and female models are often hard to tell apart. I enjoy the asthetic mostly, but some of you may not. If you're not sure, watch a let's play. (I liked the monster design and many of the design choices, but can understand why some people don't)- Some mechanics of the game are not explained well, and you are left to figure some tings out on your own. For example, relic weaopons. If your hero gets a nickname during battle, his weapon will turn into a powerful relic when they die, if they are using the basic form of the weapon (not the researched form, like bone bow or knockback caber) Even if the hero fights with a modified weapon, as long as they DIE with a normal weapon equipped, and have gottten a nickname, they will pass down a relic within their bloodline.- Some features, like inter family conflict, seem like they were only partially implemented. Hoping for some DLC at some point to add a few more things to an already fun game.Those things aside, this game is well worth the money (and even more worth it on sale.) If you're in doubt, watch a let's play to get a feel for the game, then give it a try. You may find yourself getting attached to the families, and yelling at the screen when the Cadence swallows up one of your states. I'll probably do a strategy guide for the game at some point, after I play through a few of the games I got for the Steam sale. Maybe that will help out some of the people having a hard time beating the game.  Bottom line, if you are looking for a strategic game with a fresh take on the genre,  and like the idea of arranging marriages, this is the game for you			"

												If XCOM-style gameplay in a fantasy world sounds interesting, Massive Chalice might be worth a look. There are 3 aspects of the game that really stand out:Combat, units, equipment: With a few base unit types and a variety of different equipment types, armor, etc (that you slowly research by killing certain types of enemy units) the strategic turn-based combat was really fun. I loved scouting and flanking with invisible hunters to find “nests” of enemies for my alchemists to lob grenades into and then warriors to charge in afterwards.Your land: The “base-building” side to the game is pretty unique in that you might build a structure on the outskirts of your land for a large short-term bonus, but you know that it will eventually fall into dust later on and it makes you question if you want to “waste” the years of that build time. The buildings and bonuses are pretty cool too.Heros and bloodlines: This is the most unique part of the game for me. The war lasts 300 years, and your heros do not! A huge part of the game is managing and creating the Houses and Bloodlines of your kingdom, making them stronger, worrying about babies, and training babies to become your future epic heros. Along with that, if you marry cross-class the offspring will be hybrid units (parts from each skill tree)! There are 6 hybrid classes, making a total of 9 classes in the game. The concept that was just so cool to me is during this 300 year war, heros are born, fight in their prime, maybe die during battle, but then definitely die of old age, and hopefully after they have birthed some offspring and started to train them.The art style is pretty refreshing as well and the controller support is excellent, just sit back and strategize!Really, the big complaint I have is about what happens after the 300 years:Once you reach the 300 year mark, you need to engage in one final, huge, battle to defend the chalice. The issue with this “wave-style” battle is there are 20-40 little Seed enemies constantly, and you have to wait and watch, one-by-one-by-one as each of them do their turn, along with the 10-20 other enemies on the field. Oh, and there are like 5 waves of enemies in this fight as well. 95% of the time during this battle you are just sitting and watching enemy units move a couple of tiles, one-by-one. It was so insanely boring that I never “finished the game” in that regard. At times during the game I wished there was a “skip animation” type option so I didn’t have to watch the enemy movements, but this battle was unbearable due to the ridiculous amount of enemies there are. I lasted the 300 years, but I couldn’t last the hours it would take to go through that battle. Really a “slap it together” finale it seemed like and that was really disappointing.So to me, the game ended at the 300 year mark, and it was a good game that I will play again - but I wont even think about starting that final battle again.

												If you are a fan of the hex turned based strategy games - this will not let you down. A brilliant but basic story-line which pits you against the Cadence, an alien like species which comes to infect your lands, set over a 300 year time-line.Throughout the time-line you build upon your territory and research better gear for your group of fighters to defend against the Cadence and ensure the Chalice is not damaged. The leveling system from your class of 3 fighters (x2 ranged and one melee) is a two tiered 10 level system. Your fighters are sub-classes which are desginated by lineage.What's unique about the level system is you are not investing your time into a certain character but in a lineage/family. You marry your lineage off to another and make babies. These babies have good or bad traits which are then passed down from generation to generation. Your lineage determines your fighter class as well. You marry off one Caberjack to a Hunter and therefore you make a Shadowjack for the next 40-50 years.Time itself is sped up until an event occurs (research ending, lineage monarch dying, cadence presence etc etc). As time progresses so does the level of Cadence and how Advanced they get... the latter years gets harder.All in all takes about 20 hours to finish the game, but a definately replayability for another go at it, because you will make a lot of mistakes. Worth getting.... because I actually finished this game.8.5 out of 10 Timefisted Caberjacks...			"

												This game is an excellent tactics RPG.The complaint you'll likely see from many negative reviews is that you have to cycle through heroes too much, preventing you from getting attached and preventing meaningful progression. Those people obviously didn't understand the games central mechanic. The hero churn is one of the BEST things about the game. The major form of progression in the game is not individual heroes, but rather their bloodlines. I didn't get attached to any particular heroes, but I can sure tell you that House Thorne and their relic weapon, called Fear, won me many a battle. This game is full of interesting choices about how to best develop your bloodlines, and managing them is where the real meat of the strategy side of the game lies.The tactics side of the game is fairly simple, but elegant and satisfying. There are three starting classes that mix through the miracle of childbirth to make up to 9 classes. The opposition consists of 7 different types of enemies, and advanced forms of those 7. Most of these enemies have unique gimmicks, some of them playing into the macro-strategy side of the game. Battles happen every 10-20 years, and they remained fun for me all the way through the game.If there's any real problem with the game, its that it kind of feels repetitive, and it doesn't really build up to its ending. All 300 years feel mostly the same. I feel like the game really wants me to take what I've learned on my first playthrough and apply it to the harder difficulties, but a playthough takes too long for that to really feel reasonable. This game could have really benefitted from each playthrough being shorter, but really I think the game is worth playing anyway.			"

												I thought this game was going to have more depth to it than it does.  I love turn based strategy games as they tend to have lots of depth, customizability, and replayability, however this has none of those.  It's a very basic game and you can't even get to enjoy developing a character before they die off.  The concept is sound, but the character development and longevity is poor done.  Probably worth about $2-5 if on sale, but don't expect too much fun out of it after a few battles.  If the company keeps at it, evolves the game, etc, it could be a great game.			"

Great ideas, not so great executionI love the idea of this game but for the most part but this leaves my frustrated that full potential was not found here.Basicly this is surviving with kingdom (until timer runs out) and making most of what you got. When trouble arises you choose where you send your team and go xcom lite on their♥♥♥♥♥When your heroes gain power you can continue their heritage and get people to reproduce so that heroes traits survive the years.Sound pretty nice doesn't it? Well its not that. Like most modern double fine games it has nice assets and ideas but something along the way went haywire.Make no mistake there is nice music, narration, assets all that good stuff. The gameplay is where my problems come from.Managing kingdom is mostly mobile game level of deep and random story multiple choices have no way of knowing what bears what results so you have to take shot in the dark. Not that you care much when you can breed more canonfodder.Years roll way too quickly compared to time that anything takes to build or reachers and mostly your heroes get one or two fights and then they are basically old af.You can crossbreed people to get more variant classes that aren't that different or use time to get random batch of heroes that might not have what you want.High Level heroes drop their heirloom weapons you can give your soon to be cannon fodder in hopes it does something. Mostly you just give it somebody and forget the damn thing.When enemies come so comes the fight. Fight that's usually WAY too long and far between generations. The game introduces gradually enemies that suppose to make strategizing more variant but it really doesn't that much.However some of those enemies are some of the most bull I have seen. Enemy that takes your xp on every hit, one gets almost invulnerable on first impact for one round, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who spawns multiple enemies. AT BEST difficulty comes from game spamming enemies on you and when mechanics take arbitrarily time and sometimes ever so lovely rng screws you over the experience goes to shiter. I had under lvl enemy straight to my character who had 100% chance to hit it. Well he misses. Couple of times. In a row. Killed by random shot coming from the fog of war I could not predict atm. Some of the crap you can medicate with skills that aren't really that interesting, on in many cases even useful. Later in game you get frustrated since THE DAMN GAME IS SO AFRAID YOU MISS SOMETHING. There's a small delay/pause after and start of every action and it LOVES to break gameplay to show found enemies and statuses. Not after your move or anything - straight away. The rubberband camera that kinda lets you move it even when ""HEYHEYLOOKATTHIS"" segments gets irritating AF pretty fast. Not to mention occasionally it brakes and doesn't for random reason go any further than point x. The game uses those delays even on enemy turn making later stages in game unbearably long (since there's creep spam). That would be fine if I could change those things from options but that place is as shallow as this game.So game is shallow, spammy, unclear at some points and mostly frustrating.DO NOT get this game at full price. Not necessarily at low level sale. I would recommend getting this along side of other games (Humble Bundle).			"

Summary: A game where the developers put in the bare minimum effort.To start with, I want to say that I purchased this game when it was 80% off (I paid $4) and I feel what I got was worth the price I paid. However, had I paid full price, I'd have felt ripped off.First is lack of variety.* There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of bloodlines. (Apparently it was a backer award.) They are all virtually interchangable. They each have a flag, a color scheme, a name and a motto. The first three only matter for identification in the menu, while the motto appears after a member of the bloodline gets a kill. I'm not saying they need a unique perk or anything, but for the sheer volume, they boiled down to class and menu color.* With only 4 hair colors (including grayed), a handful of hair styles and one skin tone, heroes start to blend together very early. Even the armor colors stop distinguishing heroes once you get Cadence armor types. (And you'll want to use Veil Armor on every hunter.)* There are 9 classes (3 base, 6 hybrids), but only around ten unique skills. Every hybrid shares the majority of its skills (and armor appearance) with its two base classes. So of the nine classes, there is very little difference in basic function. Heroes will spend the majority of the game being distinguished by which of the three weapon types they use.* Seven enemy types. Seeds (basic mooks), Ruptures (explode), Lapses (drain exp) and Bulwarks (ranged attackers, take 1 damage from all attacks after the first hit each round) appear early on, joined by Wrinkles (age heroes), Cradles (spawn Seeds) and Twitches (swap positions with heroes) within the first 100 years (of 300). 'Advanced' versions show up around the 150 year mark, which just buffs HP, damage and exp. The only mechanical difference I noticed with any of them was that Advanced Lapses also slowed down cooldowns. Each enemy only has one attack.* The Chalice duo will occasionally chime in after an enemy or ally is killed, at the end of a battle, or when a random event pops up. By the fourth battle, these lines were already repeating.* Each zone has one map, with the only major variation each mission being your, and the Cadences', starting positions. Same goes for each structure, when they're directly attacked. (At least the final battle has a unique map, which added a sliver of variety after I had spent the last half of the game just going through the motions.)Second is a lack of balance.* Hunters can stealth, which is essential for scouting. They can also attack at range, and get a double shot that can potentially one-round Bulwarks. They are awesome.* Alchemists can throw a limited number of flasks (read: grenades) per map and can get an extra item slot. They're useful for dealing with seeds early on, and actually manage to get really powerful with time.* Caberjacks are melee heroes meant to mitigate damage. The plethora of Ruptures and ranged attackers early on makes them sitting ducks, since they lack the HP or armor to soak any more damage than a hunter early on. In theory, they can knock back enemies to avoid rupture explosions, but their low damage on their first knockback skill means they can only kill a rupture if it's nearly dead, otherwise you need a hunter to off it anyway. Theoretically, they can stun enemies by knocking them into each other or against walls, but again, only if they can close the distance.* Most hybrids are similar. Shadowjacks are just caberjacks that can scout with stealth. Blastcappers and Boomstrikers don't stand out from their base class much. Brewtalists has the sole distinction of getting a melee version of the hunter's double shot. Enforcers are just hunters that can knockback at range (which is an upgrade over cabers, at least) and are a bit more durable, but durability doesn't matter much when hunters can avoid getting hurt in the first place.* Trickshots are notable for being an actual interesting hybrid. Their flask arrows sacrifice the ability to be thrown over obstacles and must be aimed at enemies instead of being able to target an empty square, but have longer range.Third is the story.While the game is sparse on plot, that isn't my issue here. No, what bothers me is the forced and groan inducing 'twist' at the end.WARNING: Spoilers for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Massive Chalice.So you've finished the final battle and the Chalice informs you that the Cadence can't be stopped, only pushed back for a while. This is a pretty common trope, kind of dull, but acceptable on its own. But it just makes the next bit more frustrating.I bring up XCOM because the endings are quite comparable. In XCOM, the Volunteer personally flies the alien ship away from earth, knowing it's about to explode. This is heroic, because the character is knowingly and willingly making a personal sacrifice for the good of the world.In Massive Chalice, you beat the game and the Chalice informs you that the Ruler - the character / role the player fills - will die when the Chalice does its thing to push the Cadence back. Both the player and Ruler are unaware of this fact until a moment before the Chalice fires. This is not heroic, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, because the player/Ruler was being lied to, manipulated, the entire game, unaware that not only would they die, but their goal of wiping out the Cadence is literally impossible.XCOM's ending was heart wrenching, because I had to watch a character I grew to favor and rely on, to care about, walk knowingly to their death.If Massive Chalice's devs had any creativity, any drive to make the player feel something other than frustration, they'd have put more effort in. Even one little change could make all the difference: Imagine if using the Chalice would wipe out the Cadence at the cost of the Ruler's life. Now imagine that the game asked you if you wanted to go through with it.Despite the game's potential, it fails to live up to any of it. I feel sorry for the kickstarter backers.			"

												I bought this game and initially loved it.  On the surface it has a lot going on and seems like tons of fun.  Sadly, it only takes a few hours to realize how shallow the gameplay really is.  The breeding, training, and research all seem like good ideas but I can't really immerse in it too far after discovering that the only classes worth using are Hunters and Hunter-derivatives.     The meat of my complaint: they have virtually the same starting health and damage as the other two primary classes, can stealth their way across the map, and eliminate enemies from range with no limit to the number of attacks.  I'm sure the other two classes could be good with a lot of work and research, but why bother?  They fill no roll.  You can literally start breeding nothing but Hunters right out of the gate with zero regard for traits and stats and win every single fight hands down.     It really feels like a near miss.  The components are there for a solid game, but the core of it - the fighting - is horribly broken by design.  The worst part is Double Fine seems to be satisfied.  Don't expect any DLC's or patches adding content or changing mechanics.  This thing is done, and it's just not where it should be.			"

												Critical miss on key features that prevent the rest of the game from delivering.This game is all about family houses that span the distance of 100s of years, and you oversee this and nurture the bloodlines and nation as a whole. A major shortcoming was to prevent players from customizing or naming any heros, keeps, or houses. Nothing can be tailored to you. For a game that is centered around the growing of bloodlines, the decision to prevent any bloodline customization was an odd one (Backer reward only). This came off as being forced to choose between something you dont want or something entirely silly. House name, keep name, founding male and female names, motto, and battle cry probably appealed to the creator, but fail miserably at forcing me to love a shoe that doesnt fit for 300 years of gameplay.Also lacking is any distinct combat scenario. Combat was repetative. Not necessarily an awful thing, but made late game very tedious and taxing rather than fun.Overall feels like a very well done moble game. If you dont care about your game purchases allowing you to put your own flare or spin or that 'RAWR' or ""GYARRRRRRR!"" might be your battle cry, give it a shot. Devs did a good job here, just apparently kept combat monochromatic and gated any player customization behind backer rewards.			"

												The breeding heroes is an interesting concept.The random events with with unpredictable outcomes doesn't bother me.But the distinct lack defensive options during combat which makes up the bulk of the game really just sucks the enjoyment out of the game for me. It make battle boil down in to just run at the enemy and attack.If you kill it great,if not you lose a hero. It just doesn't feel like you have much in the way of options in how you want to fight. Which leaves it feeling very dull.			"

Early Access Review
								Can't recommend this right now -- it's extremely derivative of XCom 2012 which wouldn't be a problem in and of itself if it were close to feature parity, which it currently isn't. Right now the game seems to be balanced on top of the tech grind, taking for granted that the combat is fun and interesting meanwhile, and they have a lot more work to do on that front. The aesthetic is great and the lineage stuff is nice, but the core still feels like a prototype.			"

												You hear this so many times about so many games but in this case it is so true.This game has so much potential but falls short.You see the game has a certain look and feel, the Graphics are really nice and it will remind you off Endless Dungeon/Legend.The game is pretty unique but you wont get very long games, the game period is over 300years that pass by really quickly then game over, sort of ruins it really but is unique enough to sort of work.The Combat is really simply and plain, the only AI in this is that it will just throw lots of spawns at you. There is no saving points for next turn, no overwatch, no real cover system except a simple one. All that is required is to click the ground to move or click enemy to hit, that is it.So the combat is very simply done, it sorta works though but will bore alot of TB Vets out there.The only other part of the game is very weak, all you can do is click a item to research, and click a keep to add its king etc.This is where the gasme needs more mechanics, how about a beastiary? you kill a monster its added to the beastiary, research it to find full details, best tactics and a small bonus vs that type, anything, the game really lacks any Depth.Then they anounce its to be released, imagine if you kickstarted this, ouch, once more they release and finish a game that is not complete and in need of a few months work.That is where it is sad, if it had more features then man this game would rock, they are so close but money has called again.Shame such a shame, especially after the Spacebase fiasco.Sadly being released as is gets a thumbs down,  but i wish theyd realise how close they are to a awsome game.

												There is a lot of cool stuff about Massive Chalice. For example, the family system; being able to marry off heroes from differing families to create different classes and even more powerful heroes makes for an interesting time... be careful though, you might end up with a single bloodline of only Hunters if you're not careful. It's also pretty cool to watch the lives of your heroes from the day they are born, to the day they go to jail, to the day they die... be prepared, however, you're going to see a lot of birth and death in this game.To add on, beautiful graphics, great voice acting from the two advisors within the chalice itself and a hypnotic and somber soundtrack that really immerses you in this soon to be destroyed world. Then there is the badstuff... well, the bad thing, really.

			The Commissar plays the recently released Massive Chalice turn-based strategy game! This game features an absolutely, incredible family_heritage system that is probably the most interesting part of...		

That being, the combat system. Combat in the game can pretty much boil down to a couple of different enemy types that if allowed to close in, will absolutely ravage your heroes. While this isn't a bad thing, the combat itself is just tedious... and fighting battles isn't half as interesting as what's going on during your forays on the Campaign Map. Truly, I'd be okay with just autoresolving the battles so I can delve further into the lives of my short-lived heroes rather than manually fight every single battle against the Cadence.All in all, I definitely recommend this game. For 20 bucks? I'd say that's a damn good price.			"

												Massuve Chalice is like a big plate of french fries. When it first arrives piping hot, it's delicious and enjoyable while you juggle the first few hot bites in your mouth but as you continue eating, it soon gets cold and you're left with a mouthful of staleness and regret as you stare at half the plate sitting there in front of you knowing that no matter how you reheat the fries, it'll never be the same.The game plays around with some interesting concepts, but the execution ends up flat. The idea of bloodlines is interesting and how you manage heroes throughout the years but once you peel that first layer away, there's not much to it. The combat is simplistic without much depth to the strategy and soon gets dull. the characters both heroes and monsters lack variety and the story is pretty linear and bare. The game eventually ends up more of a chore and you feel it even more once you hit the halfway mark.Buy if only heavily discounted and if you don't mind highly repetitive games, else go for the XCom series instead.

												Everything you'd expect from a Double Fine game: interesting gameplay, unique and colorful art style, funny and fun. The bloodline system is ingenious! The tactical combat is rather simplistic but still satisfying, though sometimes it feels repetitive especially in the latter years if you've nothing left to gain but victory. The kingdom management is probably the shallowest aspect of the game; still fun but less interesting as choices dwindle. Character classes are an interesting lot, and the leveling system feels good. Random events are wickedly fun to discover. The enemies are cool, but I think the game would have benfitted greatly from a few more mob types and bosses. Overall good game and easily replayable. Sure its not perfect but it's perfectly fun! I'm MASSIVELY happy to have backed it and recommend it anyone interested in something new!			"

												Fun, X-COM meets breeding simulator?. Gets repetitive after a while, and its not a super deep game. I enjoyed it. There are far better examples of the genre, and it doesn't really do anything new. I did not beat it because of the weird difficulty ramp and repetitiveness. If you haven't played a game in this genre before, there are far better options. Do not buy at full price, but anything $5 or less.I will recommend because the addition of the bloodlines adds a interesting dimension in terms of getting attached to your characters and their descendants, and the core gameplay is solid, but there is not as much depth as you could get in other games.Great potential, but falls a little short.

												So I bought the game because I watched the trailer, am a fan of XCom, and thought this game had a lot of potential.    But just like DoubleFine's work on SpaceBase DF-9, I'm left feeling short-changed and disappointed.Long story short, what this is is an incomplete project that should have never been released to the public.  None of the ideas are refined, the graphics are dated, the gameplay is stale, and the concept as a whole was never achieved.  To give the game credit, I will say that had they actually had the funds and the time to finish the project as I believe they had intended, I'm wholly confident that this game would have been pretty fun at a minimum, and potentially great if all went well.  I'm sad to report though, that that's not the case here.As far as I'm concerned, I think I'm done supporting DoubleFine until they can show me a high-quality FINISHED game that's worth playing.  If studios want to use the ""alpha-access"" model to produce funds before games are ready, that's fine with me, but taking that strategy shouldn't excuse developers from their responsibility to release finished prodcuts for sale.  If a game is incomplete, it's incomplete, and they should be upfront about that.  So should the reviewers in the media.			"

												Massive Chalice is X-COM plus King of Dragon Pass.  It's a neat game concept that doesn't make it all the way to being a good game.  I like the slightly zany art style.  The narrators get stale long before you finish one playthrough.The events add nothing.  Do you want to pick door A, B, or C?  It's OK that you have no way of evaluating the options, because it turns out all of them will kill your hero.Do you like Punnet Squares and genetic engineering? Too bad.  All the heroes are limited to 3 traits.  Also, the heroes play the same way whether they have +5 hp or -5 hp, so it's not really worthwhile to put effort into crafting a super-race.Sagewrights, your researchers, are tedious at best.  You put your oldest people there, because age correlates with research speed.  Then they die, because they are old.  Then you stop gameplay, zoom into your research house, and take ~20 seconds to pick your next oldest person.  This isn't a feature, it's a chore.Relics are a neat idea, but they stick with a hero until death.This would work better as a turn based game at the strategy level, because there is no situation in which you adjust your play style to adapt to changing situations.  You just wait an indeterminate period and then choose options.  Heroes are assigned for life, so there is literally nothing you can do except wait until your heroes die in order to choose their replacements.			"

												**Key was donated from the developer to review**   Introduction            Massive Chalice is an X-Com style game with the artistic touch of the people from Double Fine. Some people have said that Massive Chalice is extremely simplified and missing a lot of polish, but I cannot agree with this. Massive Chalice is filled with tons of really innovative and fun mechanics including the bloodlines. When you start the game you have the option in enable a “silly” mode witch adds funny things to the names, mottos, and battle cry of the different houses. These include hilarious stuff like: A motto “You only YOLO once” and tons of various things about the amazement of bacon. Though this feature is option I would highly suggest having it enabled just for the laughs. The combat boils down to a simplified turn base shell with a bit a variance with the difference hero classes. Even though I did start to get bored with the combat after a while, I still enjoyed playing Massive Chalice because of the different mechanics like the bloodlines, training, and researching. I have loved nearly every Double Fine game from past times and Massive Chalice is just another one to add to the list. I would highly suggest picking this game up some time.-HiPFiRED   Pros                Graphics Style Hero Training Bloodlines/Generations Solid Combat The Story is Solid and Makes You Want to Defend Everyone    Cons               No Real Replay Value  Some Say Compared to X-Com the Combat is Very Simplified  Many People Say the Game Gets Really Repetitive Although I Don’t Agree With This.

												I'm sure some people will find this game very refreshing, but it never hooked me. MASSIVE CHALICE is the very definition of a polarizing product. This is an example of a game that is stuck in 90s. There are a lot of really cool ideas here, but to truly embrace to this game you need to do a lot of planning which means spending a bunch of time in menus.

												Do you like fantasy games? Do you like turn based strategy? Do you enjoy tactical positioning? Are you a fan of leveling systems with customizable skills? Do you enjoy dealing with random chance? Would you like to breed a family of superheroes? Would it be entertaining if their bloodline developed heart disease or alcoholism because they are people too? Would you like to manage the development of a small kingdom that feels like a board game inserted into all of this? Then this game is for you, buy it. If you aren't convinced, wait for it to go on sale ($10 is a great deal for it).A good friend of mine played this right up to the 300 year marker, but then lost because his heroic bloodlines went infertile around year 250. No one was left for the final confrontation. I got a kick out of that.			"

												This game has so much potential. The marriage and breeding are great! But it doesnt matter how great your people are when battles happen very rarely and no xp is availible outside of them. So anybody you leveled from the last battle is either dead or about to die. So you put in some new blood hoping to earn xp, but the hordes of enemies with ridiculous attacks and abilities mow them down because they aren't leveled. Just about every enemy is downright overpowered, except the damn seeds. Which wouldnt be so bad except there are around 10-15 per map. One enemy makes you lose xp every time it attacks, one explodes when it dies and one can only take normal damage once a turn. Engaging in melee combat is downright laughable as at least 2 enemies explode when they die. It would be a great game if there were more battles with less enemies.			"

												MASSIVE CHALICE has likely flown under your radar, and for a certain (possibly large) percentage of you, that's totally OK.  But for the remaining 5%(?) of us out there that thoroughly enjoy turn-based tactical games, regardless of whether they're a bit bloated (XCOM2) or trimmed down (MASSIVE CHALICE), this is a great find and I encourage you to buy it.What makes it an engaging experience?  Well, I'd say that the designers succeed at their primary goal of marrying short-term tactical battles with a LONG-term strategic agenda.  The tactical battles will seem familiar, and to be honest, they are less satisfying than those of XCOM.  However, there's more depth in the classes that you may originally perceive.  At first, it seems like you have a choice between:  melee tank, AOE bomber, and ranged striker.  But these primary ones can be mixed to create hybrids through family manipulation.  In truth, there are actually 9 different classes and significant variability in how your individual heroes will operate.And that's where MASSIVE CHALICE breaks new ground.  The long-term strategic elements are primarily two-fold.  First, there's a relatively simplistic tech system that will allow you to research stronger weapons, better armor, and useful items.  These will be vital to your success in the late-game, and satisfyingly, you won't be able to research them all.  Thus, you'll have some tough and interesting decisions ahead of you.  Second, and more importantly, you will be maintaining a kingdom of important families (vassals, if you will).  You will decide who marries who, and indirectly, what their children will be like.  Not only will the children have a class determined by their parents, they'll also have a set of traits - both good and bad, which will influence their utilty in combat.  You may have a 16-year old Caberjack (the primary melee class) who possesses Bear Strength (giving her attacks bonus damage), but who is also Sickly (fewer HP).  On top of this, every child develops a personality, perhaps Cocky, or Valiant, or even Passionless. Traits can be passed down through multiple generations, so if you're not careful, you might create an entire line of Caberjacks who possess serious genetic shortcomings.It's fascinating stuff, actually.  On my first playthrough, I mostly made random (or near random) decisions when it came to marriages and such, focusing primarily on success in combat.  But if you don't manage your families well, keep their children trained, and equip your heroes with solid items, the advanced aliens (sorry, ""Cadence"") are going to wipe the floor with you.  As such, the two threads of the game - tactical combat and family dynamics - are interwoven quite effectively.MASSIVE CHALICE is easy to learn, difficult to master, and is nearly constantly revealing new ideas that surprise and delight.  You'll likely want to play at least 2 complete games - one on Easy to learn the ropes, and one on Hard once you understand the genetic intricacies.  Winning is thoroughly satisfying and certainly not guarenteed.			"

												XCOM (2012) meets Crusader Kings II with a eurogame design aesthetic.If you are a fan of those games (or even one of them), Massive Chalice is worth a playthrough. XCOM was already a streamlined remake of X-COM, so you might wonder how it could be further simplified. The solution is reducing resources that need to be managed to just bloodlines, territory and ""Research"". The later can be used to get new technology, build out infrastructure and aquire new heros. Instead of the slightly complicated system of engineers, scientists and money, you can build one project at a time and speed it up by dedicating heroes to become lifetime ""Sagewrights"". They can't fight for you anymore, which is always the tradeoff when assigning heroes to special positions.It's a similar situation with expanding your bloodlines: dedicate heroes to become ""Regents"" and marry them to start having children. This part of the game take the primary decisions in CKII (arraigning marriages) and removes minor (and fiddly) decisions like assigning counsel duties and building structures in each county. The overworld game operates on a puasable realtime system, but unlike other games you don't spend much time waiting around. It helps that there's a steady diet of random events such as deciding whether to punish heroes who have children out of wedlock. While I enjoy these bits of story, I can see how they can be frusterating for people who enjoy strategy. The results seem to be random even when you see the same event in a later playthrough. Sometimes forgiving the couple gives them a positive personality stat and othertimes a negative one. It's never possible to make a perfect decision. For me, however, this is just the right level of chrome.XCOM fans might be disappointed that heroes age and die off whether you play well or not. Massive Chalice seems to want players to be invested in bloodlines (AKA, dynasties in CKII) rather than individuals. Parents randomly pass genetic traits to children and also determine the hero class. Bloodlines specialize in one of three base classes: ranged, melee and area damage. These classes can be combined by marriage to create interesting dual-classed heroes. Once you get the concept of managing families rather than a team of individuals, the game will be less frustering.The tactical game starts fairly slowly, but as you develop technologies and bloodlines your tactics change. Meanwhile enemy forces bring new powers to the fight. The forces of chaos invading your nation are called ""Cadence"". Appropriately, their sortees come at regular intervals for 300 in-game-years. Fighting isn't too different from XCOM in terms of feel, but heroes start with fewer options. As you develop your bloodlines and technology, new and surprising tactics are opened up. Because of the bloodline mechanism, it'll take several playthroughs to see all the possibliites.Unfortunately, the tactical maps start to feel samey after a few battles in the same regions. If they are proceedurally generated, the just isn't enough variablity. (I have the same problem with XCOM, which is odd considering X-COM (1994) largely avoids the problem.) Other then the occational base defense missions, most fights settle into careful seek-and-destroy excersises. Cranking up the difficulty helped a bit.I tend to play these games in Ironman mode as it remove the tempation to break immersion by save scumming. This worked great until the final showdown when I accidently dropped acid on the Chalice. With no option to restart the mission, I was stuck starting the entire game from scratch. I'll probably want to do this at some point, but I don't think it'll happen until I've mostly forgotten the slow start.In summary, Massive Chalice does a great job of feeding the player with a steady diet of meaty decisions. But there isn't quite enough spice to sustain the mulitiple playthroughs needed to explore all the choices. A faster start and more variety in tactical maps would have helped.			"

												Massive Chalice is a blatant fantasy clone of the new XCOM, minus the tactical depth offered in the aforementioned title (deep or shallow as it was, depending on your opinion). The game is lacking in several key areas, as explained below.1) No explanation of range for hunter weapons - you are left to guess whether your crossbow is in effective range. This should be stated upfront, in number of tiles. 2) There is no point to utilizing any other class in combat besides hunter - enemies such as Wrinklers (melee enemy, they age your hero on any successful hit by 5 years), Ruptures (explode when killed) and Lapses (explode when killed, possibly stunning anything in range) make close combat units a gamble, at best. 3) Mixing the three basic classes (caberjack, alchemist, hunter) does nothing of particular interest  (except for shuffling class skills and adding a few questionably useful new skills). 4) AoE attacks don't function unless targeted at specific enemies (except for alchemist grenades). In other words, you can't utilize the majority of AoE attacks as indirect fire / artillery. They MUST be targeted at an enemy.5) Most 'heroes' that are recruited are typically stacked with negative attributes that make them useless in combat and useless for generating further hero bloodlines. 6) You can use only 5 heroes in any given tactical combat, but the Cadence have typically 3-4 times more units. Regardless of what skills are used against them (for example, Taunt) they still maximize their effectiveness in terms of hitting multiple units. A Taunted unit should not be able to move to where it wishes and hit multiple units - if it is Taunted it should only be concerned with directly attacking the unit that Taunted it. About the only thing that was done correctly in this game was the music.If you're looking for a turn-based strategy game I would recommend avoiding this, unless you're willing to deal with ridiculous odds, horrible random events that can destroy your heroes, and weapons that lack any sort of explanation regarding range and capability.I'd recommend picking this up on sale. In fact, I'd just pirate this garbage software since it was given to Xbox One owners for free on release. Talk about discrimination.			"

												First impressions? Massive Chalice is massively disappointing. I backed this game on Kickstarter, figuring ""it's Double Fine, how could they go wrong?"" Well, lately they have a habit of not putting nearly as much love into their games as they used to. What I hoped for was a fantasy XCOM, which is pretty much what Massive Chalice tries to be. Where it fails is that it's so shallow in every aspect. The choices you make on the strategy map are uninteresting, and the combat in particular (which really needs to be the strongest part of a Turn-Based Strategy game) is watered-down to the point of tedium. No cover, no flanking, no range bonuses, no benefit to saving action points. Outside of skills, it's just a matter of getting to a square where you can attack the enemy and killing them before they kill you. Plus most of the enemy designs are not fun at all. An enemy that steals XP from your heroes when it hits? Not fun. An enemy that causes your permadeath heroes that you've invested a lot of time in to age faster and thereby randomly die of old age sooner? NOT FUN.On most games I feel like I should put more time in before writing a review, but honestly the game is so shallow that I have a pretty good idea what to expect from an entire playthrough already, and so boring that I don't know if I'll be able to bring myself to find out for sure. If you want a good TBS, do yourself a favor and play XCOM instead, or even Banner Saga.			"

												A game that never realized its potential. It originally advertised as a medieval version of X-com, essentially. Now, a medieval tbs isn't the most original thing in the world, but one that focuses more on strategy then RPG elements. What we got instead was a weird ""medieval universe"" that just made the classes feel like gunners and the enemies feel like aliens. It's just not very fun. It's not medieval enough to want to play outside of X-com and not good enough to want to play outside Fire Emblem. I'm officially bummed.			"

												This is like the movie Click, but a strategy game. You literally fast forward through most of the game. Unfortunately Christopher Walken isn't in it, and you don't get your life back at the end.The idea of breeding the different classes together to make hybrid classes was interesting, but you can't keep breeding hybrid classes together to make even more hybrid classes, it just comes back around to the defaults. Enemies are unvaried, as is the terrain and the tactical situations themselves. You start out with all your pieces on the field, and you're either near enemies, or you have to uncover the fog of war to find them. Then you beat them and do more fast forwarding. The game was over in 13 hours, and there's not much replay value, other than trying to get the rest of the achievements. Art style is neat. It's a short and interesting tactical strategy game with the Double Fine flavor.Not recommended at full price.			"

												Strategy enthusiast ( well accustomed to turn-based and realtime gaming with menus upon menus) disappointed and bored by Massive ChaliceLike many of you I was intrigued by the mechanics of breeding help/harm traits and compounding experience. I was hoping for a variety of possible playstyles, long-term consequences to decisions, and emergent character classes/behaviors and AI behaviors as they adapt to each other's strategies over 300 years. Instead, I had the same hide and seek fight for 26 hours with the same playstyle generation to generation. There was no reward for creativity in breeding and selecting for positive traits in breeders necessarily removed my favorite units from play. Each encounter was incredibly one-sided: stick to the formula, and hunters would triumph untouched; experiment, and all caberjacks and alchemists die horrible deaths to soulless, malevolent squash-beings.TLDR:ClumsySlow LearnerSluggish "

Early Access Review
								It sounded better as a concept when they were raising funds for it (most DoubleFine games do). I backed it way back then as at the time I still held out hope that DF were a half decent studio. Time has proven otherwise. The result in this case - now in beta, is a boring, derivitive, uninspired turkey.Double Fine are a joke now. If they aren't failing to deliver games (Broken Age) or cancelling them entirely (Spacebase DF9 - atrociously managed), they are churning out half-baked money grabbing rubbish like Hack'n'Slash and Massive Chalice will be joining the pile of refuse.These guys don't deserve to be in business. Don't support them - there are some genuinely talented real indie devs out there that deserve customer support but DF isn't one of them. They are neither professional nor talented - and they'd rather distract the public with their superficial social justice crusading than make good games.			"

There are a bunch of ideas here that *sound* cool, but many just don't quite work in practice - leaving us with I can't help thinking of as XCOM Generations (5-soldier tactical battles with classes, gear research; instead of explicit base building, you are *breeding* future generations of soldiers).

												As someone who backed the kickstarter, I must regretfully say that Massive Challice is underwhelming. The main problem is that it's trying very hard to mimic X-COM while being worse than it in nearly every way. Its one distinguishing feature - the bloodline system - is kind of creepy (a eugenics program?) and, worse, not implemented well enough to be very interesting.Beyond that, the game lacks variety - the number of monster types and hero classes are both rather limited - and unintentionally highlights this fact by making an individual playthrough rather long. 80 years into your 300-year run you'll have seen all the enemies and all that will remain is 220 years of seeing them again with bigger numbers. The same tactics work basically from start to finish, and once you've figured them out battles are more chore than entertainment.In short, just go play X-COM.			"

												This game has all the good stuff from old XCOM games, without everything that put me off. I always tended to rage-quit or reload XCOM save games after a sudden death of a squad member. This game forces you to think ahead, and death in combat is offseted with the fact that everybody will die sooner or later, and Your task is not to craft the best combat team, but to secure bloodlines for the steady stream of heroes.This dynamic alone is genius. The game has great art style, good storyline, replayability, fresh game design ideas, and very solid tactical mode (XCOM inspired). If you get too attached to the heroes You led this game will definitely frustrate You, because it punishes people who cannot compromise. It is the best feature of the game and I love it. I have learned a lot while playing this game. It highlighted important questions about life. It provided nicely graded entertainment. It is what I would like more games to become.			"

												While MASSIVE CHALICE proudly wears all its influences (Crusaders Kings 2, XCOM remake, Game of Thrones) on its sleeve, ultimately it does not feel like a castrated version of something grand - it is a fine game for its price and set scale.The central gimmick of managing bloodlines is very entertaining, especially when you realise that marrying random people is not the way to go (by year 100 when you need diverse classes).Tactical battles exchange XCOM cover management for knockbacks and stuns, forcing you to constantly be in motion, slamming heads into solid objects.The length of the game is a bit frustrating - playthrough on normal took me 16 hours, while my first XCOM playthrough was only a bit longer - 20 hours. With a game much more abstract, leaner on story and systems, it drags, but by the year 200 (of 300) the ""caring about troops"" aspect kicks in and you just cant leave the clans that you have been fostering for centuries.

												There's a lot of things in the way of liking this game. The gameplay lacks a lot of depth in battle, and out of battle the progression is pretty linear. The enemy variety is nice, but early on it can be a slog. The randomness is also really annoying, especially in Ironman mode.Still, the premise is great enough that I can get past that. A 300 year war where you have to manage your ruling houses in order to produce soldiers to replace the ones that die of old age is just a really unique concept. It's a stripped down XCOM:EU from a game play standpoint but taking the permadeath aspect of XCOM and twisting it around to be an inevitability that you have to prepare for is really interesting.If you enjoy XCOM or the 'generations' ideas in games like Fire Emblem: Awakening this game is worth a try. Stings a little bit of wasted potential, but I'm definitely able to look past a lot of its flaws.			"

												As a huge fan of turn based tactical battles (like in X-Com), I really wanted to like this game. The backgroundstory is uninteresting at best and the humor is not funny at all. This wouldn´t be a problem, if the battles were interesting and challenging. But the battles aren´t tactical at all, they´re just boring and tedious. Uncovering the fog of war to activate the next group of enemies just to kill them always in the same way is a time-consuming pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and no fun at all. And what the game claims as its biggest gimmick, the bloodline genetics, turns out to be its worst design failure: since your heroes will die anyway, there´s no possibility - at least no reason - in developing a relation to them: XY survived a battle or died? I just didn´t care about it at all since numerous heirs just took over their place. And their different traits and states are just +1 or -1 to their stats. Furthermore the UI is so bad designed, that it´s just annoying to click through the  stats of your heroes that I soon gave it up which affected my lack of interest for them even more. All in all the game was so uninspiring, that I wasn´t able to spend more time with it than just two sessions. I prefer searching on for the next hidden round based tactics gem over spending more time with this game.			"

												So when I first opened this game I was blown away, production values are just through the roof, the voice acting really brings it to life, combat is fun but took some learning to master, so I was super excited.  Now I've played about 7 hours, and at this stage the game is starting to feel grindy, as described in other reviews.  Not too much more is given to you over time.I think I'm about half way to beating the game on normal difficulty, and I still plan to finishk, although I may not stick it out for the harder difficulty.  So I would say it's been worth it, I spent a good chunk of time on it, and it was very enjoyable.			"

												I'm going to keep it short because it's been said a hundred times already. The game showed great promise early on. It has a very elegant design that has potential for a lot of depth. But as seems to be the case with Double Fine's Early Access titles, they never followed through on that potential. This game is official ""finished"" as in there will be no future development or content, despite it being ripe for and desperately needing exactly that. Save your money. This is DF9 all over again.

												It's impossible to discuss this game without discussing XCOM; when comparing the two, this one is lacking, but it's a decent game in its own right. I'd say that its major flaw is unbalance, closely followed by a lack of options. However, the combat is fun and largely well-balanced, and the story and lore are well-written and frankly deserve to be explored a little more. Overall still pretty fun, and worth a buy on sale.On the subject of the game's lack of balance, the whole idea of the game is that it spans 300 years, so your heros will all die no matter what. Unfortunatley, there are so few battles that it's very hard for them to gain experience. From birth to adulthood (15yrs) children gain experience and traits based on the skill of their parents and of the Standard, so children gradually become more and more experienced, but once they hit adulthood, the only way to level up is through battle. Therefore, a hero is really only good for two or three battles before they need to be retired so they can pass on their wisdom and make some babies. The only reason to keep a hero in battle into old age is so they can level up their Relic, but that's only viable if they have family. When heroes die, there's no reason to mourn them, because you never got a chance to know them. This game desperately needs a Long War mod to let you really invest in your heroes, as well as some battle type variations to keep things interesting. So not just a mod, a full expansion pack. Then this would be worth dumping $20-30 into.			"

												The combat is way too basic, as it mostly consists of ""see that enemy, hit it!"" and nothing more. certaintly there are special moves, but heros have to level up to get these moves. When you take into consideration that heros generally die off after a battle or 2 (either they die in battle, or they get old and die) that dosent leave much room for leveling and development, thus making the aquisition of new skills rather futile. The game also likes to be unnecessarily difficult, even on easy. Granted, this wouldent be so much of an issue if there was more of a tactical side to the game. In the end, I gave this game multiple tries, but found it not to be very fleshed out and largely unfulfilling.			"

												Interesting concept, but the turn-based combat is much to slow-paced, and for turn-based it also feels as if there are not enough tactical options. Also, battles feel pretty tough - easy to win, but hard not to lose some of your heroes.Maybe worth a try if you get it on sale, and really enjoy turn based skirmish type games, with some fresh long-term strategic elements (that are replacing the typical RPG-like story here).Still... too slow for me to really recommend it, as the ""generation management"" concept can't really carry the game on its own. I much preferred e.g. Shadowrun as tactical turn-based game.			"

												Massive Chalice puts you in command of a kingdom to watch over for 300 years.  It features turn-based combat as the core component.  It also has a kingdom building and unit management aspect to it.  The most interesting concept is the breeding system I'll go into more detail so you can see if this is worth picking up.Combat: The core game play is centered around combat, unfortunately it is a poor execution when compared to X-Com, Fire Emblem, Heroes of Might and Magic or any other turn based game I can think of.  Very rapidly I found myself feeling bored of the bland combat system which is littered with issues.  Your ranged units also happen to be your best scouts, which means you will be moving them around ahead of your melee units often enough.  I assume you can breed some of these scoutlike qualitys later on into the melee units (didn't play enough to find out), but as a baseline it feels horrible.  There is no reasonable cover system in the game and it's somewhat difficult to be sure weither or not your units are within line of sight with the enemy.  It leads to a gameplay style that is sluggish, wherein you are moving very slowly and eventually setting up for a turn where you can destroy all the enemies within a specific area or suffer the consequences of a nearly non-existant cover system.Kingdom Map: The meta of the game revolves around triage, as periodically two zones within your kingdom will be attacked at which point you must choose which to defend.  If you neglect to defend an area to much, then it goes bye bye.  This is a cool concept and one of the better aspects of the game in my opinion.  A lot could have been done to make this screen more interesting, as a fair amount of your time will be spent looking at it, but in general I give it a pass. Research & Building: You will have the option to develop your kingdom by building structures and finding new units, or you can research new technology and combat upgrades.  You can only choose to upgrade one thing at a time, which will take years of gametime (300 year span remember).Breeding & Unit management: A big focus of the game is on breeding new units.  All of your units will have perks or problems which can effect them in a number of ways.  You can assign units to breed or to help the kingdom in other ways, but once you do they will be stuck there until death.  There are 3 basic unit types: A melee tanky unit,  A roguelike unit that can throw flasks (bombs) and a ranged hunter unit.  Crossbreeding the units will make offspring that have mixxed characteristics of both classes. It becomes a question of who should you choose to breed together.  The big issue I have with the the units is that they simply grow old and die to rapidly for you to really care about them at all.  You will only ever use a unit in battle 3-4 times.  So you tend not to give a damn about their traits and stats all that much, it's just to much to keep track of when you know they are going to be dead soon anyway.Final Thoughts: Sadly the core game play just isn't there, if it was I would be interested in the game, but when the thing that should be the most compelling in your game is the most tedius there is a problem.  I almost wish they would have focused soley on everything you do outside of combat, then the game might be interesting... fun even.  As it stands though I can't recommend Massive Chalice, and with so many cool ideas I just wish it was executed better.			"

												Release edit: Don'y buy another Double Fine game.EDIT: It's kinda ded and buggy. Just wait till it comes out of EA. I have an unredeemed copy of the game if anyone is interested in trying it out.I thoroughly enjoy this game in its early phase. I'm also a backer on kickstarter. I'll tell you why. Graphics The art direction of this game is great. I'm not sure if ""low poly"" is the correct term but it's very clean and refreshing. All of the visual elements work well and complement each other. It helps that the creatures are so distinct from each other. Shadows and colors really pop.While characters are somewhat devoid of expression due to the style, I feel attachment to them. The postures and animations in battle and outside have character.The game is hardly graphic intensive but makes up for it with a beautifully rendered art style that is reminiscent of a painting. Gameplay It feels a lot like a streamlined xcom, and I mean that in a good sense. Combat is pure turnbased-- you have the choice of movement, attack, offensive abilities, defensive abilities, and utility. Positioning is really important; you need to anticipate the enemy's turn based on your knowledge of their moveset and movement speed.Part of the metagame is in constructing buildings and making decisions of where to place your nonhero characters. You appoint regents, standards, and sagewrights all call for certain attributes. Every time I appoint a new regent I have to deal with the dilemma of appointing someone who would make a good hero. If I make him or her regent, I increase the chance of passing on favorable traits to the bloodline. But I also lose a potential hero.Buildings matter as well. Currently I tend to place 3-4 keeps near the Chalice, while rushing Crucibles which help your trainees gain experience faster.The three classes in this game are Hunter (ranged/dps), Caberjack (melee/stun/tank), and Alchemist (mage/utility/aoe). I've gone through the entire game with two keeps pumping out Hunters, and one keep Jacks. The other keep I've reserved almost exclusively for nonhero characters or reserve heroes with High intuition and High intelligence. While Alchemists is strong in the right hands, I've found no significant advantage to them over another Hunter in my playstyle.It's a great gameplay experience with enough of both strategic and tactical thinking. Really scratches my itch for a certain type of game. Sound and Narrative I'm grouping these two together because of how intertwined they are. The two forces personified as two voices, male and female are infused into the titular Massive Chalice. From my understanding, they were two great heroes, a Hunter and a Caberjack (if I recall). They are trying to charge up power to fight back the Cadence invasion. I enjoy the background banter between the two during battle and when I'm making important decisions. It was hard getting used to at first, but over time (literally over centuries in the game) I grew accustomed to their voice. I especially like how personal it feels to be addressed. If I'm correct, the player is supposed to be yet another force that guides the kingdom, all the while receiving guidance from the Chalice.Music is great. That much I can say. You'll have to experience it yourself. Combat sounds are also well done. Closing Thoughts Overall, I'm really impressed with how the game is coming along in its Early Phases. I believe since Massive Chalice is DF's main project, the issues with funding like Spacebase DF9 can be avoided.The criticisms I have are as follows. Due note that these are heavily discussed in the DF forum community and consider reviewing the discourse between other users and the development team before coming to a conclusion. Hunters are seriously strong. The Veil armor that makes you go invisible is pretty much all you need for early to midgame dominance Min-maxing seems to be the only way. There isn't much room for error when picking combinations for regents. You need to thoroughly consider the advantages and disadvantages. If you ever have a couple with low accuracy, get ready for a wild ride. It's not a bad thing per se if you like powergaming, but it might turn some people off. The last battle is somewhat lackluster. I won't spoil it. Dialogue gets repeated a lot and it gets tiresome. Hopefully they'll add some more. 9/10 The highest I ever rated an Early Access Game I'll make sure to keep up with the development and add in edits for major updates.EDIT 11/11/14: I'm already beginning to see the expected backlash from upset owners of Spacebase DF9. I was surprised to see Massive Chalice on Early Access so early in development. Currently it's a premium backer alpha. I disagree with their decision to release a game in its alpha stages. Their decision was brought on by some fans who missed out on the kickstarter campaign. With the reputation Early Access has, especially of bad vaporware games that tarnish a truly effective model to support development, it would make more sense to have a Paypal option on their website rather than put it on Steam. That way, if someone who's interested in supporting the game will reach out themselves. Otherwise, they're just going to get bad publicity from people who disagree with the Early Access model.			"

												I just completed the game (Normal Iron mode) and wanted to share my thoughts.The game is often compared to X-COM for its tactical component and therefore criticized for having less depth in this segment. I would say this:- It is less deep (big difference is overwatch), but still deep enough to enjoy.- It is faster! You will handle many encounters upon finishing the game (around 30), so it is a good thing.- The tactical maps are not too varied and rather small. But in the end, it helps making the combat resolution faster as you don't have to seek enemies everywhere.This fast pace suits the game as it focuses on managing generation of heroes.  You want to see how generations evolve and not linger for hours in tactical and wait hours in the management part of the game. So, I think it is sound design here. This is what will make you love or hate the game. You have to consider if it works for you or not if you hesitate purchasing.I still felt attached to some of my heroes (not for so long, at best you play 4 times with them). The fact that they are not long-lived makes it so that you are not punished hard when you lose one. And there is always the next hero to be fond of.The setting/theme of the game is original (never seen elsewhere monsters), the chalice, the generations of heroes makes for a new experience, never played before game. In this day and age of sequels/clones, it was a good surprise.Graphics: Atypical but very clean and I liked them. I loved the fact that the armors/weapons get different looks when research advances. It shows care for details.Music is also very good. The voices are superb.The controls are very well done.The game is really balanced in my opinion. Funnily, I read most people use hunters. I used my alchemists (brewtalists to be exact) so there is more than one way to play  the game. This is positive obviously. Some research options on the weapons open tactics as the abilities offered by the different classes.Is there anything not to like? Well, for me: not really. I just have some regrets though:Sometimes, it is a bit difficult to understand exactly how stats and traits are propagated. Granted, part of the fun is maybe to figure that out.I wished there were better ways to track heroes in the different blood lines. There is a small family tree, but would have liked an overview.I sometimes wished there was the (optional) possibility to customize heroes/Houses. But the Houses out of the box are already very enjoyable.I somehow, want more... So many heroes were 'lost'. You can assign them to research, training, combat or breeding. I wished there were just more to it (more options), more events, leaderboards of heroes and so on... I do realize though that more features could work against the design of a fast paced game with constant choices.Relics were a brilliant idea to have some cross generations element, I wished for more. More logs/relations between heroes.Congratulations to the developers, this is a very unique, well designed, well executed and beautiful game.I will finish with a last comparison with X-COM :the price. Price tags at release were very different. I would dare to say that quality/price, they are a close match, or maybe even Massive Chalice is the winner there.			"

												We'll start with the good parts of the game. First, the monsters. The monsters in the game are varied enough in their appearance and abilities to make them interesting to fight against. One of them steals experience points from characters and can actually drain a level from them, others can wither a character, making them age faster than normal and the sudden appearance of one of them can summon up a feeling of annoyance or dread depending on how close or far they are from your characters. The characters themselves are a mixed bag the classes are determined by the breeding of previous characters who join houses (among other things) to meld two classes into another super class that has aspects of both included in it. Another bonus of the marriages between houses is the parents often pass on good or negative traits to their children like some sort of eugenicists wet dream, characters become super soldiers later on because of their genes/heritage.Despite their status as super soldiers these characters will die, sometimes even without getting into a battle because of how time works in the game, a character who goes into battle at age 20 can possibly die before the next one without any children since people who have a throne are the only ones allowed to make babies. Now on to the bad stuff, if these last few ideas didn't bum you out about character building in this game, some of these will make you less happy.The first bad thing about the characters is they all look exactly the same. They may have different hair styles but their faces are completely without detail and there are only a few different hair cuts in the game so none of the characters look unique. It is also really hard sometimes to distinguish characters from one another due to the way colour schemes work in the game, you take them from the noble heraldry and there aren't that many colours to choose from so inevitably you will have a few different families with the same colours. This is a minor gripe but it is sometimes confusing when you have loner character who you want to stay away from the group and a hive minded person who wants to be buddies with everyone for max effectiveness. A second bad point about the characters is their noble families, you cannot make your own Noble family, the option does not even exist and there is an option at the start of a game to take both ""comedic"" or serious names or only one of the two but the ""comedic"" ones slip in through adoption/recruiting of heroes even if you try to block them out.Lastly, there is no attachment to any of the characters in the entire game due to the shortened lifespan of the character, they might get two or even three battles before they die but then they're gone and you have to send in a few fresh faced goons to fight instead... fresh until the next battle anyway. In some cases half or more of your people are sterile at the beginning of the game which effectively makes them worthless even if they are good at fighting they'll never be able to have kids, all they'll be used for is dying when there's a chance to save someone more important.Moving on, there's the movement of time and the building/research element in the game which I think is absolutely terrible, it's extremely simplified. When time passes it never feels like you have achieved or progressed in any fashion beyond getting new armors or weapons which seems to take forever to do, one final thing I will add is when characters come of age i.e. ready to fight there is no pause function in the game to let you know and setting them up in the combat mission screen is completely clunky and time consuming. I have already beaten to death how characters relate to time so let's skip that part and head straight to the voice acting.The voice acting in this game is extremely annoying, to the point where I don't ever want it to be on. There are a few times when I laughed a bit about what they said but after that it became annoying listening to the stupid warrior woman and the wise archer/alchemist guy talk to each other. A few last topics to talk about are random events and the battles themselves which are intended to be a centerpiece of the game.Random events in this game add a bit of extra flavor to the game but in the end seem designed to♥♥♥♥♥♥you over by killing your characters or taking them away from you for periods of time when you actually need them to go on missions or make babies with other ones. It does make the game a little more interesting but doesn't really add much in the way of changing my opinion of it. Finally, we have the battles themselves. I have to admit that while tactics in the game appear simplistic there are times when you need to think a lot about how you want to move your characters but while the tactics are sometimes deep and interesting the battles themselves do not offer much variation.

												Do not let its quirky art style fool you: MASSIVE CHALICE is a rock solid tactical strategy game that rivals the XCOM series in its quality.The combat starts off simple with just 3 hero types. However you soon discover its depth and variety through hybrid hero classes as well as strategy altering weapon, armour and other loadout choices. The combat may not be revolutionary, but it is by no means disappointing. Note that you will end up altering your team composition numerous times during a single playthrough. Your heroes will die both on the field of battle and from natural causes during the game's 300 year campaign.What really caught me by surprise is the quality of the other side of the game. This is where the MASSIVE CHALICE really shines! When you are not commanding your vanguard of 5 heroes in turn based battles, you manage the kingdom. This involves building castles, researching improvements and managing heroic bloodlines. You are in charge of breeding heroes, filling key vacancies, managing bloodline relics, making decisions during random events and so on. What could have easily come out as tedious filler turned out to be a very compelling and unique contribution to the genre.The quality of this game is further elevated by its excellent soundtrack, voice acting and writing.If you are a fan of the genre, you should give MASSIVE CHALICE a chance. It is much more than just a XCOM clone.			"

												I can definately see why someone would have a hard time getting through this game. MASSIVE CHALICE's gameplay is one part XCOM like stratagy, while the other half is managing dynasties and bloodlines. More of the latter than turn-based combat. The best way for me to describe this game is XCOM fused with Fire Emblem, but  time is critical. Since time does pass, and you will have units that die from old age.This means that you'll not have the same units in each battle, since battles are also years apart. ""Why does time pass so quickly?"", I hear you ask; Well it's because the player is an immortal ruler/protector of a nation, the talking Chalice thing needs to charge up energy to combat some kind of corruption surrounding the nation. So it is your job to make sure they don't get attacked while they're charging up. They need 300 years to do it.So the time mechanic makes it difficult to get attached to units, but I managed to do so anyway. While I am enjoying this game so far, there are problems. More information about how marriage and bloodlines work would've been appreciated instead of ""Oh look we can get more heroes this way!""This game is not for everyone, if you enjoy XCOM and or Fire Emblem you might enjoy this. If you don't find managing dynasties or a kingdom interesting or fun, stick with XCOM.+XCOM like gameplay+Soundtrack+Visuals+Concept+Writing-Lacking explanation for more complex mechanics-Difficulty varies depending on playthrough-Time between battles is too much			"

												This is a game about passing time. Don't get used to your heroes, they will die. If not from wounds in battle, then from old age. Your goal is to create the bloodline of heroes. You have to choose heads of families and their partners so their children become more powerful. And there's a number of factors to consider: genetical traits, experience, character, profession, fertility.From time to time you will face the enemy (mysterious force known as Cadence) in turn based tactical battles. While the battle system may seem simple compared to other games, it's very enjoyable - you must know the skills of our warriors well to survive later battles.Heroes, who gained experience in the battle may later become Regents and parents of new generations. Or Standards, helping to train all those young heroes. Or Sagewrights, discovering new technologies. And the most brave of heroes will have their weapon transcended to the state of family relic, passed from generation to generation.Game has a potential of punishing you for early mistakes. A bloodline may vanquish, if you didn't pay attention to the succession. Your heroes may end up with nasty genetic flaws, if wrong parents were selected. Your lands may be consumed by the Cadence, if you've chosen your battles poorly. While I really enjoyed it (and I find myself being a player who rather dislikes games when I don't see the results of my actions soon after they happen), I see why some people find the game being repetive. I think it's important what you expect. Don't expect XCOM.			"

												5/10 - A fusion of proven gameplay elements, sadly artificially drawn in length.Birth. War. Death. Thats what Massive Chalice is all about. As an eternal being that reigns a kingdom, overrun by some blighty demon-creatures, your mission is to build heritages of fighters to save your kingdom and rule over a limited amount of RNG text-events. As you progress several hundert years will pass. Childrens will be born, elders will die after training the young, or in combat. In the end if you manage to get there you will have to defend the last stance and then... What sounds like a simulation with a nice storyline, a soothing atmosphere and innovative edgy graphics, well, is really just that. But after the 12th fight against slightly more evolved versions of the same enemies and the third time you send someone into exile because he wanted to eat a baby... it gets quite painfull. The character you trained on a high level in the last fight dies 2 seconds after your success... because he got old... repeatetive... So the gameplay and the mechanics are totaly amazing for, like, an hour. And so is the storyline. Because one playtrough seems like a whole life in realtime, it gets annoying after a while. But still, it is a innovative game with a mixture of genre-crossing elements.Gameplay - 4/10Atmosphere - 7/10Storytelling - 3/10Graphics - 7/10Playtime - 4/10Total: 5/10 - Close to the edge of a negative rating, the game still has its charm. Consider buying it in a sale.			"

												Massive Chalice is a game that is great fun to play. It is a juggling act of strategy and tactics with turn based combat and a smitereen of 'arranged marriage' genetic chaos thrown into it for the hells and giggles. The aim of the game is relatively simple; you have to survive for 300 years. Surviving in this context means that you need to keep the kingdom aflorat and not allow the cadence to take over the world. 300 years is a long time though and people die...and unlike many games, death is permanent. This in turn means you need a steady stream of hero's to throw into battle; hence the arranged marriage breeding program.There are many things the game does well; the concept is absolutely brilliant and kept me entertained for hours and hours at a time, the combat is like a game of chess with different classes of fighter and different enemies to work against. Some attack from afar, some age your incredibly mortal fighters further, some leave acid like residue on the ground when they die that will burn you to stand in. The breeding aspect of the game is a really interesting inclusion and creates an additional layer of juggling because bad traits get passed down; and so your rabbit like family could easily be passing down bad hearts and eyesight to the next generation of archers. That could well be your undoing in fifty years time.There are however some things that could be improved; the building strategy aspects of the game are thin at best and you are limited very heavily in what you can build which gets rather boring. Instead of two options this could have been expanded to include farms, schools, hospitals... you name it! More classes would also be a benefit to the game because although you have three base classes that can be bred together for a mix class, this still gets a little stale when you are twenty hours in or so.All in all though, I recommend this game; it requires significant thought and actually makes you engage with what you are doing. It can be incredibly frustrating however, particularly if you lose a fighter in battle and you lose them forever. Juggling upgrades versus new buildings versus new breeding stock can become rather a tight act to manage!			"

												If you're like me, and you like a (relatively) easy strategy game with an engaging story and characters, this really isn't it. If you're not like me, and you're a heretofore unknown deity of strategy games, then you probably don't care what a puny mortal like me has to say anyway. With that being said, I tend to play most strategy games on what I like to call, ""lil' ♥♥♥♥♥ mode"" because while I'm terrible at strategy, sometimes it's just fun to manage a group of characters. What can I say? I like playing god.When I started the game, it hit most of my buttons. Pretty art, cool game mechanic (bloodline management), interesting premise, snarky narrators...And the combat was fun. I even enjoyed the research, although it did get kind of boring after a while. But I was pretty attached to a couple of my bloodlines so I kept going. Then, the Chalice started suffering from dementia, because they'd repeat themselves. Over and over and over. Apparently, the dementia was contagious, because the Cadence seemed to catch it and kept attacking the same three sectors. And the random events. My god. I was more scared of them than I was of the Cadence, because while I had a 33.3% chance of an OK outcome, the other two outcomes were invariably bad and terrible, so I actually had a 66.6% chance of one of my heros dying or getting maimed each time. Hm. Despite the Chalice's mental health issues, I soldiered on and made it to the halfway point. I felt pretty accomplished. I'd been beating back the Cadence, my keeps were doing well, research was progressing, and then the fire nation attacked the Sagewright's guild got attacked. And what do I see when I get in there? Advanced Bulwarks. 5 of them. Surrounding my heros. Who all died. I think it only took about 6 turns. Well ok. Maybe I deserved that after all my successes thus far. Maybe my next battle will go better. Actually, the next battle was less  ""I should be careful so I don't lose any heros"" and more ""Jesus  H. rollerblading christ i finally killed a bulwark after getting acid all over me from the rupture I missed and now there's 5 more bulwaks, 6 lapses and another rupture?!"" Needless to say, it was every hero for themselves after that.  Billy-bob over there who failed to hit the broadside of a bulwark when it was three squares away and dead ahead? Sorry dude. You're going to be rupture bait while the rest of my hunters nope on out with their veil armor.TL;DR: It's pretty, bloodline management is cool, and it's really fun for the first half when you can actually kick some♥♥♥♥♥ Said♥♥♥♥♥kickery makes up for the repeat dialogue, the extremely slow pace of gameplay, and the god-awful, weighted-against-you (66.6% chance that your day is about to suck, remember?) random events. In the second half of your game, when you're just throwing your heros at the Cadence meat-grinder, the previously bearable annoyances become more like unbearable, i'm-going-to-throw-something-through-the-monitor-if-I-hear-that-line-one-more-time annoyances. Overall, I don't really recommend it, although I wish there was a ""meh"" button. if it's deeply discounted or part of a bundle, give it a go, but don't pay full price for it.			"

												At first glance, this game has a few iteresting concepts:- long game length (300 years) with your heroes being born, raised, send to fight (or some other work) and then dieing from old age (unless they die in fight),- you decide who will marry who, creating bloodlines that can span through full length of game,- all enemies (at least those encountered by me so far) have some kind of a twist - seeds suck your life, lapses attacks make heroes lose XP, bulwarks are ranged enemy that will shield itself for one turn after getting hit etc.- you either build or research stuff,- you have to permently send some of your heroes to different kind of duty (like research or training others, having children. and stats and level matters, so you can't send anyone).I liked some of this concepts and decided to give this game a try despite not-so-good reviews.In my opinion game fails at execution or concepts look good only on paper.HeroesIn theory your heroes have everything to make them really interesting: they have traits, that they can pass on to their children, personality that makes them bit unique (both traits and personality give bonus/penalties to stats or some other effects). Their looks and age related status effect changes as years pass. They look different from each other. There are 3 base classes but you can mix partners from different classes so they will train heroes with new classes. There is a simple skill tree with choices to make and skills to choose every few levels. Some of traits even require you to remember them (like trait Optimistic that changes displayed hit chances).It seems it should be pretty easy to like them, to have your favorite champion, to remember them.In practice they often take part only in 2-3 battles. You have to sacrafice the best and send them to have children or something. After 5 hours of playing I still had no different loudout to give them.  And they die way too fast. I found it hard to care about them. Enemies permanently damaging your heroes are also not nice. (if you care about your heroes)I really liked having my favorite soldiers in Enemy Unknow (with was IMHO inspiration for few things in this game). Getting them slowly maxed out, giving them medals, changing looks. Here your 'heroes' are just cannon fodder - if you start liking one, he will probably die of old age before next battle. Perhaps concept is bad or perhaps this could be done with different time scaling (so you lead your heroes in 7-10 battles instead of 2-3) and with better recognition of their accomplishments (hall of fame or sth). Tactical gameplayBattles are turn based. They start with your squad at one point and enemies spread out on map. Map is flat (AFAIK), but contains destructible elements that can be used against your enemy or against you (for example giant berries exploding with aoe after getting hit). Your only goal is to kill all enemies (at least in 5 hours I didn't have any mission with different goal or some kind of a twist). There are 3 base classes. Hunters with crossbow, alchemists with melee attacks and limited number of thrown aoe grenade like flasks and caberjacks using big logs as melee weapons. In 5 hours of gameplay I haven't seen new kind of weapon or mixed class that would make big difference.Battles weren't very exciting. Enemies don't seem to look for you and have pretty predictible AI. It's nice though that there is some form of stealth that you can use. Perhaps on higher levels, with heroes having more than 2-3 skills, it gets more interesting and deeper. I don't know and in fact I no longer care - 5 hours of gameplay is more than enough for a game to start being interesting.Oh, and your heroes have stats that tutorial didn't care to explain. Mouse over didn't help me too. For example I actually don't know if low-dexterity alchemist will have problems with aiming flasks or not (perhaps intelligence is required for this class or perhaps not). It's really stupid, because this game doesn't havy any complex mechanics that would be hard to explain, so it means that devs were... lazy? not aware that their game ideas are not obvious to everyone?Strategical gameplayHere you research stuff (including building... since building is part of research in this game). You assign heroes to buildings (regent and his/her partner to a keep - they will have children and train them, sagewriters to their guilds - they speed up research and Standards to crubicle - they will speed up trainging globally). You can also start timeskip that will stop on important events (death of hero assigned to a building or enemy attack).During first 100 years all attacks looked the same. 2 regions are attacked. You can see what kind of enemies you will face and what reward you will get for victory. You can react only in one region. All regions have corruption meter, if it fills completly, you lose the region (successful defence lowers corruption, successful attack of enemy increases corruption).There are some interesting choices to make. Should I make my highest level hero a regent so he can train his children to higher level (before they will leave to serve the country)? Should I 'retire' my old hero as a sagewriter or as a standard? What traits I should look for to create interesting bloodline?Those decision seem somehow less important though when you don't care about losing your heroes and when you are not sure what different stats mean.SummaryThis game is an interesting concept with big problems in execution. It creates heroes for you to bound with and then adds mechanics that make it hard and that punish you for having a bound with them.			"

												I really want to like this time game - the concept really caught my attention and the movie was enticing.  But this game has so many mechanics that suck the fun out of it and it really prevents me from recommending it.Allow me to elaborate.TLDR;  great idea, poor execution.To start, the game is set up such that has the enemies will attack every 10-20 or so years.  This is otherwise fine except that time affects your heroes - they will age and they will die. This mechanic poses the greatest challenge to the game.   Essentially, the game ceased to be a turn based tactics game and instead gets overwhelmed in favor of, ""let's pray to the RNG gods and hope we have the elements we need to continue playing the game"".The primary challenge of the game is maintaining a set of troops that will be ready to fight the enemy threat when they appear.  You can't rely on the same ssquad you had before because your heroes eventually age (lose stats) and die.  Throughout the game, you'll assuredly be going through new set of troops every 1 or 2 of these enemy waves.To maintain a standing vanguard, you need to build keeps to preserve the blood line for the next generation of heroes.  But instead of being a mechanic that helps you, that adds a layer of problems - your heroes can have bad traits that make them undesirable to sire the next generation.  Not having enough of the right gender, the heroes could be infertile, random events cause their heirs to become unusable and other random events cause you to lose the heroes that you've painstakingly prepared.  Heroes are also needed to become sages, do little side quests that have the possibility of taking away from your pool of available heroes when enemies attack.Additionally, maintaining 1 keep isn't enough as the developers have thoughtfully disallowed inbreeding.  This means a minimum of 2 keeps are needed.  Which means another 2 heroes that you have will have to be be removed from your standing reserves - and yet another set of problems that comes with it.Aside from these balance issues, AI is fairly weak, and missions don't require much thought.  Overall, it really feels like a pale reproduction of X-Com.  At this time, X-Com 2 is due to come out soon, and I would recommend you save your money and buy that instead.			"

A modest amount of strategy to be found despite the simple gameplay formula.Having encountered Double Fine Productions previous work, I was curious to see what Massive Chalice would be like, since it seemed different from their Adventure games.  What I found was a fun but undeniably repetitive & somewhat limited experience.  It got a bit old about halfway through, but I still enjoyed it through to the end.This indie game is stylish but surprised me a bit by being unexpectedly barebones.  It boils down to two things:  Achieving victory in turn based combat scenarios which pop up at regular intervals until the timeline finishes.  Ensuring your heroes are numerous and effective enough to accomplish that task through wise (optimized) choices in which structures you build (& where), the order in which you research technologies & who you appoint to each office (researchers, trainers, breeders, combatants).The turn based combat feels slow, just not quite fast enough; there is a slight delay between your input and action executions.  It feels especially sluggish given how simple combat is once you get the hang of it.  The AI should take less time to complete its turn, the input delays shouldn't be there & all actions/animations should be sped up slightly.It's extremely helpful during combat to advance slowly & uncover enemy units carefully, as in almost any game of this genre.  Coming away from combat with a flawless victory ensures your precious few heroes are preserved for any number of uses, most of all being able to fight when the Cadence inevitably comes again.There are some interesting features tied to the combat, but their implementation leaves something to be desired.  Your heroes can actually lose experience and/or gain years of age upon taking damage from certain Cadence monsters.  In my opinion though, the way things are set up here represents poor design choice, despite that it incorporates one of the unique mechanics (hero aging & death) of the game.  For example, Caberjacks & any of their hybrid classes seem like natural frontline fighters & tanks, but using them is entirely discouraged by the mechanics since they are melee range units; to be close enough to attack, they have to be exposed to taking hits on the next turn.  There's a serious class imbalance here given how easy it is for the player to stack a party heavy on ranged damage dealers, especially the area of effect specialist (Alchemist).  Note: I'm speaking about the lowest difficulty setting (Normal) here, and did not play much past my first complete playthrough - things could be different at higher settings, I don't know & didn't bother finding out.  There is in fact an item you can research & equip to protect against the XP loss / age gain, but it's not available until at least mid game and honestly not a brilliant choice considering the opportunity cost of other researches.  Better (apparently) to go full pew-pew & try never to get hit at all.Further barriers to party diversity include the method for acquiring new heroes.  Marrying two heroes from separate houses & installing them into a keep guarantees they have children who grow up to form your new generation of warriors, but their class will be a hybrid of the two parents, 100% of the time.  Useful if you wish to stack all one or two class types, a bit obnoxious if youre trying to mix it up.  I'd suggest giving trainees at keeps a chance to become either of their parent's classes in addition to the hybrid option.There is a distinct lack of necessary information on items and abilities.  Research on weapons, armors & items doesn't show actual values of the gear until finished.  Character detail panels only show basic info about RPG elements like statistics, traits & more.  Map tile bonuses don't indicate how much effect they have.Armor research includes a progression from standard to refined then advanced.  There's special research that adapts properties of slain creatures to armor, which is neat, except that this isn't truly an upgrade: annoyingly, special armors replace rather than upgrade Advanced armor, & in the end the specials are a big downgrade from that top tier which makes researching special sets a waste.Outlying tiles on the map are the first to become corrupted, yet they're the only tiles to offer unique bonuses for building on them.  It creates a bit of risk vs. reward strategy in placing your buildings.  When attacks come, they occur on two or three tiles, but you can only defend one tile per incursion.  Each tile has three strikes; successfully defending one region not only prevents an added strike but removes one from that region if it had any before the attack.  Undefended tiles take one strike & at three are lost to the Cadence, along with anything on it.  Being mindful of this makes it possible to utilize the bonuses & prevent any territory loss for quite some time!Dynamic events that require player choice pop up now and again; these are entertaining but seem to lack any rhyme or reason in their outcome - just random chance of a positive, negative or neutral effect.  One of these that I saw seems to be an easter egg that reveals a good bit of the backstory for this game, on how the Chalice was created!  The story itself is very light & in my opinion had an odd ending.There is an autosave but I'd have appreciated a quicksave & quickload.As I said right off the bat, Massive Chalice does offer some strategic play despite the very simple formula of: fight, raise new heroes, research & build, then repeat.  I found myself not just rushing through this cycle but stopping to consider hero personalities, traits, age, class, etcetera, all of which affect who should become the next Sage or Standard, who should marry into which bloodline to produce the best offspring, which heroes to take into combat against certain monsters, and so on.I personally enjoyed the game and do not regret purchasing, but also found it underwhelming based on my expectations.  For that reason I give this a thumbs up but with the big caveat that you should take a close look before buying & decide whether or not it's for you.			"

												This game is just frustrating and to me missing the point of Xcom or maybe I do. I wanted to love this but I can't.What I don't like:1) Just 4 enemy types - understandable considering the KSer budget - however 3 of the 4 are jerks.2) One of the enemies drains xp with each attack (lapses), look my boys are all going to die, that creates even a less chance I have that cool badass. And seriously that was the best monster concept a monster that drains xp? bah. Mind you some heroes start out in their 30-50's they aren't long for this world as it is. Now you finally get level 2 and one hit and you are back to level 1. Bah I say, that is frustrating just to be frustrating.3) Next monster runs up and explodes beside you, That's cool. However not only do I take immediate hp damage and armor damge. I also take damge again before the enemy turn is up because I am still standing in the corrosive goo. I am not even given the opportunity to get out of the goo first. If I choose to stay in the goo, fine hit me again but at least give me the option of getting out of the goo. 4) The research/buildings system is frustating. You have to choose either to build or to research new things and this takes serious amounts of in game time. The first keep is roughly 10 years of the game. That is so you can have 2 families producing new heroes. Which you will need, at least I feel you need that. While you are building your new keep you can't recruit new heroes, you can't research new tech, you can't do anything but wait. 5) For my stupid minor gripe I have to say the intro was just annoying. I have no clue what was going on. For the better part of a minute, half the screen lit up, then the other half. Illuminating the chalice, but no words on screen no nothing. And then you have the main menu page.6) Another stupid minor gripe that is probably more me not understaning what to do but I found annoying. One of the tutorial tips said that buy building buildings on the fringe that corruption would be decreated. I built a keep on the outer rim that had 2 points of corruption and it still had 2 points of corruption. meh.Things I like:1) I like how combining different regents with different classes gives you new advanced classes. That is super cool but I never really got far enough to see the really neat stuff. 2) I like trying to combine linages to make new interesting heroes.3) I liked how the outer realms gave bonus's but were constantly under siege. You risked a lot by building Keeps/buildings out on the fringes.This game has some super neat concepts that I think with the right amount of time and budget would become genre definning. As it stands the game feels half complete and unbalanced. I cannot reccommend this game no matter how much I would love to.			"

												These are mostly my first impressions but i can already tell that this game is not for me.The game is kind of like x-com but a very very simplistic version of it.It has some nice ideas. Like having two of your heroes marry to create childeren.The art style is really nice. I love it. The main reason i don't like it is because it's just so simple. I like complex games. "

												Absolutely enthralling, addicting turn-based strategy RPG. A little difficult to get the hang of, XCOM players should have an easier time of it; and perfectionists like me can slave over this game for hours creating the perfect army. The dialogue is hilariously wicked and the voice actor who played Loghain in the Dragon Age series is of the two narrators.			"

												What do you get when you combine the bloodline system from Crusader Kings 2 and the combat system from X-COM?...Massive Chalice.Admittedly, MC does not take either system to quite the same levels. It is a very fun game, however. There's plenty of game time here as well; I finished the Normal campaign in roughly 12 hours, and there is plenty opportunity to replay the game at a higher difficulty and/or with the classic ironman mode which overwites your saves as you make decisions!And decisions are very important, and can have lasting effects. A series of bad decisions on my part led to one of my houses dying out because I had no fertile children left (I accidentally got all the fertile family members killed. Oops.) This led me to resort to inbreeding in another house for several years, and yes, that does seem to devolve your once-noble house into a set of dimwitted, short-sighted idiots.You will make lasting mistakes - particularly on your first playthrough - but it's overcoming and correcting these mistakes that make the game so memorable.

												Tried the game because I heard it compared to XCom, thus far not impressed. I’ve seen no cover mechanic to speak of which was a huge part of XCom. The game also lacks the sense of urgency that XCom had. In XCom you are doing multiple missions over days (game time) whereas apparently events of interest are years apart in Chalice. Finally I’m not in love with the aesthetics as none of the art, music or storyline grab me.Not recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								As of v0.85:Massive Chalice is a curious mix of XCOM and Banner Saga mechanics with just enough unique innovations to make it stand out.If you enjoy good turn-based strategy combat and survival resource management - this game is probably for you.Not only you have to fend off Cadence in pretty hard battles, you also need to manage your heroes bloodlines. Since your heroes are going to age and die eventually, there must be someone to take their place. Like their children.Dead heroes can pass unique artifacts to their children, which can be very powerful on a field.Older and more experienced heroes can be used to teach younger ones, as well as to speed your research up.All of that adds up to a pretty nice and unique gameplay experience.And there's not too much of a downsides either - game is very well balanced, has quite a lot of content and feels solid overall.It does still have a few bugs and performance issues, but I guess that was the reason for going Early Access here.More detailed look in the video:

												Basic in nature and not very well balanced, this is the kind of game which gets randomly nerfed to address difficulty issues. The idea behind it is well thought. You select five houses from which to craft bloodlines over several hundred years, research and build fortifications to defend swats of land and train heroes to execute your will. Unfortunately the execution is lacking. The tactical turn-base battles are just not very challenging. The game play lacks interaction with its environment. The bloodline crafting is a great idea, except the game always throws cancerous inbreds at you with very little value and the goal quickly becomes an exercise in finding good couples to match and preserve whatever rare dominant characteristic they might have. This is such a restless activity that whatever is left to explore from the research and building systems become secondary at best. You may find yourself restarting games more than actually playing just because of this.Massive Chalice may become better, if there's ever any will to fix its unbalances, but for now its only a good purchase in the 5$ and below range. This is a game I'm uncertain whether I'll ever bother finishing.			"

												The game has way too much randomness, and you are not guaranteed anything.  The bonuses you get on the outlying terrorities is random.  The random events have negative consequences that you have no way of avoiding.  The heroes that get thrown into the first battle are random, meaning it's a wasted battle.  The starting traits of your heroes are random, and too many of them are cripplingly bad.  You can easily start out with nothing like a workable team.  I hear somebody out there saying this randomness means replayability.  No, it means you get screwed even when you didn't do anything wrong.  Apparently some people have an appetite for this abuse, but I don't.			"

Posted: July 17, 2015
												I don't normally do reviews, so I will keep this brief.This game is the start of something great. In massive chalice I see the seeds of the game which any warhammer/game of thrones/lord of the rings fan could love and harbor as a true classic. I will cover these seeds below.- You are the immortal blood emperor of what remains of mankind, thats awesome!- You command aging, powerful heroes to save the world agains TEH DERKNESS!- You have immense magical powers, and total Dictator level control of your kingdom, as well as two hilarious advisors.- You get to create noble houses and powerful blood lines who become more epic as time goes on, asigning them to the roles that will determine their lives. - There are events which occur while ""sleep"" that prompt your waking which are not enemy attacks, such as hero fueds and such.All that said, there are some other things that keep this game in ther ""seed"" stage, as opposed to the actual dream game we all want. I will list these below.- The game tries to be silly and serious at the same time, sprinkling bits of a serious plot amidst two bickering magical halves a big♥♥♥♥♥cup (Guess which), heroes who range from silly to insane (not the good kind), and in general a lot stuff which broke me out of my epic role and screwed with my immersion.- NO HOUSE POLITICS. Heroes and the noble blood lines and houses are completely loyal...maybe to loyal. Outside of events which are personal to individual heroes, and which may not occur at all, they never fight amongst themselves and never seem to be ""alive"". Though some of my heroes had some epicness tied to them. it required a lot of imagination on my part.- No armies at all. Just the heroes and stuff. The humans, outside the usurper queen when she appears, are pretty bent on obeying you and doing nothing else, so you never need to use them, since monsters are not fought with armies in this game. Hard to feel like an Emperor without armies or politics. - Not enough effect from events, not enough customization. I love my first playthrough, but sadly, the second playthrough was nearly identical to the first. I can't customize my heroes appearances very much, nor can I alter the appearance of...almost anything at all aside from placing buildings. And that is far from satisfying my builders craving.- Lack of enemy units and type of attacks. To keep it short, there are not enough of them. The ones we have are great and unique and do require a stratigic approach (Wrinklers and lapses anyone?) to properly enegage, but the fact stands that there are not very many of them.- Ending is a blueballs spectacular.There is a lot more I could say about the game, but like I said, I want to keep this brief (Failing). So why did I rate this thumbs up? Because I had fun playing it, and if they built on this and released a sequal, I would buy it in a heart beat. I want to support progress towards a game we all want.This was not the game we deserved, but it was the game we needed (In order to get the game we deserve).			"

												In the beginning I have to say that I haven't played many strategy RPG games in fact it's one of my least favorite genres and Massive Chalice is the 2nd game of this genre that I have completed and I totally loved it.In the beginning of the game you get introduced to the Massive Chalice which is a giant talking cup of water. It has the voice of a man and a woman which will keep talking to you and to each other throughout the game. The Chalice will tell you that it has the power to defeat the cadence which are monsters who attack your kingdom for a reason that nobody knows. In order for the chalice to cleanse the land from the cadence it has to charge it's power and it'll take 300 years for it to charge and for this to work you need to defend your land till the chalice is fully charged. Sadly; after you get introduced to this you are left alone and you will not learn anything about anything until you finish the game which is drastically hurts the game as it would've appealed to more players if it was lore rich.the most important part of the game is the regions management. There you will chose what your nation should be focusing on in the upcoming year, building keeps and breed new heroes and so on. You decide what to do and advance time to see the effect of your decisions, it's like a relaxing meditative time between battles. The breeding system is neat and interesting. It is like an eugenic simulator, If you chose a husband and wife with positive treats and personalities you'll get a generation of reliable combatants, if you do the opposite; you'll wonder why your heroes are missing 80% of the shots. I totally wasn't focusing on breeding in the first 12 hours of the game and I ended with generations and generations with useless hunter. I've been in a situation where I had 4 hunters in a battle and they all missed a point blank shot at single Seed which is the weakest enemy in the game. After getting back and adjusting my marriages the game became way much easier so deciding who should marry who is a key to success in this game. Also there are much other details in the breeding system that'll take a long time to write so I'll stop here.The combat part of the game is good. Maps are good looking (even though that it would've been much better if it was procedurally generated) enemies are well designed and to each his own specialty and they become really threatening at times especially when you make a big mistake or miss an important shot.The soundtrack is perfect. It's not a one that you'll buy and listen to but it perfectly fits the mood of the game. It was composed by Finishing Move Inc who worked on many other projects like Halo and Mad Max: Fury Road. The voice acting is great, well; it's a Double Fine game so it has to be.Throughout the game you'll see regions getting corrupted, babies being born and old heroes die of old age or heart diseas. It is sentimental in the beginning but you get used to it over time. In my first 5 hours of the game I was in a position where I had a really good female hero, She died at the age 64, she had a relic which is a crossbow that she inherited it from her mother so the relic must be passed to someone from her bloodline but she had no brothers or sisters nor sons and therefore her powerful relic must be broken and put inside the chalice and this hero and her relic will be forgotten forever. This was a sad gaming moment for me that I rarely found in other games.I can write a hundred line review about Massive Chalice and it'll still has more to be written about. It's one of these games that you can enjoy but you can't blame other players if they hate it because it has some downs that may get some players off like random events or the accuracy that does not get affected by how far is the target from shooting position. I can never say that Massive Chalice is not a good enough game, yes it can be better but I can take it in this current state. Go and try it for yourself, if you did not enjoy it then at least you'll get an experience that is more unique than many other games.And Double Fine...please reforge the chalice			"

												LOVE this game. Very simple and intuitive to get into. I felt that the story/voive-acting/atmosphere and art direction were all spectacularly well-done, they all really worked to get me hooked. Combat follows the same format as all other turn based games out there, however with a few great tweaks. The enemies (especially when you take into account some of their special abilities) are some of the most creative and strategically challenging that I've ever come across; have a really awesome hero careful not to get hit by a Wrinkler and have them aged drastically, or risk some damage to age a young novice into his prime. One of the things I had no idea I'd enjoy so much was matching partners together. Ensuring a houses' legacy via their lineage has never been so addictive. I found myself being painstakingly picky about who married who as I tried to ensure that I had the best crop of children coming from my houses. I wish there was a bit more control here as the attributes seem to be mostly random and some of the negative traits can be a little annoying and aren't able to be reversed, it adds to the games challenge and I don't see it as a flaw of the game at all, I just wish I had more control in grooming my heroes into potent killing machines. Having played the game for about 20 hours so far and only just beaten my first campaign (although I did restart a few times because as I learned more about the game I wanted to go back and fix the things I didn't know about before), but I still feel like I don't have a full handle on everything the game has to offer or what the best way to play is. I will definitely be returning to try it all over again in the future.PLAY THIS GAME.9/10			"

Basically you play a light form of civilization, mixed with turn-based tactical combat, mixed with a breeding simulator, mixed with rpg elements. I do enjoy it, and replay is decent due to the attempt to maximize your hero stock. If it looks fun or interesting, get it, it won't dissapoint.			"

												Massively underrated.The game looks striking with a very lean and clean outlook and it's very focused. Tactical elements develop the more you play with new enemies and new skills and gear becoming available. The strategic layer will force you to make tough choices and face the consequences of these decisions. It's a blend of tactical combat, choose your own adventure game and hero breeding and the only real drawback is that there is no way to design your own Houses in game (you have to pick from lists).Last but not least the soundtrack is amazing.

												In short: Messy UI, boring gameplay, strange wrapping. Has some core ideas wich are really good. Could make a good sequel. UI: To many animations, roll over effects, and non intuitive menues. Feels like navigating a webpage that keeps refreshing on your phone. Why is there half a second of black when changing between menus, IN ADDITION to the constant zooming in and out animations?! And there is a serious lack of information where you need it. When you are selectign the heroes, you can see the traits but not what they mean. So you have to go out of the menu you are using, back to the main map and then into another manu if you wonder what the trait means. Here it would actually be usefull with a roll over effect. Graphics: They went with a very unique style. I like it. I wish the units would look more different though. They are very bland. Story: For me the story was marred by the ""comedy"" of the narrators. Bad jokes that are intended to be ""so bad it's good"", but failes. And this is the serious setting! I shudder just to think what the ""funny"" setting is like. Gameplay: I compare the combat to Xcom: Enemy unknown, and it's very basic compared to this. The animations and game mecanics makes it feel old and repetetive really fast. The selling point of the game is the familiy mecanic. You ""breed"" your soliders/heroes on the traits (wich are hard to fint the effect of, as mentioned). But the UI is so cluttered and cimbersome, so I never felt anything for the different dynasties. Great idea, but it is not shining in this installment. The same idea is found in Crusdaer Kings, but effevted so, so much better.			"

												I'll confess that I never did get the whole 'Massive Chalice' thing.When I explain this game to people, I breeze pass the name, cop to the presence of a big stupid cup and go on to tell them that it's a fun turn-based tactical combat game, matched with am even better eugenics simulator.The mixing and matching of various heroes provides a wide-variety of blended character classes derived from the basic Alchemist, Caberjack and Hunter (the Rock, Scissors, Paper of this game) archetypes. But deeper than changing the skills, the joining of bloodlines supplies a variety of Traits that modify heroes in ways ranging from how many babies they're likely to have (and of which gender) to increasing their basic attributes, which is a direct increase in combat damage, to how likely they are to drop dead from a heart attack.Many times I found myself weighing who should marry whom, since characters made heads of households can no longer join in battle. Similarly, building the Sagewright's Guild allows you to permanently retire characters for a reduction to research time for new technologies and nation-wide buffs. Finally, a Crucible structure allows you to retire a single exemplary hero to train the next generation (providing bonus experience points) and shape their attitudes (by imparting Personality on others, a learned version of the Trait system that you breed for in order to create the best heroes). Selecting proper breeding stock and maintaining enough quality heroes to repel an enemy attack can be a challening balancing act.As far as the tactical combat goes, it does not fair so well in comparison with its most obvious inspiration: X-Com. The lack of variation in maps becomes crushingly tedious over even a single playthrough. The small number of enemy units is disappointing, though they are interestingly rendered, looking like enemies unique to this surreal fantasy universe. But the Caberjack and other melee combinations are punished by the enemies' proclivity for stunning, knockbacking, hurting and aging (yes, age attacks are to be feared since you're spending 300 in-game years breeding heroes. You wouldn't want your prize stud going gray before he's had a chance to pass on his swell Traits).Also the lack of any kind of overwatch command and no modifiers because of elevation or posture choices further limit the tactical options. Frequently I found myself wishing for more imaginative gear to research. I wanted items that affected the battlefield or changed the way you fight in more tangible ways than providing simple buffs, healing or immunities (the Skipping Stone being an exception).Since you're cast as an immortal sovereign, shepherding your kingdom in a three hundred year holding action until the Massive Chalice charges up like a Death Star in a pint glass, various conundrums and questions come up along the way. These opportunities to pass judgments often create lasting consequences that take a few years to show themselves. While being simply text and two or three Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style choices, they add a welcome break from the immediacy of tactical combat and the more considered, long term choices in your breeding program. Unfortunately, there don't seem to be nearly enough of these events, with many of them repeating on a second play-through.All in all, I enjoyed the cubist fantasy art and the unique enemies. Though I wanted more from the combat, I still enjoyed it, even if some of the maps sprawl too much for my taste. The eugenics simulator was entertaining, and I enjoyed (at least on the first playthrough) the occasional problems that my subjects would require my judgment on. I wanted a little more from every system in the game, but if you're a fan of turn-based tactical simulators and are willing to explore a fresh take on how one recruits the units for one's army, I recommend trying Massive Chalice... just ignore the premise of the big stupid cup and enjoy the rest.

												I picked Massive Chalice up on sale and while I enjoyed the game, I'm very glad I didn't pay full price for it either. The game starts off fairly quickly giving you a taste of everything. It quickly abandons you as you start to progress through the 300 year war. The combat while not extremely challenging or varied is enjoyable throughout your first play through. The random events come semi frequently and offer a lot of possibilities. During my second play through I used the wiki to look at the outcomes just to see the potential of each situation and was pleased by the range and pros and cons of each decision. I found the art style very hit and miss but I can't fault the game nor praise it either. The music was appropriate and enjoyable to listen to while playing but the two ""voices"" of the chalice I found incredibly annoying and within 30 minutes of playing dropped their volume to nothing and used subtitles instead. I had a few issues with Massive Chalice besides the annoyance mentioned above. I was really hoping for more from the eugenics side of this game. It's not often that a concept like this comes up, especially within gaming. I found the pairing / breeding system of the game at best disappointing both in the long and short term game. The 300 year war isn't long enough to selectively breed a really decent army and for the ""hero's"", the best of the population. Undesirable traits seam fairly common. I really thought there would be a lot more depth and variety in the actual game play. Instead of fighting the same 5 or so enemy types on different maps in different combinations and numbers constantly throughout the game. Finally without spoiling anything I found the end of the war to be anticlimactic. I mostly enjoyed my first play through of the game even after restarting about 175 years into the war due to some poor prior planning. My second play through was dull before I had even clicked start, I got to 200 years and stopped because I realised I had not been enjoying it at all. I think Massive Chalice had some great ideas and seamed great from the outside and while enjoyable the first time around, it really didn't deliver what I had expected from the game. If you enjoyed the eugenics side of games like Crusader Kings 2 this game might give you a bit more (but not greatly) of what you are after but besides that, it's a dull game with great ideas and great random events but that's it. Buy it on sale, it's worth $5 at the most. 6.5/10			"

												Maybe this will sound weird, but I find this game very much alike the X-COM game, yet it is also nothing alike it.This is a fantasy game. Lovely artwork. Yet the strategic elements in the battles and the way you build up your ""base"", or in this case, kingdom, reminds me of how X-COM works.Your goal is to defend your kingdom for 300years, and a large part of the manner in which you achieve this goal is by breeding your heroes, your nobels. They make up both your soldiers, but also researchers, trainers and parents of future heroes/soldiers. I get great fun out of trying to fit together in arranged couples those who will pass on the most desired traits to their offspring. Yet at time I have had to pick whomever I had left at said time. You start with three base classes yet breeding toghether different classes can yield new classes.  I have yet to complete my first playthrough but will definitly play though it several times (even as I doubt that I will manage to move from the normal difficulty setting).The management side aside, ever so often your kingdom will get attacked. Often two or three times at once, yet you can only send out one team of heroes. Leaving you at the hard choice of which parts of your land to possibly loose.The battles themselves are as stated before turn based. Enemy difficulty has thus far always felt challanging enough, with a good (yet not overly large) amount of varied opponents. Nothing has felt OP even as there are some leaps in difficulty from time to time.If you like games that are a mix of management and turnbased strategy, then this is really a game for you to try. "

												Interesting concept however badly, badly implemented. The heroes die exceptionally fast, old age, the pox, hell... who knows? A lot of times they just fall over dead out of nowhere. A lot of thought and effort put into the banners, mottos, battle cry, ect, ect. But why the heck bother picking that stuff out or even developing it when it doesn't mean anything at all? Says it is cosmetic, but one of the families I picked out, they all fell over dead before I hit 20 years into the game. Even on Normal the game does not slow this down for you or really give you time to get your teeth sank in before it decides to kill your heroes, your heirs, everyone. This game even allows you to have a 10 year old boy take the throne and then force him to marry a 64 year old women and have babies.... really? Kind of sick if think about it. What did I expect for $4. I'd be so mad if I spent $20 on this....""game.""Here is another example: Special event happens and my hero helps my married lord/lady stay married and get the title silver tongue. Cool! - Little bit of immersion, he is now John ""Silver Tongue"" Doe. Whatever. years later. He dies. Of what? No one freaking knows. He just fell over dead.Combat is a little dry and you can really just about scratch melee from the list. Just throw alchemy bombs and blast them with arrows and you're good to go. As you breed your lords and ladies, you can make hybrid classes which add a little bit of flavor to your vanguard... but if you want to make that new dude, who is all awesome on the battlefield make babies. Guess what? nope! While making babies over years and years; somehow they can no longer protect the realm from the one every 10 year+ attack. How the heck is that? That is right.. awesome guy get no love and dies a horrible random death with nothing to show for it.If the whole program was not so hell bent on turning over generations like an attention deficit disorder pancake flipper, maybe and just maybe this game would be worth some time and money.

												Another example of Double Fine overpromising and underdelivering.  I've yet to meet anyone who has actually finished the campaign.  The gameplay goes from fun and interesting to repetitive and boring after the first hour or so.  The game mechanic quickly steals your favorite characters away from you.The production quality seems high, but the actual game development was sorely lacking.  It's shiny, polished, well voice-acted, and absolutely no fun to play.I remember when Double Fine used to make good games.  What happened to you guys?			"

												(9/10)Tactical hero breeding roguelike!  Thats something you don't see every day.  Obviously you get a combination of xcom like tactical difficulty thrown in with a relatively unique flat polygon heavy 'retro 3d' look which I'm actually quite fond of, mixed up with some rpg elements and a relatively fixed timeline to work against.Yes, this is not going to be the easiest game in the world, and yes you can totally screw yourself  by making a relatively poor choice of family matriarch/patriarch pairings early on and ending up with an entire battle force of dim witted, puny, sickly heroes before you even realize what you've done... but the whole point is to take those lessons and try again to do better the next time.  Replayability is relatively good since you will likley absolutely have to restart the clock a number of times before you really master enough systems to nail everything perfectly.  I also appreciate the game offering you a choice of either 100% serious in-character/genre hero conventions or some lighter hearted, sillier hero names etc.This is not going to be a game for everyone, but if you do like xcom, and more broadly tactical turn based games in general, this is by far one of the most innovative games to come down that genre in years.

												Tedious.The gameplay is very limited in scope on the overworld. Build the occasional building, breed people, pick a new research. The game rarely ventures out of this tedious formula, and the random events are not nearly engaging enough to break the tedium. Once your families become large, it's a huge slog to manage everything.The combat is boring. It's a copy/paste action-point system that any gamer will have played dozens of times before. There's no depth. No initiative, or attacks of opportunity, or tactical depth at all. Enemies are repetitive and combat takes way too long. By the end of the game I was waiting a solid minute for the AI to complete turns. Honestly, I almost quit my game during the final battle because it was taking so long to slog through the turns.This concept needs deeply emergent gameplay to shine, and it simply isn't there. It's a great concept stuck into a mind-numbly standard shell.			"

												I liked the graphics overall and the sound effects in this game quite a lot. But the gameplay is not good.It just feels like the game should have given me more creative freedom on the strategic map, and tighter and more complex mechanics for combat. And certainly, it should have had less repetition and better pacing.To go into some of the worst flaws:On the strategic map, I had to spend almost all my time repeatedly and manually doing the same keep, crucible and vanguard squad management chores. The random factors that are involved just added to the tedium, rather than leading to any particularly interesting choices.And combat is just repetition of very few, simple tactics. Scout, then trivially snipe / bomb / whack with overwhelming force (preferably insta-kills). Rinse and repeat. No enemy ever manages to really break this pattern. Kind-of obviously so, because the game gives you pretty few tactical options either through classes, items or skills.And it's all dragged out with pretty long animations and enemy turns happening, both of which apaprently can't be disabled, and during which you can't even issue further commands.Lots of clicking and waiting, few choices -of which even fewer matter-, little thinking. Not good. And the game really offers little else but graphics and a bit of a thematic flair in return. "

												Right! Completed a campaign on the starting difficulty. I reckon it took about ten hours all told, and at various points I was ♥♥♥♥ing sick of everything but Massive Chalice has some interesting enough points that it's worth discussing.First off: the obvious comparison to make is X-Com. It's the same basic template of a squad of five engaging in turn-based percentage-themed combat with alien-looking-things.  Backing that all up is a world map where events emerge and you react. There's some research where you use alien-looking bodies. There's a timer. Surely just a rip-off? Well......not quite. Let's take a step back: What's the premise? The MASSIVE CHALICE is a superweapon of sorts, charging up to once and for all defeat the dastardly Cadence, a vague orangey blob around the map there that is planning to destroy you and everyone you care about. But it's gonna take a while to charge up - 300 years in fact, so your elite squad is going to be experiencing a lot of change. They've got a fighting lifetime of maybe 50 years if you get lucky, so you don't invest in single supermen, you invest in super-bloodlines.Each of your castles on the map is occupied by heroic families. The Kuan! The Leones! The Aabershots! The Berrys! Heroes all! Keep 'em married and not covered in orange goo and they will provide you with a fine selection of heroes. Then you cross-breed them with special tweezers to try and encourage positive traits to emerge. I mean in theory you do, I just married off people with high fertility so I could get maximum manpower, which led to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ super soldiers indeed.The research you're doing is gradually improving their equipment, both in stats and fancy stuff, and during their short lifetimes, they'll level up themselves and unlock special powers of their own.Basically it is a balancing act, trying to keep the conveyor belt of babies rolling consistently enough that you always have a good enough five-man force to call upon while trying to boost up the long-term bonuses - I've mentioned research but there's also relics which have to be passed down bloodlines, and gain power every time they're used in battle.As long as you make sure to build a few keeps at the start to house your families, minion numbers aren't really an issue, so then it's going to be battles which could be your downfall. Every ten years or so the cadence strikes in 2/3 provinces, and you defend one. Three strikes and they vanish forever.You're inevitably gonna lose something. What you have to do is not lose battles, as that will accelerate the process of loss, and at the difficulty I was on, this wasn't a taxing task either. I lost one battle out of maybe thirty, which meant a lot of those 300 years were boring , waiting for the next fight to emerge so I could get it over with.About 200 years in, I'd unlocked enough stuff, advanced my soldiers enough, and came across bad enough dudes, that the occasional interesting battle slipped in. Everything I've said so far is functional and boring, but let's get in the praise for MASSIVE CHALICE now, which is the diversity of battlefield options.There's Cradles - upside down jellyfish who spit out babies. Roided-out blue guys called Twitchers, who can instantly swap position with anything. Ghostly Lapses, who causes your heroes to forget how to do things. Spiky Ruptures, who only exists to explode, leaving behind damaging sludge puddles. There's also baddies that can only be hit once and go invulnerable (Bulwarks), and baddies who cause your heroes to age years in a single punch (Wrinklers), potentially having them die of old age in the middle of a fight.Your heroes are also pretty damn fragile, which means everything can suddenly go 100% to pot in a moment. So at its best, MASSIVE CHALICE is this little battlefield puzzle, where you have a huge amount of enemies around you that you can't possibly all kill this round, so how do you prioritize? Can you chain-reaction the ruptures? Can you knock some of them into a tree so they get knocked out for a turn? Can you smash up the local flora?In my favourite battle (barring the final showdown which I shall not go into cos I want it to be a surprise if you play it), I found myself against a very large number of bulwarks, who go almost invincible after their first damage instance each turn. I did not have the damage to take out eight of them simultaneously, so I couldn't just start locking and loading as they would ♥♥♥♥ing murder me, but I had invested in some bulwark armour (researched with their corpses), which does exactly the same for your men.So the big men waddle into the centre and absorb the hits and hope they don't run out of health while the alchemist stands at the back lobbing crates of bees at the enemy, which meander around, causing damage to everyone and the hunters prowl around in the shadows looking for pickoffs as the blundering bulwarks try and escape the bees.Later on I got something from the Twitcher corpse research called Skipping Stones, which let you be the one who swaps positions with anything - there's some really inventive things you can do with them, to force enemies onto certain paths, to save people, to drag baddies into range. I kept a guy alive on 1HP for a good ten minutes on the final battle by swapping him all over the shopThe other thing which got better as the game went on was my feeling towards Bloodlines rather than specific heroes. X-Com is all about that one sniper who is the best at killing aliens, and you give him a name and ooh isn't he the best. Whereas with MASSIVE CHALICE, your heroes are going to see at most five battles before they die, so you better get used to them fast. Ultimately - I can barely name anyone who fought for me, but I have a strong recollection of the bloodlines they came from (always rely on the Aabershots) but you're not going to be able to tell the same stories about them.In summary: MASSIVE CHALICE starts off immensely boring, and gradually increases in challenge and options until it becomes interesting. My normal campaign took about ten hours, so it depends whether you have that time to spare.I'm gonna try an ubertough campaign and see if that helps or compounds the issues.Anyway, it's worth a fiver			"

Early Access Review
								DISCLAIMER: early access review (v0.9)*SPOILERS*This game was very fun for the first few hours. It took me three attempts and 22 hours (total) to complete the game on Normal+IRON MAN difficulty.There is very little mob variation and they all have some sort of gimmick to fight through.Seeds: Standard melee mobRuptures: Standard exploding mob. Leaves ooze on the ground that deals damage over time.Lapses: Gimmicky single target ranged mob. Steals experience (more annoying than anything else when your level 10 character keeps dropping to level 9)Bulwarks: Tanky piercing ranged mob. Can only be damaged heavily once per turn.Twitches: Tanky, high damage, melee mob. Knocks back heroes and can swap places with them.Cradles: Ranged mortar / seed spawning mob. Deals high damage and can spawn seeds. Spawns 3 seeds upon death, as well.Wrinkles: Melee medium damage mob. Ages your hero and can instakill older heroes.Learning all of the mechanics and trying to get strong blood lines going for my kingdom was the best part of the game. After a few battles, I quickly grew tired of the combat and just wanted to keep running my nation. Sometimes random ""events"" occur and let you choose a few options. These random events generally result in a negative outcome, most often resulting in you having to throw away a hero or getting negative traits. At first I had started to level up an enforcer army and a few caberjacks, as I really like the idea of a ranged army. However, the caberjack class quickly outshined the other classes because of their immense amounts of crowd control (my end game team comp consisted of 4 caberjacks and 1 shadowjack).Late game combat is REALLY bad. I had 2 caberjacks with the taunt ability, and 2 level 10 caberjacks with relic weapons and kill rage which let me easily kill entire groups of mobs in one turn. Anything not finished off by the level 10's would run stupidly towards my taunters positioned far, far away.I recommend this game. It's fun for $30 but I don't think I'll be playing it again unless:1) More class depth is added2) Researching anything other than weapons/armor/items has a meaningful impact (seriously, by the time you get all of the nation buffs the game is already almost over). In addition to this, it seems impossible to keep ALL of your territory which makes building more than 1 crucible, 1 sagewrights, and 2-4 keeps meaningless.)3) An endless mode is added.			"

												Fine example of taking risks in game play design that paid off.  Loved the art style and simple yet effective UI.  The player is constantly challenged to make tough decisions that have real trade offs and consquences.  And the tactical battles connect back to the strategic layer better than most any game that's attempted it.The player will fight to maintain bloodlines and relics through the 300 years of history leading to the final battle against the cadence.  Will you succeed or fail?  In the end all of your decisions along the way will determine that.			"

								I *love* tactical and strategy RPGs.  Which is why I'm pretty sure this one has some serious issues.  I've spent an hour and a half with it, and I feel absolutely zero compulsion to continue.  The potentially interesting heredity mechanics are broken by the fact that the battles (this could get better as the game progresses, I suppose..) are incredibly tedious and uninteresting.  Three classes with next to no abilities doesn't exactly motivate me to get deep into a game.  Movement and camera interaction is clunky and unpleasant.  Honestly, if you can't get me hooked on your strategy RPG, you've done something incredibly wrong.			"

												A unique, well executed, enjoyable game. I wouldn't call it simple so much as concise. The combat strategy gets more complex as you progress. Once you've had time to level and explore all the class combos, you get a final battle that ends the game. I found that a much more satisfying conclusion than tapering off into the oblivion of infinite turns that plagues so many strategy games.			"

												Unfair AI. The game tries at every angle to make it impossible for you to build a strong base of heroes. The odds of creating good bloodlines is low, maintaining them is even harder because they grow old much too fast too often. Half way through the game, your bloodlines are hardly producing children. The real way you want to setup, is to get 4 Keeps, 3 of these for your classes, and the fourth purely for creating good marriage mates for your Regents.  This is the best way I have figured out to outmaneuver this game mechanic. Still, there are other ways the game will put roadblocks on your progress. It will take your best heroes, and add ""Life Choices"" to them, and by the way, the same answer never always works, and that means your heroes will get bad trait consequences set on them, for example Depression, and Nihilism. So your stuck with poorer heroes churning out low quality heroes. We are not even getting into the battle mechanics, where half way through the game, the monsters start to do crazy things to overwhelm your forces. Sure, its challenging and could be fun except for the fact that they get noticeably stronger and duplicate themselves or make your heroes age with every hit so that they literally die of old age in battle. The combination of these elements did not make frustrated so much as feel like there was no truly rewarding experience for my progress - and that's the problem I have with the game ultimately. It's not a journey that you will take with your empire whereby you made wise and intellgent decisions to give you the edge your deserve, no, its more like an endurance race to the end of the time period where you can finally rest from the onlought of unlucky tribulations you escaped by the skin of your teeth. Like I said, I enjoy challenges, but not when the games AI is making things blatantly unfair.			"

Early Access Review
								TLDR: A solid Strategy Game, that lacks just a bit of content to become one of the classics. 8/10.(Review based on the 0.93 patch, and the current info on future updates)I've been following Massive Chalice for several months now, and I've been active on both the Steam and the DF forums. I decided to put out my review now, since I finally feel like I know what the final product will look like. I've also got 53 hours  of steam game time clocked in, and I'd like to think that I'm now somewhat of a MC veteran.Massive Chalice is a Tactical Strategy game very much in the vein of X-com. You take command of a kingdom beset by corruption called cadence on all sides, and your job is to manage the kingdom's buildings, marriages and research in order to ultimately defeat it. The gameplay is divided into the tactical side, where you command your heroes against the monsters called pawns, and the strategic side where you build, research and manage your heroes as centuries pass and the cadence enroaches on your territory.  I'm gonna go over the game's features from best to worst. Graphics and sound design: Easily the best thing about the game. The Doublefine pedigree really shows here. The game has a certain papercrafty- jaggedy artstyle that is just beautiful. The graphics aren't the most high-fidelity thing in the world, and I don't have the computer to judge them, but the awesome look of the game really makes it stand out from pretty much everything I've played. Not only that, the aestethic is very unique, and the fantasy world is more than just your standard fantasy setting nbr. 2871. You command caberjacks swinging huge logs, Alchemists with clawed slings, and battle in environments ranging from red-white deserts to blue-green swamplands. The voice acting, and music are also a very strong point. The game has a phenomenal soundtrack with some very punchy music, and the voice acting from the two advisors that accompany you through the game is so good it doesn't even get annoying 50 hours into the game. The sound effects are also very appropriate, with each blow, explosion and shot perfectly puctuated, with skitters and screams, and little details like the alchemist's flasks clinking as they run. For the eyes and ears, this game is a treat in this genre. Tactical Gameplay: the combat is really good, as it should be. Instead of an X-com cover system, the game's combat is based around line of sight and positioning. Your group consists of 5 characters that can belong to 9 classes. Enemies can be knocked around the battlefield, stunned and dispatched, and the three main classes have a wide variety of options from Caberjack charges and alchemist flasks to the Hunter's sneaky stealth ability. The enemies start out weak, but suddenly spike up to strong, and then start coming at you in large numbers. Especially in hard, it takes all your wits and skills to make it through each fight, with the reward being the lives of your heroes and stopping the spread of corruption. The biggest weakness in combat, is the variety in enemies. There are 7 in total and each has an advanced form, which give them a re-skin and an added ability. (to be implemented) I think the game could have benefitted from just one or two more Pawn types, because sooner or later in the midgame a certain boredom starts to creep in. Especially in the lower difficulties and when you're doing well. Your maximum level characters are also so powerful that enemies become mere targets. on a successful playthrough, the last few missions tend to be more of a ""clean-up"". Again, this only applies to normal mode. There is also only one mission type discounting the final mission, but the system is designed around it, and there is a rather large ammount of randomization to keep the gameplay interesting. It's not a huge point against the game. Story: Pure and simple. You Chalice, they Cadence, Kill. The atmosphere is great though, thanks to the aforementioned audiovisual design, and there are several events that pop up through the playthrough to give you the bigger picture of the kingdom you're managing. The atmosphere is better than the story. Strategic gameplay: It's mostly a good strategy game. the most unique thing is the Bloodline system. You are given a retinue of heroes each belonging to heroic bloodlines (made by the people who backed this on kickstarter) and marry them together to produce children. The traits, relics and experience all influence the children, and they will grow up to be heroes themselves. The game's campaign lasts 300 years, so heroes don't always stick around for long, but the bloodlines so leave an impression on you. You also manage your kingdom's research and deal with the several random events that keep popping up. The events usually have several options to take, but the outcomes are still randomized, so no matter how many times you've played through it'll be hard to make a ""good"" decision.The strategy layer isn't the deepest thing in the world. Even though the bonuses, the heroes and the events are randomized, the map and the building times are always the same. (Hard mode shakes this up a little bit with extra corruption) If you figure out the right exploit, it can be easy to overlevel and steamroll the cadence. There are only two resources, heroes and time, and everything happens letting time pass, so all you're really doing is deciding on research, marriages and where to defend. And there aren't really that many viable builds either. All item research is around the same powerlevel, and the more necessary research takes such a long time, that there is no point to doing most of the research. there are cool weapons, items and equipment you'll never really want to use, and bonuses that come in way too late to be important. Multiple times through, the Strategic gameplay isn't as interesting as the combat is.  Conclusion: Massive Chalice has it's flaws. You can see the effort and love that's gone into the game, but you can also see the points where the constrained budget and developement time prevent the game from fully realizing it's vision. For any fan of strategy games, this is still a wonderful experience and an easy buy. It is a fun, unique and challenging game, that you can have a lot of fun with.			"

												Fantasy Strategy Game - XCOM Combat MechanicsYou are an eternal ruler that has to manage heroes and bloodline to persevere against the swarm of the Cadence for 300 years. The game is very simple in itself provides a good guideline and has a very nice touch of humour. The difficulty of the game is that every unit/hero you have at disposition is pretty much UNIQUE. Music is just EPIC.On another note... One of my heroes got a ""Leg Injury"" after a trip to the park with me. :DI guess my jokes went too far. :P11/10 would want a Massive Chalice 2.			"

												I'd read reviews saying this was just an XCom knockoff and not worth the time, but I like XCom and it was 75% off so I snagged it. I'm happy I did. Talk about addicting. I've just spent the past 6ish hours solid playing. The combat is indeed pretty much like XCOM, but there is so much more to it. You have to research, build, and most of all breed your eventual champion. Your heroes age, so you need to take 2 that have abilities you want inherited and you marry them off. If you do it right, they'll have tons of offspring and you can use some for combat or other jobs while still keeping an heir within the keep. Once the current regent dies, your heir takes over and you can then marry the heir off to pair new abilities together for their offspring and so on. It really does mean thinking ahead, but it's pretty cool so far.			"

												Only 4 hours in (53 years in game time) and I'm really enjoying it.  A lot of strategic layers to the game (short-term and long-term) revolving around the choices you'll make in controlling your bloodlines and, consequently, your classes and abilities.  Between the research options and weapon/armour/item upgrades you'll find there are tough choices and tradeoffs to be made.  Tactical combat isn't quite as deep as X-COM, but you still need to think clearly about your approach or your characters will die (permanently) in rapid fashion.  The music, visual style, animations and voice acting are top-notch.  Not a game for the for the impatient or dim-witted.  Highly recommended. "

												The best and quickest way I can descibe this game is to say that it's fantasy XCOM (the newer ones) with elements from Hero Generations.And I don't mean that as a bad thing, I love XCOM, and I'm really enjoying MASSIVE CHALICE, but it really is XCOM. The management simulation sections are similar to XCOM, and even feature similar research mechanics. The combat interludes are similar to XCOM, even down to the 2-AP turns. The character pregression is similar to XCOM, esspecially as far as the two-path ability tree format and equipment layout prior to a fight.The biggest difference is that MASSIVE CHALICE features a ""character breeding"" mechanic. Your heroes will age and, eventually, die of old age. To keep yourself well-stocked with battle-ready warriors, you need to arrange marriages between heroes. They will do the deed, have children with their physical traits, raise them into warriors with their personality traits, and, eventually, die as well and need to be replaced from their own bloodline. It's kind of neat, and keeps your hero-pool continually changing, instead of letting you just stick to the same five heroes forever like XCOM does, also giving a sense of dread as you realize your best troops are getting old, and you need to decide whether to keep them in the field or settle them down to make kids who are, hopefully, a quarter as amazing as they were before they drop from age.All-in-all, I'm enjoying it a lot. I recommend it to anyone else who enjoys games like XCOM or Jagged Allience: Management games with tactics-RPG combat interludes. If you're looking to get into the genre, I'd even say to start here and work your way to those others, MASSIVE CHALICE is a bit more forgiving than some.			"

												The art style works quite well.  The story, such as it is, is okay.  The variety of enemies makes each battle challenging and interesting.  The different classes, character traits, and dare I say genetic manipulation are neat mechanics but not overpowering the gameplay.However, the periods in between fights... Literally, nothing is happening that the player controls. And you have to do a lot of waiting for upgrades, births, buildings, research, and troops to come of age. There needs to be more to do in the rest periods.  I found little reason to replay once I beat the game, but im not an achievement hunter so your mileage may vary.Still a well done game.			"

												I love Massive Chalice because of the player driven plot. It's amazing, I imagine I'll make similar yet different decisions next time I play this. They should have called it ""Massively Replayable"" in my opinion. All three of my sagewrights now are sisters. Basically everyone of note in my kingdom is of the house Varadero. Am I breeding stock or helping people's lives?! The end goal is to let the eponymous Massive Chalice regenerate enough energy to wipe out the corruption that's spreading across their world. The Chalice takes a loooooooooooong time to recharge, so how you get there is entirely your choice (if you manage to succeed at all).			"

												This one took me by pleasant surprise.  It's mechanically one of the leanest, meanest, and well balanced strategy games I've every played.  It cuts the fat you find in most other strategy titles, leaving only meaningful discussions to be made by the player.As a veteran of X-COM and its spin-offs I can honestly say that it's going to be hard going back to just one cast of heroes after playing his one.  It's so nice to be able to think ""I'll just breed that trait out of the next generation"", or ""these two are going to have kick♥♥♥♥♥kids!""I personally loved the sharp visual design and slick interface, but you mileage may vary.Definitely recommended.

												Let me preface this review by saying I am not a Double Fine fanboy (I've played a few of their games, but would never buy one merely because it is DF). I also did not back it early. I have no bias to say this is good if it isn't. I bought it on sale. I've also beaten it on Normal Ironman mode, so I've seen the whole thing.This game is not going into a Top 10 for me or anything, but it is quite good. I'll try to address the concerns you may have from the other reviews.""The game is not XCOM."" This is a strangely specific complaint. Are we to judge whether a game is good solely on whether or not it is XCOM? The games have different foci. Any of the myriad complaints along the lines of ""you can name your characters in XCOM but you can't here ... this game sucks"" are nonsense. The goal in XCOM is to keep people alive. One of the main mechanics in this game is to get time to progress so that people die and new, better ones take their place! I'd be overly annoyed if they wanted me to name the 200 people I went through. Not naming is a good design choice. Anyone that says otherwise has misunderstood what the game is about. This goes for the other ""this is not XCOM"" complaints as well.""The tactics are limited and shallow."" This complaint is a thinly veiled ""This is not XCOM."" The depth doesn't come from pure tactics like XCOM. The depth comes from the large scale strategy of bloodlines, buildings, researching technology, setting standards, and so on in a limited resources environment. Time is a resource. You only get so much. I'd like to see someone with this complaint beat it on Brutal Ironman difficulty. Yeah. If it's so shallow this should be cake for them. That's what I thought.Look. The general idea of some of the complaints stand. It gets mildly repetitive. I plan to take a short break before starting some attempts at Hard/Ironman for this reason. But it has some strategic and tactical depth to it. It is fun. It has some unique, new ideas. It is certainly worth the price. I'd be surprised if I got less than 50 hours when I decide to call it quits. Not game of the year, but certainly not bad.			"

The developers had the window to make ""boss"" monsters, like something that took up 4 squares and was a real challenege? I dunno... The ending is HELLA ANTICLIMACTIC!

												I picked up this game during the Summer 2015 Steam Sale and I have no regrets. It was exactly what I was looking for. My first play through, which clocked in around 16 hrs, was fabulous. I enjoyed the lite tactical battles and the province management. I just played the game, I didn't try to micro manage my bloodlines or optimize my research route I just played for fun, and ya know what? It was! As a gamer who reloads a save every time one of my Xcom soldiers dies, I liked the way this game made your heroes feel just important enough to play safe while not punishing you for losing a few. I never felt like my game was ruined because of a death or a random event. I'm almost hoping they use this game as a sort of proof of concept I would love to play a game with these types of bloodline mechanics with a little more width and breadth. All and all 9 outta 10 with my only grievance being the ending which I was slightly disappointed in.			"

												This game is good.But most people make a mistake - they compare it to X-COM and expect an X-COM-like game. That's totally wrong. This game focuses on pre-planning, planning in advance and preparation much more than X-COM game and while strategic mode in X-COM serves to support tactical one - by unlocking more guns, armors and stuff for destruction of aliens in tactical mode - in Massive Chalice tactical mode would be a test of your strategical decisions and ability to allocate your main resources - time and people.The main idea of the game is not turn-based battles - the main idea is managing of your heroes - which is both simple and complicated. Simple - because there are three positions to which you can assign your heroes. You can have them reigning (supposedly) in a castle, where they would produce more heroes (assuming that you've found a fitting partner for it), you can have them doing research in sage's guild, which would speed up many other things or you can have them training other heroes at crucible, which grants a steady supply of exp for all your heroess and allows them to also pick some good or bad traits from the teacher. All assigments are life-long and you can't undo them. All heroes, who are not assigned can participate in fighting off Cadence (though you can take only five of them into battle - you can choose those five out of all your unassigned heroes). And then comes the complicated part - the higher level of the hero - the more effective he would be at those assigments - he would be able to train his children, so they'd start with several levels already, he would be able to give all heroes more experience at crucible and... no, he won't be more effective sage, as wisdom comes with age and certain in-born traits. And, of course, high level hero would be able to fight off Cadence better. The other thing you should take into account are traits - they are divided into inborn ones and 'gained' ones. Inborn ones are simple - characters can be strong or weak, have inborn heart problems or be very bright and so on. Those traits can be inherited from parents and can't be changed, so you should look - who are marrying with whom. 'Gained' traits are a bit more complicated - as character can pick them after parents, after the crucible instructor and even after his teammates during the mission, so one drunkard can quickly turn the whole group into drunkards - those traits add a layer of complexity as well.And only after all that complex strategy layer comes tactical one, where your heroes are sent to fend off Cadence in an X-COM-like fashion - tactical mechanics are close to what you get in X-COM - every hero has two actions, attack ends his turn, so you can either move twice or move and attack or attack without moving. Instead of cover mechanics - there is positioning and visibility, since enemies that you can see may not see your characters, even without using all sorts of hiding abilities. Many abilities affect areas or lines or pierce through multiple enemies, so you'd need to do some positioning, before engaging them (and keep an eye on enemies trying to do the same) and eventually you'd get cool stuff, like bombs that create walls and so on.So, in general, I'd give this game 4.5/5 - but I warn you that this game may be not fitting for people, who love only tactical games or only strategical games, as it would require combination of both to win - without good strategical management of your heroes you'd get an army of low-level weak clumsy dimwitted characters, who'd miss an elephant at a point-blank range. Without tactical abilities - your army of super-soldiers won't be able to win battles, which would lead to an obvious defeat.Also, I've encountered some people, who don't like the graphical style, the style of weapons (a log as a main melee weapon and giant crossbow turned sideways as ranged one - that's too hillarious for them) or find the fact that there are only three main classes a bit lacking for their taste (though there are hybrid classes, which add some to gameplay - for example, caberjack (fighter with that log as a melee weapon) married to hunter would produce shadowjacks - still fighters with a log, but they sacrifice some of their combat abilities for ability to turn themselves invisible, like hunters do). So, if you are among those people - approach this game with some caution.			"

												Ever wanted to play XCOM in a fantasy setting? Then you'll be happy to hear that this game does just that!While some of the battles might drag on because of the spawn randomness (like the original X-COM: UFO Defense), the game manages to keep the player captivated during the entire campaign. There isn't a lot of monster variety, but they each have interesting mechanics that make them serious threats until the very end. I consider myself a seasoned XCOM player, and yet Massive Chalice managed to keep challenging me. The music is superb, and the art design is cool.Overall, it's a quite a good game! I would say it deserves it's 20$ entry point for the replayability alone, and it is definitely worth experience when it becomes discounted!			"

												A unique, well executed, enjoyable game. I wouldn't call it simple so much as concise. The combat strategy gets more complex as you progress. Once you've had time to level and explore all the class combos, you get a final battle that ends the game. I found that a much more satisfying conclusion than tapering off into the oblivion of infinite turns that plagues so many strategy games.			"

												Unfair AI. The game tries at every angle to make it impossible for you to build a strong base of heroes. The odds of creating good bloodlines is low, maintaining them is even harder because they grow old much too fast too often. Half way through the game, your bloodlines are hardly producing children. The real way you want to setup, is to get 4 Keeps, 3 of these for your classes, and the fourth purely for creating good marriage mates for your Regents.  This is the best way I have figured out to outmaneuver this game mechanic. Still, there are other ways the game will put roadblocks on your progress. It will take your best heroes, and add ""Life Choices"" to them, and by the way, the same answer never always works, and that means your heroes will get bad trait consequences set on them, for example Depression, and Nihilism. So your stuck with poorer heroes churning out low quality heroes. We are not even getting into the battle mechanics, where half way through the game, the monsters start to do crazy things to overwhelm your forces. Sure, its challenging and could be fun except for the fact that they get noticeably stronger and duplicate themselves or make your heroes age with every hit so that they literally die of old age in battle. The combination of these elements did not make frustrated so much as feel like there was no truly rewarding experience for my progress - and that's the problem I have with the game ultimately. It's not a journey that you will take with your empire whereby you made wise and intellgent decisions to give you the edge your deserve, no, its more like an endurance race to the end of the time period where you can finally rest from the onlought of unlucky tribulations you escaped by the skin of your teeth.

												A unique, well executed, enjoyable game. I wouldn't call it simple so much as concise. The combat strategy gets more complex as you progress. Once you've had time to level and explore all the class combos, you get a final battle that ends the game. I found that a much more satisfying conclusion than tapering off into the oblivion of infinite turns that plagues so many strategy games.			"

												Fantasy Strategy Game - XCOM Combat MechanicsYou are an eternal ruler that has to manage heroes and bloodline to persevere against the swarm of the Cadence for 300 years. The game is very simple in itself provides a good guideline and has a very nice touch of humour. The difficulty of the game is that every unit/hero you have at disposition is pretty much UNIQUE. Music is just EPIC.On another note... One of my heroes got a ""Leg Injury"" after a trip to the park with me. :DI guess my jokes went too far. :P11/10 would want a Massive Chalice 2.			"

												BUG ALERT: I played normally for the first 18 hours. Then, suddenly, the game kept freezing on the main menu. After researching the problem, I found out that the game would only work in windowed mode. It's a minor hassle, nothing game-breaking, but still very annoying. It should have been fixed.  This is a very interesting game, but not as good as, for example, X-COM: Enemy Unknown. It's very hard at the beginning: the heroes (soldiers) keep dying (more of natural causes than by combat) and it will take a while until you have several keeps with fruitful bloodlines; afterwards, you'll barely get to know your heroes, because the offer will be enormous. Although the game is comprised of a 300 year period, in which battles happen in intervals of about a decade (so it's like there are 30 turns), this was not enough for me to have a building in every region of the small map or to have leveled up a relic (special weapons) to the maximum or to have finished all the research projects (probably I should've built another Standard and Sagewright buildings). So I think a New Game Plus mode would have been a nice idea. Without it, I don't know if I'll play again. My first game, on Normal, took 28,5 hours to complete. The ""good"" ending seems disappointing at first, but after you realize that the game is supposed to be cyclical, it becomes actually interesting. Combat is very easy, specially by the endgame, and not very diverse, since there are only 3 basic classes of warriors, from which you can breed some mixed classes with different abilities; but a lot of these abilities are not unique, therefore these subclasses are not that unique either... Maybe it would have been more interesting if I've had the chance to research more items and weapons.  Something that I found weird is the game's tone: although the story and the world are really depressing, the Chalice keeps making jokes... It sounded schizophrenic.  All in all, an OK game, by all means. But probably not one that will get you hooked or will be unforgettable.			"

												Wonderful little game of the XCOM meets Banner Saga' and Rogue Legacy' ideas vein.Nothing of a large scale here, just a 700 meg game that nevertheless does everything right. The tactics' are there, the artwork is finest, the oft times fun narration and (end theme) story are awesome, moving, and in a sense allegorical. Little random events here and there add flavour and variability. There's also an overarching feel of progression, plus challenge. Chalice is a grower though, its ""indieness"" can be off-putting at first.It has also been said for cons that characters in the game die so often (of age) that you can't remember them nor form any connection. That's somewhat true, yet I think it holds separate value that only a flag and its legacy will stay visible, this theme also supports the end-story. Could have done with some more city building and strategy, maybe more story elements. You know, more content.Yet for this size and this price, there's plenty of fun and wonder here. It plays perfectly well, not like XCOM 2 (which is unplayable on many systems and terribly optimized, for little to no merit). This one actually looks artistic. Has more 'soul'.Massive Chalice is a well done game that I'm more than happy I've played.			"

												Some really good ideas (of which some are new and some are ""borrowed"" from XCOM) and some very nice design, combined with a moderately minimalist implementation and a frustrating final battle make this game... good, but disappointing. There's a lot of gameplay value to be squeezed out of this one, but at the same time, it could have been *so* much better with just a bit more work. If there's a Massive Chalice 2 somewhere down the line, I'll be all over it, but in the meantime, this is one thumb mostly-up and a recommendation to look out for it on discount.			"

												I love this game, though it may not be for everyone. There's periods of time where you just have to wait for one event or another to happen and occasionally that period of time drags out a little. Combat, to me, is exciting enough to keep me hooked. Could they have made better choices here and there, sure they could have, someone mentioned that to get some of the information you sometimes have to go out of the menu you're in and go into a different menu and that can get a little annoying. However, I find that a minor annoyance that doesn't detract enough from the game to not recommend it.			"

												I thought the concept of this game sounded cool, but in execution it's not that fun. It's about as slow paced as Civ, but not nearly as enjoyable. The resource management element tries to generate tension the way XCOM did, but even when I cut my deployment crew down to 3 people, I didn't really worry about whether I'd be able to win the fight. It's not a bad game, it's just not that much fun so I can't recommend it.			"

												I found Massive Chalice to be a challenging, engrossing and entertaining experience.The combination of Double Fine humour/charm, reasonably deep turn-based combat and epic dynasty-building is a potent one. There are a number of clever ideas at play, the tutorial is cleverly and unobtrusively integrated into the gameplay and the research tracks and hero/cadence levels keep things interesting.Having said that, there are some flaws.It's near-impossible to become attached to any individual hero; attacks are so infrequent that they may fight only a few battles in their life. That robs the breeding system of some of its attraction, though it does emphasise the focus on the big picture rather than individuals.It is also all too easy to make the final mission very difficult through some failures or bad decisions at the very beginning, which can lead to a frustrating experience on your first playthrough. It was only after 13 hours of play that my decision to only have one bloodline proved almost devastating, and made for a very tough final battle. Still, the game is good enough to justify a second playthrough, and maybe more, so after that you can enjoy the experience and only have yourself to blame for any mistakes.All up, a very worthwhile purchase.

												Ok. So I picked this game up in a sale and found myself liking it much more than I thought, keeping in mind I have only spent a little over an hour playing so far. The gameplay is quite good, being partially a turn-based tactical RPG. It is very much XCOM-like, minus Overwatch and an always changing experience. I thought I would hate not having Overwatch as a standard in this genre, but it works out very well. It makes you play a more offensive game while stratigically avoiding taking damage. I will say that the Caberjack (melee) seems underpowered when it comes to fighting because many enemies I've encountered so far damaging close by characters when killed. I personally find having Hunters (ranged bow) with a couple Alchemists (grenade throwers) is best.Where XCOM has its base to upgrade, Massive Chalice offers a world to build as your personal stategic will decide how to best handle the ever growing balancing act of whether to give up your best fighters to give you better warriors through their children, benefitting all children yearly, or helping research; or to keep them to best deal with the invading threat. Massive Chalice gives the player only one research or building option at a time which will make you have to decide what you value most as each will take some time to finish.The music is fitting, but I don't find it to be one of the top soundtracks (Bastion, Transistor, etc.) What sold me on this game is the comedic voice acting of the Massive Chalice as it really hooked me in. I hope to update this review as I dig deeper into the game and learn more.			"

												I thought this game was OK. I liked the combat, the music was perfect, and the kindom management, while a hassle, was kind of fun. However, there are two major problems with this game. 1. The map is annoying as hell. It doesn't zoom out nearly far enough and it's just an aspect of management during battle that could result in your heroes getting spotted without you realizing it until it's too late. 2. The game doesn't give you NEARLY enough information about how its mechanics work. I played the game twice and both failed because the game simply didn't communicate basic information, like how to keep your heroes leveled up, and how the final fight would work. Speaking of, if you do buy this game DON'T PLAY ON IRON MODE. In Iron mode all your actions are overwritten while you play. While that sounds nice and hardcore, the game does not tell you valuable information about the final mission which you will likely fail without. So play without iron mode, and when you fail the final mission you won't have to replay the whole 10 hour game (yes, it throws away all your progress if you fail the final mission).I can't recommend this game. Despite it's great soundtrack and fun combat I can't forgive a game that screws the player's time through a lack of information. If it gets some major sale, fine, but until then just go buy something better.SPOILS: Here's the info about the final mission that I've been talking about, if you want to know ahead of time. Alright, so in the game you can create 'bloodlines.' In the final mission, if a hero dies it will be replaced but the previous hero in the bloodline. If that hero dies, it gets replaced again, and again, until the bloodline is exausted. So bring the heroes that are a part of bloodlines, not recruited heroes. Also, bring a couple alchemists. You're going to need AOE and you can refill your flasks at the Chalice. Make sure you got a relic weapon for them (which you can get by getting one hero a ton of kills over their lifetime). With this information, you should be able to beat the final mission.  "

												I played it for nine hours on hard and it was really fun until I ♥♥♥♥ed up the breeding metagame and had nothing but melee.Plays somewhat like X-Com but on hard it's notably different in that the combat has a big emphasis on party positioning and enemy displacement. It's different enough that as someone who likes modern X-Com I liked this game as well, and it didn't make me feel like I should just replay X-Com. The breeding metagame initially feels unimportant but becomes crucial to pay attention to later on, and there's enough to it that you could obsess over.That said, there are things holding it back from being super-awesome: The enemy visual design looks bad, like someone was told to draw something evil so they drew a bunch of pickles and covered them with spikes. The environments are rather bland aside from a couple of instances. The writing tries to have that typical Double Fine wit and ends up making the game, one about an apocalyptic event that is swallowing the landscape, feel tone deaf. And over all nothing is as deep as it could be.So it's pretty good, just not great. I hope that it'll get an expansion pack.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. It's up my alley - a complex system of bloodlines and heroes combined with turn-based combat. And parts of it were really interesting and fun. But the combat? So boring. There are about six different enemies, and as the individual battles get more difficult, first there are more of them. Then about halfway through, they double in hitpoints. Then, there are more of them. Battles would stretch to 15-20 minutes of exploring very similar maps, looking for more of the same enemies so you could use the same moves to probably kill them. I'm not the kind of master strategist that gets really excited by ""Oh!! The wall is over *there* now so I have to deploy my hunters like *this*!"" I struggled to the end of one game and now feel like I know enough of the mechanics to do much better the next time - there are some specific things I'd like to try - but I simply cannot yawn through another endless series of battles!

												Massive Chalice is a fantasy version of X-COM where you fight a 300 year war to hold back the Cadence until an ultimate weapon can be unleashed againt it. You build keeps to establish bloodlines from your heroes, these bloodlines allow you to breed better heroes for future battles and pass down relics, which are special weapons that level up in combat.You also build crucibles that allow you to assign a hero as a trainer for other heroes. Trainers provide experience to level up the heroes as well as pass along personality traits. There are also sage guilds which aid in research and construction of buildings.Any heroes assigned as the regent of a keep, trainer of a crucible, or as a sage cannot be used in battles against the Cadence. This makes heroes an interesting resource. There are times when sacrificing a hero to pass a long their genetics to the next generation, despite them being the best option for a hero in battle. Or, you might not put the highest experienced hero in the crucible, because you don't want his personality being passed down to the other heroes.The game doesn't have the strategic or tactical depth of X-COM, but it does offer a good range of tactical options. I would recommend putting the game on a harder difficulty than normal, since normal is a walk in the park with some class balance issues.Battles occur about once every 10 years with the last 30 years having them occur more frequently. This means you'll have 30-40 battles in that time. Heroes die of old age after about 60-70 years, so your roster for battles will change multiple times.The game does have a few downsides. The first being the lack of enemy diversity. There are about 8 different enemies, each having a stronger version later in the game, but the game could really use a few more.The next issue is research. The majority of the research isn't necessary. There's a large variety of things you can research, but it either doesn't sound that interesting or helpful. Especially, when the healing potions are the main items you'll be taking with you to battle.The events, while adding some flavor, are really just an RNG. The RNG of these events can cause two lands that are on the brink to succumb to the Cadence. Or you can get a bonus trait. The main problem is that you have no idea what you're risking with your decisions which makes your decisions even more random.The last issue is there's not a whole lot of choice when the Cadence attacks. Whatever land is the most threatened, from prior attacks, is the one that you defend. The only time the choice and rewards really matter is when both lands have the same threat level, or you're only able to save one land. This isn't unique to the game, as X-COM had a similar problem when assessing the alien invasions.Overall, it's a fun game that anyone bored with X-COM should take a look at. Even more so if you're interested in a fantasy take with some interesting genetics and personality mechanics.			"

												This game can easily be splitted into 2 parts: a TBS, which is basically an X-COM, and... Well, I would call it a king-pimp simulator with a hint of that X-COM again. The first one is really plain and simple: 5 heroes, some monsters, abilities, 2 Action Points... Nothing fancy here, though fun at times. And the second one is what this game is all about. To fight off a nasty thing dreaming about consumping your ""kingdom"" the Chalice from the title must be charged. And it needs just some measly 3 centuries. Good thing you are immortal. Bad thing your heroes are not. And without you they, apparently, can't have sex for some reason. So one of your duties is to marry heroes, hoping they are compatible with each other and capable of producing not only healthy, but also promising offsprings with crazy stats and utility traits and personalities until these heroes die.Yes, heroes here have not only stats, but also traits and personalities. And if you are bad at pimping, then rather soon the crisis will emerge: all your heroes are drunkards with heart diseases that can hardly hit an enemy right in front of them and you can't even 'produce' more because there are only 2 bloodlines which will lead to incent... Basically, you are screwed.The game is not bad. This 'marriages and bloodlines managing' is a fresh idea with some potential. But the rest of the game is simply boring. You sit there, waiting for decades until the Corruption strikes (always 2 regions, but you can protect only 1), at the same time hoping the research you started will be finished until then, then wasting an awful lot of time searching for 1 monster hidden somewhere in the corner of the map. And by the next invasion your core heroes will be already long dead, leaving you with rookies who somehow inherit the worst traits of their parents. Maybe it is just me, but I also noticed that all melee classes are useless compared to ranged classes. With 5 hunters you can hide in shadows and take out 1 enemy at a time without exposing your heroes and risking their lives. All in all, the concept is interesting, the game is boring and dull. Take it with a discount and decide yourself.			"

												It's a fun game requiring planning so you don't end up in a bind if you lose a territory or when your Hero's die. Has combat similar to X-com. The passing of traits is a neat idea as time marches on ingame to see them passed (good or bad) to their children.Cons: The time between combats could use more random events or perhaps more frequent combat. More research options or ways, outside of class leveling, to allow Hero's hold more items to give a bit more variety and a need to research Items.Bottome line, if you're intested in the game, get it on sale.

												Just picked it up for $10 and it's the best random purchase I've made in awhile. I love XCOM and they do a solid job of executing on squard base tactical combat and throw in a light hearted spin on king making. You have the rpg element of your heroes leveling up and getting new skills... researching different buff items, different structures and weapons/armor, etc.. I also really enjoyed their class/profession system. It's once again nothing overwhelming, but based on the profession of the parents and their traits, it determines their off-springs profession (this is how you unlock new professions) as well handing down some traits. They also include some fun aging elements (buffs/debuffs) that keep things interesting. First game I've picked up in a long time where I just wanted to keep playing.			"

												Most of the reviews I see on here that are negative, are from people who haven't spent much time with the game, so take that for what you will.In general, I think Massive Chalice is a solid strategy game -- a good 7/10, with some moments that make me feel like it is an 8/10.Veteran stragegy players should definitely play on Hard or Brutal, since that will give you more of a challenge. My first playthrough was on Normal, just to get a sense of what options were out there, and the mechanics of the game. I'd love to see a DLC or a patch that allows for House creation by those who did not back on kickstarter, and I think most of the Kickstarter Backers are okay with that sort idea, since the House you would be creating would just be limited to your local game copy, etc.Again, overall, it is a game well worth $20.00 -- and if you can get it on a sale, then I think that is a pretty stellar deal.

The core presentation is simplified, but the bones underneath that - a surprising variety of skills, the ability to 'crossbreed' your heroes into odd hybrid classes, and enemies with markedly different attacks (one AGES your heroes!) adds up for a surprisingly complex situation under the hood.The gameplay is a little samey for a very long, involved session, but I've had fun dipping in for twenty minutes or so here, twenty minutes there, and the game does let you save at just about any point - even when you're being asked to select a mission or make another crucial choice.

												Massive Chalice could have been something really good with its interesting and rather unique mechanics.Unfortunately it shoots itself in the foot with its fast pacing and somewhat boring fights.Bloodlines could have been a really nice feature, if not for said pacing making you see it as just a number matching simulator and is hampered by RNG. You can't get attached to your heroes as they die in under an hour of gameplay due to combat, events or simply old age. You can't feel any immersion as the world, while interesting, feels very bland and monotonous.Hero classes are quite limited as you have 3 basic classes, then their descendants who can become a mix of those classes, and while it looks like you may have many classes, it's just a basic mix of skills sets from 2 classes in 1. Range + Alchemist gives a ranged with alchemist tools. What could be a really unique class is just a bad 2 in 1.What is even worse is that if you make a mistake while appointing regents and their spouses, you may lock yourself out of a class until you build more keeps or said regent dies, while you still have the heroes you want to have descent of. For example you may lose access to the pure melee Caberjacks early on if you lose them in fights or don't appoint as the regent to keep the class going. Those are the little things that end up making the game a chore rather than en entertainment.Too bad as it was a really good idea.			"

												A breath of fresh air for stretegy-enthusiasts!  An IMMENSE amount of customization in HOW the game unfolds.  There is no ""right way"" to play Massive Chalice, but all the ways you'll try will feel balanced to perfection.I absolutely LOVE this game.Massive Chalice is unlike any other strategy/tactics game I've ever played.  Originally, I was intrigued by the description promising different forms of strategy combined with a standard tile-based tactics system.  However, I had no idea how complex theses elements would be, and the result is a truly unique, pleasantly deep game.The game is split between battles and planning stages, but the ""planning"" isn't as simple as outfitting heroes with gear, or leveling up attributes.  You can do all these things, but additionally, you actually have to populate your army by mating your heroes in hopes they are fertile enough to produce babies.  The offspring inherit traits of the parents, and can form unique classes based on how you mix the parents' classes.  Also, be sure to keep an eye on the age of your heroes, because unlike any other strat game I've ever played, your heroes actually die of old age.  You'll want to continue their bloodlines, and take advantage of relics (super-weapons) that can be passed down through bloodlines.Then on top of this there are random events, choice of what battles to fight, options to retire heroes for use in research and general army-level boosts, structured all around a ""passing timeline"" which beautifully incorporated into a consistent style.In addition to the typical grid based battle system like so many turn-based strat games, I found an astounding number of ""new ideas"" for weapons, attacks, skills, environments, etc.  Example:  One environment/map-type has tall weeds you can hide in to increase your evasion.  This is nothing new to strategy games--tall grass/mountains/swamp tile, etc always make it harder to hit you... but in Massive Chalice, these weeds only show up in ONE environment-type--it's the ONLY time you find a tile that increases your evasion.  I took advantage of these weeds twice, in 25 hours of play.  Each bio-style has its own little exploit.  Some I like more than others.  But it completely keeps the turn based battles from getting repetitive.Another example:  There's a weapon that has a chance to knock an enemy ""into the future""; you don't understand at first what this means, but then, (years :P) later, during your NEXT battle, those enemies show up and hopefully you're more prepared this time.  And this is just one weapon you can research to develop--that is, if you want to research weapons at all.  I got to the end of the game only ever researching 2 things from the ""items"" category (health potion, and health buff) and never got to try the other 15+ items...And I know next time I play through, I can focus my research into a different category and completely change the way the game is played.  And the nice thing is, I WANT to play again.  Especially now that I'm becoming more of an expert in the game's mechanics.Lastly, art is SUPERB, music never dull or repetitive, story/depth feels personalized and is never disappointing, reply value is definitely there.  There isn't really any ""fluff"" in this game.  Everything has been refined to perfection.The ONLY criticism I'd have for this game:  Sometimes it'd have been nice to play through battles at 2x speed.  If you had the option to speed up an enemy reveal, or enemy turn phase, this would be cool.  But really, that's it.  It'd be cool.If you've been bored with new developments in tile-based strat games (but still love them) you will be over-whelminging engaged by this game.			"

												Best single player game i've played in years.  You gotta like city managing, turn based combat and rogue like elements.  You're an overlord of a nation for 300 years - managing heroes.  Heroes can fight, get married, have kids and eventually die.  Their kids become your next generation of heroes.  Incredible amount of small details.			"

This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].We are alone and surrounded. The Cadence never rests and their sole purpose is to destroy us. But there is a glimmer of hope, an ancient relic that can wipe out our demonic enemy once and for all. However, it will take three hundred years to charge up the divine chalice to have enough power to destroy the Cadence. During those three hundred years, your heroes will live, fight, reproduce and die. As an immortal ruler, you will remain vigilant. You cannot leave the keep or the chalice, but you can oversee the entire land and dictate everything.This is the premise of Massive Chalice, Double Fine’s fantasy turn-based strategy easiest described as a mix between XCOM’s tactical battles and Crusader King’s marital simulation. But it’s not quite as simple as that. The way those two elements come together is what really sets Massive Chalice apart. You start off with a central keep that houses the chalice and five royal families. In the rest of the provinces you can build further keeps and assign your heroes to them. Their duty as regents will be to procreate and thus provide new heroes in order to sustain the centuries-spanning battle against the Cadence. You can also build two separate keeps that will either provide research bonuses or faster training of young heroes. Heroes assigned as regents, sagewrights or standards cannot fight so you constantly have to bear in mind that you need at least five battle-ready heroes. This is a bit tricky at first because deaths are permanent and heroes will die both in combat and of natural causes.There are three main hero classes. Hunters are ranged specialists, Alchemists are great for crowd control as they carry explosive flasks and Caberjacks deal damage with brute melee force. Each class has two sub-classes which you gain by marrying different main classes. Also, every class and sub-class has their own unique skill tree. For example, a Trickshot is an offspring of a Hunter regent and an Alchemist partner and has the unique ability to fire off a long-range explosive flask using his/her bow and arrow. Apart from that, each hero has positive and negative physical attributes and personality traits which they can potentially transfer to their children. So you will want to pay attention as to who you’re marrying as it will influence the class and traits of your future heroes. You don’t want to find yourself two hundred years into the fight with nothing but sickly, nearsighted, drunk heroes or even worse, lacking a vital class.The enemies also come in a range of shapes and sizes with different abilities. Some will run up to you and explode, some will shoot from a distance and stun your heroes whereas others have the ability to spawn additional minions and throw explosive substances. In a rather unique twist, one type of enemy will actually age your heroes while dealing damage. This could potentially lead to your hero dying of age, not by damage, on the battlefield. Even if they survive the battle, they will most likely die soon after. That’s where your research comes in. Over the years you can assign various research and develop better armor, weapons and items that negate the aging attack, among others. The battles take place on grid-based procedurally generated maps. The battle system isn’t the deepest out there, but it is engaging and satisfying enough to quench that tactical itch.Another unique aspect of the game are relics. Once a particularly valiant hero passes away, their weapon may become a relic that can be passed down through generations, but only within that bloodline. Throughout the years, the relic itself will gain experience points and become more and more powerful. As the ruler, you will also be tasked to solve random problems or situations similar to the ones in The Banner Saga. I’m not sure if I just had really bad luck, but almost every choice had horrible repercussions. A few times my choice didn’t lead to any change at all and I never managed to resolve a situation in such a way to get something good out of it. But the biggest problem I had with this feature was that, unlike in The Banner Saga, it just felt impersonal, distant and irrelevant. I didn’t feel the plight of the people and I wasn’t immersed into those more whimsical situations.The game’s presentation is absolutely great. What stood out to me the most was the superb soundtrack which hits just the right notes. It has a bit of a melancholic vibe to it which makes sense in the grand scheme of things as you will see dozens and dozens of your heroes die over three centuries. The art style is very nice as well. The environments looks lush and beautiful, the colorful enemy designs are wholly unique as well. Ironically, it’s the heroes that visually lack personality, they seem too plain and bland. Also, male and female models are actually quite difficult to tell apart.Double Fine needed this. The famed independent developer lost quite a bit of good will recently as Broken Age didn’t turn out as people expected and the less said about Spacebase DF-9, the better. Massive Chalice is a step in the right direction to regain people’s trust. But even if you disregard all that, Massive Chalice is a great strategy game in its own right with an engaging combat system, engrossing marital simulation and stellar presentation.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"

								It's really made for power gamers. There are a ton of variables you need to master in order to win, and the game is stacked firmly against you in every way in regards to the amount of enemies, their powers, your limitations, etc... Also, there's too much random stuff happening (heroes dying, especially) for you to get a real grasp on what's going on.If you're spending 40 hours per week gaming and don't mind running a spreadsheet to keep track of what's going on (what regent has what powers, family trees, and so on), then you can probably, eventually, get somewhere with this game. For me, I'm a few days in and I'm done with it. Here's what I think it needs to make it better:a. Variable difficulty settings. Seriously. Spending five hours trying to manipulate bloodlines before getting decimated by an onslaught isn't fun.b. More items to research to improve your heroes. You shouldn't have to kill three missions worth of something to then research better weapons. Or anything else to level the field. The monsters with level drain and nearly perfect ranged accuracy who show up from level one need to be fought with something better than a puny hunter with 28% accuracy.c. Less stuff to keep track of. Is there a reason that I'm made aware of babies, trainees, and heroes? I can't tell if this is necessary to know or not in any practical sense. I either have enough heroes when I'm attacked or I don't. Do I need to know how many heroes I'll have in 15 more years? Why am I shown infertile partner choices when a keep needs a regent? Why is it sometimes a fertile partner and a fertile regent can't have children?d. More ways to keep your heroes alive longer. Is there some sort of immortality mechanism later? I don't know because I've never made it that far, nor do I intend to.In all, unless your idea of a good time is studying a game for hours, taking a lot of notes, and doing a little bit of finite math in the bargain, then buying this game probably isn't a good idea. I certainly wouldn't have bought it had I known it was like so.			"

Early Access Review
								Playing since the initial beta opened up and the game is super fun.  Like Xcom, you skip time in between battles.  However, it's measured in years, not days.  You have to consider the age of heroes (Go old man, sacrifice yourself because you're dead in a few years anyway!).  Your best can be sent to train the new recruits, and relics are made from heroes that do a good job in battle, which are independently leveled.  It's still in beta so there's some rough spots, imo mostly revolving around notifications (Oops, I just sent this hero with a relic to never return from researching).  I also accidentally bred out an entire class (hunters) because I didn't know how they were assigned.  However, I was able to beat it all the way through (with an asthmatic drunk family) and would recommend it to anyone who likes turn based combat.  Oh, and the music is extremely good.  It also has a lot of humor mixed in.			"

								MASSIVE CHALICE adds a depth and enviroment to the turned-based strategy game like nothing I've ever played before. There is deep strategy in nearly every choice you make - from setting up bloodlines (your heroes matter, not only to your campaign but to YOU, too) to the battles you choose to fight. Every fiber of this game is seamlessly woven together to create a deep and engaging title that stands out among the rest. I highly recommend this product if you're a fan of the genre. You will not be dissapointed.Also, considering this is ONLY an Alpha at this stage, expect a lot more improvements and content.			"

								This game takes A LOT of ""inspiration"" from Firaxis XCOM but that is not necessarily a bad thing.

Posted: June 13, 2015
												This is a cracking take on an XCom style game with enough interesting ideas to make it worth playing. One key area that it differs from XCom is in the makeup of your team, each character may only get to battle 4 or 5 times at best, assuming they survive, as the game is set up to run over 300 years. Your characters age and die, with a battle coming up once every ten years. This leads to you having to work with what you've got in front of you, rather than just send out the same elite team again and again. You'll also want to adapt the team based on what type of enemy you're up against. Also in line with XCom, you have to research new tech, and there is plenty of exciting stuff to discover there. The tactical battles have varied environments specific to the region of the map you are fighting on, and the range of opponents seems quite large, with each being very different to the other, and certain types that you will come to dread. This part of the game flows quickly, the view is perhaps a little clunky (90 degree rotation only), but for the most part I am happy with it. There have been plenty of moments during this part of the game that have had me swearing very loudly due to misfortune, the first time you flask one of your own high level characters will make you think very carefully before you take a similar action in future.The game adopts some ideas from Crusader Kings, characters have various traits that they can pass on to their progeny if you assign them as a regent. This is pretty key, and provides you with a steady flow of new characters to use as you see fit (there are a couple of other non combat roles also). Your keeps can even be invaded, which is a hideously tense battle as your regent and their partner take part in the battle. You'll probably be tempted to get them into the action. You probably shouldn't. Every few years you get some multiple choice events, which can lead to nice bonuses when they go right, and characters dying when they go wrong. Never game breaking but potentially disasterous if you lose a key figure. Over the course of the game, you'll also wind up with powerful artifacts to hand down the generations, intringuingly the artifacts also level up, which is a very neat idea. I've made it half way through the 300 years so far, and although the game is seemingly repetetive, I am finding the short tactical battles (10-15 minutes) compelling, and whenever one finishes I am always very keen to see my next research item completed and to make other decisions until the next battle crops up. The game maintains a nice level of tension and I suspect it will get very tight towards the end of that 300 year sequence. I've no idea what happens at the end yet mind you, but I've seen enough of the game to know that it is right up my street, it certainly has it's hooks more into me than the other recent game in this vein, Invisible Inc.

The interface does not give you enough power to manage all your bloodlines efficiently and there is not enough atomation possible (like queueing next sagewrights).On the other hand, the combat is boring - very few tactical possibilities, not many enemies and repetetive environment forces you to repeat the same tactic all the time.This game is not bad, but I had to force myself to get trough a few times.

												Battle Tips:+ Melee units (Caber) can knock back and damage to avoid corrosion+ AOE units (Alchemists) can do 2 shots/turn at level 2+ Range units (Hunters) can stealth for free, unlimitedUnique to Game:  In this game you are leveling the “Keep” or Bloodline, not the heroes.  In general, for any game, the player’s heroes need to gain stats at the same rate the monsters do.  If the player’s stats lag, the game is too hard, if the player’s stats leap ahead of the monsters, the game is too easy.  This game works on the same balancing concept except that instead of leveling the heroes, you are leveling the Keep.  Heroes get married and produce children in the Keep that inherit some of the stats from the Keep.There are about 30 battles in a game, approximately 1 every 10 years.  The average hero can fight from age 16 till his death around age 65 – at most 6 battles.  Then he (and his personal stats) are lost forever and a new hero takes his place.The game is about using the hero’s temporary life span to contribute to the improved stats of the Keep/Bloodline fast enough to keep up with the monster’s increase in their stats.  If you can do this really well, you should set the game to Brutal, which makes the monster’s stats better quicker and your stats go up slower.  If you are having trouble keeping up with the monsters, you reduce the difficulty to Hard or Normal.Improving Keep Stats:This is the fun of the game, I've been playing about 3 days and my longest game is 106 years, so I'm still just getting going, but here's what I've learned early on:+ If a hero fights in a lot of battles during his life (4+), he has a chance to produce a relic.  This relic in the form of a weapon etc. is passed on from one hero to one other hero and itself levels.+ Heroes that marry have traits and personalities that can pass on to the kids.  At the beginning of the game most of your heroes have really bad traits, but by carefully selecting the heroes to marry, you slowly select for only the good traits, and the bad traits fall away.+ When you build a crucible(s) you can make your highest level heroes a Standard, and then all the heroes that are born (ages 0-15) get a yearly experience boost based on the Standard’s level.  That way your new heroes start at a higher level.+ And of course, Research can boost stats+ Use your heroes with the best stats for marriage. Almost any hero can win the first few battles, so it's better to invest heroes with good traits in a marriage.Graphics are good.  Camera controls are good.  Game seems crash proof.  The AI is not the best.  This is not the best turn-based battle game. The fun in this game is learning how to increase your stats even though your heroes keep dying off.			"

												Double Fine has created a game that is a combination of XCOM-style tactics games, and Game of Thrones-style bloodlines system.  The game switches between those two parts throughout the game as you are constantly trying to ward off “The Cadence” and keep your several families’ bloodlines alive and ever growing. The Cadence is a hoard of decay that has surrounded your kingdom. They will attack sections of your land a few times every decade. And most of the times they attack, you have to pick only one section to save. The other sections will then be afflicted by the enemy.  The different types of enemies represent different effects of time on the mind or body.  Some enemies make your heroes forget their combat experience. Others might add five years to a hero’s age with every attack.  I’ve even had heroes die of old age in battle because of this! Massive Chalice spans a timeline of 300 years.  As an immortal omnipresent ruler, you will watch generations upon generations of your people live and die in battle or of old age.  You will research armor, weapons, and accessories for your combat team, “The Vanguard.”  You can also construct various buildings for things like housing families or to speed up the leveling of your trainees. All of your research and building takes years to complete.  You have to choose wisely because time is always afflicting your heroes with age.  When they get old, they are less effective in combat and become less fertile.  This can get out of control if all of a sudden you’re trying to defend your kingdom with white-haired, frail heroes having traits like Puny, Nearsighted, and Arthritis.  You also need to pair the right heroes together at a good time inside a Keep.  This will allow them to produce children for the future.  The art in Massive Chalice is a bit hard to enjoy.  Some parts of the game look beautiful, like the vibrant environments when you’re in combat.  But the basic models of the heroes still look unpolished.  A lot of the game still has a placeholder look.  There might have been some compromises Double Fine had to make with their Kickstarter money.  It’s not an ugly game by any means.  But it also doesn’t pop at all.  The music in the game however, is really great.  There’s some well-fitting drums and string instruments in the soundtrack that kept me in the moment during combat.  Juggling the two focuses, combat and bloodlines, in Massive Chalice is what makes it hard to put down.  Watching your research timers tick down to completion, leveling up your heroes in combat, passing down family relics to future generations, and trying to perfect the genetics of your houses is quite unique.  Massive Chalice offers a very different take on the turn-based strategy genre by making you have to really think about the effects of time.  4/5			"

												What can I say about Massive Chalice other than to get it? It's good.I remember wishing while I played X-COM: Enemy Unknown that there would be some fantasy equivilent at some point. Massive Chalice does a great job being that and setting itself apart at the same time. While X-COM does offer more tactical and strategic options throughout its gameplay, MC offers a more overall compelling gaming experience.The ability to build dynasties and manage them throughout the course of generations is unique, and something that is quite enjoyable. Breeding in good traits into your various lineages and breeding out bad adds a strategic element I've not encounted in any other game previously. The occasional story elements that pop up while you are advancing the timeline that cause you to make a decision about the management of your kingdom and dynasties is akin to the decisions in The Banner Saga, though definitely less morally heavy.The strategic combats are also quite interesting, made more so by unique enemies and the ability to research (over the course of years) new items, weapons, and armor to use on the battlefield. One con is that you do get used to seeing the same handful of foes used over and over again, though this doesn't get tiresome. They remain challenging throughout gameplay.Something I've noticed is that it may take a game or two to make it through to the endgame of Massive Chalice. If you find yourself starting over, don't despair, this is natural, and from those I've spoken with, it happens. You're not the only one. It does allow you to hone your strategies for the next playthrough and learn the system just a bit better.One last con for the game over all harkens to my initial comparison to X-COM. There is no real customization of the houses that you see throughout the course of the game as they are all predetermined by Kickstarter backers. While it is true that your heroes are very expendable, a feature that allowed you to at least make your own houses and mottos would have been a nice tip of the hat. This is just an aesthetic grievance, and nothign that distracts from how wonderful the game truly is.TL;DR: Massive Chalice is wonderful. Go buy it. I've bought it twice.9.5/10			"

												Chalice is a great game.  The difficulty ramps up in expected places, pushing your tactics and strategy further; the long view is at times awe-inspiring in its ability to generate thoughts about mortality, descendency, and rulership.  The aesthetic of this game is wonderful; just what you would expect from a Double Fine game.  This is their best work since Psychonauts.There is more sex in this game than the Witcher. 10/10			"

												If you enjoyed XCOM, chances are you'll enjoy this game. The combat mechanics are much simpler and there is less stratagy involved overall, but the fantasy setting and bloodline mechanics kept me interested enough to play through two full runs. For me the highlight was finding out that I can mix classes to produce soilders with skills from both parents. I'd really like to see an update in the future with more items and classes to work with, but as is the game is good casual fun for a short while.			"

												Double Fine has released several big disappoinments since I Kickstarted Massive Chalice, and I was ready for another big let-down. Guess what ... this is another big let-down.In Early Access, they seemed to have laid a solid foundation, and with a fair amount of effort they could have made a game worth playing. But no, Double Fine doesn't actually DO effort. They half-@$$ every project they start, leaving a trail of unfinished garbage in their wake. This is just another piece of sketchy shovelware that would have been brilliant had they taken the time to flesh it out. It really is a shame.			"

In the beginning it is fun, however you quickly lose the characters which you play with. In the end you don't feel any attachment to your squad and it's just a chore to get through.

												This game has great potential and would be worth the money but for one very important reason. Absolutely no support. The game has been abandoned it was abandoned less than a month after release. No additional content, no polishing to come. It is such a shame that such a great idea will not be improved. I believe if the devs followed the Paradox interactive style of polishing for years and providing additional content they would build up a loyal fan base just like PI has done. I cannot reccomend a game abandoned so soon after release. It really pains me to write this review as I, again, really really liked the idea.			"

												What can I say about Massive Chalice other than to get it? It's good.I remember wishing while I played X-COM: Enemy Unknown that there would be some fantasy equivilent at some point. Massive Chalice does a great job being that and setting itself apart at the same time. While X-COM does offer more tactical and strategic options throughout its gameplay, MC offers a more overall compelling gaming experience.The ability to build dynasties and manage them throughout the course of generations is unique, and something that is quite enjoyable. Breeding in good traits into your various lineages and breeding out bad adds a strategic element I've not encounted in any other game previously. The occasional story elements that pop up while you are advancing the timeline that cause you to make a decision about the management of your kingdom and dynasties is akin to the decisions in The Banner Saga, though definitely less morally heavy.The strategic combats are also quite interesting, made more so by unique enemies and the ability to research (over the course of years) new items, weapons, and armor to use on the battlefield. One con is that you do get used to seeing the same handful of foes used over and over again, though this doesn't get tiresome. They remain challenging throughout gameplay.Something I've noticed is that it may take a game or two to make it through to the endgame of Massive Chalice. If you find yourself starting over, don't despair, this is natural, and from those I've spoken with, it happens. You're not the only one. It does allow you to hone your strategies for the next playthrough and learn the system just a bit better.One last con for the game over all harkens to my initial comparison to X-COM. There is no real customization of the houses that you see throughout the course of the game as they are all predetermined by Kickstarter backers. While it is true that your heroes are very expendable, a feature that allowed you to at least make your own houses and mottos would have been a nice tip of the hat. This is just an aesthetic grievance, and nothign that distracts from how wonderful the game truly is.TL;DR: Massive Chalice is wonderful. Go buy it. I've bought it twice.9.5/10			"

												TL:DR = Manage your kingdom well & always keep a full house!I wasn't going to write a review. But seeing other reviews trying to knock this game because it ain't xcom really chapped my hide. I play xcom. I like xcom. But you know what? I'm sick of xcom. Know what else? I play this game because it ain't xcom.Let me put it another way. XCOM plays like a game. MASSIVE CHALICE  plays like a war. A 300 year war.Other than their genre, there's nothing ""common"" about them.The object is simple. Rule a fantasy kingdom for 300 years to fill the magic chalice and have enough heroes to fight the final battle. Guess what? I've only played the campaign once and reached the 300 year mark. However, my final vangaurds were wiped out in my last prior battle. And my new vangaurds were one year, ONE LOUSY YEAR, away from coming to the capital to save my ***.So I lost.Oh, but it was so much fun!Your heroes age and die. And often at the most inopportune times too. (No crying in baseball).Your relics get passed down from one generation to the next PROVIDED you still have a generation left.You get these random encounters thrown at you with randomized consequences from YOUR DECISIONS (good or bad).You have tough choices to make about building keeps, facilitating marriages, appointting heroes to positions that mean taking them off the battle field...etc.,etc.It's a lot more than the simplified halfassed descriptions placed here by most.I enjoy the keep battles too. Those are the times you get to fight with the heroes you made regents. So instead of going in with five warriors, you're warring with seven. And the goal is to defend the keep at all cost.To tell you the truth, I'm eager to get back at it. Now I think I know what I'm doing. That last battle I had revealed some devastating combos I want to experiment with.Not to mention I need to manage my kingdom better. Running out of heroes is really a pain in the ***.There's a ton more I want to tell you, but this review has gone on too long already.If you enjoy tactical turn-based stategy gameplay, you'll love MC. It's fun and challenging. The combat is sweet, but it's what's outside the combat that really draws you in.			"

												Amber Fletcher was a promising child. She had exceptional agility. Excellent sight and she was quick. She was so eager to join the battle. Great things were planned for her. She was destined to gain battle experience, become the creator of House Fletcher relic and then the Standard at The Crucible or maybe a Regent, if she would still be able to bear children when her parents would pass away. At the age of 19years she went out to protect the borders against the Cadence scum under a protective wing of her mother's sister - Jessica. A mission like many before.Noone expected how accurate the Bulwark's projectiles would be on that day. Amber died defending the borders of her motherland, her body riddled with holes was brought home by her aunt, who would later become a Standard herself. Her uncle Michael who was heavily hungover that day, or maybe still drunk after a night before, was sent to The Guild to become a Sagewright. He would never see battle again. Nor his family, for whom it was all the better.Massive Chalice is a system creating stories. It gives you tools you need to create your heroes, and then it doesn't give you total control over how your tools work. Your choices are not always what defines the outcome of a given situation. Sometimes things depend on chance. Fate if you will. You might hover close to defeat. Losing all your heroes in a hopeless battle, to go on 20 years without anyone able to fight, waiting for the children to grow up and then when time comes you'll need to defend against an invasion with three teenagers who barely have level 2 and under 10hp each. You can still prevail if you use them wisely. They will gain experience, in time, they will become Regents of their respective houses. And when their time comes. They too will pass away.Your heroes will die in this game. They will have children, grandchildren, they will have traits that are positive, neutral or totally negative. You wont have your perfect party built out of them, but you will have some characters that are unusually authentic. They might be sickly, asthmatic, they might be shortsighted. All the positive and negative traits mixed together make the experience a bit like a novel, story-wise. Ultimately, Massive Chalice is a game about challange. You're given pieces. Can you use them wisely enough to accomodate for any chance-based accidents and survive the 300years to win the game?What story will you unfold?			"

												I have to recommend this game.  I've been watching Let's Play videos and then embarked on my own playthrough, and it was a glorious, addictive session.  After loving X-Com and being perturbed by X-Com 2's failure to improve/grow significantly, Massive Chalice gave me that X-Com, can't put it down, strategizing, permadeath-fearing warm and fuzzy feeling.  First, the negatives:I don't like the art style, or the alien self-contained culture (caberjack??  what??).  I don't like being confined to your set of zones, having some be 3x the area of others, no ability to ever take back lost areas or expand your reach, and the mind-numbing ""you can only fight one battle!"" mechanic taken right from X-Com.  I don't like marrying a 71 year old dude to a 16 year old girl, something about that being allowed makes me feel dirty, but hey that's the game.  I don't like that you have to immediately replace a dead regent with their offspring, even if they are in the cradle, that's weird.  And I don't like that some of the AI monsters run in circles or act incoherent.I STILL have an awesome time playing the game.  Time and lives are your only resources - no need to horde gold or decide what to spend on equipment.  You focus on spending two things - time, to find heroes or research or build keeps - and your heroes.  Do you keep this one around for battle, or set him as Regent to sire children for your future army?  Useless characters can find a home at the Sagewright's guild, and your amazing, infertile warrior can teach others as the Standard.  Balancing bloodlines and classes, working all 3 main classes and their subsets to get a good mix while growing more powerful and staving off invasion, it's a brilliant challenge.  Having to decide which of the best 3 sons will continue the bloodline, leaving the others to become Standards or just keep fighting.  Becoming enamored with a character that lasts 3 battles (~45 years), and then seeing their offspring inherit their Relic.  The random events are a little lacking - too often they are minor with no impact, or suddenly take away two of your most valuable characters.  Middle ground seems to be missing.  But sometimes, when your 48 year old veteran asks to go out by competing in the Lash tournament, you grant them their wish.  This game drives home the shortness of existence like few others can - Civilization doesn't show you individual people after all, and X-Com has everyone going from scrub to uber soldier in 3 or 4 months.  In this game you can see your heroes, from the cradle, to 15 year old recruit, to bearded prime-age warrior, to aged veteran, to elderly scholar, growing and changing over time.  It's definitely not a connection like other games - you can't have anyone around more than a quarter of the game, and only that much if you are extremely lucky (and they are only useful for a portion of that).  Your connection will be with 3 or 4 family names that persist over time, if you are lucky, and the relics and experience and traits they pass on.Different, interesting, very X-Com but with enough of its own mechanics to make it shine.

												Very good game, sort of a fantasy XCom with the added element of the complication of managing the bloodlines. In fact, a lot of the abilities in this seem to, oddly enough, have been added into the upcoming XCom 2 . Anyway, I grew oddly attached to my bloodlines and their imperfections and relics, and when some of my originals died off I was very sad. Well worth the $4 I paid for it on sale, and I do imagine I'll get replay out of it because it's less time intensive than other similar games. Could be improved on (does get redundant, wish there was a little more variety for example a regent getting sick so you'd have a limited amount of time to select a successor and maybe that could go wrong and the successor would abdicate or something, and the enemies seemed to ramp up really quickly once they did finally get harder).

												If you're a fan of XCOM's mechanics and you like spending countless hours on upgrading and equipping your troops, you will surely love this game.It may overwhelm you with content when you fire it up the firs time, but that's okay. Don't expect to fully understand how this game works in the first 2 hours (minimal). This game has the potential to keep you interested for countless hours, but it rarely gets updated, so once you get a hang of things it really starts to become boring. But, it takes a long time and many campaign re-starts to get a grasp of it. It really has countless different outcomes, all depending on your playstyle and your decisions. As you may have guessed, the game has those random events that require your decision whether to take the risk or not. Combat is, as I mentioned above, XCOM-like. Which means that it's simple turn-based dungeon chess board. But as you progress in the game, make sure to keep up with the research, it really makes it easier to complete those mid-late game battles.All in all, it's a great game for it's price, and it surely will make you spend hours and hours trying to complete the campaign. I would rate it 7/10 since I am a huge XCOM fan.			"

												Massive Chalice is like X-Com, but the battle takes 300 years, so you have to manage you have to breed your heroes to make sure they fight in battle. You need keeps to get babies to get more heroes for future generations. The regent and partner are no longer able to fight, but the stronger they are, the better their offspring will be. You also need keeps to house each bloodline, but keeps take a long time to build and you can’t do that and research at the same time. If a particular heroes does well enough over several battles, their weapon becomes a powerful relic that is passed down to future generations and is leveled on its own. As you kill the Cadence, the bad guys, you can research more weapons, armors, nation-wide boosts, etc. Not to mention random events, picking your battles, etc. There are a lot of factors you need to deal with and that’s the major strength of the game. On the downside, later in the game, you have to deal with a lot of deaths and it becomes tedious replacing several researches between each battle, for example. Overall, it is still a great game and I hope there’s a sequel that’s a little more in-depth with perhaps less micro-managing. ... I’d also like a way to use Heroes that are not strong enough for battle, smart enough to research, or have the right temperament to train. There are times when more than half your heroes are just waiting around to die.			"

Highly recommend it, bought it on sale and would pay full price for this game. 10/10 BUY IT!			"

												I started of enjoying this game but over time my enthusiasm waned, I've never played XCOM so I'm pretty new to this type of game and I can safely say that overall I didn't enjoy it. The main issue I kept coming back to was just the frustrating randomness of the game, missing two or three 90% chances to hit in a row is just purely frustrating to me. Loading a saved game and executing the exact same strategy only with better rolls is not my idea of fun. I tried to finish the game but in all honesty I was forcing myself to play it from about 60% of the way through, I got to the final fight and just gave up. The art style isn't to my tastes but I could live with it, the map screen is boring after a while as nothing really changes, the voice over’s are repetitive and feel out of place most of the time. I wish you could defend more than 1 region at a time if you had the force to do so, it feels unrewarding especially if you’ve spent effort to try to grow a large enough selection of heroes.Another point on the randomness front, the dialog choice sections that the game pops up from time to time feel shallow and unrewarding, they were often boiling down to ""click this button for something terrible to happen that you couldn't have foreseen"" some of them did play out over a longer time and those ones were OK, however a number were again just random rolls of the dice for something bad to happen and for me, this just isn't enjoyable.

												Possibly some of the negative reviews were from an expectation of what this game is not - this isn't a grand strategy, or grand RPG strategy like XCOM, it's a neat little intergenerational strategy turn-based game. I got a good 20 hours out of it and really enjoyed myself, but if you go into this expecting more you'll be disappointed. The combat is so streamlined that battles go quite quickly, and the strategy element also suffers a bit from streamlining. However, at £10 this game would be a steal.			"

												It's not a bad game but the pace is so terribly slow and the stats aren't accurate so planning your battles is frustrating when it says the damage is between 40-45 and then it hits for 35. There needs to be an option to fast forward the turn of the enemy because watching each unit perform its ten second turn gets old fast.			"

It's true you don't get attached to individuals, but you certainly focus on breeding strong bloodlines. The random elements of this game, keep it fresh, although it is not really a big game, there are  not many enemies, or that many things to research, it allows you to focus, rather than specialize.I encourage anyone who enjoys turn based strategy to play this game, it has a unique style and enough surprises to inspire the curious mind.

I get that ""Losing is fun!"" is the new du joure in gaming, but it's pretty tiresome to waste hours on a game that wants you to fail.  Every choice shouldn't be punished, because that isn't fun, no matter what the cool kids say.Hey though, the graphics are good and everything ran pretty smoothly.  The classes were cool and there was potential for some great strategy if it was ever possible to field a full team.  Running around throwing bombs and whacking folk with cabers was awesome.  Hunters are pretty much the only class that matters though, since every hero is a wet paper bag that dies in two hits.Great loss management simulator, really.			"

The time mechanic is very ineteresting and a unique idea.Overall 9/10. only complaint is that the camera controls are terrible on sagewright levels. Otherwise the controls are fine.			"

												I gave up halfway in.The game is basically a dumbed down version of XCOM.  Less soldiers, less classes, less skills, less mechanics, less.. everything.The artstyle is fairly unique, but also lacks quite a lot of detail.What's the main problem with it? Everything takes too long.Every single action you perform in combat is held up by an unskippable animation.  Reveal an enemy? Camera moves over to it and it unleashes a battlecry, then moves back to your selected soldier. Attack an enemy? Camera follows the attack then moves back to your soldier. Kill an enemy? Camera moves over to it and it dies, then moves back to your selected soldier to show your soldier's battlecry. (god forbid you multi-kill) Get exp? Camera stays centered on your soldier. Level up? Camera stays centered on your soldier. Used up the action points on a soldier? Camera forcibly moves to another soldier. Etc.You can't switch soldiers during an action either.  You're forced to sit and wait and watch until they completely finish their action.There is so much needless waiting that it makes combat take much longer than it should.  This is made even worse by the fact that..Combat is too easy.  Maybe as a veteran of XCOM (the original and the remake) I have much more skill than the average player, but I just found absolutely no challenge at all.  My soldiers basically one shot everything and I never had anyone die; which leads us to...The character balance is really off.  Hunters are supposed to do big single target damage.. but they're weaker than Alchemists who one shot groups of enemies.  I found the Caberjacks to be completely useless. They had high damage, but being melee in this game is awful due to Ruptures (explode on death), Lapses (exp loss when hit) and Withers (age gain when hit; extremely bad).  My main group was 3 alchemists and 2 hunters, though a more optimal group seems like 4 alchemists and 1 high accuracy hunter to function as a band-aid for misses on critical targets.And yes, there are really only 3 character classes.  You can breed different ones together to get hybrids, but they basically function the same, only with a few different skills.  Some of them are objectively worse (ex. Enforcer) due to their skill changes.The other problem with the game is the management and RNG.  You have a very simplistic map with 10 locations on it.  You pretty much build 1 Sagewright guild, 1 Crucible and the rest are keeps to breed heroes.. and you NEED to build keeps ASAP (see below).  Other than that, you can research some weapon and armor upgrades along with some (mostly) passive items.Soldiers (or Heroes; I'll be using this interchangeably) all have unique traits and personalities; completely randomized. Some are just flavor text, some are good and some are horrible.. and they're usually horrible.Soldiers also have ages, and age is a key mechanic of the game.  Your soldiers die from age, and they die frequently as it's usually 20+ years in between combat sessions. (It's like the combat is a side activity compared to how long you spend managing your soldiers.)Age is effectively the most deadly enemy in the game.If you do not start breeding your heroes early, you will run out because they all die from old age.  You can hire a group of 5 heroes, but they're usually far worse than ones you can breed due to coming with a lot of negative traits.  For example, the last group of heroes I hired all came with the 'Slow' personality (among other negatives), which meant they moved less tiles in combat.  It may not seem like much, but the default movement is 4, so that's a 25% reduction in how far they can move per turn.  I brought one on a mission and they were left behind everyone; useless.There's also another very bad one: Heart disease.  The average soldier lifespan seems to be 65.  People with heart disease can die in their 40's.  This makes it almost pointless to even take that soldier into combat, as they'll die far before they get to a higher level. Longevity is the counter to this; those soldiers can last into their 80's, which is extremely useful.So, this means you need to selectively breed your soldiers if you don't want a ton of useless people.  Traits can get passed down from parent to child.  Personalities however can be gained via the 'Standard', someone you assign to the Crucible to train soldiers (passively as time passes).  They also gain both kinds of stats randomly on birth and while they age.Pair two good parents together (if you can even get them in the first place), set a good standard and off you go breeding competent soldiers... until someone dies, or the RNG doesn't give them the traits or personality you're raising them with. Hope they're young too, because the older they get, the less they breed.Oh, and everyone you assign to any of the buildings is forever stationed there until they die.  You cannot take them into combat.  This contradicts the 'Standard' mechanic, since higher level heroes are much better at training.. but what's the point if they just die in a few years?Between waiting so long for combat, having to manage dozens of soldier deaths every time I wasn't in combat, and the combat taking far longer than it should, I just got so fed up with waiting and needless micromanaging that I stopped playing.The UI could also use some more work, especially when trying to manage a soldier.  Everything's too big and takes too many clicks to get to or see information you want (the 4 pages of tabs could be consolidated, and there needs to be a 'compact' mode for lists).  There's also no way to sort people by their traits or even search at all, which makes finding specific people a real hassle.Good voice acting though.  Jennifer Hale and some guy I don't recognize.  Guess all the budget went to them instead of giving the game more depth..If you can pickup the game when it's cheap (below $5), I'd say go for it. You'll have a bit of fun for a day or so, but if you're expecting something with the intensity of XCOM (or even half of it), then you'll start to get frustrated and bored barely 100 years in.  If we could turn off the time wasting animations, then I'd switch this review over to positive and actually play the game again.			"

												This game had a lot of potential. it starts with a fantastic premise, and for the first few years of the game things proceed smoothly but pretty quickly you realize you've seen everything the game has to offer. There is little to no customization- indeed customization appears to be locked in only for kickstarter backers and when you begin a game you're given a choice between choosing Random lineages or wading through hundreds of ridiculous lineages that most often wind up being either extremely dated memes or some variation on BLOODDARKWOLFRAVENGOKU420. Its a small issue, but immediately left a bad taste in my mouth that customization was locked in to choosing between backer lineages when it would have been simple to allow customization of names and such like XCOM.You very quickly meet all possible enemy types, and there is both little variation in enemies and in your heroes. Combat starts off interesting but quickly becomes boring and a real chore. Enemies like to hide in corners and the game feels sluggish when you have to spend turn after turn hunting down weak enemies hiding or running from you with no real threat. The enemies themselves might as well be comprised of Nerf and theres little tactical satisfaction from the battles.Heroes age and die quickly enough that its hard to develop any particular attachment to them or their lineage. Most heroes may be lucky enough to see 2 or 3 engagements if that. If you can feed enough kills to particular heroes, their weapon might turn into a Relic, but again there really isn't any attachment or story or driving force to make me care about slogging my way through the boring combat system. The game just feels simplistic and empty, and the interesting premise never ends up feeling realized. You wind up investing hours in the game hoping it gets better and it never does- you really do see everything it has to offer within the first hour or two. I kept trudging towards the ending out of obligation more than deriving any fun from it before ultimately shrugging my shoulders.			"

Initialy i though 300 years is to little but I must retract on that statement, it feels just righ because of the content and decisions that are crammed into those three hundred.The artistic style and theme of the game is funny and crazy enough but god do i hate hearoes falling during the game play (save and load, save an load, load, load, load,)I still feel bit lost and ovewhelmed with the stats to manage in the long term game play as I have never been the one to either remeber names properly or look into personality traits and keep them in mind - speaking of real life. But I can see that if I WANT  to focus on that side of the game properly, mastering would feel satisfying.Great game because the way they handled turn based tactic. It has some similar game mechanics like UFO but has actually very little to do with UFO at all. They are just similar genre, that all.			"

												Participated in the early access and I'm really happy where this game ended up!  A very well-implemented combination of tactics style combat and civilization management!  My favorite part of this game is how your party can wipe and you feel like you can still win after.  In so many of these squad-tactics games (FFTactics, Fire Emblem, X-Com) losing a key character simply means a restart of the level, but in Massive Chalice it's a great story moment that drives the game forward and keeps it interesting.The random events a la Faster than Light are a little bit of a turn-off at times because you can't see what the possible outcomes are, and they can vary quite a bit from expectations.  They sometimes enrich the story of your kingdom (I once had the last character in a long bloodline with a powerful relic die off without reproducing because he became child-averse!), but for the most part feel a little too much like random monkey wrenches.The 300 year 'goal' is a super solid way to make this feel like an approachable, long-form rogue-like.  That's short enough to reward replays and long enough to give the game a meaningful arc.			"

												Love this game. I needed something new to play, and I really had an desire to play Final Fantasy Tactics again, but that's one of the few FF games not yet released on PC. So, I googled ""Games Like Final Fantasy Tactics"" and this was one of the first hits. The battle gameplay is very similar to FFT, though because of the limited number of classes, it's probably more like Banner Saga. But the overall strategy map is what makes this game interesting and different. The game plays out over 300 years, with 2-5 years elapsing between events. You have to marry your hero characters to make more hero characters, and the skills/genetics of the heroes married reflects in the quality of future generations. You only end up getting 3-4 battles with a hero before they die, so it's an interesting mechanic, and it's been a fun ride so far.			"

												Yes, I recommend it. However, this game is a cautionary tale, for me, about how the story behind your game can make or break it. It took me three tries to figure out how to start the game in such a way as to make it playable long term - starting conditions have a HUGE impact on the end game. I played this game hard, for hours. And I enjoyed it. It became repetative, but I still enjoyed it. The combination of world building and turn-based strategy kept me interested and the story about fighting a battle for survival against an overwhelming enemy made me determined to play it out to the end. Then I got to the end. Fought that last, massive, epic battle. And then.... the story  just lost me. I was actually angry at the story. I HAD been thinking about what I'd like to do differently for my next playthrough. And now I'm not sure I'll ever play it again. If you're not interested in the story, then that won't be a problem.

If there's a ever a sequel, I'd love to see things fleshed out more.It's definitely sad to see your favorite heroes just pass away due to time, instead of taking your favorites through the entire game, but I understand that that would be counter to the central mechanic.

												If XCOM told the story of Game of Thrones, while being set on Discworld, then you'd have a game pretty close to Massive Chalice. And Massive Chalice is pretty close to being very good.First of all, if you enjoyed XCOM, you'll enjoy Massive Chalice. It's got the strategic and tactical layering. It's got the persistence. It's got the simplified, board-game-like rules that allow emergent tactical depth. It's got the skill trees and the soldier nicknames. It's got the panic levels. It adds the bloodline mechanic, where you combine your soldiers together to try and found a family of supersoldiers. Also, it's funny as heck. Definitely pick it up during a sale or something.Where Massive Chalice falls short of being great, though, is failing to go all the way with its new idea. In XCOM, you get attached to and invest in your troops. Massive Chalice wants you to do that, but after two or three battles with any given soldier...they reach old age. I wish Massive Chalice had gone out of its way to get you attached to the *houses,* instead of the individuals in them. I would have loved to see a family tree in each house, with important or venerated house members highlighted. (Battle veterans, Standards, partners and regents, or people who were involved in game events. They could even blank out Sagewrights entirely, so that ""Sagewrights must forsake all family ties"" actually had meaning.) As another example, two of my houses got into a feud. Did I hear songs about how the other house stunk when I click on the first house's keep? Did house members take advantage of the chaos of battle to murder each other? No, there was just a minor penalty to accuracy if feuding house members were in battle together.The other thing that XCOM did much better than Massive Chalice was to give the plot a sense of progression with well-times changes in objectives and cutscenes that shifted the player's priorities and focus. Massive Chalice just tells you the goal at the beginning, and...that's it. Get to the end.This game is a lot of fun, and if you have the imagination to fill in those blanks, you'll really enjoy it. Personally, I think the game world is rich for expansion, and I'd like to see more. (Hopefully including some features to differentiate the great houses in meaningful ways, too)!			"

												Just finished the game. It was a long ride, but totally worth it.A lot of people compare this game to XCOM. There are some shared principles, but you should not see it as an alternative to XCOM, because Massive Chalice is different im many aspects.What really makes this game shine is Double Fine's humour. The enemies, the items, the stories, the heroes have some nice touches that are weird in a good way. There is just nothing more awesome than the warm and fuzzy feeling that you get when a Wrinkler hits one of your wünderpants-wearing heroes.The management of your kingdom does not require you to do a lot of planning (at least not in normal mode). What could really be improved is the management of heroes, because you will have a hard time remembering them all. It makes sense to use a paper notebook to keep track of your plans of your heroes. One very central problem of the game is that it's much harder to get attached to your heroes than in XCOM, because your heroes can simply die of old age. The relic system tries to compensate for that, but it could be more epic. I still got attached to some of my heroes during my playthrough, but it was much later in the game. But once the attachment is there, it's just awesome to kick♥♥♥♥♥on the battlefield with your favorite heroes.The battles start rather easy, but get a lot tougher in the course of the game. The artificial intelligence is not that clever, but if you don't pay attention, it will still eleminate your heroes with unpleasant efficiency. There were many situations where I really thought that I was screwed but with some thinking and planning I could usually find a way out of the situation. And that was just awesome.But even if you fail during battles and lose some or all of your heroes, the game still gives you plenty of chances to recover. It's certainly not too easy (imho) and you can still play on hard mode with iron mode if you like a challenge.In a nutshell, you should get this game if you like- getting out of sticky situations- weird humour- Combining traits, items and seeing how things synergize.- Round-based battles with lots of positioning and special abilitiesYou should not get this game if- You are impatient (A battle takes around 30-60 minutes)- You want a really complex game- You want a deep story			"

												Out of over 500 games I have bought, enjoyed and slightly regretted buying I have only ever refunded two of them. This is one of those. It is so dreadfully boring I cannot imagine where all the money went. You literally sit around waiting for an RNG to pop out babies with traits for you. Then wait for the mists of boredom to launch an attack against you or some pointless research to finish. There literally is nothing to do but play a watered down X-com combined with watching a boring screensaver. No kingdom management, no balancing of issues or planning of strategies, pop out babies, wait, fight, wait, pop out more babies, wait, fall asleep.Save yourself the trouble. Double fine doubly dissapoints as once again one of their kickstarter projects burns down to the ground taking their good name along with it. Give this game a WIDE berth.			"

												Despite overwhelmingly negative reviews, I decided to give Massive Chalic a chance and have really enjoyed myself. I'm close to winning the game for the first time and will do another round. I still fondly remember Ume Graymarch, my first and best warrior and regret accidentally killing off her line 100 years later with a misthrown bomb by a drunk near-sighted Alchemist. My only really issue is with the two 'god' voiceover characters with their annoying voices and chatter.  If you grab the game on sale, it is worthy of your time and don't let everyone comparing it to other games cloud your decision.  "

There's a lot of decent / good ideas in this game - sadly the balancing and implementation was poorly dont and would have needed some work before the release.(Why can't I send different parties to different battles at the same time???)Also: A ton of RNG events that can really, really, really♥♥♥♥♥you up.I wouldn't call it a bad game, but it feels very incomplete and unpolished.Grab it for 5€ during a sale or skip it.

												Great example of a ""Just one more mission I swear"" sort of strategy game.It's a little odd seeing so many down-thumbs in the user reviews talking mostly about what the game didn't manage to be. I approached it simply as a scaled-down XCOM with a bit of a fun blood-lines system that you would have expected from Rogue Legacy. It seems that a number of the negative reviews are mostly people who expected the moon with their early access game and felt suckered when a neat strategy game didn't transcend to another realm.Not all games need to blow your mind. But it's something when a game is able to grab me for fifteen hours in just three days.Comparing it to XCOM is shorthand. It's a slimmed down and more pure experience with far fewer annoying bits like resource management and research (though there is some, it's opportunistic), and it's replaced with a system of bloodlines, marriages, babies, and combining classes.I want to mention that for the first 200 years of the game it's fairly easy once you get a grasp of the mechanics - the first mission I lost two members in the first turn due to carelessness, but after that rarely made similar mistakes. On normal it's quite a bit easier than XCOM, but by the last three battles in the last 50 years or so I was really sweating a number of battles, having to restart a large number of them.Unlike XCOM I wasn't afraid to let people die in battles. In XCOM I was a bit of a pansy, saving and reloading multiple times in a level, but in the estimated 20-25 battles I faced in the 300 year campaign I at most restarted a level due to some boned headed mistake I couldn't stand to live with. The march of time and the raising of heroes from birth means that you get a steady stream of heroes.Oh, and about the bloodlines concept, this game isn't one you should fret over who's best married to who; with tons of time speculating on stats and perks. I never spent more than 20 seconds deciding on who to marry who or who to take into battle over another.I believe things could have been improved to make your familes and vaguards more visible on the kingdom screen to help communicate the flow of heroes being born, aged, and buried. Instead I was left viewing most of my families and soldiers as anonymous people until later in the game when two families started to stand out. One was just a family that bred like rabbits and gave me what felt like dozens of caberjacks.The other family was one that I ended up cheering on as father to daughter, mother to son, etc etc as time went on producing my star unit in every battle from around year 50 to 301. I even went so far as to write down their history and anticipate their nicknames. When the thrower weapon ""Dream Crusher"" became a relic that passed between six different generations it became a tool of nearly guarenteed one-hit-kills. When the holder of the relic died it was always a serious moment when I decided who of the holder's children would be able to carry on the legacy and become my next great vanguard.It all started with the team of Mael ""Rusty"" Fu and his daughter Eleandra ""Wildcard"" Fu blowing things up together. Then came Aaron ""Clam"" Fu, who I felt was a poor substitute for his late mother. He ended up having a quiet career until late in a mission he accidentally killed his daughter and heir apparent Jacqueline Fu. With his elder sister dead ""Dream Crusher"" passed to Bloodroot ""Heavyfoot"" Fu where he became my most vicious warrior. His son Kane ""Red Hands"" Fu continued the bloody mantel, but he wasn't able to make it to the final battle in year 301. His daughter Rebecca Fu took up ""Dream Crusher"" to the final bout where she met her fate. I don't want to spoil it but the ending had me truly excited.I would happily recommend this game and would give it a solid 8.5/10. I'm not eager to return to it after finishing the campaign in 15 hours, but I was addicted and felt accomplished to finish it.			"

												Massive Chalice is very, very close to being an excellent game. Meaning it isn't, but it's nonetheless a fun twist on an old shtick. The pitch - turn-based combat married to kingdom management in service of fighting a generations-long war against monstrous invaders - is dynamite, and it marries the tactical and strategic layers together better than any other game I've seen. If there's a ""but"", it's the game's small budget, which shines through pretty noticeably at the nation level. It's not bad so much as it's thin, so for all of Massive Chalice's strengths, it's a much better fit for Fire Emblem or XCOM fans than those of Civilization or Crusader Kings.The 300 year timeline immediately sets Massive Chalice apart from your average turn-based strategy, and the best bits are those that reflect it most strongly. Character permadeath isn't new, but zooming out to such a long timeframe makes it an inevitability rather than a fail-state. That gradual, unstoppable changing of the guard ends up being the game's biggest strength, since it ensures that your tactical team's composition is constantly changing. Marriages you make in the kingdom produce different unit types, and you'll also be juggling units' genetic and personality traits, plus the kingdom's greater needs and the particular enemy types being battled. It's dynamic in a way that no other tactical game is. Also praiseworthy are the enemy types. While there aren't many, each functions fundamentally differently, and most are threatening not just for the damage they deal to your heroes, but to the threat they represent to your long-term plans.The strategy layer itself is where things fray, unfortunately. The hold-out-until-battles structure is lifted almost wholecloth from XCOM - despite it being unquestionably XCOM's weakest element - and while the addition of dynasty management, legendary weapons, and random events add some spice, the overall experience is frustratingly static. Also not helping matters is the lack of attachment to your heroes, houses, and kingdoms. Watching 300 years drain from the hourglass was always going to distance you from the individual people you're ruling over, but it doesn't feel like you're missing those day-to-day details so much as it feels like they simply don't exist.And ultimately, that's Massive Chalice in a nutshell. The core systems are all there and range from fine to perfect, but it doesn't have the bits of polish that would make it an instant classic. It's very much worth a playthrough, but will not be the kind of game you'll sink thousands of hours into.			"

												This is a qualified recommendation.  I bought this game for $10 during the 2015 Steam Summer Sale and I think it was probably a good use of $10.  I really enjoyed my first playthrough, the graphics have a very interesting style, and the characters and monsters show a ton of variation.The basic idea is x-com, but with less research and upgrade options, but much better gameplay, much more balanced and interesting combat scenarios and much less random nonsense, and with a natural ""retirement"" mechanic in which you generally get no more than 3 or 4 combats out of any specific hero.Instead of getting attached to certain heroes, you get attached to their liniage, raising other members of their family to replace them, etc.The game basically gives you no hints regarding build order or strategy, but despite that I beat the game pretty easily the first time on normal difficulty, so I don't think it's too hard or anything.Overall I think it's a lot of fun and better than X-Com.  I don't know if I see myself playing through it again, but on the other hand I never played through X-Com a second time either so that's not really a huge knock on the game.I think if you're looking for a lot of depth or options, I""m not sure there's that much here for a 2nd or 3rd playthrough but it's still a good few dozen hours of fun for your money.

												Massive Chalice is a turn-based tactics game with a rather unique strategic management layer. The game takes place over time period of 300 years, so in addition to individual heroes you also need to manage their bloodlines.The strategic layer is for the most part rather simple, as you only have access to three different building types. Rather annoyingly once a hero is assigned to a building they are stuck there forever and can never return to active duty.The main complication is the bloodline management at the keeps. Picking the right regent/partner is rather important, as both the class and the traits of the children are partially determined by their parents. The game doesn't do a great job displaying this info, however, and it can take a long time finding the perfect parents.The turn-based battles are passable, but shallow affairs. Double Fine more or less copied the two action point XCOM model but ignored all the advanced features such as height variations or overwatch. As it is, the combat is rather boring and gets repetitive quickly.The time also passes too quickly for you to really grow attached to any of your heroes or their bloodlines. Even the most long-lived heroes will only participate in a few battles before they either die or are retired to a few more productive years of service in the crucibles or the guilds.Like many of Double Fine's recent games, Massive Chalice has some unique ideas but is too deeply flawed to be truly enjoyable. There are just too many annoyances for me to recommend this. I ended up giving up around the year 200 as I wasn't really having much fun with the game.The good:- Bloodline management is a great conceptThe bad:- The tactical combat lacks depth- Repetitive after a while- Annoying enemy designs- Poor writing- Ugly art style, especially the characters- Some UI issues- Random event choices feel more random than meaningful			"

												I watched myself with mild shock last November as I went through with the purchase of this game despite the fact that Double Fine had so recently screwed me and thousands of other supporters in the now infamous Spacebase DF-9 debacle.  But I went through the purchase for two very specific reasons and, as the game passes the last stages of Beta before release, I can say with complete conviction that I made the right choice.Here were my reasons:1) In the past Double Fine has made games that offer solid support to my assertion that video games are a legitimate literary and artistic medium (Grim Fandango, Psychonauts).  I was willing to accept the high chance I was throwing money into an abyss for the unlikely probability that Double Fine would once again contribute a game solid enough to sit on the shelf among such early works of beauty.2) Through reading various blogs I had gotten the sense that a significant element of the development process for MASSIVE CHALICE was the recognition that when it came to the developers' reputation among gamers, they had little or nothing left to lose.  I figured that such an environment had the potential to be completely liberated from expectation, allowing the developers to take risks  in potentially unprecedented ways.My wishful understanding of the developers' internal decision-making processes may or may not be accurate- but certainly they've taken risks with this game.  We've all heard the adage that art doesn't happen in a vacuum.  By nature, art and literature are derivative and combinant of earlier works and other elements of the cultural narratives in which they appear.  The works that move me most tend to be the ones that take these old familiar pieces and recombine them in new ways, such that the unexpected juxtapositions crack open the shells of my assumptions and in so doing reveal to me an insight into a new way of thinking and feeling (think, for example, of Yeats' vision of the Second Coming: ""And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,/ Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"").  In large part Double Fine has conjured such a juxtaposition through the interconnecting of previously disparate gameplay elements and story tropes.The game setting is deeply assymetrical: only a small group of heroes remains to prevent the mindless, monster-spawning ""Cadence"" from entirely consuming reality.  It's an old trope but it's executed with style and the world has a memorable and unique mood and aesthetic.  These heroes must resist the Cadence for 300 years- across many generations of their descendents.  At its core MASSIVE CHALICE is a dynasty simulator.  The player has a great deal of control in choosing which heroes mate, but the resulting spawn are a matter of probabilistic risk.  It's impossible to breed a perfect master race so a lot of thought goes into which characteristics you value most in which combinations.  The combat portion of the game is reminiscent of the relaunched X-COM: three-dimensional turn-based class-oriented squad tactics.  Unlocking characters of more advanced classes involves encouraging certain reproductive synergies- a hero's class is assigned at birth.  I prefer the tension and the sublime sorrow that comes from playing the ""ironman"" style mode.  The game saves in a single path on exit: live with the consequences of your choices and the vicissitudes of capricious RNG.  If a hero dies in battle, that's it, they're gone forever.  It happens often and is an essential element of the game: who am I willing to sacrifice to the greater good and who do I need to survive? Also, once a hero is wed and titled and making babies they can no longer participate in battles, so you are inthe position of frequently retiring your highest level and most effective characters.  To facilitate the siring process the game has a lite citybuilding-style mechanism, in which you can choose to build one of a few types of buildings in the zones that are free from Cadence encroachment.  There are a couple research and production buildings, and then there are keeps in which to house your fledgling dynasties.  Space is very very limited and constantly threatened, so building choices must be made very carefully.I am a person who devotes much of his professional and private life to the uphill battles, the ones that may likely fail but that deserve to be championed.  I hold on to hope when all evidence points to its foolishness. This game speaks to that part of my being with passion and understanding. The overall experience of the game is tense, humorous, challenging, compelling- and frankly beautiful.  On your first playthrough MASSIVE CHALICE will feel bizarre and confusing, but if you are like me, the game's indelibly unique chracter will call you back again and again; what was strange will become intuitive, and what was alienating will become utterly consuming.

												Don't listen to the naysayers.  Massive Chalice is strange, quirky, interesting, and one of a kind.It's get compared to X-Com, and that is not in itself wrong, but it feels completely different.  LIke X-Com, you have both the Strategic Layer, and the Tactical Turn Based combat system.  The difference is the scale is much more massive.  You are playing an imortal ruler and the game takes place over 300 years, with each fight taking place often decades after the last ones.  This means while your heroes level up and gain skills like an RPG, you aren't really leveling them up.  You are leveling up their bloodline.That's the unique thing here.  You can build keeps and then retire two of your heroes from battle to establish a bloodline.  They won't fight any more and can't normally level up any further, but they will pass on their experience and levels to their children as well as various personalities and traits.  You can also pull heroes from the field to be trainers, further boosting their xp and augmenting their traits and to increase your reseach.As your heroes only get to fight one or two battles before they grow old and die, it's all about getting them up a few levels, retiring them to pass that knowledge on to the next generation, and engineering a class of heroes with the best traits and abilities. There's a few more thing, but that's the gist of it.  Go in treating it like a typical combat game with RPG elements and you will get frustrated.  Treat it like the completely unique thing that it is, and you will enjoy it.			"

												Fantasy X-Com with a dash of Rogue Legacy. Thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game, though two simple things would have made it much better: I realize they didn't do this because of the way they structured the kickstarter, but it would have been REALLY nice if you could customize your character names, family names & slogans and maybe even banner. This sort of game is built on the idea of becoming vested in these families and their members, so that it really hurts when ill befalls them, and this is a feature that would have really enhanced that aspect. It also would have been nice, particularly given how the game ends, to have a New Game+ mode of some sort, perhaps where the families you had persist, but you're given a new generation at half their current level and the difficulty is scaled up. Lacking these two qualities, I'm unlikely to ever go back to the game, but I still very much enjoyed my dozen or so hours going through the first time.

												Awesome game that fully lived up to expectations. Not just Fantasy XCOM, but a ton of new ideas for the genre.  Lots of interesting mechanics that can be combined without being overwhelming. Plays great with a controller due to pretty streamlined UI. Art is beautiful and refreshingly new.			"

Early Access Review
								Fun game, however right now it's a little frustrating. It crashes on me pretty much every play through. Sometimes it crashes hard where my monitor goes black and I need to reboot. As far as gameplay, there isn't really much depth here at all. It's fairly X-COM like with the combat. I like turn-based combat,so I'm a fan of that. In the world view where you're not fighting, that's where the game is super basic. It's got some research tree component to it, and a few other things, but there isn't a lot here. I'd say it'd be worth it for $20. However, that all said, despite that it is lacking in depth, I find that I'm still somewhat hooked to it (but I've only been playing for about a week.. not sure how long that will last).			"

												It's a great concept for a game. The idea is a tactical turn based strategy game that is drawn out over generations. So you don't simply manage a squad of heroes, but rather a dynasty and genealogy that you have to develop overy many years in order to breed great leaders and fighters for you to combat this ever-present demonic army threat.As such, many of the threats you will face are not simply the battles but rather the slow passage of time, and the random events that can either benefit you or lose your heroes.I find it very difficult and deeply frustrating but at the same time, I enjoy how involved it is. It brings other elements of strategy into the mix that regular games don't.There's a bunch of small nitpicky things that bother me about it, but it's a good experience overall. If you're a strategy fan, it's definitely worth checking out.			"

												Massive Imbalance. Better have a good amount of alcohol and a sunny disposition before setting off into this game. The mechanics are clunky, and that's generous, as well as the strategy by the ai is set to ""Hivemind Horde Rush"". There seems to be no sense of tactical advantage. You can win every single battle with the same mindset not matter what you face... unless you are 5 heroes vs the one enemy that spawns massive amounts of other enemies, and if it's your 2nd battle you face them... well at least you didn't spend much time in that game. I'm going with this as my final part of the review:How many Tim Schafer's does it take to make a broken game?No one knows but for some reason he and his multi-million dollar company are always asking kickstarter.

												X-com and 4xs are my favorite games.  I wanted to like this, it has a neat concept and a neat art style.  You can't get invested enough in the characters 'cause they die too quick, and frequently you are dealing with inherited traits that you don't like....'cause you don't have enough people to fill vacancies.  The combat is pretty simplistic.I am about 75% through the campaign, in it's defense maybe you can master the game and make it more fun... but I don't know that I'll ever finish it.			"

												The road to bad games is paved with good intentions.Massive Chalice has a good concept and some cool ideas, but is riddled with poor design choices and shortcomings in the gameplay. It feels like many of the problems it has could have been ironed out with better direction or stronger feedback/QA. Sometimes its hidden genius can shine through the mire of its own failures, but only rarely. It's a shame, really, because as it stands Massive Chalice a somewhat unique but ultimately mediocre game. Another example of lost potential, I suppose.			"

												Surprisingly shallow.  The deal breaker is that your leveled soldiers die of old age after about 3 battles, so you are always running thru new soldiers training them up.  If that sounds tedious it is.   The idea is that you give some traits over to the next generation but it is not a deep system.  The reality is that you are using low level soldiers again and again.   The combat maps are flat and mostly static.  No flanking.    I love turn based tactics but this is sadly a 6 out of 10 game,			"

												This is the tale of Chris ""Red Hands"" Antony.Red Hands didn't come from a large house, and was an only child. He quickly proved himself a great hunter, and could have easily solo'ed some missions if he wanted. After leading my army for over 40 years, I built a training school, the first of its kind, and retired Red Hands from battle to become a teacher who would soon influence the rest of the nation with his high level and favorable traits. Within a year, news had spread of his new school, and it was then attacked by a large group of monsters with the intention of trying to kill the teacher who had killed so many of their own. I, as King, launched a rescue party to go in and kill the monsters, and Red Hands barely survived, getting down to 1hp at one point in the battle. Several months after the attack, Red Hands came to me and told me of a love child he, which under the law was illegal without the consent of the King. I decided to show mercy on Red Hands, as he was the most famous warrior in all the land. I decided to exhile one parent, and let one live, but I would let the child choose which. The baby girl chose Red Hands, and he had to watch as his lover was escorted away to be exhiled. Unfortunately, the child inherited all its atributes from the mother, and was predestined to be a terrible warrior. Red Hands taught for 12 more years without issue, and died months before his only child old enough to fight in battle. While Red Hands house will probably never rise to power, and more likely will die out when his daughter is married, Chris ""Red Hands"" Antony will always be remembered as the best warrior these lands have ever seen.

												Interesting game.   Very X-Com ish but in a fantasy setting.   The main difference is that you are charge of maintaining your own bloodlines over the course of the 300 years the game runs.  Choose leaders with strong traits to get the next generation of heroes stronger.   Mix classes to get Hybrid classes.   Assign smart but feeble offspring to the sagewrites guild.   Time passes quickly so you cant get attached to any particular hero.   But their sons and daughters will carry on the family name and perhaps pass down a relic weapon upon their death.Well worth the $5 I paid for it and would recommend the game in the $8-10 range.			"

												From my standpoint i bought this game with Humble Bundle. I had no Expectations.You play as random classes of Alchemist (bomber), Ranger (bow), Caberjack (Tank). Through Bloodlines you can mix these roles up. You the player essentially much like a gardener make more powerful heroes breed meanwhile fighting the good fight.I finished the game and had to make risky moves, lost even heroes that i got attached to (there was a period that i was geting fights all the time). Decision making can be hard for example hero A is your best hero, do you keep him on the field? do you elevate one class? or do you elevate his class?Pros: Art style is amusing, humor is good and player involvment into the game.Cons: The game though they explain the start pretty well, i found some enemies abilities to be unclear until i went toe to toe with them, resulting in deaths of my heroes.  Then again i didn't play the tutorial specificly. "

												I really enjoy turn based tactical combat games. When you are not in battle there is a little strategy as to where you place diferent districts on a map wich help build up your forces, and after so many turns you need to defend 1 of 3 under attack districts. You get diferent bonuses and also need to be carefull. If you fail to defend a district 3 times in a row you loose it.I love the humor. Low poly is beatifully done. And music is very fitting.

												Never mind that Double Fine is a poor company in terms of behaviour; let us focus on the game itself.---------------------------------------------------------I am the Emperor or King of a land surrounded by an eeiry sea called the Cadence; I was created by a massive talking cup and at the age of 0, I was forced to command 5 warriors into battle;The Caberjack, a person who wields a large piece of wood, whose tactics involve hitting people with said wood.The Hunter, a person who can hide, and then shoot things.The Alchemist, the fantasy pre-cursor to Al Queada with their own homemade bombs.At the tender age of 0, I had them run through a building and murder everything. At the tender age of 1, I had to tell one of them to get married to another and start making children. I was, as my mother/talking cup called it, an old soul. I chose to breed up the Urdas, with their massive wood making me strangely aroused.I was then given the choice between spending 8 years learning how to hit people better with the large pieces of wood, or build a castle to let people get married and make children in. Eugenics is okay when you're born from a massive talking cup, you see.Occasionally the cup would talk. I began to worry I was insane. It told me we had to wait 300 years to defeat the Cadence, who rather kindly despite having taken over the world would wait 8-12 years to attack me with perhaps 10 monsters, ranging from those who charged me, and those who shot me. Some would remove my people's experience, and some would simply age them into retirement or voting for UKIP/GOP/Right-wing party of choice.As I forced 60 year old men to marry 16 year old woman for their juicy, juicy fertile bodies, I didn't care because time would fly past and they'd likely die before I ever bothered to learn their names. Eventually, I just learnt the family name.There was the Urda, who hit things. There was the Modes, who shot things. There was the other family who never seemed to quite produce enough children to do anything besides provide more children to continue to line, but never enough to fight. Lazy gits.I made some Crucibles. I told my finest warriors that they were too old to be useful to me, but I won't let them retire or have kids, oh no, they're going to continue to work for me until I find them dead in their bed. When others began to complain, I build some Sagewrights to improve the learning speed of my giant talking cup and I began my Old Age Pensioners working scheme. Sure, they'd die every few years, but plenty more Urdas where that came from.After a few hundred years, I found my bloodlines were flourishing nicely; the subsidation of viagra had helped many 60 year old men breed with their young brides, which is totally okay, because I am the King/Emperor. We had many kids and I would take these children and send them off to work for me their entire lives.Occasionally, I would have to make a choice. Like a peasants riot; however, as I am the King and without me, everyone dies, I can just tell them to shove it and continue and life will go on. I had an issue with an ostrich that ended so poorly that a third of my kingdom was swallowed by the ocean of evil, so apparently we may be Austrialian.After a while, I quickly discovered that covering Caberjacks in Bone armour, pried from the dying flesh of our eternal enemy and given massive hammers made of time monsters who would release bees from their armpits when an enemy sneezed near them and would suck health out of the newby enemies via stones made from the juice of fallen enemies were rather over powered and broke the game.Alternatively, I discovered that Hunters could wear Harry Potter's invisibility cloak and massacre the entire enemy force without being seen and broke the game again.Alchemists, however, suck.There are mixed classes; Alchemist prove their worth by shagging the Caberjacks and making their wood highly explosive to the touch. There is also a stealth wood-waving maniac, and a Hunter who can shoot grenades at such little damage he may as well attach a message insulting their parentage.Anyway, I have to deal with this for 300 years. The same combats, people constantly dying and being replaced by their children, a random choice occasionally destroying half of my kingdom, and my cup yelling at people about its lack of arms.It's a good thing I'm immortal, or I'd kill myself.

												Too small in terms of content and some poor execution in mechanics makes it get stale very fast. I got through my first playthrough, but there's nothing in the game that keeps me wanting to play through the other difficulties. Add on the fact that modding is not available, or (as I hear) planned, I don't see myself coming back to this game.I want to like this game, the core mechanics are good, but it's just a very shallow game.Examples of shortcomings:Most choices you make in management, like marraiges, don't seem to make huge differences. By the end of the game, I had generally positive traits, but it still didn't feel like there were enough traits to make it seem like any one family was really special in a good or bad way. Classes were kind of neat, but there are only 3, each with 2 variations, and your control over what classes you get are constrained by traits due to their inclusion in the marriage mechanic.There aren't many enemies, and the main crowd control mechanic is hard movement of enemies. It does add more depth to the combat that I saw at first, but that was about as deep as it got.Relics are random, and absurdly strong. There are really no other options. You can research a few weapons per class that mimic enemy mechanics, but they still pale in comparison.Research is limited to a few techs, that never change based on playthroughs(though they may be unlocked in a marginally different time frame). I also disliked the idea of having to ""research"" more troops to recruit. I see why they did it, but it seems silly.Perma-death doesn't hurt much in the long run, really just for that battle. If the dead person carried a relic, it is passed on. If the person had good traits, well you chose someone else for marriage instead of them, who likely had even better traits. I would have liked to see more units needed for battles, and the inclusion of regents in the fighting forces, to raise the stakes. The finale was neat, and if the mechanics of battle were better, it would be incredible to play.Lastly, I'd like to see more done with the overworld. It's the same everytime and is, in the grand scheme, rather small. Basically 5 areas, with 2 divisions (10 total), where only the outer region carries any value. On top of that, the invasion mechanic is painfully simple. Bad guys invade 2-3 areas at once. Defend one area to reduce 1 corruption points, other regions gain 1 corruption point. None of that matters unless a region reaches 3 corruption points, at which point it just disappears. I'd like to see regions be affected by corruption, and lost regions do more than just go away.

												Game is quite fun. Good art, story and fun gameplay.You get to fight in turn-based battles which aren't difficult once you understand your way around. Archers are way better than the other classes, alchemists are only useful for their AOE in a few situations and melee are useless until they get lv 10.I really enjoyed the idea of passing relics and trying to select the best characteristics through bloodlines. Often you see yourself in need of a class or another and when you invest in that one you have a boom the next generation but then you might lack another one.It does get very repetitive, they should have other fun mechanics rather than only this management until battle. Also, the choices you get sometimes seems way too random and often penalize more than help.I recommend this game if you find a 30% sale or more.			"

												Massive letdown.  While the rest of the game is solid, the combat is tedious and generic, and there's just not enough to it to hold my interest.  Unfortunately, this game is only as strong as its weakest link.  As addicted as I was to building family lines, I couldn't stand another minute of this weak attempt at a Strategy RPG.			"

												Absolutely gorgeous game, artstyle is absolutely stunning and the interfaces are pretty and clear. I've only played about one third (If I make it) through my first game and some of the more advanced concepts and strategies are still not clear to me, but the game feels amazing. The game is really quite xcom like, but misses some hallmarks like overwatch. This makes the tactics quite a bit different (lost me two great heroes already) and the game is far from trivial.Really, really nice game. Sounds, art, gameplay, they all link up into making an awesome experience.			"

												I followed this game pretty closely in its early development, then let it go its merry way before finally coming back to it this summer sale. Sadly, it hasnt gone far from where I left it. The game itself is overwhelmingly shallow, with only 3 real classes to speak of, and 3 uninspired and bizzare weapon types. The gameplay consists of competent turn based tactical combat and some hero-breeding on the side, with the goal being to keep the monsters out for 300 years while your super weapon charges. After less than an hour of play and a quick glance at the wiki, I can confidently say that there is nothing more to the game, despire what its name would suggest; the game is small, and basic. It fulfils the original goals of the design document and nothing more,and ultimatly feels more like the product of an indie game jam than a kickstarter project. Given that turn-based games like this are simpler to make than real time games, the real test of quality is in the execution of unique concepts that go beyond what somebody simply copying XCOM or Tactics Ogre could have produced. This game has no such features to speak of, other than a fairly basic hero-breeding backdrop, and a quirky aesthetic. Sadly, this game falls behind even things like Banner Saga, which even with its shortcomings is a must play at $10 or less. There is no reason to play Massive Chalice, as once you've read this review you've pretty much played through the entire game. Tell your friends, they'll be so proud!			"

												It's not a bad game by any means just painfully mediocre.  The dialouge tries to be witty and is centered around the two sides/characters of the chalice.  None of the lines are amusing and even worse they often repeat their banter.     As for the game-play it's basically a poor man's X-com  lacking any real fun in the battles and the lack of intresting enemy types leaves much to be desired.    Even worse is the maps are all really small but the slow battle speed makes them run longer than they need to.The lineage system is the only idea that really stands out compared to games similar to this.   But that itself is limited basically you force marriages and try to pop out as many kids as possible.  Those that marry are never to actually be used again other than for breeding and training their offspring.   When they die you replace them handing a new couple the same fate. Old heroes are best to be made into sages but this becomes annoying and real fast. Because of their age and collected experince they tend to be best suited for this job on the flip side they die so quickly due to being old.  So I find myself changing these people more than any other non-combat task.Although there are techically more than 3 classes  there is a primary three and they are all boring. Your standard archer type,  alchemist who lobs bombs but are limited in amount and become useless when all are consumed,  and melee with basically a battering ram type weapon more suited for busting down a door than practical combat use  who brings unpredictable and unreliable results.    Most of the time I just go with all archers if I can as it by far brings the easiest experience.   The classes are boring and bring nothing to be praised.Unfortnately this game was gifted to me so i cannot refund it otherwise I most certainly would have.			"

												Pretty cool and very envolving game where, sometimes, you grow too attached to a character that you know is going to die soon, but can't help feeling sad for it at all. Like XCOM but combat is easier and stakes aren't as high. On the other hand the kingdom and blodline managing part is fast-paced and a whole lot of fun. Has exotic cool graphics and the combat zones don't get repetitive at all, due to various different locations.8/10 --Reccomend playing on Hard difficulty since Normal gets a bit dull at times.			"

												Biggest complaint I hear about this game is that you only get to use your heroes once or twice, meaning you have to keep going back to square one. This is a misguided conclusion. Heroes with high xp are the ones you breed, making their children start off with higher xp.Over the course of the entire campaign, you will work with heroes that slowly have more and more beginning experience and levels. It also sidesteps the problem that often comes with XCOM: losing a hero means restarting the leveling up process or restarting the level. In fact, losing a hero is often fine, so long as you have more in backup. They all will likely be the same general level, so the ones you use in battle are the ones you want to eventually take out of battle for breeding. It's all about planning for the future, and the new types of heroes you get from mixing class types makes for an interesting experience as you try to maintain bloodlines, level up families, relics, and research.And remember which enemies to use your Wunderpants against.I can safely say I've had more fun with this game than with xcom, and while parts of it are simpler, that doesn't mean it's less fun. It's easily more focused, and removes frustrations with the format cleverly.			"

I can remember multiple play-throughs where I personally invested in a child at the age of 10 and then used in combat and then rewarded with a regency and they, in turn, gave me many powerful offspring that made their own stories. Getting invested in characters is very possible and is even more powerful in this game BECAUSE they have such a short lifespan. Ones that stick around and make an impact on your time table really do something to your emotions when they pass. You will remember their contribution.At the end of the game you get a feeling of the journey you have undertaken and your blown away by the horrible reality of the plot. Massive Chalice is one of the few games that gave me a deep emotional connection to the characters and the families that I utilized throughout the game. I bred and built the characters that defeated the end game and what a hard battle that was! Worthy of those that sacrificed their lives!10 of 10 because this game will and IS one of the few that I will play for years and years to come.

												A breeding simulator bolted on to an excellent strategic turn-based tactical game in the style of XCom.There's a threat to your kingdom, one which will try to consume and destroy everything - very slowly.You have a stable of heroes... however, at best, even the most vigorous of them will only live into their 80s or 90s, and most will die in their 50s or 60s. Given that you must survive for 300 years, you're going to have to get new generations of heroes to continue fighting. So you pick two young heroes with the best traits (hearty, strong, bright, etc.) to wed, and over the next several decades, they will produce children, who will grow to become the next generation of heroes to fight the good fight.I felt that both the breeding and combat portions were equally compelling - you start with three types of heroes (hunters, alchemists, and caberjacks), and depending on whom you breed with whom, there are a total of 9 classes which you end up with, which combine traits of their parents to get unique skills (such as the trickshot - a hunter/alchemist, who is able to fire an exploding arrow.) Combat-wise, you've got to deal with the fact that you've got only five heroes (unless you're protecting a keep, when the two rulers will also come to the defense) to deal with potentially dozens of cadence. The game also features typical Double Fine humor, which makes the game that much better.Overall: I was a KickStarter backer at $20, and I felt that I got my money's worth out of it. From what I understand, it's been on sale recently for as low as $8, at which price I would say this is a total steal, and should be purchased by anyone with any kind of interest in the genre.			"

												I enjoy the game. The only complain I have is I don't have many chances to use my heros. In one of my gameplay, I saved a baby by puting him into the chalice and he grew up with very powerful traits, just like a chosen one. But he only participate one mission because he serve his time in a  peaceful time and end up as a standard carrier.I really hope there are more side quest so we can use our heros more. For example, maybe a quest we have to send a scholar with some escorts to collect some specimen in the wild, or a mission that the standard carrier bring some trainee with him/her to learn how to fend off monsters.Overall, I still recommend this game to the people who like turn-based stratrgy games, and it's really cheap now during winter sale!

Fantasy XCOM on a 300 Year ScaleIf you've played XCOM (old or new) you've basically played the tactical side of this game. The thing that lights my brain on fire, though, is the long-term strategic meta-game surrounding it. You aren't leveling a squad of guys, you're shaping the genetic lineage of kingdoms to combat the Cadence.The story is very engrossing, too. I've found myself laying awake at night thinking about the implications of one of the story choices, or the nature of the Chalice attunement.The tactical game play is fun, but nothing new. The setting, though, makes me rabid for more. WELL worth the price tag on this one. Easily good for 2 play-throughs at 8-12 hours apiece.			"

												If you enjoyed the recent XCOM reboot, you will likely enjoy Massive Chalice. If you're like me and enjoy micromanaging Experience Point gains in XCOM, Fire Emblem, and other tactical-RPGs, Massive Chalice might very well become your new favorite game.The ruthless march of time, the negotiation of physical and personality traits, the mixing of hybrid classes - all of these combine to promote compelling decisions of who to send to battle and who to leave to raise the next generation of heroes. Others have remarked that the combat is not deep, but I disagree; when coupled with the long-term strategy layer, every decision in combat has an impact to the greater game, and the developers got a lot of leverage out of a somewhat small number of maps with randomly placed elements (compare to XCOM which had a larger number of completely pre-made maps).It might take some time to really get a good grasp on the mechanics - perhaps 1 or 2 playthroughs at 15-25 hours each, if you make it all the way. But when it gets challenging enough to the point of spending five minutes on a single turn to make certain that no one dies (and then actually pulling it off, and then actually being able to continue the heroic bloodlines and pass down relics), Massive Chalice is wonderfully satisfying.Plus, the devs were extremely nice and open about the process of making the game. =) And there are Bees in Bottles and smily-faced rocks.

												I really enjoyed playing Massive Chalice.  I never felt like the maps got old, and they kept progressing the difficulty at about the proper pace.  I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the turn-based strategy genre.I played on Iron Mode with Normal difficulty and it was my first time playing.  This meant no going back to another save and trying again.  I had to learn the hard way about how some of the skills do and do not work in various situations.  More than one time, I ended up blowing up my own people by hitting the wrong button, but I can't blame the game for my own stupidity.The one con that I see is I don't have a strong desire to go back and play it again.  Because of Iron Mode, I ended up learning while playing, and I don't think the game could recreate that for me now because I have down how most things work. "

												Massive Chalice has some great qualities and some ""less-than-average"" qualities, but I think for its target gamer, its a great game.The Great:The unique part of the game that separates it from the other ""turn-based"" combat strategy games is MC's ""breeder"" system.  You build ""keeps"" and choose an initial two characters with a variety of good and bad traits and they create offspring with similar traits to create a bloodline.  The strategy is to try and breed out the bad traits while influencing the continuation of the good traits.  All the traits have a real effect on the game and all your people die eventually so you need to always be looking at the next generation and beyond.The voice acting in this game was a real win for me.  Usually in games it can get really repetitive and annoying, but this game the parts are quick and relevant and at times humorous.  The Average:The combat system feels borrowed from similar games like XCOM and others, not that its bad, just dont expect much innovation there.  Its your basic turn-based combat, each ally and enemy has one move action and one attack action.  You do have the freedom to develop your own strategy based on your preferred play style.  I  particularly enjoyed using the ""Hunter"" classes and move around the board in stealth fashion.The Less-Than-Average:If amazing graphics are your thing you can probably skip Massive Chalice.  What you get is practical but not on par with most games produced these days.The complexity of the game was rather shallow.  There is only a handful of enemy types that get harder as time passes, also there are only three classes although through breeding you can increase that to nineOverall:Massive Chalice is a good game and held my interest to over 50 hours.  The most satisfying thing for me was the breeding system and trying to develop the traits that helped me in combat the most.  I would and have recommended the game to my friends.			"

												The bloodline mechanic is one of the most interesting and unique I have encountered so far, definitely worth buying to experience. However, I can't help but feel there are so many missed opportunities that would make this from a good game with little replayability to an amazing game with tons of replayability. This is one of those games which I hope they make a second one, it does lead itself towards that.I have some comments if I may be so bold.1. No family tree at the end was disappointing, I really wanted to see how convoluted and inbred my houses were.2. Cadence weapons and armour seemed pointless, bloodline relics and top armour outperformed, so i never used them. Also, bloodline weapons with special affects like fire, knockback or something would have been nice.3. Would have liked some big boss Cadence to break up the monotony of the standards.4. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! (The censored word is B_astards, not a rude word, an actual proper term) This game needs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. these heroes are living their entire lives under threat of death by Cadence, being forced to give up everything and join the Sagewrights because they are clumsy, or being forced into marrying an old timer in a last ditch effort to keep a bloodline going. I think in this situation the heroes would be shagging like nobody's business and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s would be popping up all over the place. Yes there was the standard baby random event but that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the kid should have been adopted by a house.5. Kid's classes was too static, so this kid's a rebel but is the same class as everyone else in the family, sounds like a wannabe. Would have liked some randomness in there so that an alchemist and a caber could sometimes have alchemist or caber kids as well as the majority being the fusion.6. More optional missions would have been cool, like attacking a seed hatchery or something to win back some corruption points.*Minor spoilers below*The ending was terribly unfulfilling, the little twist at the end made me really hopeful and think there was going to be a ""New Game +"", where  the Cadence is back and the chalice has been reforged thousands of years later, maybe with the last dregs of your major factions and a bloodline relic or two? But no, it just ends... or they are setting up for MASSIVE CHALICE 2!! In that case then well done, I want it.*Minor spoilers above*If you actually read this then thank you, please make another one!!			"

												Massive Chalice reeks of the infectious charm every Double Fine game is known for. Unique classes, graphics, animations, and, best of all, a foundation that takes some of the best genres and mixes them into its own unique brand of gameplay.If you've played XCOM: Enemy Unknown you'll be familiar with the combat in Massive Chalice. You have a team of five that you will take into battle, known as your vanguard. This vanguard will gain power through both leveling up and research done in your base. However, there's much more to the game than that. Your heroes will also learn new abilities to use in battle, creating fun, strategic combinations when utilizing various classes.The story drops you into a war that will last 300 years. During this time, you will be required to manage your heroes' bloodlines through a system of arranged marriage and pairing. The children they create will inherit similar stats, traits, and abilities. They will also get their initial class training from their parents. Once they reach sixteen years of age, they are then deemed fit for combat and are put into your pool of eligible Vanguard, Trainers, or Scholars.As the years pass, you will find yourself losing some of your favorite heroes, only to be replaced by their descendants. If one of those dying heroes performed well enough in battle, he or she will leave behind a family relic: a weapon of great power that gains it's own levels. This relic can then be passed down to others of the same house. This weapon can eventually become a very powerful artifact that will tip the scales of battle in your favor.In addition to managing your bloodlines, you will be asked to make decisions on how to spend your precious time. You may build new buildings in your territories, research new items, weapons, or armor, or you can even spend some time recruiting new heroes or adopting children to be future heroes in order to fill out your roster. As the game time is finite, it is crucial to plan ahead and have a goal to strive for. Keeps are nice, but if you build one without a potential bloodline to propagate, that keep will go unused.One of my favorite parts of Massive Chalice is the fun and witty narration. There are two narrating characters, and their commentary and banter in the background as you wage this 300-year war creates a sense of the world you are defending.You can find more of my ramblings about video games at www.chatswithrad.com "

												I enjoy the game. The only complain I have is I don't have many chances to use my heros. In one of my gameplay, I saved a baby by puting him into the chalice and he grew up with very powerful traits, just like a chosen one. But he only participate one mission because he serve his time in a  peaceful time and end up as a standard carrier.I really hope there are more side quest so we can use our heros more. For example, maybe a quest we have to send a scholar with some escorts to collect some specimen in the wild, or a mission that the standard carrier bring some trainee with him/her to learn how to fend off monsters.Overall, I still recommend this game to the people who like turn-based stratrgy games, and it's really cheap now during winter sale!

												Making the hero bloodlines was a cool idea but lacked any customization. The game throws a tremendous amount of data, stats, and effects at you, but then goes to immediately show that it all doesn't really matter. The combat was pretty one dimensional and I just didn't come to care about any of it (this reminded me a LOT of banner saga 1, not in a good way). It's basically XCOM very dumbed down with all the real meat and potatoes stripped out. After an hour I just felt like I should go play XCOM instead, so I did.If you want a turn-based strategy where you don't have to think much, and you like medieval themes, this may be for you.			"

Fantasy XCOM on a 300 Year ScaleIf you've played XCOM (old or new) you've basically played the tactical side of this game. The thing that lights my brain on fire, though, is the long-term strategic meta-game surrounding it. You aren't leveling a squad of guys, you're shaping the genetic lineage of kingdoms to combat the Cadence.The story is very engrossing, too. I've found myself laying awake at night thinking about the implications of one of the story choices, or the nature of the Chalice attunement.The tactical game play is fun, but nothing new. The setting, though, makes me rabid for more. WELL worth the price tag on this one. Easily good for 2 play-throughs at 8-12 hours apiece.			"

												This is such a cool game, I was hooked the whole way through. While enemy types do get repetitive after about the half way point, it feels really rewarding to build up a bloodline - as in games like X-Com, you will be hugely attached to people you take into combat multiple times, and seeing those soldiers age and eventually die is heartbreaking. There's nothing else at the moment doing anything quite like this; it's really worth experiencing. Music is fantastic, the visual style is consistent and appropriate, and while it lacks the strategic depth of say, X-Com, the combat is still satisfying.			"

												If you enjoyed the recent XCOM reboot, you will likely enjoy Massive Chalice. If you're like me and enjoy micromanaging Experience Point gains in XCOM, Fire Emblem, and other tactical-RPGs, Massive Chalice might very well become your new favorite game.The ruthless march of time, the negotiation of physical and personality traits, the mixing of hybrid classes - all of these combine to promote compelling decisions of who to send to battle and who to leave to raise the next generation of heroes. Others have remarked that the combat is not deep, but I disagree; when coupled with the long-term strategy layer, every decision in combat has an impact to the greater game, and the developers got a lot of leverage out of a somewhat small number of maps with randomly placed elements (compare to XCOM which had a larger number of completely pre-made maps).It might take some time to really get a good grasp on the mechanics - perhaps 1 or 2 playthroughs at 15-25 hours each, if you make it all the way. But when it gets challenging enough to the point of spending five minutes on a single turn to make certain that no one dies (and then actually pulling it off, and then actually being able to continue the heroic bloodlines and pass down relics), Massive Chalice is wonderfully satisfying.Plus, the devs were extremely nice and open about the process of making the game. =) And there are Bees in Bottles and smily-faced rocks.

												Games got its fair share of ""why would you make it like that""'s and bugs, but all in all it is a pretty fun alternative to the XCom reboot (Which also had its fair share of issues).  The 9 different classes all play fairly different, and the generations mechanic has good and bad things about it. The main bad thing about it is that often times you won't be able to put your heroes where you want to before they die of old age, and that since years go by so quick you don't really get attatched to any one character. The good thing about it though is that it leads to varrying up your party compelation and play styles because while in XCom EU you just always picked your most powerful units, in Massive Chalice you may have the choose between your 62 year old level 6 Alchemist with a lot of good traits and a heirloom, and a 17 year old level 3 Cyberjack with good and bad traits and no heirloom, which come down to do you want an easier fight now but harder fights later or a harder fight now but a more experienced hero when your Alchimist dies before the next battle.All in all it has things better then XCom EU, and things that are worse then XCom EU but if you like turn based strategy games that have both in combat and out of combat strategy elements I would say it's well worth the asking price.

There just isn't much variety really. You get a few different landscapes, but they are just laid out different each time.You get to build or upgrade something every now and then.The rest is clicking on the clock and watching time pass.... literally.... waiting for an invasion or your building/upgrade to complete.The chalice ""small talk"" gets old... fast.I really like the concept of the game.

You can make some pretty cool teams. I  had fun running a Caberjack, Trickshot, and any combo of the 3 alchemy types. Gave me good range, AoE, Scouting, Tanking, and Healing. Definitely reply value. I plan I playing at least a few more playthroughs to try other combos of classes. Very Fun. Worth the Money. Took about 35 hours to beat...			"

												Massive Chalice is a turn based strategy game. The combat gets boring, repetitive, and easy, even though there are stronger enemies later on, your nation is, at that point, stable enough to produce high level characters that deal with enemies with no issue. There is absolutely nothing for you to do between battles and research, except for replacing people who die of old age and getting random events that have very little effect on the game. At best, the game will reduce corruption points on a region so that you won't lose the land. At worst the game will kill off a character. But for the most part the game will be mundane and simply give one of your characters a personality trait that usually have little effect on your game. The game arbitrarily kills your accuracy against quite a few enemies, and I've observed that the RNG is just wrong. I've had a team of 5 archers on brutal fire at a single advanced seed enemy with 50% accuracy. I would have had 2 archers land shots, but I wasn't able to land a shot until 3 rounds had passed.The game is still enjoyable, but don't buy at $20, and of course just buy X-Com			"

								This game is a turn-based tactical game that has similarities to X-com with time/resource management mixed in and so far it is fantastic. The game forces you to make hard choices on how to handle your heroes. Should you keep your level 5 hunter ready for battle or retire him from battle and marry him off to pass on his genes. The monsters in this game are interesting as well and can make you think about the right way to take them out without losing a hero (or having something misfortunate happen to them). Can't wait to see the game when it is fully polished.			"

								I desperately wanted to give this a No, given that it's comming from the company that lost any possible claim of credibility with Early Access games, but I just can't.I was a big DF fan, for the games they had done before, and for keep on innovating on their smaller Amnesia'ed games. I even went personaly to their offices and gave Tim a framed fan art[dl.dropboxusercontent.com], and got The Art of Brutal Legend signed by the team, and a Brutal Legend box signed by Tim, so you could say I was a ""fan-boy"". But I didn't much care for Broken Age, as I think it devolved the genre rather than evolve it - I'm sure the next logical step is to keep bringing the number of interactions down, so it will go from one to zero, and the game will just play by itself...But then the DF-9 fiasco brought down my fan-boydom overnight. I understand the logic they were working on, but a lot of people today simply no longer buy Early Access games, and were waiting for the game to come out. I was one of those people, and now they'll never see that money. So I believe that any loss they would incur now during development would be made up after relase, but now not only did they severely hurt their prospects with any future Early Access games (and Kickstarters too, I'm sure), they've managed to further distance most players from Early Access titles (which I'm not overly concerned as a player, but as a developer with an Early Access title on Steam myself, this affects me personaly, so color me biased...).That said, this game is VERY good and deserves your attention. The art style oozes personality, and the strategy layer that takes place between missions is very deep and engaging. If you get too attached to your fighters you will be disappointed, as if they don't die in the battlefield, they'll die of old age. But that's a good thing and not a bad thing like some reviews here state - you can't possibly be interested in a game for it's multi-generational layer, and then complain that your squad is not made of Methuselahs that live 500 years. Fighter recycling is at the very core of the game here.Another great thing is that you'll have some very tough decisions regarding were you allocate each of your peoples. They can be fighting, but they can also be assigned as:- Regents and their partners make new heroes and pass their traits on.- Scholars decrease building and 'science' time- Defaults give XP and other bonuses to heroes.(I don't think these are the proper names, but that's the gist of it)You want your best people on these roles in order to keep improving and have better heroes in the future, but you want your best heroes in your squad to fight the missions and not get slaughtered.The tactical battles are good but not great. Yes, X-Com is a better game on this regard, and if this is all your care in a game of this type, then by all means, install the Long War mod and avoid this game. I for one like to have a deeper strategy layer, and I think Massive Chalice beats X-Com in that regard. Given this game's budget compared to X-Com's, I think 1-for-1 is pretty darn good. Is it an inferior X-Com clone? Most certainly not, as it does a LOT of things differently, both in the tactical battles (even if I personally don't like them), and specially on the strategy layer.My two biggest complains with it so far:1. This game requires a decent ammount of min-maxing to make good decisions on the things I mentioned earlier. This is not a bad thing on itself, I enjoy min-maxing games, but it does lack features that allow you to min-max efficiently, like robust tools to sort, filter and compare heroes stats and traits.2. Alchemists frequently do something like this:

I'm waiting for the official release to keep playing more, specially due to my first issue there. That said, if the worst came to happen and the developer just walked away today (it's certainly not a far-fetched idea...), I think the game already delivers it's full price in entertainment value as it is. That's why it gets a Yes from me, no matter how much I wanted to not like it.By the way, if you've read this far, I'm going to plug my game I mentioned earlier. Behold, the Adventurezator:I'm working on a loss too during Early Access BTW, but I assure you that you won't see me throw my hands in the air and give up because of this.And if you are curious about the art I mentioned earlier, it's from the intro cutscene for this game (you can watch it on the store page)			"

They can be fighting, but they can also be assigned as:- Regents and their partners make new heroes and pass their traits on.- Scholars decrease building and 'science' time- Defaults give XP and other bonuses to heroes.(I don't think these are the proper names, but that's the gist of it)You want your best people on these roles in order to keep improving and have better heroes in the future, but you want your best heroes in your squad to fight the missions and not get slaughtered.The tactical battles are good but not great. Yes, X-Com is a better game on this regard, and if this is all your care in a game of this type, then by all means, install the Long War mod and avoid this game. I for one like to have a deeper strategy layer, and I think Massive Chalice beats X-Com in that regard. Given this game's budget compared to X-Com's, I think 1-for-1 is pretty darn good. Is it an inferior X-Com clone? Most certainly not, as it does a LOT of things differently, both in the tactical battles (even if I personally don't like them), and specially on the strategy layer.My two biggest complains with it so far:1. This game requires a decent ammount of min-maxing to make good decisions on the things I mentioned earlier. This is not a bad thing on itself, I enjoy min-maxing games, but it does lack features that allow you to min-max efficiently, like robust tools to sort, filter and compare heroes stats and traits.2. Alchemists frequently do something like this:

I'm waiting for the official release to keep playing more, specially due to my first issue there. That said, if the worst came to happen and the developer just walked away today (it's certainly not a far-fetched idea...), I think the game already delivers it's full price in entertainment value as it is. That's why it gets a Yes from me, no matter how much I wanted to not like it.By the way, if you've read this far, I'm going to plug my game I mentioned earlier. Behold, the Adventurezator:I'm working on a loss too during Early Access BTW, but I assure you that you won't see me throw my hands in the air and give up because of this.And if you are curious about the art I mentioned earlier, it's from the intro cutscene for this game (you can watch it on the store page)			"

								It's a fun game with great art and music but not many options about classes and traits. I remember Kickstarting it with them talking about how many different classes there would be because you could just have two parents have kids and then they would have the skills of both parents making a whole tree of class options. For now there are just three options but soon hopefully there will be more. Aside from the lack of options this game is amazing.			"

								Really enjoyable game.  Basic gameplay is similar to X-com but with a fantasy spin.  The innovation comes in the character ""breeding"" and managing your kingdom in the short and long term.  The game is also overflowing with personality - the voices (yes, plural) of the chalice and the banter epitomize this.  If you like kingdom management sims, Xcom-likes, or strategy roguelikes, definitely check this out.			"

								This game is a turn-based tactical game that has similarities to X-com with time/resource management mixed in and so far it is fantastic. The game forces you to make hard choices on how to handle your heroes. Should you keep your level 5 hunter ready for battle or retire him from battle and marry him off to pass on his genes. The monsters in this game are interesting as well and can make you think about the right way to take them out without losing a hero (or having something misfortunate happen to them). Can't wait to see the game when it is fully polished.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is still early access at time of review.  I've completed my first playthrough in ~15-18 hours, I believe.Overall, I really like this game because it provides consistently difficult choices which are only going to last a short while before you have to make even more. I should have restarted once I got the hang of everything because you're semi-pigeonholed once you're up and running with the initial choices - however I won and it was fun seeing how far I could get and seeing what I can do with it all.There's a really big timeline which I believe is ~300 years. The ultimate goal is to hold off the monsters for 300 years until the Chalice can do something epic and cleanse the monsters (the Cadence) forever(?). Any time you need a building/research/item for your people/weapon/armor to be made you can only pick 1 of those things. Often research takes anywhere from 5-20 years and you cannot research anything else during that time. You can only hit the ""fastforward"" button on the timeline and hope nothing bad goes down. Once something occurs the game pauses and you can deal with it, whether it's research or an attack on your lands.You've got heroes from different houses and you appoint a male and female regent & partner so they can create offspring. The templates of their traits and tendencies for stats come together and create children that are then trained to be fighters. Your characters are constantly dying from battle but more often from old age, and you have to continually supply new ones to keep things running smoothly. The big battle here is to make sure you appoint people who are very fertile with good stats so you can supply enough for upkeep. You can sacrifice 7 years to recruit new heroes. Deaths of any kind are permanent in here. It's actually a tad depressing, because I actually found Brad Muir (Thed esigner) as a character and watched him grow old and die.The combat itself is very reminiscent to a partially simplified XCOM which is not a bad thing at all. It provides challenge from the get-go, with enemies that you absolutely do not want to get close (they'll explode, they reduce your XP on hit, or their melee makes you 5 years older every swing), enemies that keep their distance and snipe, or enemies that create other enemies and you're in a mad dash to kill them so the flow of creatures stops.You can save and load throughout your timeline so there's no real pressure if you make a terrible mistake - you can load an older save you'll get an entirely different scenario all together. This is a bit of a player crutch but it's not unwelcomed since I'm 7 hours in and I'm still not through the whole timeline..The art is cool and the UI is fairly basic in a good way. All you really see is the damage spread you'll do and the amount of HP left on the creature. Moving and attacking are fairly simple.Characters in your ranks gain abilities as they level, each one being a ""one or the other"" choice down the chain. I've never gotten down the entire chain before dying of old age, so I don't know what some of them do.The classes are hunter (ranged stealth DEX), caberjack (melee, knockback tank STR), and alchemist (mid-ranged finite amount of bombs being thrown --- honestly this class seems to be a bit weak, I can't find anything very good about it. INT). You deploy up to 5 at a time, and really, less than 5 heroes is often going to be a tough challenge.I just bring hunters and caberjacks due to the types of enemies I've been encountering. I generally don't want them anywhere near me so I just try to snipe them all before they close any ground. I also like using the hunters to go invisible and scout out the territory so I know how I want to set up.  You can lead enemies into traps if you just set up your hunters and have the caberjack as bait.So yeah, totally pleased with my purchase on this one. It's got its kinks, especially if you've appointed characters of different ages offset in such a way that it'll keep stopping you and asking you to appoint people to thrones or roles. Stop, transition animation into building, click on a guy from a list, exit from menu, fastforward on timeline (repeat x5). The kinks, though, especially for an Early Access title are very small and the overall thing has felt solid.And yeah, the art is solid and simple. The environments have breakables/exploding stuff/hazards. It looks good.A word of warning at the time of writing - DO NOT TRY TO WIN THIS GAME.  THE ENDING IS CURRENTLY IN FLUX AND IT WILL MURDER YOUUUUUU.   Check my screenshot to see my experience there  :)			"

								Heyyo, I was a Massive Chalice Kickstarter backer after having seen the fantastic pitch video. :)Double Fine has delivered on their promises of Massive Chalice. It's turn-based strategy, permadeath, bloodlines, relics and strategy where you play as a ruler who is immortal and guides his people in a war that spans 300 years.So as a ruler? You get chalise-attuned heroes which means not just any pesant can join your ranks. You can aquire them from mating your heroes in keeps via bloodlines which at random of a hero death may lead to a bloodline-tied relic, an extra-strong piece of equipment that gains effectiveness as the hero it is equipped to gains experience... So you're constantly balancing researching new technologies, building keeps/sage towers or Crucibles (for boosting experience points of your heroes per day by dedicated a hero as a Standard Bearer). Plus? You can't forget about random events... oh yes, they are random, interesting and both rewarding or dangerous. ;)I'm only on my first playthrough and have made some bad choices and have been paying for them... but it has taught me that no two playthroughs are the same and this game is definitely a gem. I definitely intend to do more playthroughs after waiting for a few patches and changes to the game.Right now? It's on patch 0.85 and is pretty fun. There is a few balance issues with the game... namely Hunters (the archerer class) is overpowered compared to the other classes. I found using 4 Hunters and 1 Alchemist (a potion-based warriror/mage class... thingy or something lol) was the most efficient team of heroes to use in combat. Mainly because the Caberjack (melee warrior class) has several disadvantages due to the unique properties of the Cadence (the evil forces of the game). For example, Wrinklers are an enemy type that does melee damage and causes aging effects if they hit you... but with a team of Hunters and Alchemist? You can usually take them out before they get close to you... Lapse's are an enemy that cause your characters to lose their memories (experience points in this case) and when they die? They explode and cause minor damage to anyone nearby but also there's a risk of getting stunned... Rupture's are suicide units and wether they die or kamikazi? They explode and do minor damage but lower armor effectiveness (called armor corruption). All three of these enemy types can be easily dispatched from a safe distance. Debateable? But you can research and equip Wünderpants to negate the aging and memory-loss attacks of the Wrinklers and Lapsers... but it takes up the only item slot they get which means no health potions or Max HP buffs and they can still damage you or stun you... so once again, better from a safe distance. Plus, if they get close? Alchemists are decent melee units... so I always sent any camberjacks I recruited to the Sage Tower (helps lower research time) or as a regent's partner for breeding.So yeah... Massive Chalice is a darn fun game, but it does need a little patch refining to especially make Camberjacks more effective... they need a bigger healthpoint pool and dare I say more than one inventory slot for acessories out of the gate. Upgraded? Camberjacks are pretty handy... but they usually have an average Hitpoint pool just like the other classes and that's not good when they're supposed to be in the front lines taking abuse.. and abuse they shall take.

												It's difficult to fully recommend this game. I've waffled between thumbs up and down. If it's on a 50% sale, it'd be a good buy.The combat is good, but it's largely the same thing over and over. You and the monsters get more powerful, but the monsters don't change. You change some due to the skills chosen. Terrain is overly simplistic. There's no cover rules and the terrain variation is very limited. Managing bloodlines is interesting, but if you do it poorly you don't realize it's a lost game until much, much later. In some ways that's good as your decisions have long term impact. In other ways, it's bad as you invest a lot of time in a lost cause before it's clear the game can't be won. It's almost a good game.			"

												Your kingdom is dying. The Cadence - a pestilence, an army of monsters, an evil slime mold - is closing in around you. And the only thing you can do is trust in the wisdom of two disembodied advisers talking to you out of a large cup/fountain. They're telling you that the Cadence can be beat. It'll only take three hundred years and men and women of noble blood to fight the good fight. You'll see families turn into dynasties, the clumsy 'slow learner' turn into Lydia 'the Rose' Kendrick, your most formidable alchemist, and all the while, the rotting of your nation will continue. The outer regions will fall and heroes will die. All to the accompaniment of a soundtrack that's appropriately mournful, graphics that are appropriately understated (though I will admit a little more variety in the character models would've gone a long way) and surprisingly engaging voice work.Massive Chalice isn't perfect, and I don't think it holds up well to multiple playthroughs. But as someone who's not particularly good at tactics games, and whose poor decisions early on made even a 'normal' difficulty game really harrowing around the year 150, this game's tone, aesthetic and the actual difficulties I was facing came together in a super memorable way.

												Pros: Low poly art style, polished user interaction and gameplay, a good challenge. A quality game. There is a lot of content here.Cons: The game is divided into a more strategic (map, buildings, research and people management) gameplay and the tactical gameplay, which is much like the UFO series. Sometimes you just want to play the strategic variant, but you are forced to play the tactical game where you take down enemies, with regular intervals. Both are pretty fun, though.Recommended if you like turn-based battles.			"

								I really love this game!!! Thanks for making it... really reminds me of X-COM enemy unknown. A lot of critical decision makings on the deployment of heroes and scenarios that pops up every now & then that you have to make decisions to. Its really cool. The part where your heroes get to age is an added twist to the gameplay. The downside to this is that your heros can die due to natural cause and you might not be able to see your veteran heroes full potential. I have yet to unlock all their skill trees but they will die before I can even get to that, died to natural cause.Yet overall, I will still recommend this game to everyone who loves strategy game as it still a lot of fun and enjoyable game.

Strategy-lite,  XCOM combat style, accelerated time, dynastic marriage systemOn the one hand, Massive Chalice uses squad based combat similar to XCOM. On the other, you breed new heroes by arranging marriages (kind of like Crusader Kings 2). The traits of the parents, good or bad, can pass on to the children. Producing children is vital because in-game time passes quickly. Battles occur about every 10 years, thus your combat squad composition changes nearly every fight as heroes die naturally. Overall, I think it's a decent strategy game for different types of personality. If you are the micromanaging type, you can spend a lot of time looking at character sheets to optimize marriages and squad selection. If you are a casual player, the game is forgiving and does not have a lot of complexity. There are only a dozen or so enemy units which get tougher.The art style may not be for everyone. The game sort of looks like if you turned the graphic settings to the lowest, giving everything a slightly geometric, block-like quality. This is by design, makes it unique but I can see it turning some people off. However, the use of color is amazing and to me, made the game visually memorable.			"

Started playing and couldn't stop.Here's the breakdown:Graphics (9/10)Loved the blocky look of the units, landscape, and map. It made me think of a stained-glass window come to life and worked very well for a medieval setting. The drastic diffences in the look of armor and weapons (especially the heirloom weapons) added to the unique look of the units.Audio (6/10):While the music was nice and the dialogue was humorous, I found myself listening to the comments of the narrators repeat over and over again early on in the game (about 1/3 of the way through). The voice acting itself was good, though the female actor clearly understood the witty dialogue better.Gameplay (9/10)The best compliment to pay the game is that it is very similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown in its turn-based combat. The political parts of the game added a lot to the time between battle -- putting emphasis on makin' babies (the more children you have = the more units you have and the more options you have for putting specific people in specific positions of power). Battles gradually got harder as the story neared its 300-year mark, causing new enemy types to appear battle after battle, though I never felt like the game gave me more than I could handle. One issue that I ran into was that I could completely exploit the Alchemist units and by the end of the game could have a squad of fully-upgraded Alchemists who could wipe the floor with their almost OP abilities. Especially since the last mission allows you to continually refill your flasks.Story (7/10)Watching 300 years of a country pass by while I attempted to save it from unknown baddies really emersed me in the world and, although the story is as simple as that, made it feel quite real. Seeing generation after generation of the rulers die out and pass on their legacies made the story unique as it was no about one person or family, but about a country and its survival. Sadly, the ending left me wanting and didn't quite live up to all the work I put into these families. Also, though there were many random events that took place between battles involving non-combat confrontations with the citizens of the country, I felt like there could have been many more of them than I experianced.Replayability (7/10)Getting to choose what families ruled the country gave the game some replayability (especially if you choose the humorous name option), just so you can see what names might come up (one of my proudest warriors was named Slippy Goatbone). Spec'ing out your units in different ways allows you to play the game differently at least few times, emphasizing certain units, skills, or research in order to try out different strategies. The way the game ends makes me think that a second playthrough might have some different dialogue from the main characters, although I haven't started my second playthrough yet.Total: 7.6/10MASSIVE CHALICE Main Website[www.massivechalice.com] MASSIVE CHALICE Wiki[massivechalice.gamepedia.com] "

								I've been watching the development of this game since the Kickstarter and it's turned into everything I hoped. On my first play I managed to barely scrape through to the end with several close calls that really had me sweatting. The choices that you make on the strategic map really influence how the battles on the tactical map go, and a mistake in either area can really cost you. I love the ""keeping all the plates spinning"" feel it gives me and I expect it will get better as they tighten down the balance and add the promised hybrid classes.In this case Early Access doesn't mean ""barely a game,"" it really means ""almost finished.""

								If you are new to strategy games and turned based fighting I think this is a nice game to start with. Right now it is really 'simple' in terms of the turn based fights so your not overwhelmed. My favorite part is trying to create the perfect bloodline. It is a great mechanic that does add a ton of depth, while mostly random it is still fun, and frusterating when you literally start out with nothing but weak, slow, and stupid heros.It has a way to go before it feels like an epic but it is fun for quick bouts. It has a mobile game feel. I hope it won't turn out to be that and does become a deep, varied, and epic adventure because the foundation is here.			"

								***UPDATED***POST RELEASE REVIEW:I've played this game in early access, decided that I don't like it at current state, but was sure that it had much potential and release will change a lot. And it didn't.While Double Fine has added class shuffling and improved graphics a bit, game's main disadvantages (in my eyes) are still there - the HUGE dependance on luck factor, lack of depth in battle missions and unappealing maps and models. I officially regret that I have backed this game up on Kickstarter. This will be a lesson to me, not to back concepts that has nothing to show but idea. Ideas can be great, but bad realisation can ruin any great idea. I hope you will learn from my mistake. ORIGINAL PRE-RELEASE REVIEW:Now a little bit more detailes:My main complaint is luck factor. There is a LOT about luck in this game, from the begining, traits of your heroes are random and while it's not difficult at first to play with idiots, drunkards and slowpokes, the biggest problem is that you have to apoint one of these genetic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to start a bloodline, meaning he/she will pass down all the bad traits and habbits across generations for at least 50 years or so. Then you have random events - they can cripple your only good heroes or even kill them. Good choices are not even remotely as rewarding. Defend missions may have♥♥♥♥♥♥for reward, and if you are unlucky, the same zones will be attacked and eventually regardless of what you do, you will start to loose land and buildings that you have puted so much time to build.And finally luck on the battlefield is a huge factor - starting from position (you can start with all heroes being surrounded) and finishing with misses. Even the veterans can miss, especially if they were bred by genetic trash you had to put up with at the begining of the game. And while it's not always lethal, with each hero you loose, your macro economy will get cripled a lot. The only existing remedy to this is load after each huge fail, but that is a gameplay killer for me. Now don't get me wrong - I'm not saying the game is too hard or impossible. It's just frustrating. Also there is very little depth in the whole mechanics, but I really hope that it's just the matter of time. Basically, you don't have to be a smart strategist to play this game as long as you have good heroes, simply because all correct things to do are obvious and there isn't a lot of things you need to do but wait. Combined with luck factor this is really bad, because it's the depth and smart unobvious choices that are supposed to balance bad luck you have to face with, and this game doesn't have the any of that.The final problem I see in this game is it's graphics - while it does have certain unique style to it, the models are so poor on polygons, I don't understad why have developers made this in 3D - the game obciously could have been 2D with MUCH more appeal. I'm sad to say this, but heroes models look ugly, Double Fine have been cuting budget to 3D modelers waaay too much. Now this problem isn't big for me, the good gameplay always comes first, but it's certainly a letdown.Heroes are the only (except for the Challice) alive characters in this game that you can see, but being faceless and almost featureless makes them very hard to think of as characters, instead of skill sets.

Early Access Review
								As a fan of XCOM I was very exited when this game got funded on kickstarter, I only realised a few days ago that the game was actually available for download. I've played the crap out of it over the last few days and I've got to say for the most part I've really enjoyed it. The presentation and style of the game is great, it looks beautiful and has a quirky sense of humor. The character classes are distinct but lacking, as there are only three. Caberjack (melee), Hunter (ranged), and Alchemist (mix of both), although this is set to change with an upcoming patch which will allow players to mix classes. The gameplay is fun, although it did begin to feel a little repetitive by the end of the game. I really enjoyed the bloodlines aspect of the game which gave you the chance to marry different heroes with the hope of creating offspring with the best traits of their parents (this was a little tricky but very enjoyable when done right). If your heroes went through several grueling battles and distinguished themselves there was the chance that their weapon would become an heirloom, basically a special weapon that leveled up over the campaign. One of my favourite moments in the game came when a young alchemist named Seargent Ra became my first level 6 character after two battles. With his amazing stats I decided to name Seargent as the next reagent of the house Ra, now Standard had the ‘bountiful’ trait, allowing him to basically have kids in litters. The guy ended up having nine kids and established the Ra lineage as the dominant family in my game. That wasn’t enough for Seargent, when the magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ died he left his weapon behind which became the first heirloom in my game. Two of his ancestors fought in my final battle many generations later, one of them carrying his weapon, the ‘Inevitable’. This is exactly why I bought this game, I wanted a story behind my heroes, I wanted to feel this connection to the characters. The main issue I had that it did get repetitive by end game and I didn’t have as much of a connection with the heroes as I originally did. However I still enjoyed the experience.On the whole this is still very much a work in progress but I’ve really enjoyed it so far. "

												I don't like Double Fine, I think they're a cut-corners type of shop. I also don't like Tim Schafer, I think he's a over-appreciated ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I love turn based combat and strategic games, though. You can check my hours played in Crusader Kings 2 and you will know that this game about building dynasties across the realm is right up my alley. If it had come from another studio I probably would have bought it much sooner.I won this game in a give-away and I was very excited to actually get to give it a shot. I refuse to spend any more money on DF products (I bought DF9 and backed Broken Age, blech) but a Fire Emblem knock off should be fun and engaging even if it's made by a substance over style group.So, anyway, enough about my experiences and feelings, what aboutThe actual gameIt's ugly. The ""style"" is very low-fi and legitimately looks like the shaders and textures didn't all load. It's not consistent, some random objects look way out of place and the particle effects are either missing or awful.It sounds bad. I can't think of another game where the tutorial narration drew complaints from other people in my apartment but the voices in this game are honestly super annoying and also sound like every single one was done on the first take and never polished.It's boring. It's a ""grand epic time scale"" but that just boils down to watching time scroll by on fast forward, which is still super slow. I would say roughly a third of my playtime was just watching numbers scroll on the world map.It's opaque. The game wants you to Make Big Decisions, but you never know what is at stake, and you only have a tiny handful of choices AND you never find out what the results are for ages or maybe ever. It's simple. I don't mean in a stream lined ""dive in and play"" kind of way, I mean 3 classes and enemy AI that is nothing more than rushing straight at the nearest hero every time. It's just simplistic.I wanted to like this game. I promise I did. Nothing would have made me happier than for this to have been engaging and deep and interesting and complex. I would have loved to be wrong and I would have written a long review about how it was so much more than I was worried it would be. But the truth is it's not a good game.TLDR: it's bad in every way and not really worth free "

								XCOM and Crusader Kings 2 just had a baby and sprinkled it with humour as they named it MASSIVE CHALICE.Don't get attached to your heroes though, they die of old age or get killed like they're the cast of Game of Thrones if every episode was the Red Wedding episode. But managing the bloodline/family is fun. Seing the the families and realm evolve. The Turn-Based Tactical XCOM like combat is great. Graphics style is really cool as well.			"

								Deceptively simple yet complex, Massive Chalice will keep you interested for hours as you plan your nation, bloodlines, and strategies to fend off the Cadence. Interesting and challenging to balance bloodline stats and active party members to maximize the value of your people while staying viable in combat.Combat certainly takes good planning and strategy. Structure specific (Sagewright / Crucible) are the hardest by far. Enemy mobs also have a different spin on them in the ways they can defeat your heroes. Not only do you have to be concerned with your HP reaching zero, you also have to consider the effects of the Wrinker's aging attacks that can be devastating if you use a party of older heroes. The Twitchers also tend to appear at inopportune moments (usually from over a wall) to mix things up.As this is an early access review, game ran beautifully from start to finish with no complaints. Only actual issue I encountered was a mispelling (Critical was Criical or something) which I easily overlooked.			"

								Supported through Kickstarter eons ago. Started playing some months ago when it had only 3 classes.It was fun even then. Played it through few times just to try different tactics. After the recent patch of hybrid classes it got even better. Squad turn-based tactics - with some random choices that may, or may not, screw you over - with ever changing panic over keeping a proper squad together as your keeps can't keep up with enough worthy heroes.Toss the crappy ones (slow, arithis, multiple negative stats) into guild to do research. Pick ones with positive effects - and later higher levels - for standards. And assemble best ones into frontline fighting squad. And cry when they get wiped. Random chance and mean AI makes each game a struggle at some point. Not enough heroes for full squad? Don't want to sacrifice your good heroes? Which area you're willing to lose.. Balancing for picking least annoying combat and best rewards.Compared to x-com or a like games this one has kept me interested longer. Still has some optimization issues considering system requirements for graphics, so saddly requires decent graphics card at least for now.			"

								There are far better options to this game out there. For one the graphical quality and color choices tend to hurt the eyes, far too much bright saturation and mixes of brown and red in the game's art style. The characters are blocky, polygon shapes also drenched in red and brown. It's hard to get attached to them, as they look like glossy glass models rather than human beings rapped up in a war.I wish I could give this a recommendation, but it feels like a rushed product in every way. The enemies are bland and non-menacing. The characters are lifeless, and the world is dull with barely any life or activity to it. Besides there are far superior games out there such as XCom Enemy Unknown which offer a better experience, better art style, and better character customization.  "

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review: I don't see how this game can change a whole lot to make a vast improvement, which it really needs. If you've ever played X-COM, it's hard to play a dumbed down version of that. Massive Chalice has some really awesome concepts that work better on paper. You get to create several generations of blood and name that will go on for as long as you can keep them alive. They may have some weaknesses and strengths, and many of these can carry on for a couple hundred years. This can be alcoholism, higher HP, lower evasion, better aging, lower lifespan, better stealth, etc. The list goes on and I probably only got to play with a third of what's out there. The important thing is, once you find a strong bloodline, you stick with it and make it stronger. Sounds pretty cool, right?Well, unfortunately, there's not a whole lot else here. As time goes on, your birthing choices mean less and less and eventually you just want to get the game over with. The combat is challenging, but not complicated enough. You only have so much to work with, and it's not even 1/10th as intricate as X-COM. There's some fun concepts here like trying to plan your means of attack and stealthing in unseen on a group of 10 enemies. But it all starts to become fodder to a point. You get to saying ""here we go again..."" and finish it like you had the other 20 battles before it. So I just don't see how this game can be greatly improved on full release. I completed it with an emptiness to fill and hope the best for it. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough for me. I recommend getting this on a massive sale if you REALLY need to play this type of game.

												Lovely little game. The combat reminds me of XCOM and the family management somewhat reminds me of Crusader Kings 2. Unfortunately MASSIVE CHALICE doesn't add anything special to the table (not like Shadow of Mordor, which does copy the Arkham and Assassin's Creed franchise, but delivered something unique with the Nemesis system). I would say it's a casual game, worth your time and money if you're interested in the genre.

Early Access Review
								The games difficulty is intense, even somewhat ridiculous. The seemingly insurmountable odds stacked against (any non-hardcore) player seem challenging at first, but quickly become either annoyingly time-consuming (with save scumming) or off-puttingly random (with ironman mode) with its difficulty spikes. Making ""easy"" the only difficulty that fits a player that's not 100% committed always feels condescending. If the game was otherwise a complete gem, this could be forgiven. Unfortunately, it is not. The battles and environments are quirky and fun to look at for a while, but quickly wear out their appeal; it's obvious the art style is just a thin smokescreen for hiding sub-par, lazy graphics design.The game's lack of variety in difficulty, graphics and strategic content, lack of polish and the baffling decision to let people to create shoddy and very unfunny custom content in the form of Bloodlines (character descriptions/battle dialogue) just leaves an impression that the game's creators don't really want to make the effort to produce high-quality content. The Bloodlines, rife with bad jokes and knockoff GoT quotes, are a testament to the game's shortcomings; the developers have made no effort (yet) to polish the player-created content, but also did not include an option to disable said amateur garbage. It's like a comic book that's sold as the work of a professional comics studio but all the pages are mostly colored in by unpaid and inept first graders. At it's current stage, MASSIVE CHALICE seems to be a brilliant concept that's gotten trashed by a lazy, unrefined design process.			"

Early Access Review
								This game seemed like a game I was going to love. I am a huge fan of tactical, turn-based combat games. XCom is one of my favorite games. However, this game lacks a lot of contents I'd expect from a game like this:TACTICAL COMBAT:It's just plain boring. Your heros gain skills as they level, but the combat itself is lacking. By the time I reached my third invasion by the Cadence (enemy plant race), I was just tired of it. Each combat scenerio is the same and very repeatative, and you lack a variety of classes and specializations to keep it interesting.BLOODLINE/BIRTHING:This is probably the only interest thing about this game. You assign a regent to a territory and marry them off to someone. Based on their fertility and skills, they'll give birth to a lot of children that pick up some of their traits. You have to be careful not to pair up two people with horrible traits, or you risk a good deal of horrible warriors being birthed.CUSTOMIZATION:Practically NONE. What I love about XCom is the fact you get to customize each of your soldiers. You choose their hair, face, voice, what they wear and even give them first, last and nicknames. Massive Chalice only allows you to change your hero's armor and weapon... and that's even limited. For me--customizing my characters is not only extremely entertaining, but it emotionally invests me in those characters and when they die in battle... I actually care.KINGDOM BUILDING:Yep. Boring. I imagined having an entire kingdom to build things like blacksmiths, guilds, research towers, etc. Nope. You  build keeps to fill a territory and assign a regent, and then you just wait around to birth children to fill your army once they reach the age of 15. You can also research something, but you can only research one thing at  time. And constructing buildings, for some reason, is considered research. Instead of having several different areas to work on multiple projects (building, researching, crafting) you literally can only do ONE thing at a time. And you wait. And wait. AND WAIT some more for something interesting to happen.OVERALL:Yes. It's an Early Access Game, but based on what's in the game right now... there's not much going to change. The core mechanics are there, and they're lacking. If you enjoy tactical, turn-based combat games... buy XCom: Enemy Unknown. You can get the main game and all expansions for the same price as this game. Plus--XCom is a top-notched game with a ton of content, customization, intenst tactical combat and a great storyline.

												After playing a couple hours on normal mode with the tutorial I can say I really enjoy this game. There is a lot to learn and I'm sure I've already screwed on something that'll bite me later. I love the system for creating heirs, it's actually pretty easy to learn, but there's so much to pay attention to I don't get bored with it. The heroes are important and I grew attached to a few, but their lives are so fleeting and there are so many that I wasn't too devestated when they died of old age or on the battlefield. The heir system reminds me of rogue legacy a lot, and the combat is quick and fun. I still haven't experienced many classes beyond the beginning set I had, but they do play differently and you can really feel that when your drunk team member hits for two damage and the hunter has to save their butt again. I mean really, girl, can't you sober up in the face of danger? I've barely scratched the surface of this game, and I look forward to getting deeper into the story and playing again when I'm not so clueless. I'm sure people who are veterans at this style of game will pick it up easily, and new players should have no trouble learning with the tutorial.The art style isn't too detailed, nor is the game processor heavy. The main screen looks like a board game, and the game feels like that at times, with you playing against the bad guys. I feel like the style works well with the fact that while the heroes aren't nameless, they are many, and frequently changing. Characters age with time and this affects their abilities in and out of battle. Pros:Tutorial will get anyone up to speed quicklyEarly battles are quick and funHeir system is fun and complex, easy to learn but hard to masterRuns just fine on my 7 year old laptop fast-forwarding time makes it easier to get stuff doneCons: It's not the shiniest game ever? If you're looking for movie realistic or fancy cutscenes this is not the game for you.There's no multiplayer though I don't miss it.I felt a little lost about which land to save since the benefits were only partially explained.

												The combat system for this game was dumber than my autistic neigbor. The R&D was fine with an interesting bloodline concept, but who the hell makes a top down strategy game without cover, flanking, or anything actually important?If you want a game where you don't need to think and the best bloodline is decided based on how much damage you can pump out, get this game. If you have more than two brain cells and the right number of chromosomes, get XCOM.Massive Chalice has a good concept and a chance to be interesting, but it botches that with a combat system that essentially makes the game unplayable. Get XCOM. Not this. Massive chalice = sad, small chalice that doesnt have much depth or playability.			"

Too many random misses/bad outcomes/etc. that just encourage you to reload and hope for a better result, rather than legit strategy rewards. Also really disappointed by the final plot resolution. Especially when playing a second time after half a dozen months more development; Doublefine really couldn't come up with a more satisfying ending?

												I was going to give MASSIVE CHALICE a pass.Give it a 'ha-ha, you got me again Double Fine, when will I ever learn' and just carry on with my life.That is until I saw it on my friend's wishlist. Friends don't let friends play MASSIVE CHALICE. It's not addicting, heh, it's anything but addicting. The most it will get out of you is 10h of dredging through a blandness swamp. It will introduce mechanics for about 2h and then have you kind of continue on moving through them on auto-pilot. In the latter half of the campaign they really start not giving a f**k and just inject steroids in the enemies you've already been tired of for hours and stop introducing anything remotely new.Turn-based battles, Noble houses that have their own character class and inherited pros and cons,Equipment research,Fighting an ever-rising tide of evil forces,these are just some of the things you thought were going to make a great game, before you saw them realized this blandly and with as less effort as possible. Funny enough the one redeeming quality of the game, its unique visual aesthetic, also can be attributed to the development team just deciding textures or high-poly meshes just don't fit their busy schedule of not making a good game.This one goes to you, Pufe, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

												Massive Chalice represents the marriage of two great concepts: Turn-based Strategy and an ancestry system. The former will be familiar to fans of XCOM and Fire Emblem where the latter isn't quite as well-represented. The only example that comes to mind being Rogue Legacy, but the basics are easily understandable: Pair your heroes together and they will have children who are a combination of their parents classes, skills, and traits.

												The reson I dont recommend this game it´s because, although it has great voice acting, it´s just not immersive for the player. I compare this game to Banner Saga, as it´s pretty much the same mechanic. And BS was just way better, with an intresting story and awesome characters and hard choices that matters. Still, awesome graphics, great voices and well... not much else.			"

								An amazingly brutal and brilliant game.Nothing worse than the crushing feeling that you accidently bred heart disease into your tank bloodline so they are dying by the age of 45 and their fertility can't keep up with their deathrate so you're going to lose all your relic weapons.Please for the love of god make this game playable and available for android... I would buy it twice!			"

												I backed this game because the concept of XCOM meets breeding simulator sounded interesting.  It is!  And it's pretty fun too!  Enemy types are inventive in that it's not just straight damage dealers - you have enemies that subtract XP or age your heroes on hit.  There's the aspect of when do you retire heroes for breeding or research versus keeping them in the fight.  It's a mildly stressful balancing act but that's part of the charm.  I beat the game in 12 hours (with one reset in the very early game because I thought I messed up) on the normal difficulty.  It's entertaining, charming and a little different with mechanics that are as straightforward as any game I've ever seen.  It seems to go for $20 normally and I'd say it's worthwhile at that price, but if it goes on sale, snap it up!			"

								This game has some flaws...First of all it's not optimized at all, the cut scenes are missing and the game still needs a lot work to shine... (Mostly due it's early development stage)And secondary it's extremely addictive!This game has a great feel and an awesome atmosphere.The ideas are neat and more than only enjoyable.It still lacks some strategic depth and features to make it really awesome.The trait systems feels brilliant and the fighting feels intense.Every decision can hurt and backfire a lot.Permadeth and aging adds what it needs to get a feeling for your characters...

												Shallow, and none of the individual parts are done especially well. Every single mission is ""wipe out the enemy"". The classes are dull and unimaginative. The ""world/dynasty"" building layer is uninteresting.Basically, DF bit off more than they could chew and ditched support for the game when it was clear no one else was buying into it - so I'm glad I held off and picked this up when it was 80% off. It's a shame, because the concept is a really interesting one - but DF of late appear to be going the ""grab money, make something, doesn't matter if it's actually any good because it's not our money and we can't be held accountable unlike traditional publishing methods"" route.

												This game has some really good parts but could use some more polish. The paucity of classes reduces the fun factor significantly. Also, the alchemist archers are fairly OP.

												The schtick of the game is that you manage a fantasy realm for 300 years in a prolonged seige from an otherworldly badguy.  You have a few bloodlines of heroes, and the top-level gameplay sees you assigning them to a few different roles.  They can be part of your vanguard (strike team used in tactical levels), you put them in baby farms keeps to produce more heroes (cause the game goes for something like ten generations), they can take on the white to become a sage (speeding your research times), and your most awesome heroes can become standards in the training crucibles (boosting all heroes kingdom-wide).Meanwhile, the badguy threat the ""Cadence"" attacks your lands (in which you build keeps, crucibles, and sagewright guilds).  You send in your vanguard and play a blessedly short tactical exercise to take them down.  There are always more attacks than you can address, though, and the Cadence's corruption seeps into your lands, eventually destroying them.  So you're constantly triaging your threats, knowing that you won't be able to keep everything, but holding out for retaining enough to make it to the endgame.The endgame, by the way, is when the titular Massive Chalice fills up and can destroy all the Cadence forever.  That takes 300 years.  But you're immortal thanks to the power of the Chalice, so you can manage things until the endgame… assuming you can hold everything together until then.The Good:Dividing your resources (ie heroes) between vanguard, breeders, sages, and standards is surprisingly difficult, challenging, and consequential, and continues to be so throughout the game.  Your heroes have various traits, both genetic and acquired via training, and they pass these down to their kids and their trainees (and sometimes their comrades-in-arms).  There is a whole lot of fun fiddling and arranging what traits you want your baby farms keeps to produce.  Or who you're willing to put into the sages instead.  Or who's going to fight for you, or who's going to train the kingdom's heroes.   This is, from a game design standpoint, a real victory.  It is some seriously elegant, downright exquisite, design.  So the strategic level of the game gets an A+.The character classes are amusingly different from your standard fantasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  You have caberjacks, whose weapons are giant, iron-shod logs.  You have alchemists, who sling explosive potions.  Lastly you have hunters, who can stealth and shoot things with their crossbows.  You can shunt these into the tank/dps/aoe structures you're used to, but you don't have to.You also get hybrid classes (when a mommy caberjack and a daddy hunter love each other very very much…) which make for interesting combinations.  Trickshots shoot arrows tipped with explosive potions.  Shadowjacks can stealth and then leap out of the shadows with their massive cabers.  And so on.  As you can see, as you start figuring out hybrid classes, things get weirder, not more predictable, and it's lots of fun to explore those new options.And there are relic weapons that get passed down from generation to generation, leveling up as they get used, and becoming incredible items of power.  Nothing says dynasty of super-powered warriors like a crossbow that's been passed down within the noble house for 200 years.  Towards the end of my playthrough, which youngster got bequeathed a relic more-or-less determined who was going to be in the vanguard.  There's a lot of thematic power in that decision, where you're figuring if this 13-year-old lordling shows enough promise to be given the mighty Monarch crossbow.  I really got into it!While there are a lot of Game of Thrones elements in there, it's also notable what things are _not_ carried over from the most popular fantasy property of the day.  Namely, you have all these noble houses in your kingdom, but they do not conspire or scheme or complain to you.  They don't have petty rivalries, they do not undermine the realm with their ambitions.  This would be a natural development to pursue, but ultimately it would detract from gameplay.  Your job isn't to convince the realm to fight against the White Walkers Cadence, it's to manage that fight.  Good on the designers for not falling down that rabbit hole.Also the game is pleasantly gender-neutral in regards to you, the sovereign, even though it sticks pretty strongly to the gender binary for your baby farms regents.  I'll take my victories where I can get them on this front!The Not-So-Good:The game suffers from the common trope of the Big Final Battle being unlike any other battle you've fought before, so all of the expectations and strategies that you've honed over the course of the game are just slightly off-base.  (Mild spoilers; skip to next paragraph to avoid…) Instead of using your team of five heroes sweeping an area for the 15-20 badguys hiding on a map, you set your team of five heroes to defending a single target against wave after wave of badguys who teleport in every few turns.  Worse, there is zero indication if you have four waves to go, or one, or fifteen.  Given that part of the game is resource management, withholding this information does not do the endgame scenario any favors.More mundanely, except for that last one, the battles all have the same objective: kill all the badguys.  Every once in a while, the game mixes things up and has the badguys attacking a keep and you have to defend the regent of the keep… by killing all the badguys.  I often complain that the objectives of tactical games miss a lot of potential, and this game unfortunately falls squarely into the same trap.The UI does a good job presenting a torrent of information that you need to manage, but there are some unfortunate lapses.  The worst is the fact that, while every character has a Strength, Agility, and Intelligence stat, nowhere does it tell you what those stats actually do—and they don't operate in traditional ""Agility to hit, Strength for damage"" ways.  Luckily a quick internet search will answer these questions, but still: not something I should have to do to understand the game.  More puzzling, this is a known problem and could be addressed in a very simple patch, but it hasn't been.Overall:This is a slick, powerful, engaging game, and I'm holding off starting another playthrough because I've got stuff to do.  I know if I start another, it will consume all my time like the last round.  I still haven't explored the Alchemists hardly at all, and feel like I missed some clever uses for caberjacks.  I'm eager to try it again, but I'm not sure if I want to play at Normal difficulty like last time or submit myself to the harrowing of a harder difficulty level. "

												hell yeah. if arranged marriages intrigues you. get this game. no really, it was the most fun thing about this game from my pov. starting a family with a weak whiny cadence burger, into a full blown warrior tribe of awesomeness. the game play is also fun too, see x-com, but with a medieval twist, also you actually hit your shots, how amazing!. theres research and random events to keep you busy in between attacks. also your heroes will constantly die, but there's homegrown  fresh blood to replace them. note, you cannot name characters and houses if that's a big thing to you,(it reallly shouldn't be you whiny spitbag)it doesn't affect me at all. i found myself growing close to some of my houses, who had grown to formidable strength. individuals do sometimes get lost in the shuffle, but the true heroes that are called upon every time there's an attack are sorely missed upon their death. and sometimes they pass down their weapon to a family member, which is cool. in my current run i'm at year 250ish and i dont really feel like finishing,i most likely will, but i'd rather restart, i feel the strong parts of the game are the begginning up to the midlate. its starting to get stale( i feel there's no more strategy to the research part, i'm just randomly assigning research at this point, maybe a higher difficulty is in order?, and the game overall is getting kinda grindish(repetitive)(my whole kingdom was basically decked out by year 180 probably), but starting over should remove that feeling. buy this game you won't be disappointed. but you should wait for a sale, i got it for 8 bucks. i would've been pleased even if i paid 20, but i know others people won't be.

You need good units to breed good units, but you also need good units to win battles.Traits are not explained with a tooltip or something, so you need to guess what they mean.Cant recommend it even in a sale.

I know if I start another, it will consume all my time like the last round.  I still haven't explored the Alchemists hardly at all, and feel like I missed some clever uses for caberjacks.  I'm eager to try it again, but I'm not sure if I want to play at Normal difficulty like last time or submit myself to the harrowing of a harder difficulty level. "

												hell yeah. if arranged marriages intrigues you. get this game. no really, it was the most fun thing about this game from my pov. starting a family with a weak whiny cadence burger, into a full blown warrior tribe of awesomeness. the game play is also fun too, see x-com, but with a medieval twist, also you actually hit your shots, how amazing!. theres research and random events to keep you busy in between attacks. also your heroes will constantly die, but there's homegrown  fresh blood to replace them. note, you cannot name characters and houses if that's a big thing to you,(it reallly shouldn't be you whiny spitbag)it doesn't affect me at all. i found myself growing close to some of my houses, who had grown to formidable strength. individuals do sometimes get lost in the shuffle, but the true heroes that are called upon every time there's an attack are sorely missed upon their death. and sometimes they pass down their weapon to a family member, which is cool. in my current run i'm at year 250ish and i dont really feel like finishing,i most likely will, but i'd rather restart, i feel the strong parts of the game are the begginning up to the midlate. its starting to get stale( i feel there's no more strategy to the research part, i'm just randomly assigning research at this point, maybe a higher difficulty is in order?, and the game overall is getting kinda grindish(repetitive)(my whole kingdom was basically decked out by year 180 probably), but starting over should remove that feeling. buy this game you won't be disappointed. but you should wait for a sale, i got it for 8 bucks. i would've been pleased even if i paid 20, but i know others people won't be.

												Well in age of easy games that hod ones hand from start to finish, if you're looking for a challenge Massive Challice won't dissapoint. To be honest I got fustrated with too much randomization with everything, from starting heroes and their talent to battles, and towards the end of the game my heroes were underpowered due to my a team having been wiped out a decade before that I had no hope of surviving the final battle. Gave up, and watched the ending from youtube...The first half of the game was quite enjoyable, but got bit too repetitive towards the end. I wouldn't say MC is a bad game, rather that it simply wasn't for me. Oh, and Cradles and Wrinklers can go suck a bag of ####s			"

												The top rated reviews had me a little wary on this title, but since they were all Early Access complaints, and the game previewed positively, I decided to give it a shot. It's a blast! It's a fantasy cousin to XCom, with neat visuals, warm character voices, and all of the fun feels you'd expect from a production of DoubleFine. Games last from 10-20 hours, and it starts very easy, and quickly becomes highly challenging.			"

												I played this off and on through beta, but now that it is at full release with balance, I am really enjoying it! They have done a great job with a tactical turn based game. The different classes now have great feel and I use them all. It used to be that only the long range characters were worth using, but now I love my melee caberjack's! They have done a good job with the bloodlines and aging features, and it is everything I actually was looking for when I Kickstarted it. It feels polished and pretty well balanced. Well done Doublefine.Pros: Interesting classes and hybrid classes. Clean visuals and fairly easy UI system. Good bloodlines system, and good approach with upgrades in general. Cons: Locations not super diverse, I wish we could choose different colors for keeps etc.			"

												Like XCOM, this is a game about fog-of-war-focused tactical combat with a greater strategy layer above it, best played in Ironman Mode. XCOM is better, but this game is still worth experiencing.Rather than being about cover management, the tactical combat part is about trying to kill enemies before they ever get a chance to attack you, where the enemies are dumb as bricks. So, sometimes entertaining, and sometimes rather unimpressive, and on the whole a bit less great.The strategy layer is a closer match though; it's got the same level of researchyness, with the additional hero breeding mechanic. I think the tactical combat's balance kind of wears down on the strategy layer though: there are many elements that make it easier to focus on upgrading and breeding only one class, but the tactical rewards for diversifying do not really make overcoming those elements worthwhile.Oh, and the voices in this game are rather unimpressive. Every once in a long while during a battle, one or both of the chalice-people will say something useless from their rather small set of things they can say. My favorites being ""Good riddance!"" when an ally dies (if an enemy was killed in the crossfire), and ""Ha! Following my advice paid off!"" (or something like that) when nobody has said anything. There are individual Red Alert 2 units that have more lines than this game. Almost.			"

												(Full disclosure: I backed this game on Kickstarter but didn't play it until the release.)After my wife complained about the game being unplayably difficult, even on the easiest difficulty, I decided it was time to give Massive Chalice a try.I played about half way through a full game on the normal difficulty, with tutorials on and the game difficulty doesn't seem balanced to me. Some battles are really easy then you'll have one that's nearly impossible. Because battles are spaced so far apart it's also difficult to build any kind of team because two fights from now everyone on the current team is dead of old age. I also suspect there are some underlying game mechanics that aren't being exposed for regent marriages. By the time I finished playing I had four different keeps and figure I must have intermarried between them or something because despite having 1-2 dozen heros available of both sexes, only one or two people would show up as elligible for a regent to marry. I coudn't figure out an actual reason why this is happening so the only thing I can figure is that there's some unexposed game rule about someone marrying their cousin. =)All in all it feels like a game that could have used a bit more work. I'm fine with bad things happening in a game like XCOM, because it's usually something I did that caused it, this game is frustrating because it feels like I did everything ""right"" yet still ended up losing in the end.

												20 minutes in and I'm already giving up.  Framerate was awful... maybe 15 fps on a new Mac.  Tutorial said I could hit the [End] key to perform an action but this is a Mac and it does not have an [End] key; their QA team should have caught that.  I tried dialing back the video settings to get better fps but even at the lowest settings the framerate was still lame.  So I clicked [Reset] to restore the defaults but when I clicked [Apply] nothing happened; I had to restart the game again to apply the settings.  They seem to have implemented their own proprietary keyboard driver which basically ignores my OS settings where I just tap the touchpad to perform a click... with this game I actually have to depress the trackpad hard to do a basic left click.  Maybe this game is good but after so many annoying and preventable issues so early on, I'm cutting my losses and moving on.			"

Boring, stupid ""stand your ground, more masses of monsters will arrive""-action that is no fun at all.It's interesting to have a quite new kind of gameplay first. Many decisions, good tutorial, pretty complex.But with the game proceeding, things start to get annoying, like all these dying people you have to replace every second.And all that just to reach the biggest disappointment in game's ""final boss fight"" history.Overall: Nice idea, nice try, but this one isn't the one.

												I like Double Fine, no, love is more accurate, but this is a serious misstep. Gameplay: This is a pared down version of the latest XCom games that ramps up the frustrating parts right over the garden wall. That may seem facetious, but it even observes the same adherence to the passage of time, the meticulous planning of building and research, and the bitter mocking when a hero dies. They haven't included injuries sustained during combat, deciding instead to build those directly into a heroes core statistics by the usage of ""traits"" and ""flaws"". Your heroes do feel a bit more powerful as you can mow down twice as many enemies in one battle as you ever could in XCom and the monsters do provide a nice palette of obstacles to overcome. Of course, your heroes only live about sixty or so years which goes by surprisingly quick, so it is difficult to form much attachment. I suppose one is supposed to develop a fondness for a clan of heroes that you breed over generations, but it seems rather pointless when you're maintaining the houses much in the same way one takes care of an ant farm. Normally, I would not directly fault a game for copying another game's mechanics, but DoubleFine is a studio I look to when I want good design, gameplay, and solid writing. Which leads me to my next point:Story: The writing is weak. There's a diad of narrators that fall so predictably into bad cliches and poor acting that I simply had to turn the sound off; no hint or narrative point could be worth that. Despite the game allowing you to choose a ""Silly"" and a ""Serious"" mode as far as randomly generated names go, I lost all love and respect for the heroes I was grooming when their nicknames arose as ""Fishfingers"". The game flits between wanting to be a comedy and wanting to be a grim war and mortality simulator so nervously that I can't commit myself to any emotion other than anger when I play it.Sound: Aside from what I've already mentioned there is nothing special here, the sound is just passable and you will get tired of the soundtrack before your first playthrough is up.I was very much looking forward to this game and was elated to see it pop up on sale, I will have to give DoubleFine a second look before I plunge into anything of theirs again.

												It's pretty good. It's an extremely well presented XCom-light. The problem comes from the lack of true variety to match the game's scale. This as been explained by every other review though. Overall good and worth $5-$10.			"

												XCOM meets Game of Thrones, or something. I don't know, it's fun tho.People seem to be getting hung up on their heros dieing off so quick, but they're missing the point. You have a guy you've leved a bunch and are super into him? Breed the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! The game is about bloodlines and breeding badasses to breed more badasses, not individual heros. This is part of the game, this is what you bought. complaining about the mechanic is like buying Battlefeild 1 and complaing that people keep shooting you.			"

												ok so as i understand it your this big cup, the Chalice... or perhaps you came out of the big cup and now command 5 guys or gals who either throw flasks of exposives, shoot shoulder fired crossbows or hit people with battering rams as they fight some evil ghostlike monster things...I am confused but the game is good.SO before a battle your 5 guy or gal tem jump into the chalice, which may be you the player i am not too sure, and they get transported to the battlefield where you do a little turn based tactical battle.Oh you get to arrange marrages and watch them make babies... well you can't watch them really but that would make for some great cut scenes.I really don't understand much of what is going on but i am enjoying myself.

												The interesting part about this game is that you are suppose to manage bloodlines, breed desirable traits and weed out bad traits. The problem with the game is that you never get the feeling that a blood line is distinctive, like for example most heros from this blood line has high strength but are sickly and prone to die early.The reason is because, within a few generations the bloodline's trait might change wildly into something completely different from the start. Although this means that it is easy to get rid of bad traits, it means that those bad traits keep coming back. It also means that good traits does not stick and you are left hoping that RNG favours you and generate children who have the good traits but not the bad ones. Every generation you must play this RNG again and sooner or later you are going to lose and drop back to square one.What they should have done is instead of having binary on/off states for the traits, the traits should be a gradient. For example the quick study and slow learner traits should be combines into a single trait that give +/- exp modifier. Every children will inherit a slightly different modifier. Small changes should be more common than large changes so that you cannot breed good learning within a few generations. At the sametime you can't lose it easily in a single generation if the RNG goes against you.The game fails at its most unique aspect, which is a shame because with some tweaks it could have worked much better.

The game: Massive Chalice is an event driven quasi turn based tactical battle game (see description below ^.^) with resource management in form of generation spanning unit spawning, time and kingdom management (wow!) that features a “massive chalice” (no spoilers here – you will find out soon enough) and also a mysterious enemy force called the “cadence” :	The tactical battle part of the game is straight forward: different unit and enemy types, units progress via experience points (xp) and earn different skills. Your basic Seek & Destroy gameplay with developing units.	BUT! Your units (heroes from different families) can die of old age, you can let them get married to transfer parts of their characteristics to daughters and sons [thus creating new units (and new types of units) or transfer specialized skills and traits (also the bad ones) to your offspring]. Or you can let them do research to use the knowledge they gained in all those years fighting the enemy. So not so basic after all! 	Each time an event occurs, e.g. birth, death, attack, research, building – That is basically a turn in the turn-based tactical part of the game, but it may be 2 years or 20 years in between – you can react to said event with new building orders, arranging marriage for two of your hero_ines or change the direction of your research.What happens during the game is this: You start your kingdom with different families. Each family is providing the kingdom with fighters which in turn can create offspring. The different heroes at your disposal come with a wide variety of bonus skills and also with a bit of bad genes / upbringing. Some are anxious and easily panicked, others like to see the bottom of a wine bottle a little too often and similar traits that definitely won´t help in a fight. Some are courageous, noble, fast, and strong. So there is some help after all! You have to choose what role each hero is going to play, for the future of the kingdom. It can be a fighting role, a researching scribe, a healthy marriage with another member of your growing royal family (or should I say clan?). Or you may be unlucky and loose one of yours to a disease or some other unhealthy random event.When it comes to battles with the enemy you get a randomly generated battlefield. In the confinements of those areas, which differ in size and setup, you have to defeat the enemy utilizing your unit’s skills and your own tactical prowess. Look and feel and sound: The game has a clunky looking graphics style, which fits perfectly. The game is not about looks, it is about a fully voiced Chalice that sort of gives the game its name. It is about silly! family names and lot of (failed?) attempts at saving your kingdom from the enemy, from plagues, from old age and from general uselessness. Captains Orders: The game is an absolute blast to play! I totally enjoyed the easy to pickup fighting parts and I liked the kingdom planning even more. It is not an in-depth tactical monstrosity like for example x-com, don´t let the similar mechanics in battle fool you. It is a game for some short and fun tactical sessions. You can easily pick up your kingdom in the middle of its pride after having had a few days off, playing something else. Go grab it – if you like tactical battles mixed with kingdom management in an atmospheric game that has a charm of its own! And did i mention silly! random names?Verdict: Treasure! Will be massively featured on Land Ho! with Captn3mo[www.twitch.tv] "

												Do you like X-Com: Enemy Unknown?Do you like games that are overflowing with personality?Do you like games where you can lose spectacularly and have a blast while doing it?In Massive Chalice, your adventurers are your kings and queens, your scholars, and they train the next generation to keep fighting.  And your adventurers will die.  Whether it is heroically in battle or just from old age, your squad of heroes will pass on their relics and traits to the next generation.It's Rogue mixed with X-Com and it is freaking awesome.During my first playthrough, I was so excited to build my keeps, select the best personality traits and try to groom the most ideal bloodlines.  I built a grand cathedral for study, and put my top minds to work researching the latest and greatest technology.And then I found that I had nobody left to go out and battle!  And then my perfect matches had marital problems!  I lost a baby and the mother during childbirth!  Everything had been going so well!  My kingdom was thriving and then RUIN!  I had rulers on thrones with no spouse to get the next generation going.  I had an army of 67 year old grenadiers who tripped and broke their hips before they even got to the enemy.  GET BACK UP AND GET IN THERE YOU GERIATRIC ADVENTURERS!!!!They died spectacularly and my kingdom was overrun.But holy crap was it fun.  I've never lost so overwhelmingly and yet had so much fun doing so.  The two voices that make up the Massive Chalice are hilarious and their personality is as overflowing as the water in the chalice.  This game is fantastic.  The graphics suit the gameplay and the flavour of the game spectacularly and enhance the experience.Buy this game.Play this game.Lose to this game several times before you figure out how to make babies (it shouldn't be that hard, right?).Then, once you're done losing a few times, go out there and defeat the corruption in the most spectacularly hilarious ways.10/10			"

								Massive Chalice (beta) is an interesting new spin on turn-based strategies. There are several levels of strategy you need to think about when playing.You only control a small squad of 5 heroes when in combat, which means you need to use terrain and other tactics in order to survive. The death of a single hero in combat affects other areas of the game.Everything surrounds a single goal: protect the massive talking (multi-personality I might add) chalice at the center of the map. The chalice is surrounded by regions which in turn are surrounded, from all directions, by the enemy which creeps ever closer. The big talky chalice promises it has a way to defeat the enemy but says ""It takes time. A lot of time"", so we have to defend it until then.Placing keeps and guilds in each region takes time - I'm talking years. Fortunately the years move quite quickly. Unfortunately, the lives of your heroes span those years in real time, which means they get old and they eventually die of old age (unless killed in battle).In order to maintain a line of heroes you have the option to make them regents (or regent partners). This stops the heroes from entering the battlefield and instead focus of making the next generation of heroes. You now need to find the right combination of heroes to produce offspring with attributes that can defeat the enemy more efficiently.Overall I found the game to be semi-light hearted, enjoyable, and also a challenge. You're often attacked on multiple fronts which means you have to pick your battles. The character models could do with a little bit of 'prettifyling' I suppose, but hey, you're not pairing them together for their looks now are you? :)If you're looking for a new turn-based challenge, have a look!

								This is not a carbon copy of XCOM, it's more like inspired by XCOM, as well as much more difficult. The main thing this game has in common with XCOM is the combat mechanics and permadeath and these are not bad game mechanics so I believe it's acceptable. Every choice matters and your soldiers (named Heroes) WILL die and you will have to accept this. I love this game but not because of its combat, (which is very light strategy and needs some fine tuning to be satisfactory) but because of everything outside of combat. You rule a kingdom and control when time starts and stops. Time means everything in this game, as well as the age, experience, fertility, and traits of your heroes. Even some enemy designs revolve around these subjects, a type of enemy can cause you to lose experience, or make you older by 5 to 10 years, or even make you sterile. Your people WILL die on the battle field. Accept it. The artstyle is fantastic and the gameplay outside of combat is very intriguing and interesting. Now for the enemy types, the only thing I have a problem with is how powerful the enemies are. I don't mind a challenge but I believe some tweaks would improve their combat mechanics, such as for example, the Lapses who when hit a hero they drain experience, the amount of experience should dialed down. Also the variability of hit success can be infuriating at times, (f.e. 87% chance to land a successful hit and misses can be very  frustrating.) This game is a work in progress for sure, however despite it's flaws it is well worth the price and extremely fun, satisfying, and very challenging. 9.5/10! In case you don't think this review is helpful because I may be confusing in how I feel about this game, it's worth the money if you enjoy strategy games like XCOM. If you don't enjoy those types of games then you won't enjoy this one. Simple as that. For thirty bucks though this is worth it.			"

								I played this game for about 24h and I have to say: It's my favourite game of the year. Even under my Top5 of favourite game. (I don't knw what's actually my favourite game...).But now to the game: The Game is an interessting twis an the strategie Genre. The actuall round-based strategie part playes a lot like XCOM. Unlike XCom, the story is 300 years long. Your heros will survive maybe 1/6 of the story. After that, they'll die of age. The managing of heros is fun and the GamePlay is even better!But the second best thing about the game is the graphics: Holy ♥♥♥♥♥! It's too beautifull.As a strategie-fan it's a must buy. After the last Update (Premium Beta) the game sucked me in and never let me free. Since than I play MassiveChallice all day long. Théo SeveinDrBlock42PS: Everybody knows that SpaceBase DF9 is not the best example of EarlyAcces. But this Game is almost finished (except of one big feature) and Devs are realy working hard to improve it every day. Since the one month I was able to play it they fixed every Balancing probleme that came up.			"

								First off, this is in early access, and I backed the Kickstarter at the time so take that for what it's worth.Massive Chalice is a turn-based tactical game in the same vein as, but on a smaller scale than, X-Com.  Where it differs is in the meta-game; rather than building a base and managing resources, you're managing the family trees of your squad.  You do still research equipment and choose buildings for the different regions in the kingdom, but it's a more limited set of choices than you may be used to.  The overall aim of the game is to survive as a kingdom under threat, until the titular Massive Chalice is able to purge the threat from your lands forever.The heroes that make up your squad (up to 5 at a time) are born, they age, gain experience and abilities, and die.  They will die a lot, and saving and reloading when a mission goes poorly won't save them.  The timeline that you are trying to survive through means that even if everything goes according to plan, your heroes will still eventually succumb to old age.  The trick is to ensure you have enough new heroes being born (with beneficial heriditary traits) to replace them.On a functional level, the game looks and sounds beautiful.  The art design is outstanding, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it win some awards at the end of the year.  It is still in Beta, but I've not experienced any game-breaking bugs.I've followed the development of the game throughout the process, from concept art to playing it on Steam, thanks to DoubleFine's excellent TeamStreams.  I understand why certain decisions have been made, and while there are some tweaks I'd like to see to the balancing, overall the game is challenging, fun, pretty, and a triumph for open game development that I hope more developers learn from in the future.  :D			"

								THIS IS A BETA REVIEW.I've played about 2 hours of the game (30 years of the 300 year timeline). So far, I like the game, and I see potential for continued improvement before the final release.The game does play like a fantasy X-COM in a lot of ways, but I was also reminded of the random good and bad traits from Rogue Legacy. These affect your strategic choices because many can be transmitted genetically (so be careful who you choose to found bloodlines) or socially (so be careful who you appoint as trainers). I also feel losing a valuable soldier hurts less in Massive Chalice than in X-COM, because all your soldiers are going to age and die anyway. It's a neat twist.WHAT I LIKE:- the graphics are charming; I like the style- the choices on the strategic planning map are challenging and I feel there are probably multiple good (no ""best"") choicesWHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE CHANGED:- unit variety I'd like more than three classes, and some way to ""blend"" abilities of different classes (e.g., one parent's an alchemist and the other's a hunter, so the kids they raise are a little bit of each)- silly catchphrases make me roll my eyes a bit; maybe the ""serious mode vs. silly mode"" setting (I forget what it's actually called) isn't implemented yet?- eventually, I'd like to see an option to let the timeline extend beyond 300 yearsAnyway, I've enjoyed what I've played of Massive Chalice so far, and will be on the look out for future updates.

Early Access Review
								This game takes two of my favorite games Crusader Kings II and XCOM and mashes them together in a way that fixes some of the glaring flaws in XCOMs design.This game takes place over Hundreds of years and you are managing a nation and stable of heroes across multiple generations. Through out the game you will build keeps to further bloodlines, crucibles for training and Sagewrights guild for research. You will also engage in some genetic engineering through selective pairing to get the best possible heroes. The heroes you pair do a few things. 1. They have a chance to pass along some of their traits (positive and negative) to their kids. 2. They pass along some of their XP. This alone fixes the massive flaw in XCOM, by the midgame of XCOM any new recruit you get is useless to you. Now your new recruits are able to scale in power as the game progresses. The other big flaw involves ""losing"" a battle. While there is no ""ironman"" mode that I can see, I play with it self imposed on myself. In XCOM ironman mode, a team wipe is essentially a loss state. You likely have no team of soldiers that can adequately replace a team that fought something tough enough to get wiped by. In MC, a team wipe hurts, you spread more ""corruption"" (Panic) and obviously you lost your heroes, BUT it is not a game over scenario as you have a team to fight with comeing through the ranks (at least you should) infact, losing members of your team can result in the creation of a ""Relic"", a weapon that it bound to the bloodline of the hero, can critical strike, and grows stronger as you use it. The game is a blast to manage if you love XCOM and CKII. It is still unfinished at this time, the only feature that I can tell is missing is hybrid classes, but the game plays great without it right now. If there was one thing I would add to this game it would be an active/reactive combat system like Gladius, but that is just me being wishful for Gladius II...The actual tactical battles are cleverly done with some cool maps and the different types of enemies add some good depth to the combat, certain enemies need to be approached the right way or they can really cause problems at different points in the game. Lapses in the late game are nasty, wrinklers in the mid game, Bulwarks in the early game. They all attack very differently (especially in the case of Lapses and Wrinklers) and in ways that are thematically appropriate (messing with time) and not simply a case of one just hitting harder. The one knock I do have is once the 5-6 different enemies are rolled out it kinda stops, eventually they all become ""advanced"" versions of the same thing, no reskins, no different mechanics. That is an area for improvement as the game moves to launch.There is no difficulty setting I can see, but the games difficulty is more than adequate, however as you get a bit more familiar with the items you can equip, you can use the imformation about the types of enemies you are facing to give your guys a leg up. In future playthroughs I am going to try and not look at that information before battles as the game got a lot easier once I started really looking at the types of enemies I would face pre-battle.One successful playthrough (3rd try) took me about 25 hours and it already has great replay value in the randomness of it's design. As it sits right now it is worth the price of admission and this game will only improve as it gets closer to launch. The short version is that this game took XCOM and made it better in almost every way, even in it's presently unfinished state.			"

Early Access Review
								Recommended because I want this game to be better :/Ok so this game isn't finished, and to be considered finished it needs a lot of work. game play is like final fantasy tacticsonly 3 classes, Cabberjack (melee) hunter(ranged)alchemist (hybrid, glass cannons)At first glance I feel like there should be more classes, like maybe 2 more, a healer and a assassin. However if you play long enough you find that in place of a generic ""healer class"" any one can be a healer, but it's a little hard to figure out.It's little things like this that make the game interesting, but it runs into problems. For instance to be a healer you have to research this health potion, that you can equip on anyone. (you only get 1 health potion per character if they have it equipped, and it heals for 10 hp). But you are limited to only one item per character, this wouldn't be a problem if your characters could hit anything for their lives. So you have to get the item that makes their accuracy higher (by 15%) even with this I found my guys still missing point blank shots, or missing against inanimate objects. More often than not I had scenarios where my guys didn't hit a single thing, and everyone just died. I mean come on! their warriors, dedicating their lives to protect a kingdom and they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.Also the mechanics of their hit rates seemed all over the place, Sometimes I found  at the furthest distance you can be from an enemy you get a better hit percentage, but sometimes that idea went right out the window. Also there is no indicator of how far a move can go before you move your character. leaving me with guys one space shy of being able to hit something a lot of the time. (attack ranges of at least your characters needs to be displayed) many games like final fantasy tactics, or Disgea execute this much better. Some voice acting issuessome of the banter between your 2 chalice deities or w/e seems like it was cut short, and some cut scenes show a glowing light when ever they talk, but they stop talking and the light keeps flickering, and it feels like you missed the end of a conversation half the time. illusion of freedomyou are given a lot of choices to upgrade your kingdom, but I found myself not making it past the 4th or 5th battles If I didn't stick to a precise set of upgrades. Enemies get a lot harder each time you have a battle. There is a nice pull and push in fighting back oncoming enemies. You are attacked by 2 groups, one you can kill, the other takes 1/3 of the tile. So you have an important decision on what you need to defend. However some tiles ie. the most outer ones (going to be attacked 1st every time) have perks to them. like makes research faster, or lvls up your guys faster. having them only on the outer edge of the map seems stupid. there should be a perk per tile. You're going to loose tiles no matter what and it feels like a whole one step forward 2 steps back process.Leveling up your heroes:This is a hard mechanic to get your 1st play through, and you won't rly know how to do it efficiently until like your 2nd-4th play through.You heroes die of old age pretty fast, so instead of lvling them up you really need to pass down (items/relics) that get better with every generation. Also parents pass down traits, some good some bad. So don't get attached to anyone, get attached to bloodlines. This is a cool mechanic too, buuuuuuuuuut to do this you need higher lvl heroes to become rulers of their keeps (bloodline homes) and it's rly hard to start a bloodline when all you ever have are clumsy dorks who usually have crappy stats to begin with because they are lvl 1, and you can't really get anyone better because they have to die off, and by that time you may or may not have already lost the game. level design:some levels have really cool mechanics, like moving obstetrical that can be pushed or destroyed by enemies and this lets you block off areas, obstruct enemy vision ,and is a pretty cool mechanic, buuuuuuuuuuuuuut( sigh) it's only in 2 levels. The one with the egg shaped blocks that can move around, and the other level with geysers. visuals:AWESOME! Doublefine is great at making games with their own character, and this game is no exception. I just wish the game was not so frustratingly, and sometimes, impossibly difficult. This game has a long way to go if it's going to be good, and I want it to be good, that's why I got it.To support them, there was a kick starter and stuff, but they still need a help.     :(			"

								Having completed my first game, I would liken Massive Chalice as a XCOM light in a fantasy setting, with a twist; bloodlines. Light because it doesn't have the depth and content of XCOM. There is little explanation on what Cadence really is, and there are only 2 types of missions; defend the keep and defend the territory, aside from the final mission. That said, the game is also about half the price of XCOM.The concept of bloodlines is interesting but unfortunately, the drawback is that your heroes die so fast from aging, you will not develop any attachment to them, unlike XCOM. You will have to plan carefully on what to do with your heroes, making sure that you have a sufficient fighting force and at the same time, enough set aside to research and continue the next generation. In my opinion, while the game is fun, it needs more polish, balancing and CONTENT. I wouldn't mind paying more if the game has more content. As it stands, I would rate it a 7/10.			"

								I've lost 40 hours to this game in the early stages of beta, and I'm still ready for more. The game is great as it is, but will only become more balanced, polished and rewarding in the run up to the spring 2015 release. I kickstarted this game, and the team have been really responsive, streaming their development progress every couple of weeks the whole time, and it's been fun to be a part of, so if the idea of helping fine tune a game's mechanics sounds cool to you, I'd definitely consider Early Access. So far they've been responding really well to everyone's feedback with several significant balance tweaks in the short 3 weeks since the backer beta began.Even if you just want to play the game, there's a fine XCOM style strategy already working here with a generational twist, and if that sounds like your thing, I can totally recommend picking it up either now or once it's totally done in the spring if you'd rather play something completely done - but you can play it start to finish right now and have a great time.Add in super distinctive art direction and a wonderful soundtrack, as well as some very Double-Finey touches to the world building and writing, and this is one of my favourite games of the year, which is quite an achievement for something that's still got a few months of development left to go!

								Train your heroes, guide them in battle and then make sure that enough of them get married and have children that you can repeat the process.This game is all about pitting the needs of the realm's future against the need to guard the realm from present danger and I loved playing through it even in its current early access state.The turn based combat is reminiscent of XCOM or Shadowrun returns but instead of managing cover you need to manage line of sight, enemies that cannot see you cannot shoot you. Keep that in mind and remember neither side gets overwatch.			"

								This game has me spending way too much time than what I should be (in a good way). Once I start playing I have difficulty turning it off as there is always ""one-more event"" that I begin counting down to and the battles are engaging and well designed.I really enjoy the ""recruitment"" process of marrying off your heroes and having them found dynasties to continue producing heirs and playable heroes. It's a great twist on how heroes are usually recruited, especially with the ability to breed for particular traits.It's great how much the game is actually affected by this mechanic, as you need to decide when to essentially ""retire"" heroes in order to benefit from their strengths in future generations, without them dying before their time.It would be good to see one or two new classes be brought into the fray, there would obviously be alot of work required to maintain the excellent balance that already exists, however the addition of extra classes would prevent it from getting stale too quickly.I also enjoy the random events that require decisions to be made and years later the full repercussions of these events are revealed, for good or bad, it really makes you take the time to think on your choices, as you can't simply save / load a file to rethink your decision.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good turn-based strategy with roguelike elements, a gameplay and difficulty similar to the likes of X-Com, however it is certainly by no means an X-Com clone.

												A lot of what is said in reviews is spot on and even more is complete and total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t...Balance: Flawless. People saying they loved XCOM EU/EW and hate this game because ""it isn't balanced"" is hilarious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Massive Chalice does a better job at getting me to bring one of each unique class into each battle than any other tactical game I have played. You have a melee class, a grenadier style class, and a ranged class as you three base classes and then merging bloodline will create hybrids. Having one of each base class was a must for me playing and I enjoyed it.Story: Decent. This is made better with the fantastic voice acting and great visuals. This is yet another claim that boggles my mind- that the ""story is boring and XCOM is better"". The ""story"" was by FAR the weakest part of XCOM, ""aliens are here, kill them, they only have one master ship, kill it"". If you are playing either of these two games for ""the story"" you are in the wrong genre friend...Combat: Decent. This one is true. Other tactical games (such as XCOM EW/EU as well as Divinity Original Sin) have produced a much more solid combat experience. Every fight is on a flat surface with elevation never being introduced. Some games (like Divinity) get away with their fights being only on one surface but it can be felt in this game. There is enough tactical fun and content here to make combat fun and thought provoking but not enough depth or inovations for it to be a selling feature.Bloodlines: Great. This one has not been done well in any other tactical game save for some Fire Emblem games (which have even LESS tactical combat) and it has been done well here. Relics that get passed down bloodlines and playing ""game of thrones"" with regents is great. This is a huge selling feature for this game, if it does not interest you then buying the game would most likely be a mistake.Length: Weak. Each ""generation"" needs to be 4x as long with 4x as many battles. You can beat the game in 15-20 hours. This is (IMO) the single greatest problem with the game- the combat was never a selling feature (IMO) for the game and didn't need that much more content (if any) but the world size as well as content feels lacking. It is a shame that mods were never really a deal as a ""Long War"" mod for this game I would frankly enjoy far more than on XCOM EU...Tower Defense: Weak. I add this in as well even though combat doesn't reflect a ""tower defense"" style of play the ""defending the heart of your country as things come in from the borders"" style of play is present in the ""world view"" aspect of the game. I am a huge fan of ""no lost countries"" and would never, EVER lose a single country in XCOM- that CANNOT happen in this game. This game is a ""hold out long enough to win"" style of game with countries/areas that will fall regardless of your actions. I hate this, it would be the first thing I mod out or at least give some way/option to fight to retake it (like in XCOM LW).Overall: You want a decent turn based tactical game with country management and bloodline control there is nothing better on the market. If you want pure tactical combat with nil story and nil country management and nil bloodline control then this isn't for you. If you are somewhere inbetween then I would still recommend, I would just suggest picking it up on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								This is just an initial review for the 7.2 hours I've managed to put into the game so far (year 150) so please keep that in mind.I feel that Massive Chalice wants to be more than just a tactics game, more than just an empire game. Where the game is now, however, it's not /quite/ there - but it more than easily has that potential. The attacks on your kingdom force you to truly build up a team of heroes that rival the forces of the Cadence, while at the same time making you choose which of those heroes will carry on a bloodline, teach trainees, and who will carry on the research. The balancing act is, by itself, a game that put me to a bit of a challenge, at first.As I said, I feel that this game wants to do two things at once, which is fine. But in the wise, immortal words of Ron Swanson; ""Never half♥♥♥♥♥two things, whole♥♥♥♥♥one thing."" My first playthrough (which ended up with me having zero hunters and no idea how to get out of that bind) was a complete flop - But it frustrated me in a way that I /wanted/ to find out how to remedy that situation. So, I started anew and quickly built up three keeps, stocking them each with one of the classes, figuring this would keep my army strong with new recruits and my sagewrights pouring in.How wrong I was. Quickly, it became apparent that I had partnered with each of my regents, Queenmakers. My female population boomed! That wouldn't have been an issue if most of my males had survived past the Regent's deaths (I've only had one hero die on the battlefield, so far, my regents just refused to die). As it was, I struggled to balance out my kingdom. It was wonderful and challenging just enough because you cannot replace regents, you cannot pull back your sagewrights. But now, in year 150, I've found that simply bolstering your ranks with new recruits from the research/build option, that's never an issue.But it should be! And while, yes, I should be able to recharge my kingdom with new blood, I find that I'm able to do so easily and without effort because of this; There's simply not enough to build/research that I can't spare 15 years to recruit three times in a row. And this leads me to my next point...The combat is fantastic! I love when the Cadence get the balls to move into my territory and the balancing act of which territory will get an extra corruption. Now, being in Early Access I understand the sameness over and over, but each battle I try to go into with a fresh perspective because the enemy types aren't always the same. However I've come to realize that currently, hunters are extremely powerful. Not because they're overpowered, but because Alchemists and Caberjacks just aren't up to snuff yet.The Alchemist does have a nice aoe attack, but it pales in comparison to a hunter because of the lack of vials. And while they're ""weak"" physically, most of mine do actually punch things pretty hard - so they're not totally useless after they've blown their load all over the field, but I just feel like having the hunter would do more for me. Caberjacks, on the other hand, hit like Optimus Prime and if you equip them in the Bulwark armor they're actually fairly tough tanks. But they lack the range of their hunter counterpart and still have the same HP pool on most heroes.Now, I know these things can be breeded out through genetics of your bloodlines, and that's fine. I just don't feel like the other two classes are quite up to par just yet - which is terrible because it caused me to build another two keeps for more hunters and another for Caberjacks (as a just in case) but I completely disregard my alchemist line except for Sagewrights. Which, in a weird way actually works out well because I've bred them to be intuitive and that helps research times. Except, I'm out of things to research.So, in closing, Massive Chalice has great potential and while it is still in Early Access, it's the perfect time to get this kind of feedback in for the developers to look at. Again, only halfway through my (second) playthrough and I can see replayability being a thing, because I want to know how some of those random events turn out in other ways. If you're on the fence about this game, I highly recommend it, especially if Double Fine can keep up the work.			"

								Double Fine has delivered.  Massive Chalice is everything that they said it would be in the original Kickstarter.  The alpha/beta have been fully playable, with no game breaking bugs, just some minor balance/pacing/difficulty issues that they've been working hard to fix before the final release.  What's also impressive is how much of the development they did ""in the open"" with near constant team stream videos and blog posts.  Most importantly, though, the game is fun to play.  If you enjoyed X-Com, Enemy Unknown, you'll like this game, as the gameplay is similar, but the bloodlines system adds a lot of depth and makes you feel more of a connection with your heroes.			"

								Ok, so I'm already 7 hours into this game according to steam, and I bought it yesterday. (wha... how'd that happen?)I am REALLY digging this game. The spirit of the game has the right amount of snarkiness / playfullness and is completely unforgiving (in a good way). I highly recommend giving this game a shot - it already feels finished enough that you can do a solid, fun playthrough- and I expect it will only improve as we get closer to a 1.0 release.I'm playing this on an incredibly outdated (mid 2011) macbook air, so the settings are cranked WAYYY down, but I have to say that even on the lowest settings the game is both playable and INTERESTING TO LOOK AT! I have a better computer that I haven't had a chance to download it on (it's my DOTA2 box that sits at my friends house) but I'll be doing that for sure the first chance I get - I hear the art direction is really amazing and it shines through even on crappy settings.

Awesome tactical combat once you get the hang of it2. A good mix of humorous and serious tones3. Gorgeous art style.4. Challenging but rewarding leveling5. Great difficulty, challenging but never unfair6. Character breeding. Take two characters together, make a keep, slap them together, and boom! Warrior baby! or lowly peasant baby, all depends really.7.Ability to research different upgrades, buildings, and character skills for different play styles8. passing of weapons of fallen heroes9. The story plays over 300 years so you have to plan in advanced to get good heroes that were created due to the hard work of their ancestors who you controlled in battle leading to a lineage of heroes.10. Random events occur as time passes and you get to pick the result, each with its own consequencesAll is not perfect however. There are a few drawbacks1. Only 3 classes2. Not too many abilities for each class3. The tutorial is a bit convoluted. It confused me more than it should have. It plays like all other tactical games but you wouldnt know by the diagram they throw at you.4. Not a lot to reasearch5. A lack of options in most areas. There are a few but not nearly enough			"

												The game has great combats but there's also many weaknesses in the design of the global management mainly, plus many design choices of the global management that I don't like.The main negative points that are more or less objectives:- The UI looks cool and is ok for combats, but overall it is rather weak on many points because of a bad ""ease of use"" design, like bizarre cumbersome lists, inability to check keeps during events or during some other actions, lack of switch tool like see next hero detail or see next keep detail, many more. You'll get more or less used to it, but it's still a rather weak point except in combat where it could be improved but it is ok overall.- There's a lot of random spread into the global management but they are too much pure random, much more procedurally generated random could only be much better.- There's too many rules or effects not explained, it's a design choice of the game copying a bad design element of old classic roguelike, it's still a bad design even if some old classics used it.- The strategy layer coming from the general management is rather thin. It's more a management game than a strategy game, few strategic choices, not much opportunities to setup plans and adapt plans. The game is much more about series of micro decisions. To be clear new xcom is a bit better on this but not good either.But for me the weakest points of the game are design choices that some other type of players could enjoy, the main points are:- The general management is designed with a spirit of high negativity, it's copying a design approach of old classic roguelike. It's not a matter of difficulty, it's a matter of being negative. For example you have to bother with paralytic, asthmatic, mostly blind, drunk, sterile, nervous heroes is just pointless and highly unpleasant for me. It's honestly my main grip against the game, and without this I'd probably vote thumb up, perhaps.- Mixed classes are by themselves a good design but how you get heroes classes linked to keeps marriages is generating a high lost of control of classes used, and I don't like at all this. That destroys the ability to do thematic replays based on a choice of a set of classes. That point is also a major reason why I am overall more negative than positive about the game.- There's many events along a campaign play, the problem is your choice will be random until you know the answers. The events are a good idea but I don't like at all to have to do random choices, and it's infuriating when it leads to a huge penalty and a smash in your face.- Too much random in the global management gameplay, that's tedious for me.For the sake of balance, I should add that the game has also good and even great points:- The combats are very interesting with both depth and tactical diversity at your disposition. And don't listen players complaining Hunters are only valid or that the game has no tactical depth, it's just they don't know play the game.- Despite there's only a relative random generation of combats areas, it's still working rather well and don't feel repetitive. It could be better but overall it's a good point.- The aesthetic choice of the game could seem bizarre at first, but it works very well, it looks rather nice once you admit the approach, and such aesthetic will never look old. On that aspect the UI is successful too and has a nice and marking look. It's too bad that the ""ease of use"" of the UI isn't as good.- The events are a good idea to setup a story mood along a play, and that works rather well, too bad that the choices you have to do for those events are too much random until you know the events/choices/consequences.Overall only players that like a lot either pure random and negativity spirit, either squad combats, should try this game. Other should apply a lot of caution. Myself I'm in second category and don't really regret my buy, but it's definitely for me a highly irritating and relatively frustrating game.			"

												Massive Chalice combines aspects of tactical squad-based games like XCOM with a eugenics simulator to create a pretty unique strategy experience. Broadly speaking, the game divides into two distinct segments: the ""grand"" strategy map, where you'll mostly make choices with regards to things like what to research, who to marry to whom, how to react to certain events etc., which are interrupted by enemy attacks in the tactical maps, which play out very similarly to XCOM missions if without quite as much detail or tactical flexibility.There are some genuinely intriguing design decisions here - marrying off heroes of two separate classes will create hybrid classes, opening up new options in the tactical maps. High-level heroes will leave behind heirlooms when they die, letting their legacy live on through those relics (which can also be levelled). The Cadence (the evil guys) will always attack more than one region at a time, leaving you to make broader strategic choices as to how to defend your territory with the ultimate aim of surviving for the 350 or so years the game spans.The graphics are charming, albeit simplistic. They do fit the theme of the game, which is light-hearted and fun. That doesn't mean it's a simple game; it's just simple to get into. The controls are easy to pick up, but it's the broader context of the game that's harder to master. Building lasting bloodlines, ensuring a sufficient diversity of hero classes through shrewd marriages and the like...all the while cheering for the battlefield victories of individual heroes you'll come to know, love and mourn as they pass. RIP SpaceJesus Doodlebats, gone but never forgotten.			"

								I backed Massive Chalice on Kickstarter and it's probably one of the best decisions I've made, in terms of money spent on games.The game plays like long-form, fantasy X-Com. You control a squad of heroes against a force of maurauding monsters. Instead of aliens, however, you fight the Cadence. Demonic entities that can corrupt the land, steal experience from your champions, and even age those they touch by years at a time. Your champions wield bow, flask, and caber in the defence of your kingdom.Your advantage in this war? An immortal king (the player) who can guide the battles of the nation over the course of centuries, and the Chalice, which can charge up over this time to lay waste to the Cadence on a global scale.Over the course of 300 years, you'll research new weapons and technologies, build keeps and other fortifications, and most importantly, guide the destinies of heroic bloodlines. For while the combat is similar in concept to X-Com, you do not recruit new heroes out of thin air. They must be bred. The strongest champions become regents, and through arranged marriage, their children are made stronger. Weak traits are weeded out, strengths are promoted over the course of generations. Will your bloodlines become strong enough to make the final push to wipe out the Cadence?With the latest patch to the beta game, there are now Hybrid classes that greatly mix up the combat, and I have been having a blast. (although the pure Hunter, Alchemist, and Caberjack classes are still fun). Personally I like the ****/Alchemist hybrids the best.In short, the game gives us tactical, squad-based combat on an epic scale, and somehow makes Eugenics fun.Go play it.			"

								Massive chalice? It might as well be called ""Massive Time Sink"", but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Like similar games in the tactical campaign genre, this one involves a lot of careful planning and unnecessary soldier deaths. The thing that sets it apart, however, is the breeding system, where family lines continue on through the ages, passing down training and useful traits. While these bloodlines are kept mostly safe in keeps, it's possible through poor luck or poorer planning to lose one entirely-- which keeps things interesting.Basically, if you enjoy short rounds of tactical combat spread over prolonged strategic campaigns, this is an excellent game. It's strongest when you're making interesting decisions, and the random events keep things lively, but it's not as fun when you've made a fatal mistake but still have an hour of gameplay before the inevitable loss claims you.

								Brilliant game, given it's just gone into beta. Dripping with character; especially driven by the two voice-actors, who are both brilliantly acted and scripted.Wonderful to see original character classes (caberjacks, hunters, and alchemists) and not see the stereotypical fantasy tropes (fighter, mage, cleric, barbarian etc).Interface presents very much like XCom, which is a good thing. Simple-enough to use, but all the things you want are there: line-of-sight, rotation, stealth, alternate attacks, visible chance-to-hit, etc.Graphics are very obviously polygonal--such that you wonder if its intentionally stylistic. But maybe that's rendering that needs to happen between now and production.My double-fine thumbs are raised!			"

								i'm one of the Bloodline ackers of Massive chalice and seldom ive seen  team with that much competence and organisatorial skills.The game is now not only in a playable state which is something a lot of EA titles dont even reach no its fully playable and great fun indeed most of the finished games nowadays are really bad in comparison regarding content. At the moment its not even Feature complete a lot of stuff will still be added, Polished and improved.The game is so good that i can just say Buy it if you are interested in TB strategy games. Its irrelevant if its still EA its worth that money already.			"

								I think this game is great so far. It is XCOM with a twist, however I think that the game does need a little worktwo things that come to mindTime passes to quick, the maximum amount of missions one hero seems to get to go on is 3 (4 if you start them at 15 years old and they live to be 87). Building up one unit almost has no pay off, apart from being able to give someone in his/her bloodline a boost when they die.Enimies get really hard really fast, I have heard this complaint from others, but it's true, I have completely wiped a few times. This challenge is part of what makes a game like Massive Chalice great, but I think it is just a bit too hard (an no difficulty option to make it a little easier on you.)It's a great game and I'm sure that Double Fine is going to be able to make it really wonderful.

								In this game, you are an immortal and immobile ruler of the kingdom besieged by evil poisonous monsters. The talking Chalice is going to purge the monsters in 300 years, so you have to survive that period with the help of the warriors you recruit, manage and guide in turn-based X-COM-like battles. There is a twist - be it a kingdom management projects or hero level-ups, it takes long time. LONG time. Years, decades, literally. So the value of each investment and decision is becoming critically high.Your heroes are aging and dying of old age, as well as in battle, so you have to account for it by retiring them from active roster to form a family and produce offspring - your new cannon fodder. You can also retire them to research and training instituions- with age heroes get increased ""wisdom"" property, which is good for those activities. One hero can only participate in a few actual battles, so you can't get a fighter from first to last level in a single lifetime.  This way, it becomes important to find the right time to retire your leveled-up hero to the family life - for the children of leveled-up characters will be automatically pre-leveled-up in accordance with their parents, and so can continue the advancement.Good stuff:-Beautiful design-The feeling of advancing despare and desperation, the all-powerful Time and Death.-Gameplay is easy to pick up and is quite enjoyable.Not so good stuff:-Story is rudimentary-There are not a lot of options for research/kingdom management, and even less of those are really worth consideration.-The game is ""evil""-tough. I'll elaborate on this. In turn based combat games, like X-COM, there is usually a strong feeling of risk and the enemy outgunning you. It's tough, as screw-ups can lead to devastating effects for the whole team, and you have to take chances, think strategically and even just pray for a lucky outcome. This is part of the appeal, because it adds suspence and a semblance of realism.In this game, though, the toughness is not of a risky, but of a depressing kind most of the time. Your team is screwed up from the start: your options for strategical advance and recon are limited by abilities/landscape. Also, there is almost no chance for blind luck to give you joy once in a while. I do understand that it's the part of the idea that your fighters will die messily and often. But mission after mission of ""we are blindly rushing in a pre-arranged death-trap"" kills fun rather sooner than later.Still, all in all, it's an interesting game with a potential, as it's still in EA stage.

								MASSIVE CHALICE is worth buying if you're a fan of XCOM, or like the idea of long term management along with tactical combat. The management seems more complex than XCOM, but at the end of the day you're just looking at numbers. Combat isn't as complex as XCOM since there isn't cover or many advanced tactics, but it is still fun. The game will last you about 15-20 hours, and it does have some good replayability since you can take a different research route. The only things left to really add to the game are difficulty levels and IRON mode, which will probably just prevent you from loading your game whenever.A video shows most of what the game is about:

								8/10 This game is amazing.The gameplay is fun and involved, the lineage system is truly revolutionary.Would've 9/10 + except for a few things. I know its still in beta, but getting past around year 100 is extremely difficult, to the point of impossible, and the gameplay has too much missing. (i know this sounds silly, missing is a good mechanic that can make things more lifelike), but in a strategy based game, especially at higher levels, it makes it very hard to plan attack strategies around the immensly strong enemies when you miss so often. each character has their sweet spots and you can even upgrade an item to make them more accurate, but it is still stressful. The alchemist which are supposed to be weak units that must hit from afar only start with 5 bombs, and you have to be within 2-3 spaces to get anything higher than a 60%, so they die. alot. even melee units, some units will get around a 60% when attacking at point blank. yet some get 100%. im not quite sure how this is supposted to work. Its a fantastic game, however I don't believe a strategy game's difficulty should be based around missing your target or not. (especially when the enemies have 4x your health and they dont miss half as much as you do, and deal more damage).			"

The art style is simple and easy to understand. The music is very nice and upbeat. All in all, the game is as deep as you want it to be. Maximizing parent skills is fun and keeps me interested in the bloodline. I would recommend this game to any X com fan as it is fairly well polished and at least in my opinion really fun so far.			"

								Massive chalice isn't a conventional strategy game in the terms that you have very few research management. Your currency is essentially time and death is a regular part of the game. Don't get too attached to your heroes as they will age and die. The good thing though is that their legacy can still live on through their children. It manages organically like XCOM and it's simple but good.			"

								This game is being worked on intensely and things are changing all the time, so much of this is subject to change.Short version: It's fun. It's hard. It's relatively bug-free.MC seeks to address a lot of the issues with squad-based tactics games like X-COM, primarily by making character death less of an issue. The fact that even your best warriors will eventually die of old age means that losing a few in battle doesn't NECCESARILY require a restart of the entire mission. Heck, if they die in battle they might turn into a magical weapon for your other warriors to use.That being said, there are issues, though most of them just come with the territory in this type of game. There are a lot of things to research and build, and all of them take a long time. If things start going badly for you, don't expect them to stop. Sure, you have a crucible to train your new recruits, but without someone to staff it, it does no good. If you find yourself low in units and your birthrate isn't good, you can go scour for new recruits, but it takes years.			"

												What I can say about Massive Chalice is odd. It's a game that is at the same time very neat, and very clunky.For example the combat (one of the things you'll be doing the most) is laid out in a neat way, the UI is good. You get a lot of information (although not enough like the game not telling you if you'll be in the range for a melee attack) without it cluttering the interface.That however doesn't make the actual combat any better. While at first it might be enjoyable to experiment with various classes you quickly discover strategies that work best for your current line-up and stick to them.For example if you play with a lot of hunters you'll be doing a lot of sneaking and alpha striking the enemy to blow him up before he can react, as kaberjacks you'll notice that enemies take damage by getting knocked back into walls AND into units. So you'll abuse that fact for more damage+stun potential, alchemists are really only good against the weakest enemies in the game. so after the start they only really serve to make kaberjack and hunter hybrids. But that creates a problem for the other game mechanics.The breeding. It is supposed to be a big part of the game but really it turns into a chore. The mechanics are never explained properly so you have to do a lot of guesswork to understand how to do it properly. It is important to remember that your kids will not only get the traits of the parents, but also possibly random ones or traits from the OTHER members of the family tree, OR perks that you didn't even know the family has. This is extremely frustrating in the early game and if not managed properly becomes a problem in the mid and even late game.Imagine this scenario. You decide that you'll base your early game on kaberjacks (and you have to decide who to base it on early because you only get one castle at start). Cool. You built your castle, you find a good young couple with a high fertility rating and good kaberjack stats and mush them together. Recipe for success right? No.Now it took your super fertile mating pair anywhere between 0 and 40 years to pop their first baby. They might NEVER get one even though the release day patch supposedly altered the numbers. But hey, there is a kid! Oops he's asthmatic and anaemic. So he can't run and he has reduced hp. WHy is that?! Oh because both family trees had those perks hidden in their genes and you had absolutely NO way of knowing that. Enjoy.Now imagine you're doing this for 300 in-game years while having to constantly bring in new blood (and new bad traits) because upkeeping a family that is provided for is apparently a really hard task.So yeah, neat idea, pretty dull and clunky execution. Same you could say for most of the game.Honestly if this is how Double Fine keep doing things I think I'll just stop buying things from them altogether.			"

												This game is so much fun! One of the writers on Rock Paper Shotgun dubbed this game ""SEXCOM"" which is the best, most accurate name for this game. I don't know if I'm enjoying this more than XCOM, but I am enjoying is as much as I did XCOM. I love just about everything about it, but I am terrible at it. It requires a lot of planning expect to spend hours deliberating which of your soldiers you need to start fracking each other for the sake of mankind's survival.There's definitely one big complaint I have with this game, though. There's no customization, The ability to design your own houses was a kickstarter reward which the creators really should have recognized as a terrible idea in the first place, I'm really hoping for a patch, dlc, or even a mod to change this.

												Still some things need to be imporved... But a must buy game!Overall on of the best stratagy games out there!  (NEW, game release review!) The release of a game update made the game so so so much better! its like a complete new game, a DLC to the game you can say.  I really like how you can feel so close to your heros/family in this game.... and you scream at the computer if one dies! i have done that so many times, that i felt embaressed when i did it.  My brother comes running up the stairs, ""are you ok brother!?"" then I scream at him, ""no way brother! raphtin potter died!""  I love the main map, I love how the tec works in the game, but I wish I could research two tecs at the same time. I wish there were more buildings to build.  But I only want more in the game because I like is so much!  I love the time line in how it works... after years your heros die and you need to breed a new set of heros every 40 years or so, and your tec and buildings take years to build and research.  most of what I wrote about is in the battle, but everything in the main map screen I really like. With the new controller support it feels like a completely different game, but I say that because I enjoy playing with the xbox 360 controller.... I give Massive Chalice a 9/10!!!1. I am playing on a surface pro one, which I can play games like crisis 2, whicher 2, skyrim... but this games graphics are not as good as xcoms and xcom works way better then this.  MC is very laggy even after putting it in windowed and revolution low, and taking off all the visual effects.  I played Gang Beasts from doubled fine and it has the same problem!!!!  I hope they fix this(UPDATE: FIXED GRAPHICS :)2. voices are good, but they need to put the voises together so there are no pauses in the cinamatics.  Also they need to add more voices into the game for the characters.  After they kill someone a comic book animation pops up, making it look like the character say something, why not make the character just have a voice over? also the cinamatics are very boring, make the speaks voices together without pauses(FIXED THE CINAMATICS :) but they still need to add voice overs for the families once they kill a bad dued)3. I am not sure why, but one of my guy attacks a ghost looking guy, and he does 2 damage (which it said he would do 11-15 damage), then another guy with the same weapon attacks and kills it doing 15 damage to it.  (UPDATE: STILL NOT FIXED :(4. (New) They need to make the heros more memorable in some way.			"

								It's early access so beware if you're not willing to put up with that. Right now it's kind of a mixed stew for me. I like the concept and much of what's implemented. Haven't had time to play alot yet but I can list some +/- at least.+The gfx style is kind of an aquired taste but it reminds me of games such as the Interstate '76 series. It's quite nice in it's simplicity.The Bloodline Genetics system adds some depth to the game.The voiceover for the chalice ... ghosts?Fighting. It's not very complex but satisfying, mostly.Easy to get started but from what I can tell mastering it will take some practice.-Randomness. Yes there's always gonna be some degree of randomness but I feel it's a bit harsh sometimes. Like spawning in the middle of a big pack of cadence, assigning two healthy middle age heros to a castle and having one of them dying in a year with no children. Etc. If bad luck like this was rare I guess it would be fine but it's happened a couple of times in my short playtime.I think the time progresses a bit fast. Now don't get me wrong I don't want the game itself that much slower, build and research times don't need to be longer. But I'd like to spend a little more time with my heros. To get to know them better during combat etc. Mabe more frequent encounters would work as well.About half of the cadence I've faced so far explode making Caberjacks alot less useful than hunters and alchemists. This might work itself out when I get further and can start upgrading armor, get them to higher levels etc. But early game I don't really see the point to them. The cadence that don't explode can be killed just as easy by the two ranged classes. And while caberjacks get charge at level 1 and it has a knockback it has cooldown and if it doesn't finish the cadence off it can just walk up and explode next to the caberjack when your turn ends. Would be good if even at low levels with no upgrades to gear caberjacks had more health or better damage mitigation so they had better survivabilty,			"

								Fantastic game in most aspects. The musical direction is superb, the combat has its own unique yet familiar feel, and the game will have you do some selective breeding. The things I feel that could use some work are the usefulness of classes, such as the caberjack, which is a melee brute-like class that I let die out everytime I had one, not on purpose, but because I gave Hunters and Alchemists priority. The hybrid classes are what filled my ranks however, each one is unique and they mix classes from both of the parent's classes. The decision you make is what traits you want to have your future soldeirs to carry. I binged this game, mainly because that's how I intake these things. The game is fantastic and I will be doing another run through because the game was a bit too easy, and it was kind, I got hawkeyed and longetivity traites for most of my beginnner soldiers. So seeing them die at the age of 70 was sad but I felt good knowing that others can die at 40~. If anything the game's ending (no spoilers) could use a bit more of an expansion or some work, I just think it needs that ""legacy"" feel as the whole game is literally built around legacies, but YOUR legacy. It could be sequel bait(I don't mind it on this occasion because I'm down for a sequel). The hate I see on forums is based on it being DF and spacebase. Frankly however, this game differs and seems to have had a lot of time and effort put into it. If you buy this game, you will NOT regret it. You'll be fighting the cadence for a long time...almost 300 years.			"

								WARNING: Do not start playing this game until you have several days of free time open. At first glance, this seems like a fairly standard turn-based strategy game, but it is far more. Managing bloodlines within your nation will leave you immersed for hours and hours. In fact, I often found that actual time seemed to speed forward like the in-game time! The combat itself is a lot of fun, but I got a rush of adrenaline every time I activated the ""time forward"" button. Seeing families live and die while passing legacies onto their children is really damn cool. In addition, having to make decisions with real consequences is a nice touch to add to the immersion.  This game has far exceeded my expectations when I backed it on Kickstarter (full disclosure!).			"

Early Access Review
								First Review ever on steam!One it's in early access so there is more to come but form what I've played it's got alot of potential to become a very great game.ok my review!If you liked X-Com: Enemy unknown, Grand Strategy games, state breading (pokemon style) and a simple but hard game play. Try this game!The combat comes down to a very few things, range attacks, AoE, melee and knock back. The enemies have there own strengths and weaknesses, but though the use of your Heros you can over come the enemies (mosly by combos of keep you enemy away and taking them down one at a time). The story is well something intresting, you can have it narrated straight forwerd or silly. The combat can be overwellming when you have to many enemies to fight off at once (4 or more different provoked enemies will kill someone or your whole party)What I hope comes to the full version is-more classes-AI boss enemies (maybe evolving like you heros though some breading)-AI that know how to run away to fight again with there fellow enemies-AI that try to flank or trick you into a fight-more weapons-making your own custom Families/House (banner and Names)All in all really good game, you may find your self saying "" oh just a few more years, just a bit longer"".

												Dont play this game unless you want an uglier XCOM with a medieval theme, seriously though this game is ugly as♥♥♥♥♥♥  and really poorly optimized.  My laptop choked on it frequently, crashed a few times, and its far uglier, with less going on, than many i play.			"

								This game is great. The concept behind it is fun and creative. I just with there were different diffivulty levels that you could choose from. I had a dozen or so extremely frustrating playthroughs befoer I got the hang of it. I still enjoyed it, but I need a break for awhile before I dive in again. It makes me want to have a drink			"

								Super fun game. Surprised myself when I realised I've spent 37 hours in it already.And I wouldn't call myself a strategy game player.Stable for me, some minor graphical stuttering but only in specific parts of the game.Mechanics are solid, still getting tweaks from fan feedback but I can't find much to fault.Learning the mechanics and testing new strategies.Fun end-game ""boss""A friend said: ""Like a cross between Civ and Advance Wars""			"

												I've heard that the dev. team from the original XCOM game was put into this new title. As a turn-based strategy genre fan, I was very excited and looking up for this game as some kind of a new XCOM. However, it is not as what I hoped for. I couldn't feel any emotion or any regret for the characters upon their deaths. They would have died for old age anyway with or without diving into a combat which would make their basic characteristics doesn't matter at all. The game could have been better if there are more developments are put in the game. I couldn't see much the same from the original XCOM. I got this on sale so I won't be complaining much, but it is still good if it is a bit cheaper. I wish for a neutral button between yay and nay, or a poker face as my expression.			"

Early Access Review
								The potential for this game is through the roof, however there are a few issues that hinder the experiences.1. Hard to form any type of emotional bond with a character when they due of old age after only fighing in 2 or 3 fights in their entire lifetime.  With no real emotional connection to a character, permadeath isn't really that gripping.2. The child birth rate is embrassingly low.  I was always low on heros about ~30 years into the game.  These heros up their game.3. My biggest complaint has to be on the accuracy of attacks.  The game says these heros have trained their entire life to fight the Cadence, however they are painfully bad at landing attacks.  I've had turns where I've had improbably bad luck (a 95% missed, a 90% missed, 80% missed, then 2 60%s missed, same turn) and this happens A LOT.  I believe the percentages reported are not accuracte to the actual chances.  Maybe there is something I am missing.  Instead of having a hunter having a 50% chance to do 10 damage, give them a 90% chance to do 5-6 damage.  This removes the feeling that your hero (who has trained for this their entire life) is painfully incompent who can only hit a target 10 feet away 50% of the time.  Again, its a good game.  Needs more polish, but it looks promising.			"

												1 min in: Wait this is made by double fine studios? Ok I really hope that isn't an omen6 min in: Oh lord this is hilarious! There are so many factions to pick from. LIke there are 20 pages alone for just the ones beginning with the letter S. They're arranged in alphabetical order which is nice. All of these are pretty great like this one battle cry ""For Glory!...or something."" Oh man I bet this game is going to be great.10 min in: Okay picked my houses, now to go on to the game. Okay so I'm some immortal commander, giant talking chalice with two spirit things. And some kind of encroaching darkness on the land I have to keep back for the next 300 years so the chalice can charge up its super awesome attack to vanquish it for good. Okay why didn't you ever do this sooner? I guess I'll accept it for now. Oh look an attack is going on, better go take care of it.12 min in: Hey this looks like xcom, oh cool all the characters have different traits, like faint of heart which will make you weaker when your allies die. That sounds like something from xcom. At least all the houses i chose are what these guys are from. Oh whats this? These guys have kids? That sounds pretty cool. I can have different blood lines, this is going to be sweet.13 min in: Hey...why do these controls look a lot like xcom's...14 min in: Okay time to move my guys...Wait thats how you move them...Oh no this is exactly like Xcom's movement system.15 min in: Hey look an enemy, alright so how do we...wait what? Enemy in sight...darkness outside the field of view...Oh you have got to be kidding me. This is XCOM! Its literally the same game but in a fantasy setting. Okay maybe I'm just judging it a little too early. After all if this is like XCOM, its a very long game before you learn everything. i'm sure there will be mechanics that make it vastly different from XCOM.20 min in: Seriously the combat is a direct rip off of XCOM, except this time only one guy can shoot things that are 2 feet in front of him and still miss. You even have units that use grenades! Oh I'm sorry ""Alchemists"" that throw ""flasks"" Yeah nice save there.22 min in: Okay beat the first battle, now on to the non-combat section of the game. I bet this is where it will diffirentiate itself from XCOM, i mean there is no way they'd copy that as well...right?24 min in: Oh so i can assign regents to a keep, putting them in charge of it with a partner. Then they procreate, have kids and they also become heroes which i can take into battle, or assign to lead into a keep? Hey thats pretty neat.28 min in: Okay I took care of everything here, now i just click on that play button there....Oh come on! You copied that from XCOM too!? The map is just like the base from XCOM, come on double fine! Whatever, maybe theres more than meets the eye. After all 300 years are supposed to pass, there is going to at least be more mechanics than what i'm seeing right now.30 min in: Alright it appears 5 years have passed and, oh a new battle, alright lets go to that region and protect it. Now lets go to the screen and select my heroes to fi-ITS THE SAME AS XCOM'S! THE DEPLOYMENT SCREEN IS LITERALLY XCOM'S BUT JUST WITH THEM STANDING OVER A CHALICE! OH COME ON! Whatever just lets see these classes. Alchemist, Caberjack, Hunter, and...Is that it? Are you seriously telling me there are only 3 classes for the heroes? Really!? You couldn't even copy XCOM on that with their 4? Are you kidding me?32 min in: There are lot of these Rupture guys, they explode and leave behind some kind of acid that damages units caught in the acid...just like in XCOM.35 min in: More of these Rupture enemies? Geez is the whole level nothing but these guys?38 min in: Oh my god the whole level was nothing but those guys...44 min in: Alright i have all this stuff set up, my regents are making babies so I'll have future generations to lead, i built this guild to research new stuff for me, everythings going pretty good...wait what? A bunch of my guys died, how? Old age!? What! Okay I understand this game takes place over the course of years, but these guys were barely level 2! And they died in their 40's! They didn't even make it past 50. Whats the point of leveling these guys up when not even 10 minutes later they'll die of old age!?50 min in: Yay more babies born, some have grown up now, Rory is a bit of a grown up now, and he isn't too bad. He's a hunter, got the hawkeye perk, I think he'll make for a fine soldier.55 min in: Another battle...terrific.63 min in: Battle won, I'm done, I'm getting really sick of this.65 min in: Yo guild! You have literally contributed nothing so far! You have done nothing to benefit our fight against this darkness. What have you done at all? I keep giving you members that end up dying of old age, but yet you continue to do nothing. Fine whatever I'll just go build this citadel thing.67 min in: So you put units in here to train? Okay I'll put Rory in here, he did well in the last battle so leveling him up is a good idea.70 min in: Finally I found a use for you guild. Research this health potion thing to heal my soldiers up.72 min in: Another battle, another day. Yay...74 min in: Holy crap someone actually died!? Wow okay thats...I really don't care. You want to know why game? Because unlike XCOM I can't bring myself to actually care about the people i'm sending in to fight. I don't grow attached to them, and unlike with XCOM, I don't cry and mourn when one of them dies. Which since you are obviously ripping them off, is a blatant failure.78 min in: HOW DID YOU MISS!? EVEN WORSE HOW DID YOU NOT ONLY MISS, BUT THROW YOUR FLASK OFF A CLIFF!? YOU SOMEHOW NOT ONLY MANAGED TO MISS YOUR TARGET WITH A 85% CHANCE OF HITTING THEM, BUT YOU ALSO MISSED AND THREW IT OFF THE CLIFF! YOU MORON!80 min in: Oh hey look its some kind of blue lady enemy made of energy. Just like X-nope not going there. I saw her earlier but she never managed to hit me with her ranged attack.81 min in: WHAT! SHE DRAINS XP WHEN SHE HITS YOU!? AND YOU CAN LOSE AN ENTIRE LEVEL IF YOU'RE HIT ENOUGH, AND YOU ALSO STILL TAKE THE NORMAL HEALTH DAMAGE!? Even XCOM didn't do that and it was incredibly difficult without it! Don't pad your game out with artificial difficulty!85 min in: Wait the losing battle system is just like XCOM's but worse...My patience is thinner than ice right now..88 min in: You know its been a few decades now, when am I getting Rory back? I know he's not dead so...where is he? He seriously can't still be training.91 min in: Seriously I don't see any difference between this and XCOM.94 min in: Build a keep here, and...Hey that area i wanted to build something on is being attacked, I better take care of that.96 min in: Alright i'm in...level bland as ever, everything literally inferior to XCOM? Yep.97 min in: Oh look more Ruptures, and blue ladies, and a ball with two legs...you know I'm just over an hour in and yet this game still only has 3 enemy types? All of which are rip offs? I guess they have a motiff of ripping off, doing worse, and giving less with this game don't they?100 min in: Units are dying but I can still win this.105 min in: Okay make that 1 guy left, at least he's an alchemist. Sure he's low health but he can deal damage from a distance and his range attacks also have an area of effect, just use that move on the last two enemies that are right beside each other and I win the battle.108 min in:...He died...He threw it...and he failed so badly...it went back and hit him...killing him...He had a 95% chance of not only hitting them, but killing them too...and he somehow manages to throw the flask at himself...110 min in: ...ffffFFFUUUU-*screams of rage destroy everything in a 200 mile radius.*4/10 Get XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Double fine stopped fixing this game just a month after release, and it still has a lot of issues.			"

								I have been playing this game in early access and was an original backer of the game in Kickstarter. This game is fun in a new way. Working with time as a factor to create young heroes and then have them fight 3-4 battles before they pass on is challenging in a new way. It is equally hard to plan for coming gernerations, R&D and fighting the acual battles.I have spent 20+ hours and will spend a lot more before I am done with this game. 8/10.			"

												The haters are amateurs and misunderstand what this game is about; this is a game about farming dozens of Pokemon and then lamenting when those Pokemon die of old age before you could force them to breed with each other. All the combat / etc. exists only to setup that moment when you realize you're promoting weird inbreeding and you realize you are DEPRAVED.The tactical layer is purposely minimalistic, it's just enough of a battle system to support the family mechanics and timeline metaphor. Hello this attitude is REFRESHING. Like, dudes, not every game should need a wiki to understand it? Loading your game with junk is DESPERATE (e.g. Shadowrun is DESPERATE) and I'm glad this game had the confidence not to do that.PROS:- Doesn't care about fantasy garbage lore, it's silly in the right places and at the right times- Battles take like 15 minutes instead of an hour, yeah sorry XCOM I don't have all day- You get to treat humans like the cattle we areNOT-SO-PROS:- With no real concept of cover, archers are really overpowered, and it doesn't help when the game lets you upgrade them into INVISIBLE DEATH ARCHERS; this is a problem they couldn't have fixed without some serious overhauls to their line of sight systems... the alternative is to make archers really inaccurate, but arbitrary % failure mechanics are never fun, so I guess they decided to just let archers be the best, and I think I agree with that- The campaign is too long, 300 years is a cool number but it's really too long, it probably should've been more like 200 years			"

Early Access Review
								I don't understand some of the negative reviews, every game has faults. But especially here the good outweighs the bad.Good:A great Tactical Turn Based RPG/Breeding Simulator. Aside from units seemingly not having ""Facing"". I'm not always doing the same thing with my capital either so far, a few times I've researched more pools of heroes to have more people to breed due to an irritating loss due to a few mistakes in combat facing a new type of enemy. This one time one of my forts was empty, so I set a 1 year old as the regent and married him to a 3 year old girl because I was low on choices (despite not knowing how likely they would be to breed). Then they had babies twice right away at ages 16 and 17. I was like ""Success!"". I feel the game gives you ""enough"" choice. For example, I had the choice of defending an area with no blight but I would get more XP for killing stuff, whereas the other place already had blight but I would only get a baby girl for defending it. It would be more risky to let the blight spread where it is already, but more rewarding for my heroes to take the non-blighted land.Not Good or Bad:Some people complain about the graphical style, saying it has ""Bad graphics"". At first it was jarring for me. But as I played about an hour into it, the style just works. It reminds me of some of the art in Civ, just in 3-D. As your heroes age, it shows in their faces. This simplified style works wonders here, as you can tell they are older just by looking at their faces. The style remains consistant throughout the game and works well in most if not all areas. It also gives it more of a painted fantasy storybook look. I wouldn't change it, but adding some new particles or lightning might further boost the look.Things I would improve:Free equipments. I think the research time should be cut and you should have to ""build"" equipments consuming monster parts. If you lose a group out in the field you lost those equips, if you lost one dude out in the field, but you won, you get his equips back. It just bugs me a little that once you research something, you immidiately get 100+ free items through the course of the game.Bad:Crucibles are too hard. There are ways of dealing with every enemy and situation in the game (so far) that I've found out by using each class's different skills (Clobberjacks for stunning things at right times, bombing enemies from around structures, using the hunter to scout ahead a bit, etc). Except for Crucibles. They seem to outrange you, and not only that they can kill any ranged person in one shot because they do like 14+ damage. If you use both actions in your turn and ""ran"" into the sight of one, you are dead as soon as it's their turn. Even Clobberjacks like level 5 with the second teir armor seem to go down to like 1/3rd hp. Since they are ranged it is sometimes hard if not impossible to get to them in time to stun them too. You either catch them around a corner and stun/bomb/kill before it's their turn, or you get unlucky and have to fight them in the open. I found on a level where there are more than 2 Crucibles, I should always expect to lose a guy. Even the brute kockback teleporting fist dude can be dealt with, but these crucibles...			"

												An interesting experiment in the squad combat space. There's not a ton of depth to the game (limited load out options for your heroes, even an extra item slot would have helped a lot) but a fun little systems demonstration for those that like the genre. Pretty light on gameplay though, so as of this writing I would probably wait till it's $10 or less, because there's just not enough here for a $20 dollar game.			"

												The important thing to note is that it is a strategy RPG. This means moving each individual piece across a map to remove Fog of War until you see the enemy and then, finally dealing with them. In addition, some of the enemies blow up when you kill them and some of your characters only do melee damage. . .  so you have to deal with only using them in melee range, but also not killing the enemies that blow-up with them. It doesn't have the speed, long sight lines, and variety of ranged attacks that made XCOM an enjoyable strategy RPG either.I'm in love with the concept of Bloodlines and family traits for a generation-spanning RPG, but the appeal of that is killed by the fact that the game is a strategy RPG. Additionally, I imagined handsome heroes growing up from adolescents who are learning their craft to young adults honing it, to mature adults achieving their legacy, to elders securing and nurturing it, but the art is so stylized that the humans look monstrously mishapen. . .  I'm not wondering what my hero's kids will look like because it will just be some flavor of ugly. Unfortunately, Massive Chalice's ideas had some great traits, but they were bread with some ideas with bad traits, the resulting offspring has suffered.			"

								While still in early acess I have enjoyed the hell out of this turned based strategy.   So much cool content.  I LOOOOVE the hybrid classes and family building.   The graphics could use a lot of refining but that is a very minor issue.  The game play is fun, addictive and getting better all the time.   The small amount of currrent voice work is decent.   I wish there was a lot more.   Can't wait to play the finished product.			"

												While this game had several good ideas it failed utterly in any attempt at garnering my interest or immersion.  Combat was bland, characters lacked any personality beyond stat fluctuations, gameplay was monotonous, and the game lacked depth overall.  If you were looking for something vaguely similar to XCOM in combat or Agarest War in regards to generational pursuits I would not advise this game.  The game feels empty to me despite the fun dialogue and good voice acting.			"

												Massive Chalice, much like literally every Doublefine game produced since they decided they didn't need publishers or editors, is a bit confused. On one hand, it embraces the purity of XCOM2012-style (or perhaps I should say ""traditional board game style"") actions and has the trademark Doublefine carefully crafted aesthetic running through every level of the audiovisual presentation. On the other hand, it muddles everything with occasionally pointless RNG and has perhaps three too many systems going on simultaneously in the geoscape.Did I mention it's an XCOM(2012) CLONE? It's an XCLONE.There's some interesting bits resulting from the nessesarily disposable nature of your soldiers as you carefully curate their family trees to produce increasingly powerful and skilled individuals in the classes you want. It's a great twist on otherwise normal ""level up your units"" game design. Sadly this is muddled by the irritiating intrusion of RNG-based inheritance and a bunch of other random crap that turns what should be a selling point into a HR hellscape. Thankfully, the game doesn't randomly choose from the two choices you're presented with for skills when units level up.Did I mention it's an XCLONE? It's an XCLONE.The geoscape-level strategic game is neat because it forces you make a bunch of decisions all at once. You can search for new heroic bloodlines, build castles, or research new developments in fighting the corruption that threatens the world. Somewhat irritatingly, the game forces you to choose between building and researching because the titular Massive Chalice can only do one thing at a time. For plot reasons.Every so many years while you scan for alien activity charge the titular Massive Chalice to win the game, there's multiple incursions from aliens bad anime Symphogear's monster antagonists, the Noise the Cadence and you have to pick which pre-defined region you want to defend (based on rewards and the strategic situation) because you can only respond to one. Because plot reasons. The zones you don't respond to have their panic corruption meter increment by one tick.Did I mention it's an XCLONE? It's an XCLONE.Tactical combat is pretty fluid, even though there's a complete dearth of voicework for your units (one of the perils of letting Kickstarter backers do custom war cries for their backer house). Each unit gets two ""actions"" on your turn, and they all move at once. One class snipes with crossbows. One class uses grenades. One class hits things with a caber. There's a bunch of hybrid classes but they're just ""Parent class, but with a twist from the other parent"". Movement is done on a square grid, and units die pretty quickly on both sides. Okay so you may have noticed a bit of, shall we say, a theme so far. That theme being ""XCOM2012, but with some wierd addons that muddle the everliving crap of XCOM2012's super tight design"". Literally the only three big ""design elements"" that Doublefine didn't T.S. Eliot off of XCOM2012 are the house system, the endgame, and the fact that there are enemies that drain XP from your units when they hit them.Let's pause for a moment, and let that last one sink in. I'll allow that it's a pretty tiny bit of XP that gets shaved off, but level drain has never, ever, been a good design element. Not even in D&D. It's thematically a cool thing that the enemy does, but it's really emblematic of my issues with Massive Chalice as a whole: The game is so focused on style, mood, and its bloodline stuff that it sorta misses out on why XCOM2012 did things the way it did and tends to awkwardly stumble around when it's not winking at you. And the fact that the game absolutely nails its aesthetics so perfectly makes its 'original design, do not steal' gameplay all the more annoying.But no-one buys or plays Doublefine games for the gameplay, really.

As soon they returned corruption instantly destroyed my region.Overall the game is kinda solid.---I went thoroughly  through the game on Normal Iron mode and I kinda switched my opinion. The game gave me a couple of extremely satisfying moments. So:PROS+ nice low-poly graphics+ every decision matters, brilliant strategy = satisfying results+ a couple of OP builds make your heart meltCONS- random events- lack of tutorials - the ones exist are not enough- lack of content - the game gets rather boring after 10 hours played- your stupid alchemists throwing explosive flasks at allies (LOL)7/10, buy at sales and enjoy at least one campaign run (I definetely recommend HARD)			"

												I absolutely adored this game. Though a bit shallow on the management side, the tacical engine humming under Massive Chalice is superb. It plays a bit like the remake of XCOM. Combat is straight-forward enough that I feel comfortable recommending it to just about anyone, but there's still a reasonable amount of tactical depth. Not Double Fine's funniest game, sure, but definitely their best-playing. Oh, and the soundtrack is really good, too.Plays nicely in short bursts, so if you're looking for a (relatively) light tactical game, give this one a play.			"

								I don't recommend this game in it's current state. There's a promising core strategy game, but I find a lot of the mechanics to be unfun, and the balance to be... meh.1.) The enemies on the tactical map don't seem to move? You can trigger a lot of them all at once for no good reason. I prefer the XCOM style in which enemies patrol, and you can play a slightly more conservative/defensive game.2.) Enemies can take away XP and de-level your heroes. No thanks, not fun.			"

								Man, I am loving this game. The strategic gameplay is simple but the eugenics system is complex so the game has a nice rhythm to it as you switch between fighting and managing your kingdom.  People get old and die at an alarming rate but that's how it is in real life too.  Also it makes me feel a little weird when I marry 67 year old dudes to 18 year old girls simply because that's most beneficial to my bloodlines-- which is a sign of connection to the characters I guess, though why that also makes for a fun gaming experience is a question I won't try to answer.

All of that said, I saw a streamer playing Massive Chalice and it looked like so much fun that it overcame my cynicism hard enough for me to buy a copy.  I've played over 30 hours of it so far and it's still fun.  Maybe they'll finish it, maybe they won't, but its development and changelogs have consistantly reflected more dedication and skill than Spacebase ever did.  It was already good back in January when I picked it up and has been getting better ever since.			"

								I just bought this game, and i'll say god..its difficult and fun. But it lacks just that tad bit more of content, such as customization, and maybe bigger maps, squads and that managing your kingdom feel. On its own however, its still wonderful. I'll list down the pros and cons and an overall opinion.Pros: Combat is wonderful, nearly like xcom though there's no cover mechanic but obstacles do block your line of sight.          Heroes can get married, and they can have offspring which mean more soldiers. (Dont think much of the FAMILY TREE, incest happens in this game as you 'll gradually lose heroes and lack the time to recruit more due to research),Which part of the kingdom you fight on will actually matter in terms of tactics you can use.Random events, which is always a +Mechanics, are just wonderful and cornering your opponent especially the big ones are important. RELICS though you might want a tier 2 weapon at the leastCons: You can only do one action at a time, so you cant construct, recruit  and research at the same time, can be a pro if you like the game to be more tough.Enemy AI can be dumb...... if there's a wall between you and them, they'll stick to the wall (in my instance it was a low wall and they just ran and stayed there, like fish in a barrel)You can't expand your squad and you also cant escape from battle just like in x-com = can be a +Opinion: It's a great game, i just wish for customization, kingdom management and maybe even some multiplayer. Try it you'll likely not regret buying and playing this gameOk finally finished.... its good not great but yeah, worth its price considering how much you can play and how many ways you can play.			"

								I don't think the game is perfect but it's getting a 7/10 for me.  I like the art style/graphics it's a unique slant on similar games I've seen that keeps it fresh, and the voice acting is good. The AI is not what I consider the most tactical but also it's not lazy or glitchy either.  I also haven't run into any bugs which is great and I do like how parents of different classes will have babies that are mixed, and the passing down of traits is great too!  I didn't like the ""you can't get attached to your characters because they're all going to die"" thing. I GET it, everyone dies at some point and the lifespan thing is cool, but a character's full lifespan is actually very short in game time, so that man that spent all his life as an archer died of old age....at level 2... So I made sure I wasn't attached to anyone, but I couldn't really be anyway, also...being attached to characters is what makes a game fun. Maybe have a reasearch option that takes a lot to invest in but you get to make some units immortal? I mean with genetic manipulation and traits you're going to get super powered people anyway.    Overall though I really am enjoying the game. I hope other games make use of the genetic passing of traits systems, especially rpgs, though it's really unique in a strategy game like this!			"

Early Access Review
								Review of the .96b betaShorter Review: A mixture of kingdom management, tactical battles, RPG, and hero breeding that  produces a satisfying game requiring thought and planning  Still being polished, but looking promising, and worth it if this is your area of interest.To review Massive Chalice, you need to start with the story.You're an Immortal regent, bound to a mysterious chalice holding the souls of past heroes.  That chalice is the only hope of your nation to cleanse it of the foul creatures that threaten it, the mysterious Cadence.  You'll rally heroes to fight, decide how to run the kingdom, and figure out how to survive.  Good thing you're immortal, because your heroes are not, and you'll need to plan how to use them, marry them, retire them, and pass on their legacies.  You've got a 300 year war ahead of you until the Chalice is powerful enough to end it, and everyone who started the battle with you will be dust when it's over . . .Massive Challice is a game that combines several play mechanics in a way that's easy to pick up - hard to master.  That's not an emplty statement - it's the truth, because the simple parts interact in many ways.* A straightforward, effective, but deep tactical battle game where heroes fight monsters.* An RPG system where you manage characters, equipment, and skills.* A straightforward, but detailed hero-breeding system where you establish lineages of heroes - who inherit traits, legacies, relics, and more.  * A (rather light) Kingdom management game that consists of making choices of battles, what to construct, and how to react to random events.In Massive Challice, you alternate battles with the Cadence and managing your kingdom and heroes over the course of 300 years.  One moment you're deciding who to attack, the next deciding what to build next, then responding to a random event, and finally trying to figure out if you should intermarry two heroic linages - then another battle may arise.  You're constantly scaling your strategy and tactics as you play, and how the different levels of the game mesh is a big part of the challenge and satisfaction - there's something about watching a new, well-trained hero of a class you unlocked due to an unusual marriage wield a weapon of his bloodline on the first go to cause massive damage.This means that this is a game of planning and management - even when you're whomping on the Cadence.  Because time is tight, resources are limited, and enemies are tough you are always constrained, always evaluating, always scheming - and often regretting.  Death is permanent, decisions aren't reversable (well unless you're using a save game and not playing in Iron Mode), and time and resources lost aren't easily reclaimed.  You will start over, you will reload saves - and if this is your kind of game, you will go back again and again.The combat, I think, deserves special note as it's well balanced.  There's 3 main classes and descendents via crossbreeding can unlock 6 more classes.  Stealth, special abilities, the right equipment, planning, and above all patience are requires for victory.  Pulling off massive kills and victories is quite satisfying and good planning is rewarded.  This is a precise, well done part of the game that was both deep yet completely accessible and intuitive.Regarding ""Hero breeding"" part of the game, it's straightforward on the surface - you get (or build) Keeps, appoint a regent and a partner, and they have kids (if they are capable of it).  Children inherit mental and physical traits and level up depending on parental experience - and other factors and structures.  The challenge is in avoiding bad traits, ensuring linages (""Relic"" weapons are tied to a bloodline), balancing ages and genders, and determing what classes you want the next generation to be - you can easily mess up or destroy a bloodline.  Its fun, but At times can be wearing as you juggle combinations, though when you get a truly satisfying and fun character it's worth it.If there's a flaw in this release it's that the kingdom management part of the game still feels a bit light and there's not a lot of guidance.  The kingdom management is decent, but I'd like to see a few more options for research and development, or to at least see some unlockable options earlier so you know what there is to work forward to.  Research opens up more as the game progresses, but is rather lackluster for the first third.I do think the game lacks good tips and guidances for the more subtle situations like good breeding and so on.  Perhaps thats part of the challenge, but it can take away from the fun.The game's presentation is effective.  It has an angular look that puts me in mind of board games and low-poly games.  Character appearances change as they age.  The music, well done and subtle, sets a strange, almost somber mood (and is a strong point in the presentation).  The narration of the two souls in the chalice is decident to amusing, adding some levity and making you feel not so lonely (hey, you're immortal).I also feel the game should be praised for avoiding bog-standard fantasy classes.  There's no generic warriors, there's ram-wielding Caberjacks.  There's no thieves, there's stealty Hunters armed with enormous cannon-like crossbows.  No wizards either, but Alchemists who fling flasks of explosives with sharp-edged cestas called ""Throwers.""  As you breed heroes you unlock even more classes: Brewtalists, Trickshots, and more.It's rather refreshing, and the subclasses get interesting as well - I think my personal favorite is the Caberjack/Hunter fusion called a Shadowjack who can go into stealth mode DESPITE wielding an enormous two handed battering ram as a weapon.Yes, this game has characters who can spring out of the shadows and wack you with a giant log.And finally, let us close with the story.  Though the plot itself is compelling, I also enjoy how things happen to create your own narrative.  Random events change things.  Heroes grow, fight, sire offspring, die - or retire to teach or manage buildings (and then die).  You find yourself getting attached to bloodlines and some specific characters.  I still have fond memories of Freya ""What's-Her-Face"" Yurgin wielding the magical bow ""Fang"", or ""The Beard"" Nguyen the Brutal Brewtalist who retired to teach the next generations.I hope this game spawns others.  The idea of a kind of semi-procedural dynasty builder is compelling.I reccomend this game with a few limits - after all we're talking $30 bucks here.  If it was $20 it'd be no problem.* If this game sounds like it's up your alley, then it's worth it.  Certainly I have no regrets, feel I got my money's worth, and consider it replayable.* If the game sounds cool but you're not sure, wait for the full release to see what people say.  Its got a bit more tweaking and isn't exactly friendly to learn, so it's not something for everyone.I'm quite positive on this game.  I hope this launches a series, as the fusion of mechanics and long-term planning make this a fun, interesting, and satisfying game.			"

												I haven't played many strategy games (Warcraft, XCOM, JSRPGs) but I find this game to be more acessable and enjoyable than all of those, especially since you do more than just kill stuff. I've only played for a few hours but I feel the learning curve, I'm still behind it, but after I lose a few more troops I think I'll know better for my next play through.Also, super fun to choose houses based off your friends and to see which houses make better characters.

I can not recommend the game at this stage. The idea is not bad but need a lot of balancing.For example, even without losing heroes in battle, you can be in a situation where there is nobody to put on the protection of land.Heroes die much more quickly than are born.In general, I think you need to wait until the game will be brought to a playable state.

												Really irritating combat kills this game for me. It seems like every enemy explodes into acid when you kill it, constantly killing even your strongest guys with no way to protect yourself. It's less strategy and more attrition.			"

								This game is fun but gets repetitive after about ten hours.Due to lack of tactical and strategic depth. Eventhough it has some interesting game mechanicsIt's lack of overwatch ,cover, interesting strategic map , too few enemies ,to name a few make it feel more like an ios game.But since the bar for pc games has been lowered so much . This game is actually better than most.Fun for a day or two but then yawn.			"

								Right, this one gets a cautious recommendation, mostly because of the combat. Also, points for being one of a few Early Access games that's actually complete, but just needs more content (you know, the way it's supposed to be).Story: the story is, you are a god-like entity brought into being by the Massive Chalice to save the lands from the encroaching Cadence, which you will do over the stretch of three hundred years. I liked the dual voices of the Massive Chalice, and there's nothing to really complain about on that front.Gameplay: You control different houses, and attempt to keep the bloodlines going throughout the three hundred years required for the chalice to activate while fighting off occasional incursions and doing research to improve the lands/heroes. It's a very good system, and the moment the game gave me a character in the Armstrong lineage named ""Alex-Louis"", the idea of passing down his Alchemist technique through the Armstrong line for generations never stopped being funny.The rub (and indeed, the caution part of this tale) is in the combat. This game most clearly takes influence from XCOM: Enemy Unknown and (to a lesser extent) Fire Emblem: Awakening. Problem is, it lacks the balance of the former, the insane depth of the latter and the expediency of both. One of the things I liked about those games (I'm using them for comparison because it's exactly the same turn-based combat XCOM was) is that you could move through a turn quickly. You could immediately end your turn in both games if people still had moves left but you were satisfied with your position. You could tailor FE:A to move through combat and turns quick, and you could switch to other people in XCOM while a squadmate was still executing his/her turn. It kept the game from being too slow, and I feel like this combat lacks it.It's also not helped by the characters taking strangely wonky path that would sometimes do a near 360 to get to a box when they could just step four paces in a straight line. Also, I despise how the camera would linger on an enemy after you miss, as if to congratulate you on an unlucky dice roll and slow the pace down further.On top of that, the balance was fine right up until I hit the Bulwarks, which I felt were introduced long before I had the capability to deal with them. It kept going on like that from there. Also, like XCOM, the game has a fog of war which the enemies aren't supposed to hit you from until you find each other. Problem is, some of the enemies don't obey that rule, and I'd keep getting hit by ranged units that'd come flying out of the fog of war with (metaphorical) guns blazing even though I hadn't discovered them yet.Also, do you remember how you'd kinda chuckle in XCOM when it'd say you had a 95% chance to hit and you'd still miss like...1 out of every 8-10 shots? Enjoy the most deceptive percentage system in history, where 90% means you're gonna miss 2-3 out of every 5 shots. At one point, out of curiosity, I actually reloaded a save to see how many times I hit an enemy I had an 80% shot of hitting. I got 12 out of 20 before I stopped. Maybe I got unlucky, but that actually feels like a very accurate representation of the accuracy in this game. I understand it's gamblers fallacy to assume 80% means I'll hit four out of five times, but there's a massive difference between that and a near constant 50%. Which leads to the chief complaint about the combat system: its ambiguity. I have to guesstimate how far the enemies are going to move, the percentage system lies to me, caberjacks never seem to be close enough to help anything, and there are the glancing blows that are the RNG's way of saying ""you're not appreciating this combat system enough, allow me to screw you over because the unreliable hit percentage wasn't enough."" The entire point of strategy and tactics is that a game should do more or less what you tell it, with a little room for surprises. If something goes wrong, it should be because I took a chance and it didn't pay off, and hopefully I'll have enough options to compensate for that. It shouldn't be because the system is so unreliable that I have no idea whether my tactics will work or not. It desperately needs refinement, is what I'm saying.Still, the generations system is awesome, and makes the game worth playing, and for all its frustrations, the combat system has its moments.			"

								This is already a pretty complete game, and worth the purchase. The combat is X-Com style, but a good portion of your troops will be melee, so cover is less of a deal. It's mostly about staying outside of the attack range of enemies, and ganging up on them one at a time. (By the end of the game you can sometimes eliminate one enemy per soldier per game though).  The soldier classes are pretty fun, especially the caberjack, which can push and stun enemies. If enemies are stacked in a line, he can even stun more than one. He synergizes well with the alchemist, who can drop some bombs on the enemies he's shoved together. The hunter is a little less impressive, but it's excellent to have one on the team due to the stealth abilities they get from the start. I understand DF is also working adding some hybrid classes.The strategic game has a pretty steep learning curve. Your soldiers will maybe get 4 combats in over the course of their lifetimes, and so you need to build a dynasty. It's a mix of ensuring fertility (many offspring), experience (new soldier experience depends on regent at keep and standards at crucibles), and positive traits (a bit of eugenics between experienced regents and desirable mates). My first couple runs, I couldn't fill out my combat roster on the 5th or so combat.Gripes: later on there are advanced versions of the enemies, which basically just have 2x hp and 2x damage. They don't even color swap them. Learning curve is a bit too steep at the start. "

								I stayed up until 6am on a worknight for the first time in the last decade playing this game. There are a few small issues with balance and some features that feel like they are in early implementation, but overall they have nailed the most important part of making a game - it's fun.The game is fairly streamlined like the XCom remake, and borrows a lot from that design. I am curious to see what features and improvements are coming, and hope they can make the game feel richer and fuller without bogging it down and complicating it.			"

I liked the idea that marrying different professions will give you a hybrid result. And the balance needed in order to produce descendants while having good enough heroes to beat the enemy.The writing/VO is also pretty funny.Recommended!			"

I had a hero with about 40 health get hit 5 times in a row by the same hatcher (I used all my health potions healing him and I ended losing the battle due to this) If not the rate of firing lowered and the amount of spawning heightened then you should definitley lower the damage done as 13 pure damage early game is crazy as well as late game with fully researched advanced armor			"

								A cool game with the possibility to become a fantastic game.-The graphics and the artwork are a bit special, and either you like it or you hate it. My personal opinion is that it fits perfectly in the ""not so serious"" mood of the game.- I still miss the different difficulties though, but I saw they are in work. Their absence is the reason I haven't played this game for long, because just for testing it, it becomes rather complicated and difficult in the early gameplay. (My first soldier died on the first mission :,( )- So I cant really judge the whole storypart of the game, BUT... The beginning is promising, being the king of a kingdom, who has to defend it against some evil creatures, who interacts personnaly with his followers, in making joices or just being there liegelord. Especially the choices the player has to take are an interresting feature, but seems sometimes like a parrody of the rome total war politics.-Is it just me, or is the hunter a bit weaker then the other roles? The hit-chance is quiet low, and when they hit, the damage is quiet low too.			"

								What to expect from this game at the moment? Sleepless night, maybe multiple depending.Research and other options could be more deeper and more varied, there things like putting your most experienced guy to train others that you just have to do and ensure a steady flow of new people through your keeps but after you have these running there are not too many surprises around to be seen and the game begins to feel stale.Combat is your new standard XCOM style without action points, although it's much more varied with traits, personalities adding to the experience and also levels affecting the damage output with weapon relics that gather their own experience adds a very welcome and nice twist to the whole combat.AI of the enemy is rather straight forward, it's out there to kill you and doesn't get scared or have personalities.This is EARLY ACCESS review so things might change to be more involving, but core design of the game will not change so you can assume this is a feature complete game at the moment.

								This game makes being epic so easy. In my very first play through I started with an archer who had a last name of sterling. after the tutorial level I made him the lord of my first keep which began the epic tale of the sterling family. That family would prove to be my strongest and most important move I ever made. they produced so many good fighting men and women that I started to think it was normal to have fighting groups that where only one family. I figured it was some preset thing it became such a big part of my game but then I did a second playthrough and found that the sterlings didnt even show up and now I had a new epic family to lead through the ages. it has been a great ride and I hope to play the game many, many more times in the future.

								WAIT FOR THE FINISHED GAME!!!Now that I have that out of the way you may notice how I still recommend it. And that's because I want to emphasize that the game is still fun, just VERY VERY frustrating.The game is very fun and could be very addictive... once they fix the issue of difficulty and others. Think of the game like Xcom if it met with Game of Thrones, with the idea of making families out of heroes that will produce offsprings. On paper this is fantastic and for the most part the execution is more than decent enough when you consider the budget. The mechanics of choosing X or Y is not as punshing as XCom where the latter makes you feel like you just ruined the lives of millions  if you choose one continent over the other. Some complaints I have right now that will make me stop playing the game for now in hopes they'll be addressed:1. Right now how far you get in the game is EXTREMELY dependent on how lucky you are with your initial role of heroes, ages, and classes. For example I just rolled a game where I had like 4 melees and 1 archer. I then made the highest ranked melee into the regent and gave her a partner to produce babies. By the time I built my second keep to get a new regent, I only had one Archer at a decent level, and once I put that one as a regent to give me high level archers I was basically F'ed because I had no other archers for battles, so now I need to fight battles with nothing but melee and alchemists. Which is extremely hard once you hit level 40. So the issue at hand is that the regent/lineage system needs rework. Having to wait 15 years minimum for your next generation of a specific class is horrible. You don't get enough heroes. 2. Heroes don't level up unless you bring them with you to battles and use them to kill enemies. It's fine by itself if you were given higher level heroes, but you tend to be given low level heroes.3. Bulwarks or w/e they're called are broken. So is whatever system that decides how many enemies you gotta fight at a time. I'm in year 40 and I got a map with bulkwarks in groups of 2 and I had to fight like 10 with nothing but melees and one archer. This was a pain, but then like three more appeared. If you're gonna have these guys gain a shield after an attack at least don't make it where damage goes down to 1. Or lower their base damage, because 5-7 per hit is ridiculous.			"

								Just a short review of the game as it's in Early Access December 2014. I've tried two playthroughs by now.  The first went haywire so I restarted, the second I made it to Year 300 (end game). I think there's a bit of a learning curve still :) Anyway, I really, really like the game. It reminds me of a hybrid between XCOM (new one) and The Last Federation. The XCOM part is somewhat simpler in regard to the combat, yet it has its own flavor and you have some pretty clever things you can pull off with the different classes, equipment and skills. As to the Kingdom/Base Management it's two widely different beasts. Where XCOM had a lot of smaller research paths and many types of equipment there are fewer in Massice Chalice, so every choice counts - and smacks - like a b*tch.If I had to pick one great feature of the Kingdom Management it's the breeding for various traits in the regents' children. It makes a heck of a difference. If you marry two regents with bad traits your resulting heroes will be so pathethic it's painful.Right now it's not just playable but also enjoyable. I don't know for sure if there's just a lot more learning to do for me or if there are genuine imbalances in the game. I miss the feeling of late game XCON where you're very powerful and just kill scores of enemies. Actually, the second game I'm not sure I'll actually be able to complete, and I got this nagging feeling that maybe, just maybe, I shouldn't have paired that decent regent with that too young, unknown spouse. Perhaps with the right bloodline with the right traits and personality ...			"

												A cool concept but for ♥♥♥♥'s sake...- 85 % chance of 15 dommage and does 2 or miss ? people you need to revisit the concept.- The bloodline concept is great, except that you dont have the time to level up any of those people they usually die at level 2 and no potential is coming up from them.- The new ennemies are barrely introduced... and does random damage to your characters from 1 point to an archer to 20 to an other...archer... something is clearly broken here. I could recommand it to some people, but clearly not when you compare it to XCOM a game taht have similar gameplay and mechanics.			"

								In case you were in a hurry, my review in a nutshell: A game with a simple premise but extremely well executed.I have only played for 3 hours but I plan on playing for many more. This game is really awesome, between all the different heroes you can possibly have plus the combination of traits. It is such a good mesh of ideas that I will probably play for 300 hours with multiple different playthroughs.  Despite being early access the game runs wonderfully well. So far half way through the main campaign with no bugs at all.Can't wait to play more. Thank you doublefine for stealing away all my future free time. As I try and breed then train the perfect heroes.Edit:Now made it past the half way mark, have extended legacies going back 200 years.  So far the game scales really well just as you are getting to where you can crush the enemies easily they all become advanced and you are struggling and using tactics again in the hope your heroes wont die.I think the worst for me is losing a hero to old age without having them pass their experience down to my new heroes.I have had a few breaks from this game now and I just keep enjoying it.All in all there is not much more I would want in this game.

								Once you get a grasp on what's important to do early-game, Massive Chalice is a very enjoyable XCOM-like game. Even in it's early access state, the game is fun.Just be warned: It's brutally difficult. It took me about 4 new games before I realized the most important thing you can do to start the game is just to build about 2 to 3 keeps to breed more heroes for down the road. Resupplying your fighting lines, and having enough dudes to man your eventual research and training places once your people get old and die off is incredibly important, the single most important thing to your victory.

								Works very well if you're willing to use your imagination in a lot of aspects, and I don't mean that in a bad way. This is a game that wants you to take a second and come up with your own storyline, and if you care about the heroes in your kingdom you'll have a lot more fun than speed running, min-maxing, and generally just treating it like an old SNES game that needs to be beaten than an interactive and deep story/narrative driven epic like it is.Edit: After playing some more, I wanted to make some remarks about the other reviews here. A lot of people complain that the game doesn't really have much in the ways of a tutorial. This creates a really good environment though. In the game, you're new to everything. You're learning what is going just like everyone else, so not knowing the exact stats of a Bulwark but instead getting a narrative description of what it does is actually really satisfying and flavorful.Another point, I've come to really enjoy the breeding. Some people say it isn't predictable, but I can clearly tell which bloodlines are carrying what traits. Yes, some of them will show up more randomly, especially if you have regents with personalities that cause personalities to not be followed, like rebel, but that's honestly how life works. If you have 5 kids, they'll have core beliefs and fringe beliefs and both will make up who they are. For me, a very solid 8/10. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews or why so many people are agreeing with them. I feel like it has to do with how quickly people want to burn through a game on Steam, but this is really a good Double Fine production and it shows with good narrative storytelling and character development.

												This game has got flaws, this game is often frustrating, sometimes it is really sadistic, to a point you are close to 'rage-uninstall', in general this game is quite repetitive and has got no story. Why I recommend this game? Because I have spend already 40 hours and I cannot drop. It  has some addictive quality, nice music and ambience (due to to narrators' skill I believe). The comparison to Xcom is ridiculous. It is a small game, it cannot compete with an AAA monster. But it succeeds to bring a couple of funny ideas to the genre. It is not bad.			"

								I just finished my first run-through of the game, and I can honsetly say I enjoyed it immensely. A lot of people are jittery about DF having another early access game, but the situation has been made perfectly clear: MASSIVE CHALICE is COMPLETELY FUNDED for the next six months, which is the perfect amount of time to tweak this game to perfection. You may notice a few rough edges and for some people an intimidating learning curve, but the mechanics of this game are solid and have a surprising amount of depth. Like many tactical games, you might build yourself into a corner or find yourself on the wrong end of RNG, but when this game is humming, it's an amazing experience. I can't wait for DF to put the finishing touches on this game and I hope you guys enjoy!Other Misc Facts:-3 base classes currently, hybrid classes planned for future update (which ups the number of options significantly)-Get your highest level characters to be regents: XP is passed on to children of the house. The higher the XP, the higher level your trainee heroes become.-Relics spawn occaisionally when a hero dies. Usually happens when a hero kills a lot of cadence throughout their life. Get these early and keep them in the hands of the fighting members of the family. They level up and turn wimpy heroes into super men/women.-Be smart about movement and sight. Scout ahead with Hunters (using their sneaking ability). Sometimes your sight range is greater than theirs and often it is greater than their movement/attack range. Find the enemy first and utilize crowd control abilities to slow down the enemy (Flarrow blinds enemies for a turn, Knockback can shove enemies into other enemies and can stun each one affected, Prime Target can draw strong opponents away from weak or stranded heroes)Have Fun guys!

Early Access Review
								X-Com meets Rogue Legacy. It's X-Com style combat with the generational traits that Rogue Legacy has. There's a pretty strong emphasis on breeding your bloodlines well to concentrate good traits and training ability as early heroes tend to be pretty mediocre (if not flat out bad). Surprisingly fun. The main thing is that it's hard to grow attached to individual characters as they get rotated out pretty quickly; however the bloodlines seem to often breed a couple of traits 'true' for many generations, giving them a bit of a personality of their own.Combat is fairly simple, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing; I found that I didn't really want to spend hours on a tactical map at a time, since so much of the activity happens strategically. The tactical combat is just enough to be interesting without being too time-consuming, maintaining a quicker pace than e.g. Medieval.			"

								Hero breeding is cool. Everything else feels sorta bad. The game sorta splits the difference between XCOM and Fire Emble-style melee strategy (pretty much XCOM, though). It turns out that most of what drives XCOM's loop is the cover-to-cover movement.My experience with MC so far has been to move a guy somewhere, then move other guys closer to him.The names are cool but the catch phrases are dumb and I wish that DoubleFine hadn't Bypassed Oppressive Publishers at the cost of having heroes say cool stuff when they win.The UI feels weird to me, but you can figure it out in a couple of minutes (hint: the weirdly stacked flags? those are hero family crests that represent their turn order.)The story is super unfunny to me but who cares strategy game etc			"

								The Cadence attacked in the window between almost all of my heros dying of old age and their children coming of age to be battle ready, leaving me with 2 hunters and a caberjack (all level 3) to defend a territory in immediate danger of being overrun by corruption. Fortunately, I'd just researched the stealth cloak that let the hunters hide anywhere, not just behind cover. Unfortunately this battle included a new enemy type that had triple the hp of any of my heroes. With careful planning, a little patience, and those wonderful stealth cloaks, my heroes took out 20 cadence between them, and all three survived (and leveled twice each).			"

								Note: This is my first game from this developer. I've become aware of a small scandal brewing about this developer's past games, but this review is written with ONLY THIS PARTICULAR GAME in mind. I have no idea what happened with the developer's previous games, and thus that is not the concern of this review.In the time I've spent with this, I've really enjoyed it. It has all the features it claims to in about the way you'd expect them, so if the description looks interesting, you'll probably enjoy it. The game has a fairly simple core mechanic: survive until x year. However, the facets that go into maximizing your chances for survival are many and are quite novel. I really enjoy pairing my strongest fighters and securing even stronger future generations.The music in the game is lovely, and the voice acting is far better than I had anticipated (actually I hadn't anticipated ANY, but the voice acting is really very good). The visual style is a little... art over realism, as it were. But it serves the game well enough that I, as a huge fan of realistic graphics, found myself not caring at all that I wasn't looking at lush forests and TressFX hair. The controls might seem slightly limited at first, but I quickly found they did their job effectively.All in all, this game is great fun and I encourage you to grab it if you're on the fence about it.

												I purchased Massive Chalice after browsing the ""Legendary Weapon"" trope for a bit on TVTropes. I had not previously heard of the game and was very interested the instant I heard about bloodlines and tactical gameplay. Generational progression of a 300 year war and all that sounded AMAZING, family houses and children and bloodline relics and so on.Then I saw it was by Double Fine, ""Wow, those guys are really creative, I generally really like their work!"" I thought to myself. The game was funded by Kickstarter too? ""Well that's fine, nothing wrong with that, I'm just happy it made it.""I purchased the game for the $20 price tag on steam, and loaded it up. I started my new game and... was immediately filled with regret, and it was for one simple reason.No customization.Why, I thought? Was it perhaps just something I had to unlock in game? I decided to google and find out. And the first 3 responses to my search made my interest in the game sink from heavily interested to almost absolutely nothing.""There was a kickstarter tier that allowed you to create your own house and that's the reason you can't make your own."" Is basically what it boils down to... and from what I have read, there was at one point an interest in including a Create-a-House function in the game post-release, which is fine IMO, but then I read in a more recent post that the idea was scrapped because it wouldn't be fair to backers.Now I have shut the game down and lack enough interest to even bother trying the tutorial. I'm glad I didn't have to wait 2 hours to find this out either, so now I can get my money back. This may seem harsh and all, but I wanted to post this up somewhere and hopefully let someone in the know might be able to bring it up to whom it may concern:' ""You lost a sale because I am not allowed to have my own family.""I'll even be fair and say: If I could even just make one single custom family for myself to represent my own line, I don't mind if my other 4 families are pre-designed by the backers. But the fact I just plain cannot have my own input in the lore of the game or have some semblance of interaction beyond just being ""the player"" ... To be blunt: If you don't care about me, why should I care about you?			"

Early Access Review
								That's a very original and entertaining game, like if X-COM met Game of Thrones for a crossover.People tend to focus on combat, but what's really great about Massive Chalice is the strategy of breeding heroes and trying to have a minimally acceptable team to defend your lands when the Cadence attacks. It can be challenging as you have to plan ahead to have a balance of classes and also take care of the special buildings that give bonus to hero development and research of new 'technologies'.What should you do? Have your best hero available to do battle or marry him with a fertile hero of another family so his offspring have a better chance of being as good (or better!) than himself? Should you appoint your most experienced hero as the standard to be followed by young heroes and risk having only inexperienced youngsters to fight the next invasion? Will they be able to survive without more powerful items and armor? Who will research it?Combat itself is not that original or satisfying at this point, mostly because of balance issues. There are some enemies, especially later in the game, able to single handedly criple or even destroy an average party. Also, there are only 3 classes available. This greatly limits the number of tactics you can use to overcome the battles, and can lead to some repetition during the 300 year timespan of the game.Of course, this is an unfinished product, so we can hope for the combat to get a little better and the planning phase to get more polishment and shine even more.That said, if you like original and challenging games, Massive Chalice's world is surely a good palce for you to play only one more turn.

								¯\_(ツ)_/¯It's an inferior reskin of rage aneurysm in game form X-Com: Enemy Unknown/Within that someone accidentally dumped the Crusader Kings bloodline number crunching into. It's so much like X-Com that it even has the same UI and controls, the same panic level and pick between two battles features, the crap RNG and touchy map movement. All that said, X-Com is an awesome, addicting game, so, I mean, eh, this can't possibly be that bad. I'd wait until it goes live but if you like X-Com and want more of that, this gives you X-Com with a low-fi fantasy skin.At the moment, the classes and mobs do not feel well balanced, with at least one seemingly useless class and a number of monsters that are just no fun to fight, but this will hopefully change before a full release. The gameplay stretches on for years in game but feels more breakneck than X-Com which is supposed to take place over a few months. I didn't find it very enjoyable: I was simultaneously bored by the lack of battles and overwhelmed trying to get a handle on mechanics, stats, traits and personalities before my soldiers died. Also had a lot of trouble actually keeping my ranks up; at one point I had 6 Hunters and that was it.Also, this is just petty, but I really liked the idea of their art direction but it didn't seem well executed in game; it felt unfinished. When I started my first forest map battle, my first thought was, ""Wow, they slapped some really low res textures onto the tree meshes from X-Com didn't they?""			"

								As of writing, I haven't played a ton (stupid work). But, I love the game so far. If you are a fan of games like Advance Wars, Fire Emblem, etc, you will love the combat system. Essentially you get your starting crew, then fight on a board. From there, you can breed your heroes together to make better heroes. It is kind of like Pokemon in that sense...Anywho, watch some videos and see if you like the gameplay. From my perspective, it is a great real time strategy / RPG all at once.			"

												Nice, clean tactical combat missions, about the same complexity as the the original XCOM from the last millenium. Heroes need to be cross-breeded and given experience and items to unlock different functions / classes.Also, an eugenics simulator, where you try to breed out bad qualities and get your hero bloodlines to become good over the three hundred years. From asthmatic puny drunkards (or something bad like that) which you are cursed at the start to quick, smart, strong and effective.			"

												Amazing game. Does amazing things within the tactical RPG genre, and is just soooooo fun to play.But..it requires patience with your intuitions and personal playstyle, which could simply just not work in a long-term strategy game like this. Be willing to start over if you have to. And for God's sake be CAREFUL with those random events. I would recommend that if ANY (and I mean ANY) random event occurs, you IMMEDIATELY check the Wiki for what could occur given the choice you make within the event.Why? Because while I really and truly love EVERYTHING this game does as a tactical RPG (and yes I've played the XCOMs, I still prefer this game), the events are not just like ""aw, that sucks, but whatevs.""Instead, they're like ""Wait...what??....but I'm almost there! NO. SCREW THIS. IM STARTING OVER/NEVER PLAYING AGAIN."" Events can be brutal and screw up your long term plans, which you worked suuuuper hard for. And that just feels poopy.But seriously, other than that (and the annoyance that just comes from random chance) this game is amazing and you should give it a fair shake, especially if its on sale.

Early Access Review
								If you took you standard turn-based strategy game like X-Com, added a little bit of the Sims and Pokemon breeding, and sprinkle on the sass and humor of Double Fine all over it, you get something close, yet at the same time nothing near what Massive Chalice is. A definite evolutionary experiment for the genre that can end up being revolutionary or a downright disaster. You might wanna take some notes, eugenics is involved.Gameplay: 92/100 A-Massive Chalice plays like any other turn based strategy game at first, moving your units into positions which offer a greater tactical advantage, setting up a trap, or pulling off a successful raid. While the combat mechanics are all familiar, moving, using skills, on and on, that is about as similar Massive Chalice is to other games of the like, specifically X-Com: Enemy Unknown, since it's one of the more recent successes of the genre. The rest of the gameplay isn't even on the battlefield, but in your kingdoms, putting units together in partnerships from the multitudes of clans, breeding them to produce offspring who will pass down traits to help improve your army as time goes by, some will die of old age, others in battle, some at random, some not so random - the list just goes on and on and you have to decide which way you want things to go, all the while fending off this nebulous invading force. Essentially, Massive Chalice takes away the random chance with the units and puts it in the players trusting hands, making everyone your responsibility. Good luck!Audio: 90/100 A-Being an Early Access game, things are bound to change, and the music isn't exempt from this. That said, the music that is currently in the game is well made and fits the atmosphere of the game and environments. This goes for the sound effects as well, since some sound like placeholders for better samples, others feel well polished and ready to go into your ears. The voice acting is done fairly well, too. The two main voices coming from the Massive Chalice itself, features a male being and a female being, both two different personalities that bicker and support you all at once or at each other. At times they are hilarious, while other times they can be a bit of a downer as you're trying to turn the tide of the war and one pipes up and says ""Their numbers are endless and instantly replaced, we must grow into maturity..."" or something like that.Visuals: 95/100 AThis is something that has caused some discussion within the community, both positive and negative, while Double Fine has never been known for its realism, especially visually, some complaints have been that the visuals are too simplified, but this is my review, not theirs, and I respectfully disagree. Now, I will agree that the graphics are simple, harkening back to the early PC days of Another World or Alone in the Dark, and more recently Minecraft, I don't think that they are too simple for the genre, you have to remember that graphics are part wow-factor and part world building, and if one fails in its mission, then the graphics mean nothing in the end. With that in mind, the style of the characters, the landscapes, the flow of water, the weapons used, they all fit into this world. It's not perfect, again - early access game still, but it has a firm style of what it wants to look like and sway this way or that.  Content: 97/100 A+I touched on some of the things you need to juggle in Massive Chalice outside of combat alone. I found myself spending a fair amount of time deciding which members of my team should be taken out so that they can go and get freaky with one another to make me more soldiers. And then you have to build castles and other structures if you want to advance certain technologies or unlock other classes of fighters, fixing disputes with your citizens, and then deciding which battle to engage in when that time comes. Oh - and did I mention the whole game is essentially on a giant time limit? Yeah, the clock, another thing to fight. You will be spending a lot of time tweaking and tinkering with everything in this game and you won't have much choice because as time goes by, your current fighters get older and will die. Lots of people will die. You won't have that one badass from day one who kills everything, but you may be able to pass down trinkets and whatnots that hold special abilities and stats that can be passed down from generation unto generation. Story: 86/100 B+There is a story, believe it or not, but as I played, it felt like it took a backseat to the gameplay. It's still there, but it wasn't interweaved into the gameplay as other games, it gets mentioned here and there, but the fights seems a bit disconnected to the rest of the situations happening. But maybe this is something that'll get hammered out at a later time as the core gameplay is worked out and balanced, which isn't a bad strategy at all. What story there is, is constructed decently, so it's hard to make a judgement on something that isn't finalized.Design: 88/100 B+From a purely mechanical standpoint, Massive Chalice is a massive undertaking that works for the most part. The ideas are there, they're original for the genre, and they add many layers of replayability to the game outside of a dice roll. The battlefields are laid out in creative ways, offering plenty of opportunity to form a strategy. The variety is also a welcome sight, from the characters, to the enemies, and the landscape itself, which you can use to your advantage as well, not just by hiding behind, but offensively.Performance: 86/100 B+I had to play this at a lower to mid-range settings on my current computer where the game ran the smoothest and looked the best. While there are a fair amount of options to tinker with, the game seems to run at a slightly slower pace, especially in battle, but I have to reiterate this - Early Access. There's still a bunch of work to be done at almost every angle, optimizing code and programming and who knows what else. There is some clipping here and there, but nothing as notorious as the ""I can't shoot through walls, but lemme take a shot through a building"" glitch from X-Com: Enemy Unknown. Failed psychic school my♥♥♥♥♥Verdict: 90/100 A-Massive Chalice is a massive risk, but with all that risk comes potential. It's nice to see a company actually attempt something with this much ambition and still try to make it the best they can. There are issues, of course, but these are more growing pains than pure stupidity. Do I recommend? Yes.			"

								The first few times I played it I think I was expecting it to be easier.  I play turn based tactic games quite often.  I was pretty averse to losing heroes, and quit out after a few bad mission playthroughs more than once.  I went back at the game after the last update with a different mindset about heroes passing and it was actually a lot of fun, the longer the passage of time gets, the more my surviving heroic bloodlines prosper, bestowing their knowledge on to their kindred and making for stronger characters overall.  Truly something that takes some getting used to.  Can't wait for the full release, but loving the game as is so far.			"

												I've enjoyed this game.  It is an interesting combination of a long term strategy game with a turn based combat element.  I bought it thinking that it would be a game I could play for 20-30 minutes but the more I've played it, the more I find I just want to ""see what happens next"".  Establishing bloodlines for your heroes was a neat new idea in a game.  I think it has replay value as there are several different levels of play.Then only bad thing I can say about it is that the name of the game itself is pretty dumb.  ""Mom, what game are you playing"".  ""Massive Chalice""  ""What?"".  Also, drunken hunters do not have good aim.			"

Time for playthrough: Took 13.7 hrs to finish game on normal (incl tutorial) without any saving/reloading. I assume if you play with mouse instead of gamepad it's down to 12 hours.Game-play: You are mostly managing your heroes as resources and try to breed (!) better heroes - the bloodline system works and is fun, though it's not worth going into the details too much, as few heroes will have more than 2 fights in them before they die of old age and get replaced by younger ones. It's well designed though.Once you got dozens of buildings up the game begins to get slow and sluggish as constantly someone dies of old age and you need to select replacements.Battle: It's basically X-COM and I wasn't impressed.Still recommend it as it was fun. Just make sure you grab it with a huge discount.			"

												I loved this game, and consider it a hidden gem. It plays like X-COM, with a mating/genetics system like Fire Emblem (in perpetuiity), and a unique and charming aesthetic/world. You have a squad of soldiers who revolve throughut the game as they are born, mature, and die, each with distinguishable characteristics. This gives them flair and make it even more heartbreaking when they die because you missed the shot THAT IT SAID HAD A 90% CHANCE OF LANDING, HOW COULD IT HAVE MISSED?!On the downside, the campaign is small and feels repetitive. There's not a lot of customizable bells and whistles so you've pretty much seen it all after you get 20% in. While this is a drag, keep in mind that it is a medium-sized game. It acomplishes what it sets out to do, and while it lacks a full-feature-game feel, it also lacks the cost. Keeping in mind the price tag, I would label it a must-play.			"

												If you have ever played XCOM: Enemy Unknown, or XCOM 2, and you enjoy fantasy settings with a grand sense of adventure, you will like Smaller Cup- I mean MASSIVE CHALICE. I have less than an hour into the game, but I can tell you it flows almost identically to modern XCOM. The game appears to have less pressure on the player than XCOM from the get go, but I could see how that could easily change. Much like the way that countries all start support the XCOM project, you can readily have regions in MC be over taken by you enemy. I can't tell you what happens when that occurs, but the game starts out with a given time limit that you have to ensure your survival for, or else the game will end. The tacical, turn based combat does not use cover or facing unfortunately. Vangaurds start as low leveled fighters and, unlike XCOM, can be turned into research personelle, or kings and queens that run your other supported regions. Thus making a new, and interesting strain on your troops available for combat. You will probably loose if you throw all your Vanguards into R&D, royality, or just into fighting. Like XCOM, MC forces you to make choices about who to train, what to research when, and prioritise your limited resources. Unlike XCOM it has a wonderful air of not taking it's self too seriously. The little bits of humor thrown in are perfect and over all make you feel not as bad about making poor choices in the game. This is further supported by a semi-cartoonish art style which show cases vibrant colors and original character designs beautifully. MASSIVE CHALICE is a pretty damn good game that I'd recommend to anyone looking for something as fun as XCOM, or other turn based strategy games, and likes a bit of humor.			"

												Massive Chalice or Eugenics War (what it feels like to me at least) is a turn-based strategy game. It also has a kingdom management aspect to it but for the most part it is a turn-based tactical combat game.Eugenics War (Massive Chalice) is built around a hero breeding system. Every single marriage is your decision. Your choices can create a bloodline full of hearty and quick heroes or asthmatic and slow ones. With every choice having positive and negative consequences you’ll have to weigh every decision.Combat is grid and turn based. If you’ve played Final Fantasy Tactics or XCOM you know what to expect. Though don’t expect the same amount of variety of units as Final Fantasy Tactics or the complexity of XCOM. This is a lighter squad based game.Is this game for everyone? Of course not, the game gets a little repetitive and a lot of the unique ideas in this title are not fully realized. It is however a very interesting game that does something different from most turn based (and squad based) strategy games.As with most games on Steam if you don’t feel like taking a risk on this at full price just wait for a sale; I purchased my copy in a bundle and only ended up paying $1.25. At that price I feel I definitely got my money’s worth, had I paid full price I would still be satisfied though. "

												Rather bare-bones but a fun and unique RPG. It has a mix of almost 4x style overworld with classic western RPG mechanics mixed in.Towards the end of the game the engine starts to chug a bit and the game systems become a little clunky.The visuals are very low poly, but pleasing. The music is soft/heavy on strings and doesn't get annoying.			"

												This game is basically a simpler XCOM, but with the added novelty of being able to breed your own soldiers. The art style is nice, though it's an acquired taste, and the story is basic, but decent.I didn't really like having to clear the same maps again and again, but they change up the starting positions, so it's not too bad (probably randomized). Also, they don't explain all the mechanics in detail, so don't feel bad checking out the Wikia if you feel like you're missing something.There's a bit of replayability in the game, but basically only if you want to try a higher difficulty or if you want to focus on a different class of warrior. I wouldn't want to pay full price for it for this reason, but if there's a bit of a discount, it's worth getting, for sure.7/10			"

												A very fun game that can be very unforgiving. The way legacy and heros work is unique and makes the game very nice.I would suggest keeping the Keeps for Breeding close and the Cruicbels and Research Stations at the outer edges. Reason is that You can survive without increased speed in research in the end game, and the crucibels only ensure your new heros start at a better level. But without new heros you will lose the game. The benefits of the outer regions are worth keeping as they have benefits for holding them.The Hybrid classes however are not as good as I would like them to be, and I try to keep the 3 main classes breed in the keeps stay as such and have a fourth keep that can produce various hybrids as I change up the formula a bit. But so far I prefer the main classes far more than the Hybrids.			"

												Just beat massive challice, and... I loved it. I was super into x-com, so I saw this on sale and gave it a shot.It's not quite as fleshed out as x-com, the game feels a bit bare-bones, but the there are a lot of really interesting mehcanics that aren't immediately obvious. For example, there are only 3 classes, but by marring together heros from 2 different classes, you can create mixes. The regent determines the weapon and armor, and their partner determines they're sub-class, so there are actually 9 different classes. Also, the hero-breeding is really deep, heros have actual genes. So some genese aren't expressed, but can still show if you marry them with somebody else that also has the dormant gene.The music is super catchy, that's always a huge plus. The combat is similar to x-com, in that it heavily rewards taking it slow, and picking off straglers until there's nobody left.I DEFINETLY recommend playing on Ironman mode, even if you have to lower the difficulty. X-com is way more fun when played like a roguelike, and this game is too.I played on ironman normal mode, and I found it to be slightly too easy, but pretty close to perfect. I got my self in a few tight spots, but I got through the game on my first try. Definetly put it on hard if you're not playing ironman mode.			"

I can't wait to finish this playthorugh and run it again! Though there are a few mechanics (Regency and traits) that took me a bit to figure out, this game does a great job of putting you into the driver's seat quickly while making sure you feel equipped to handle what is being thrown at you.

												I'm not usually a fan of tactical strategy games, but this one is just such an incredible mix of heroes, and story, not to mention the strategy involved. I got to the last level, and lost, but felt more inclined to start again, and make different choices. I've never wanted to do that more in a game. The voice acting is great, the comedy (when you play through the silly version) is funny and well put, and the game is brilliantly designed.			"

												(7/10) This game has more than meets the eye. I don't like the art style (the character models are hideous) but the breeding of your heroes is fascinating. Unfortunately, the game doesn't prepare you for the final battle so the way you build your bloodlines matters a lot. I did't mind figuring it our but this game is hard if you don't know what you are doing and hard if you do. Good strategy helps but there is lots of randomness which leaves replay-ability but sometimes had me tearing my hair out. Ending was anticlimactic. I guess I was just expecting more celebration after 300 years of toil.  Maybe a list of my heroes or them all at a dance afterwards. But Massive Chalice is worth the price I paid and I recommend it.			"

												Massive Chalice is a good example of a game that went through the Early Access phase and was eventually followed through to successful completion.  I've seen several games that went through Early Access and were later abandoned by the developer, so it's nice to see an example that turned out to be a polished and fun game.You'll see a lot of people commenting about how the play style is similar to Xcom, and they're right.  I do like Xcom, but I actually like Massive Chalice better than Xcom because of the way heros can be married together to form families and offspring, and eventually new heroes.  The traits and stats of the parents influence the traits, stats, and initial experience level of the next generation of heroes.  With some clever planning over which hero I marry to another, I can have a batch of fresh new recruits leveled up and waiting to replace the aging (or dead) ones.  Contrast that with Xcom, where you lose one of your soldiers and they're just gone.I feel like Massive Chalice's building placement mechanic improved on the 'base building' mechanic seen in Xcom.  I don't have to worry about excavating some area, and providing power or anything silly like that.  Instead they added bonuses based on what building you place and where.  They simplified the building concept while also improving on it.  I also like the random events that come up and require a decision to be made.  The decisions made for those events have lasting effects on how the game progresses, and add flavor to the story.I hope the developers consider making a Massive Chalice 2.			"

												I was prepared for the same disappointment with Massive Chalice as I was with Spacebase DF-9. Long story short, people paid money and the Double Fine gave up on making the game, leaving everyone with a game that essentially never left alpha. But funnily enough, that wasn’t the case. Massive Chalice is essentially XCOM cross the map from the Game of Thrones introduction.The enemies are varied and you can use their corpses ro craft new weapons, items and armor. Someone dies and there’s no getting back up again. Every mission is very simple: Kill all the Cadence monsters. With no variance, the game can be a little repetitive at times. But I don’t enjoy this game for the combat.Almost unheard of, but one of the best parts about this game is the micro-managing between battles. And here’s where the Game of Thrones comes into it. You have several families/clans under your control which you place into keeps around your kingdom. Each clan has a dominant class and by intermingling different clans, you can produce hybrid classes and place emphasis on certain traits. You are an immortal dictator with complete oversight of your kingdom, the oversight and totalitarian control needed to save the realm.I have picked up some issues. The classes are really, really unintuitive. An alchemist has a giant claw and throws flasks, a hunter has a crossbow and a caber just bashes the♥♥♥♥♥♥out enemies with a caber (log of wood used in the Scottish sport Caber Tossing). The hybrid classes are even more confusing with names like Blastcapper, Enforcer and Boomstriker (lucky guess as to what hybrids they are).Asides from this, still a good game. It has a simple eloquence to it which Double Fine have always had a knack for. Even though your heroes die of old age, the next generation start at a higher level, meaning that you feel like you’re progressing despite losing your best warriors to the ravages of time. Double-Fine have made some game design choices which are great. Knowing about the game before I started, I expected heaps of flaws. But somehow Double-Fine have managed to find ways around it.For full review, visit: http://icarusreviews.net/2015/08/23/massive-chalice/ "

												I backed Massive Chalice back when it was on Kickstarter.If you want to know what massive Chalice is, then you need to think XCOM: Enemy Unknown with a fantasy setting. The most important part is: It's just as good.The only part one might have to come to terms with is the art design, which is very ... unique. Other might say peculiar. But after an hour or two, gameplay has gripped the player so tight that it just becomes part of the game.If you liked XCOM and thought Ironman Impossible was already too easy, try the same setting on Massive Chalice and get utterly destroyed. 11/10 would breed heroes for 6 generations again just to lose them all and lose the game in one single encounter.

												Let's start with the bad. This game has so much wasted potential that I could basically cry. But that is typical of a Massive Chalice's release. The strategy/ruling part is fun enough to keep you busy for a while choosing regents, partners, researches and building stuff and the combat part is also fun enough (even though a total rip-off from X-Com). The problem is, even though the game's finished it looks unfinished. The zen graphic they adopted make everything look bland and forgettable, not to mention the combat locations, after the first combat you neither distinguish, nor you care where you are fighting. I played the game on Hard difficulty and it wasn't difficult to finish and as a reward I got what? A long list of credits. Yeah, you heard right, instead of complicated statistics or charts to display my 300 years prowess, I got nothing. DoubleFine can't be trusted, they are at the opposite end of the spectrum where Overkill is (still supporting Payday 2 after years). Can't really reccomened the game for 20€ though, its worth is more in the 5€ price range I'd say.+ Fun Game and Good Ideas+ Interesting Story- Looks Unfinished- Bland Graphics- No Post-Game Statistics7/10			"

												Pros:Solid and enjoyable gameplayentertaining soundbitesoriginal conceptCons:I don't like the art style (but that's personal preference)doesn't feel like it will have a high replayabilityI only recently picked up this game while it was on sale and I must say I wish I had bought it sooner. Massive Chalice is an excellent blend of long term strategy and turn based tactics. to give you a comparison, it plays very much like a low fantasy version of XCOM Enemy Unknown. You take on the role of the faceless (and mute) commander, You place your buildings into your lands. The enemy attacks several provinces at once and you can only defenc one of them.But unlike XCOM, your heros have a limited lifespan and will eventually die of age if the enemy doesn't get them first.to save some of their valuable traits you can marry your heros off in order to breed the next generation of cannon fodder. This adds a whole new dimension to strategy and it is something I wish more games could implement.overall I would give it about a 4/5the only downsides are the blocky looking art style which I don't like but seems popular these days. and the fact that it seems like it will have limited replayability, there are only so many ways to do things so I feel that aside from achivement hunting it won't get to many repeats from me.

												This game is challenging.这个游戏很有挑战性。For my first try I think it is an XCOM like game.我刚开始的时候以为这又是一个仿幽浮系列的游戏。But after that I realized I`m wrong about the concepts of this game.之后，我才明白自己想错了。It does like XCOM, BattleBrothers or whatever turn based stragety game, but there is a differences, you are not chose your warrior but your bloodlines. You need to make your attention on your population which directly affects the heros you can choose in a single battle, also the age of your heros does have the same effects.这确实像幽浮、兄弟战团或者其他的什么回合制策略类游戏，不过这里有些不一样的地方，你不是选择你的战士，而是选择你的血统。你需要时刻注意你的人口信息，它直接影响到你每场能选择的英雄数目，当然，还有年龄。There are actually 12 types of units rather than the simple 3. And each type is unique. In the right usage of your abilities that you can make it easy to defeat your enemies. i.e. Due to the lack management of population I use only to Shadowjacker to fight a battle, but I won(In a stealth->recon->stun->attack process). So there is a lot much fun.这里不单单是3种单位，实际是12种单位。每一个单位都是很特别的。使用正确就能轻易击败你的敌人。举个栗子，由于我对人口管理的疏漏，我有一场战斗只有2个潜影破坏者，但是，我通过潜行-〉侦查-〉击晕-〉攻击的流程赢了那局。所以我玩这游戏不会少乐子And there are different types of monsters. Try not to be agressive before you find out the attribute of those invadors.这游戏还有各种各样的怪物。在弄清楚它们的特性之前，切忌冒进。GL HF.祝你好运，玩得愉快！			"

												I loved this game especially how you have to keep bloodlines going and keep your people alive. I also liked how the combat was done. It is pretty solid in how they made it. Some great points like it states on the games store page.Bloodline Genetics - MASSIVE CHALICE features an innovative Bloodline system that allows the player to marry heroes together to produce children. The Bloodline system uses a randomized genetic code for every hero. Their children can end up with the best (or worst!) gameplay-impacting traits of their parents. Permadeath - The heroes in MASSIVE CHALICE age over the course of the timeline and eventually pass away. This forces the player to engage in the beauty of permadeath and always juggle an imperfect party of heroes with which to do battle! Long View Strategy - Because the war lasts 300 years, players need to take a long view of their strategy. Decisions have to be made dozens of years in advance and long-term planning is incredibly important. That 3-year-old toddler is going to grow up to be your most reliable melee fighter sooner than you think!			"

												A decent game overall. I guess I am lucky that I didn't play xcom before because it seems to amplify the hate for this game. I found it quite hard and frustrating the first time I played. After 2-3 hours of rage quits I started to actually use the skills of the characters and to pay attention to the genetics of the houses, then I finished it in about 10-11 hours. It is really fun to play on normal difficulty and not as tedious or impossible as some suggested.The game has some interesting mechanics, I have played Civ5 and Civ4 and I found the battle system to be similar, but the game really shines when you have to take care of you Nation. The system based on noble houses that have to mate with one another to produce offspring suitable for combat, rule or study is really nice. I am sure this game did not live up to the hype as many players say, but it is definitely not bad or shallow. As heroes evolve, so do the enemies and the tactical battles get more and more interesting.			"

												I was intrigued by this game, but didn't think I would be really into it at, and just tried it to see. Well now I know I really like it! The game reminds me of the HOMM games, with many differences of course.My first playthrough, I played without paying much attention and dropped it after about 50 years, I was doomed...I cleared the game with my 2nd playthrough, and I still did so many bad things in it... (normal difficulty).Pros:- Interesting bloodline thematic, I don't remember having that in another game. It was nice though I wish I knew earlier than once you place a bloodline in a keep you're stuck with them forever.- The mini question games that popped up every now and then, that was amusing and quick, I kept waiting for a new one to pop.- The voice actors are great!- I liked the only one mission for the whole game thing, so if you mess up, you got to restart from scratch, it's quite refreshing (though I probably wouldn't feel that way if I failed around year 280 ;) )- Following above, being strong at one point doesn't mean that you'll stay this way, things happen and if you don't pay attention you're back to having weak heroes again. - The mixing of classes to create new classes was fun!- The various attributes for a heroes and the random traits and personalities.- Various details like a feud can occur between families, which will decrease their efficiency if together in battle.- Since the game is randomized the replay value is pretty good.Neutral:- Somehow I wasn't a huge fan of the battles, and skipped the one before the last since I could afford it,- I got a bit annoyed at having so many sages dying in a row, till I figured out making young ones sage would bypass this issue :)Cons:- The voices get old quickly as they keep repeating the same stuff over and over again... I understand the game is randomized so they cannot have fresh voices for everything, but more variety would have been nice.- There's pretty much no story told, all we know is that there's an evil corrupting the land and it will take 300 years for the chalice to be able to clean it up... strong storytelling!- Not enough upgrades in the end: I used mostly hunters and had plenty of heroes all around, so around 200 years I maxed out all I care for and ended up doing the heroes and alchemist upgrades just because I had to do something... I wish I would have looked forward to upgrades during the whole game. (it's not a big issue of course). "

I bought it thinking that it would be a game I could play for 20-30 minutes but the more I've played it, the more I find I just want to ""see what happens next"".  Establishing bloodlines for your heroes was a neat new idea in a game.  I think it has replay value as there are several different levels of play.Then only bad thing I can say about it is that the name of the game itself is pretty dumb.  ""Mom, what game are you playing"".  ""Massive Chalice""  ""What?"".  Also, drunken hunters do not have good aim.			"

												I played lots of violent games, a few with nudity/sex but this is the first time I play one with incest and pedophilia! So, one less thing on my bucket list! In massive chalice you are some kind of immortal king that leads a world through centuries etc. So, you get to match people in order for them to make babies. The true fun begins when you realise that the best fertility match you found among your incested mentaly defective folks is a 56yo men with a 9yo girl... Once that happens, screw everything else. Who cares about some tactical turn-based fighting etc. The game is over. Let's be real, if you were some kind of god, what would you prefere doing, leading your folks to victory in battle over the darkside or mess around with their sexuality like the biggest perv ever... ♥♥♥♥ YOUR MOTHER NOW! but let your son finish...  just join them... ;o~5.5/10, Great ideas but not that fun.

												It's interesting, but not particularly good. I bought it mostly as a cheap alternative to X-Com and to support Double Fine who put out interesting stuff, and supporting the independents is always a must.But as another, long winded but well put together review said, it gets repetitive quickly, there's no life to the world; I strongly recommend playing this windowed and running YouTube or something on the side.X-Com is probably better (I wouldn't know) but I feel duty bound to recommend Massive Chalice. It has some nice ideas and the art style is quite striking. For its faults, I still like it. Just be sure to pick it up on sale.			"

												Very interesting and very charming turn based strategy game. If you like the genre then I absolutely recommend you give this a shot!-----+Interesting macro management.+Varied enemies that encourage the use of different tactics to defeat.+Pleasant art style and animations.+Nice sound direction, both in music and sound effects.+Lots of quirky humour.+Plays well with a controller.+/- Macro Management can be a bit chaotic and unclear what's actually happening under the hood.-Only three weapon styles. (Though abiities can vary and they each compliment each other well.)-After the initial learning curve, maybe a tad on the easier side. (If so, crank up the difficulty!)-Potential for end game tedium through the final quarter of a campaign. (Though personally it kept me quite engaged.)-----I wasn't expecting to enjoy MASSIVE CHALICE as much as I have done thus far. I suppose it is similar in a lot of ways to the recent X-COM games in that the game requires you to succeed at both managing a base and also managing the strategic battles, and like X-COM if you fail at either element too badly you stand a good chance of losing the game.The ""Base"" component of MASSIVE CHALICE places you as the immortal leader of a small kingdom that spans several hundred years over the course of the game. You're expected to manage the continual repopulation of your roster of heroes as they die to old age through a Game Of Thrones-ey family system where you build keeps and assign lords and ladies to have lots of heroic children. These children may inherit some of the personality quirks or physical traits of their parents as well as experience points or even family heirloom weapons. This ensures that over the course of the game you can maintain a sense of growth in your hero roster as the game progresses through the family ties.You can also spend time researching new weapons, armours and items for use in the field and the game occasionally throws up points of contention amongst the populace for you to make decisions on which will have either positive or negative effects, similar to what you may have seen in The Banner Saga.The battles themselves present you with a variety of legitimate threats that I'd rather not spoil for you that escalate as time progresses. Enemies are interesting in that the threats they pose are often not necessarily tied in to their raw power in terms of health pools and damage they can deal. Encountering them in unexpected combinations can make for some interesting tactical puzzles and this is doubly true with the nature of your ever changing roster of heroes. You may not have a full set of tools available for you to tackle these problems with depending on how the baby-making situation goes.I've got a fair amount of experience with games in this genre and for me this game was refreshingly different and thoroughly enjoyable.

												Fun, but unforgiving.  Strategic elements require a lot of planning and tough decisions which can be overwhelming on the first play through.  Tactical elements are fun and challenging.  This game looks simple, but there many things going on under the surface.  It is not a simple game,  but may take a few decades (in game time) to realize that.  All decisions have consequences...far reaching consequences.  I just wished it had a chunky in-depth manual like early 90s strategy games had.			"

												Rather bare-bones but a fun and unique RPG. It has a mix of almost 4x style overworld with classic western RPG mechanics mixed in.Towards the end of the game the engine starts to chug a bit and the game systems become a little clunky.The visuals are very low poly, but pleasing. The music is soft/heavy on strings and doesn't get annoying.			"

												I was initially underwhelmed, but really glad I stuck with it and finished. It's a light, fresh, intriguing take on the X-Com formula. They tried for something really different and didn't entirely succeed (the biggest shortcoming is that the interface isn't quite able to handle the game's complexity), but that's an expected outcome for such an experiment. Ultimately though, it's a very innovative and aesthetically pleasing game, and I hope future games are able to run with some of the ideas that are explored here.			"

												Massive Chalice or Eugenics War (what it feels like to me at least) is a turn-based strategy game. It also has a kingdom management aspect to it but for the most part it is a turn-based tactical combat game.Eugenics War (Massive Chalice) is built around a hero breeding system. Every single marriage is your decision. Your choices can create a bloodline full of hearty and quick heroes or asthmatic and slow ones. With every choice having positive and negative consequences you’ll have to weigh every decision.Combat is grid and turn based. If you’ve played Final Fantasy Tactics or XCOM you know what to expect. Though don’t expect the same amount of variety of units as Final Fantasy Tactics or the complexity of XCOM. This is a lighter squad based game.Is this game for everyone? Of course not, the game gets a little repetitive and a lot of the unique ideas in this title are not fully realized. It is however a very interesting game that does something different from most turn based (and squad based) strategy games.As with most games on Steam if you don’t feel like taking a risk on this at full price just wait for a sale; I purchased my copy in a bundle and only ended up paying $1.25. At that price I feel I definitely got my money’s worth, had I paid full price I would still be satisfied though. "

												I loved this game, and consider it a hidden gem. It plays like X-COM, with a mating/genetics system like Fire Emblem (in perpetuiity), and a unique and charming aesthetic/world. You have a squad of soldiers who revolve throughut the game as they are born, mature, and die, each with distinguishable characteristics. This gives them flair and make it even more heartbreaking when they die because you missed the shot THAT IT SAID HAD A 90% CHANCE OF LANDING, HOW COULD IT HAVE MISSED?!On the downside, the campaign is small and feels repetitive. There's not a lot of customizable bells and whistles so you've pretty much seen it all after you get 20% in. While this is a drag, keep in mind that it is a medium-sized game. It acomplishes what it sets out to do, and while it lacks a full-feature-game feel, it also lacks the cost. Keeping in mind the price tag, I would label it a must-play.			"

												A decent game overall. I guess I am lucky that I didn't play xcom before because it seems to amplify the hate for this game. I found it quite hard and frustrating the first time I played. After 2-3 hours of rage quits I started to actually use the skills of the characters and to pay attention to the genetics of the houses, then I finished it in about 10-11 hours. It is really fun to play on normal difficulty and not as tedious or impossible as some suggested.The game has some interesting mechanics, I have played Civ5 and Civ4 and I found the battle system to be similar, but the game really shines when you have to take care of you Nation. The system based on noble houses that have to mate with one another to produce offspring suitable for combat, rule or study is really nice. I am sure this game did not live up to the hype as many players say, but it is definitely not bad or shallow. As heroes evolve, so do the enemies and the tactical battles get more and more interesting.			"

												Massive Chalice is another super solid indie game from DoubleFine Productions. Basically take XCOM's line of sight concept, tone it down in complexity, add a super interesting base building / heredity simulation game and then you have Massive Chalice. Extremely fun game, and the first play through is an absolute blast. Guaranteed for an easy 20 - 30 hours of greatness. 10/10 for the initial playthrough, then moves down to a 9/10 or 8/10 on consecutive playthroughs due to the top-down rpg growing somewhat stale because of a slight lack of depth.

												I was intrigued by this game, but didn't think I would be really into it at, and just tried it to see. Well now I know I really like it! The game reminds me of the HOMM games, with many differences of course.My first playthrough, I played without paying much attention and dropped it after about 50 years, I was doomed...I cleared the game with my 2nd playthrough, and I still did so many bad things in it... (normal difficulty).Pros:- Interesting bloodline thematic, I don't remember having that in another game. It was nice though I wish I knew earlier than once you place a bloodline in a keep you're stuck with them forever.- The mini question games that popped up every now and then, that was amusing and quick, I kept waiting for a new one to pop.- The voice actors are great!- I liked the only one mission for the whole game thing, so if you mess up, you got to restart from scratch, it's quite refreshing (though I probably wouldn't feel that way if I failed around year 280 ;) )- Following above, being strong at one point doesn't mean that you'll stay this way, things happen and if you don't pay attention you're back to having weak heroes again. - The mixing of classes to create new classes was fun!- The various attributes for a heroes and the random traits and personalities.- Various details like a feud can occur between families, which will decrease their efficiency if together in battle.- Since the game is randomized the replay value is pretty good.Neutral:- Somehow I wasn't a huge fan of the battles, and skipped the one before the last since I could afford it,- I got a bit annoyed at having so many sages dying in a row, till I figured out making young ones sage would bypass this issue :)Cons:- The voices get old quickly as they keep repeating the same stuff over and over again... I understand the game is randomized so they cannot have fresh voices for everything, but more variety would have been nice.- There's pretty much no story told, all we know is that there's an evil corrupting the land and it will take 300 years for the chalice to be able to clean it up... strong storytelling!- Not enough upgrades in the end: I used mostly hunters and had plenty of heroes all around, so around 200 years I maxed out all I care for and ended up doing the heroes and alchemist upgrades just because I had to do something... I wish I would have looked forward to upgrades during the whole game. (it's not a big issue of course). "

												I'm a fan of turn based games and I personally like this a lot more than XCOM. The bloodline feature makes you decide whether a hero is going to be used for breeding, battle, or as a sage because most the time you'll only get 2 or 3 battles with a hero before they die. In a lot of ways it is like xcom, especially with the leveling system but the traits aspect is more important than level. I suck at writing reviews. 9/10.			"

												Good concept, execution is sadly lacking.It's essentially a really basic X-COM/Banner Saga type of turn-based tactical combat, except you never get attached to your characters because the game kills them off from old-age after about 2 battles, only to be replaced by different characters who will also die at age 65 after 2 battles. Rinse and repeat. In between combat encounters you get to take very few decisions regarding your kingdom, the improvements you wish to prioritize and the characters you wish to assign to various functions(lord of the keep, researcher, trainer, etc.) . Once characters are assigned to a function they are no longer eligible for combat and you get in fact little to no interaction with them, making them little more than stats on a spreadsheet. They will also die of old age before you even memorize their names. Rinse and repeat.The artistic direction is interesting but the game's graphics don't live up to it. There are also disparities in the way some units or objects look when compared to others, and the game just ends up looking weird and sometimes ugly.The repetitive nature of Massive Chalice would not be a big issue if the core gameplay would not feel so formulaic. But when you are not given any interesting gameplay mechanics to play with, or any reason to care about what you're doing, why would you continue playing?			"

												Scratches the tactical game itch. Having the game take place over a period of 300 years and having the player essentially breed their army over several generations was an interesting way to handle resource management inbetween combat encounters instead of just using the XCOM-style base management.There may be some balance issues between the unit classes you have, and some may not like having most of the classes be permutations on three main classes, but it didn't get repetitive over my playthrough. Massive Chalice may not be a great game for repeated playthroughs, but it was fantastic for a one-off. I love eet.			"

												It is  tactical battle and a unique game of strategy. It was good but could have been much better. The strategy seciotn was primarily breeding your next generation of warriors and scholars using sires which were imperfect. You had to decide which defects to live with. The list of characteristics was relatively few and it was often hard to tell how choices affected the outcome in battle.  For instance, I never could tell what effect ""drrunk"" had on performance.  Another frustrating thing about the stategy section was the random events which were relatively few in number and the best answer wasn't logical - just random.  It would have been much better if all actions had positive and negative consequences which had to be weighed without knowing the severity of the impact.  The tactical game was good.  I recently went back to play xcom, but the tactical battles were clunky and the time  limitation frustrating. In this game, you always knew how far you could move and still attack. The management was smooth.  One unfortunate thing was that distance made very little impact on accuracy of archers - it was mostly warrier level and skill rating. It was also hard to tell when you were lined up with enemies to hit multiple with one shoot.  I would have to wait several years before enjoying a replay.			"

												This game is challenging.这个游戏很有挑战性。For my first try I think it is an XCOM like game.我刚开始的时候以为这又是一个仿幽浮系列的游戏。But after that I realized I`m wrong about the concepts of this game.之后，我才明白自己想错了。It does like XCOM, BattleBrothers or whatever turn based stragety game, but there is a differences, you are not chose your warrior but your bloodlines. You need to make your attention on your population which directly affects the heros you can choose in a single battle, also the age of your heros does have the same effects.这确实像幽浮、兄弟战团或者其他的什么回合制策略类游戏，不过这里有些不一样的地方，你不是选择你的战士，而是选择你的血统。你需要时刻注意你的人口信息，它直接影响到你每场能选择的英雄数目，当然，还有年龄。There are actually 12 types of units rather than the simple 3. And each type is unique. In the right usage of your abilities that you can make it easy to defeat your enemies. i.e. Due to the lack management of population I use only to Shadowjacker to fight a battle, but I won(In a stealth->recon->stun->attack process). So there is a lot much fun.这里不单单是3种单位，实际是12种单位。每一个单位都是很特别的。使用正确就能轻易击败你的敌人。举个栗子，由于我对人口管理的疏漏，我有一场战斗只有2个潜影破坏者，但是，我通过潜行-〉侦查-〉击晕-〉攻击的流程赢了那局。所以我玩这游戏不会少乐子And there are different types of monsters. Try not to be agressive before you find out the attribute of those invadors.这游戏还有各种各样的怪物。在弄清楚它们的特性之前，切忌冒进。GL HF.祝你好运，玩得愉快！			"

												Pros:Solid and enjoyable gameplayentertaining soundbitesoriginal conceptCons:I don't like the art style (but that's personal preference)doesn't feel like it will have a high replayabilityI only recently picked up this game while it was on sale and I must say I wish I had bought it sooner. Massive Chalice is an excellent blend of long term strategy and turn based tactics. to give you a comparison, it plays very much like a low fantasy version of XCOM Enemy Unknown. You take on the role of the faceless (and mute) commander, You place your buildings into your lands. The enemy attacks several provinces at once and you can only defenc one of them.But unlike XCOM, your heros have a limited lifespan and will eventually die of age if the enemy doesn't get them first.to save some of their valuable traits you can marry your heros off in order to breed the next generation of cannon fodder. This adds a whole new dimension to strategy and it is something I wish more games could implement.overall I would give it about a 4/5the only downsides are the blocky looking art style which I don't like but seems popular these days. and the fact that it seems like it will have limited replayability, there are only so many ways to do things so I feel that aside from achivement hunting it won't get to many repeats from me.

												Rather bare-bones but a fun and unique RPG. It has a mix of almost 4x style overworld with classic western RPG mechanics mixed in.Towards the end of the game the engine starts to chug a bit and the game systems become a little clunky.The visuals are very low poly, but pleasing.

												Fatasy themed, budget version of Xcom. Not reallly a rip off, since if not compared to Xcom, this game has some intersting mechanism design. But still, the combat system cant even support more than 3 mission types (1 of which is the ""boss fight"" without bosses. Heh), that plus the limited amount of attracitve upgrades makes lategame quite boring.Theres quite a few places to be improved for this game to be truly excellent, but as an indi game it is still worth buying under a nice discount.

												(7/10) This game has more than meets the eye. I don't like the art style (the character models are hideous) but the breeding of your heroes is fascinating. Unfortunately, the game doesn't prepare you for the final battle so the way you build your bloodlines matters a lot. I did't mind figuring it our but this game is hard if you don't know what you are doing and hard if you do. Good strategy helps but there is lots of randomness which leaves replay-ability but sometimes had me tearing my hair out. Ending was anticlimactic. I guess I was just expecting more celebration after 300 years of toil.  Maybe a list of my heroes or them all at a dance afterwards. But Massive Chalice is worth the price I paid and I recommend it.			"

												Just beat massive challice, and... I loved it. I was super into x-com, so I saw this on sale and gave it a shot.It's not quite as fleshed out as x-com, the game feels a bit bare-bones, but the there are a lot of really interesting mehcanics that aren't immediately obvious. For example, there are only 3 classes, but by marring together heros from 2 different classes, you can create mixes. The regent determines the weapon and armor, and their partner determines they're sub-class, so there are actually 9 different classes. Also, the hero-breeding is really deep, heros have actual genes. So some genese aren't expressed, but can still show if you marry them with somebody else that also has the dormant gene.The music is super catchy, that's always a huge plus. The combat is similar to x-com, in that it heavily rewards taking it slow, and picking off straglers until there's nobody left.I DEFINETLY recommend playing on Ironman mode, even if you have to lower the difficulty. X-com is way more fun when played like a roguelike, and this game is too.I played on ironman normal mode, and I found it to be slightly too easy, but pretty close to perfect. I got my self in a few tight spots, but I got through the game on my first try. Definetly put it on hard if you're not playing ironman mode.			"

												Let's start with the bad. This game has so much wasted potential that I could basically cry. But that is typical of a Massive Chalice's release. The strategy/ruling part is fun enough to keep you busy for a while choosing regents, partners, researches and building stuff and the combat part is also fun enough (even though a total rip-off from X-Com). The problem is, even though the game's finished it looks unfinished. The zen graphic they adopted make everything look bland and forgettable, not to mention the combat locations, after the first combat you neither distinguish, nor you care where you are fighting. I played the game on Hard difficulty and it wasn't difficult to finish and as a reward I got what? A long list of credits. Yeah, you heard right, instead of complicated statistics or charts to display my 300 years prowess, I got nothing. DoubleFine can't be trusted, they are at the opposite end of the spectrum where Overkill is (still supporting Payday 2 after years). Can't really reccomened the game for 20€ though, its worth is more in the 5€ price range I'd say.+ Fun Game and Good Ideas+ Interesting Story- Looks Unfinished- Bland Graphics- No Post-Game Statistics7/10			"

												I was prepared for the same disappointment with Massive Chalice as I was with Spacebase DF-9. Long story short, people paid money and the Double Fine gave up on making the game, leaving everyone with a game that essentially never left alpha. But funnily enough, that wasn’t the case. Massive Chalice is essentially XCOM cross the map from the Game of Thrones introduction.The enemies are varied and you can use their corpses ro craft new weapons, items and armor. Someone dies and there’s no getting back up again. Every mission is very simple: Kill all the Cadence monsters. With no variance, the game can be a little repetitive at times. But I don’t enjoy this game for the combat.Almost unheard of, but one of the best parts about this game is the micro-managing between battles. And here’s where the Game of Thrones comes into it. You have several families/clans under your control which you place into keeps around your kingdom. Each clan has a dominant class and by intermingling different clans, you can produce hybrid classes and place emphasis on certain traits. You are an immortal dictator with complete oversight of your kingdom, the oversight and totalitarian control needed to save the realm.I have picked up some issues. The classes are really, really unintuitive. An alchemist has a giant claw and throws flasks, a hunter has a crossbow and a caber just bashes the♥♥♥♥♥♥out enemies with a caber (log of wood used in the Scottish sport Caber Tossing). The hybrid classes are even more confusing with names like Blastcapper, Enforcer and Boomstriker (lucky guess as to what hybrids they are).Asides from this, still a good game. It has a simple eloquence to it which Double Fine have always had a knack for. Even though your heroes die of old age, the next generation start at a higher level, meaning that you feel like you’re progressing despite losing your best warriors to the ravages of time. Double-Fine have made some game design choices which are great. Knowing about the game before I started, I expected heaps of flaws. But somehow Double-Fine have managed to find ways around it.For full review, visit: http://icarusreviews.net/2015/08/23/massive-chalice/ "

I can't wait to finish this playthorugh and run it again!

												I'm a fan of turn based games and I personally like this a lot more than XCOM. The bloodline feature makes you decide whether a hero is going to be used for breeding, battle, or as a sage because most the time you'll only get 2 or 3 battles with a hero before they die. In a lot of ways it is like xcom, especially with the leveling system but the traits aspect is more important than level. I suck at writing reviews. 9/10.			"

												Good concept, execution is sadly lacking.It's essentially a really basic X-COM/Banner Saga type of turn-based tactical combat, except you never get attached to your characters because the game kills them off from old-age after about 2 battles, only to be replaced by different characters who will also die at age 65 after 2 battles. Rinse and repeat. In between combat encounters you get to take very few decisions regarding your kingdom, the improvements you wish to prioritize and the characters you wish to assign to various functions(lord of the keep, researcher, trainer, etc.) . Once characters are assigned to a function they are no longer eligible for combat and you get in fact little to no interaction with them, making them little more than stats on a spreadsheet. They will also die of old age before you even memorize their names. Rinse and repeat.The artistic direction is interesting but the game's graphics don't live up to it. There are also disparities in the way some units or objects look when compared to others, and the game just ends up looking weird and sometimes ugly.The repetitive nature of Massive Chalice would not be a big issue if the core gameplay would not feel so formulaic. But when you are not given any interesting gameplay mechanics to play with, or any reason to care about what you're doing, why would you continue playing?			"

												I loved this game especially how you have to keep bloodlines going and keep your people alive. I also liked how the combat was done. It is pretty solid in how they made it. Some great points like it states on the games store page.Bloodline Genetics - MASSIVE CHALICE features an innovative Bloodline system that allows the player to marry heroes together to produce children. The Bloodline system uses a randomized genetic code for every hero. Their children can end up with the best (or worst!) gameplay-impacting traits of their parents. Permadeath - The heroes in MASSIVE CHALICE age over the course of the timeline and eventually pass away. This forces the player to engage in the beauty of permadeath and always juggle an imperfect party of heroes with which to do battle! Long View Strategy - Because the war lasts 300 years, players need to take a long view of their strategy. Decisions have to be made dozens of years in advance and long-term planning is incredibly important. That 3-year-old toddler is going to grow up to be your most reliable melee fighter sooner than you think!			"

This game is surprisingly thoughtful - and painful. Your heroes will die all the time, but if you are a fan of XCOM, Invisible Inc, Don't Starve, or any game that features permadeath and roguelike randomisation, this game is perfect for you. I would wholeheartedly recommend this game if you enjoy this game style.But if you are not a glutton for punishment and don't enjoy dying a lot, this isn't for you, and I strongly urge you to avoid this game, simply because a lot of the negative reviews I feel are from gamers who don't enjoy this game style.

												(Played this game on the Xbone too, so have significantly more hours than stated)This is definately a gem of a game, although often very difficult and frustrating. You'll probably be on your third playthrough before you actually finish the game (especially if not playing on easy) due to the games strange mechanics and lack of explanation. I feel like this is where all the negatibity comes from.For the majority of the game you will just be playing a squad combat type gameplay. The other part of the game is creating heroes through bloodlines to use in this combat (+to use for a few extras like Sagewrites and Crucibles). Every hero has unique stats and a set class, depending on their parents. Your heroes will age, and die once they get too old. This sounds like a frustrating concept at first, however it really makes you use the bloodlines system, and gives the game alot of depth missing from other squad combat games.Again, I think alot of negativity comes from people not bothering with these mechanics, hitting a dead end, and blaming the game.My issue with this game is ****ing RNGesus. In combat, you have a chance to miss shots (even in Melee) which REALLY frustrates me when everyone in my squad misses a creature and it proceeds to blow my favourite character up. Having said that, maybe the game wouldnt be so addicting if it wasnt for RNGesus. Reccomend this game. 8.5/10.			"

												The simplest way to characterize this game is an X-Com Lite. You build your kingdom, research upgrades, recruit heroes and try and defend against an endless assault of enemies. You win while if you survive a set number of years. Now if this was all that was to it then I would not recommend this game. Instead the story of the kingdom comes together over the years, you get to know the bloodlines of you empire, you make decisions that have repercusions later down the road. I for one didn't establish an alchemist bloodline and later down the road all my alchemists died of old age, I had no alchemists for more than 100 years, but I still won battles because I chose strong heroes to train future generations.I had one of my strongest bloodline of front line warriors die out because the matriarch of the clan had low fertility and a long life so her sons and daugthers died in battle before they could foster children of their own.I lost a whole region to corruption because my only alchemist was a drunk and a stray grenade killed two of my best archers.I also won against great odds against me because of a combination of strategic thinking, good recruits and knowing my enemies' abilities. And on this I would like to note the classes and enemies in this game are very original.Also a big plus to the game's music and voice acting.			"

												I've had this game for a little while now and just recently got around to installing and playing it. This game is awesome, despite it's flaws. To start off with, you're a talking cup with multiple personalities. Unusual if nothing else, you are then tasked with breeding the common people and turning the riffraff into soldiers for your kingdom to protect against the 'cadence', some evil force that is always trying to creep into your kingdom. You have to survive for 300 years (yes, years), so you will see heroes born, fight, and die (either on the battlefield, or of old age). While generally you don't get as attached to your soldiers as XCom, you will get attached to certain soldiers throughout the game and it will sting a bit when they die, which is something you need to accept going in. All of your soldiers will die. All of them. They all get old and die. This game doesn't have the cure for eterenal life either (unless you become a giant talking chalice). They do however get to be awesome while they are alive, become legends, and possible create relics which can then be passed down through the bloodline to allow future generations to be more awesome, it just takes a little planning on your part.As stated in the beginning, it's an awesome game with some flaws, but I find it to be massively fun.

This sounds like a frustrating concept at first, however it really makes you use the bloodlines system, and gives the game alot of depth missing from other squad combat games.Again, I think alot of negativity comes from people not bothering with these mechanics, hitting a dead end, and blaming the game.My issue with this game is ****ing RNGesus. In combat, you have a chance to miss shots (even in Melee) which REALLY frustrates me when everyone in my squad misses a creature and it proceeds to blow my favourite character up. Having said that, maybe the game wouldnt be so addicting if it wasnt for RNGesus. Reccomend this game. 8.5/10.			"

												Turn based squad tactics game along the lines of XCom, adding the twist of ruling a kingdom over several centuries, breeding your heros to be better with every generation. The GoodUnique concept and the makings of an good story.Excellent and entertaining dialog and voice acting.Managing a bloodlines, active heros, researchers, and trianers is challenging.The idea of breeding heros for traits is fascinating (as is the ability for trainees to pick up personality traits -both good and bad- of the mentors) and forces the player to think to the future.Creating Hybrid classes present interesting options, especially when weighed against other strengths of available partner choices for bloodlines.Good variety of enemy types, each requiring different strategies to deal with.Art style is interresting. Combat maps provide good detail for the gameplay.Nearly endless visual customization for starting houses.The BadStory needs more depth. Very little background is provided about the kingdom or the enemy. Unfulfilling ending.Choice of starting houses/bloodline is cosmetic only.Bloodlines and breeding systems not well explained.Relic weapons not explained.AI is not intelligent. Simply clearing line of sight causes the enemey to forget you exist. This lack of intelligence could poetntially make sense if explained by deeper backstory.Class skill choices need improvement. Choices between skills often provides one obviously superior skill. Item/weapon/armor variety needs improvement. Several choices feel like filler only and not useful with limited item equipment slots.The UI is a good start and reasonably clean but lacking in details. Requires multiple steps to access some basic information, no hover-over or click-action tooltips on character pages where its needed most, certain ""close menu"" buttons can be easily confused for cancel action.The UglyClass balance is terrible. Hunters (and their hybrid classes) alone can win the day with minimal casualties or even hits taken - especially paired with veil armor which is available very early. Caberjack melee class is not effective enough for front line combat nor does it have the staying power needed for this role. Alchemists are stuck between being too weak to leave exposed to attacks and too short ranged to be involved in battle.Many enemy types have consequences for being close. This pushs the player further toward using only Hunter classes.Random events in the kindom overview provide only the illusion of choice. Events have roughly equal chance of positive or negative results regardless of which offered solution is chosen, and often have little long term consequence.Ultimately a great concept that fails to deliver on several levels thanks to poor execution and balance. Recommended only if heavily discounted.			"

												In short this game has game machanics that I have never seen before.  I would like too see something like this with a X-Com  makeover.  If your looking for a great turnbased game for a weekend and beyond give this one a try you wont regret it.			"

												A very XCOM like feel to this one, but with the base building changed out for families.  I personally did enjoy my initial play through.  But I can't feel myself playing again.  I did enjoy the bloodlines gimic; probably somewhere in other games, but my first time accross the concept.  Just OK combat sequencies with nothing to write home about.  Like I said I did enjoy my first run, but I can't say I would recommend it at full price.  If you have time to kill and if it is on sale go for it, otherwise better options out there.			"

												A quite good take on XCOM, and one that is just as wickedly addictive as its inspiration. Though there are some issues with balance and pacing (the battles get a bit old by the end, for one), the game largely achieves the fun mix of resource management and turn based that define the genre. Not only that, but the conceit at its core (of strategizing for centuries across many generations) is a good one that makes this more than just a decent take on XCOM.			"

												I liked the setting of conflict and application of time. Your heroes die, either by getting killed or by age, but through bloodlines you are able to pass on some of your hard work. Overall game length might feel a bit longer than necessary, because fights get a bit repetitive towards the end, but I wouldn't say it is too much. I also really liked the soundtrack.			"

												If I had to describe this game in one sentence it would be: ""Great idea, but lazy execution.""The look is typincal of Double Fine games and voicovers are familiar if you have played any of their other games. I did like the look of the game, I thin that it works well.The game is fun, and there is no denying that. Breeding your own heroes is, at leat to me, a novel idea. I have seen mentions of X-COM as a comparable game but that is only true for the part that it is a turn based strategy where you control a small squad. Massive Chalice is nowhere near as big in scope and detail as X-COM games are.The part that bothers me about this game is the lack of imporant details like no descriptions of the traits and personalities. You only get to see what they do after it's too late. There is a very limited number of enemy types and the game heavily favors ranged clases. I would still say that it's an OK game that I might give one or two more playthrougs.			"

												Massive Chalice reminds me of the turn based small unit tactic games of my youth like Warsong and Final Fantasy Tactics.In Massive Chalice, you take on the role of a newly appointed immortal king who is desperately fighting a delaying war over several centuries to hold back the evil tide of a force known as the Cadence.With each Cadence invasion, you deploy five heroes to defend against one and only one invasion point, on a map based on the territory that is being attacked.As the years pass and your heroes grow older you need to plan for the long term by building keeps, completing research projects, and forging strong bloodlines, so that a new generation of heroes can take up the call to arms.Pros•	Old school turn based strategy.•	Rewards strategic long term planning.•	Small unit tactics.•	The Massive Chalice is an entertaining character and a constant companion as you defend your kingdom over the passing centuries. Cons•	Lack of personality for your heroes and their bloodlines.•	Random events are a little too random, only giving you the illusion of choice.•	No steam workshop support to mod the game.Overall I had a blast playing Massive Chalice so I recommend it to anyone who enjoys this style of game. Now blast the horns of battle! "

												Good game, but I think the tiny number of areas in which you can place stuff, kinda makes it meh.  They should have done something like a long war, with many more areas.			"

												Incredible squad-based TBS game.I played this for 10 hours straight the day I bought it; the need to make game-changing choices is fascinating and the added bonus of having to essentially ""breed"" heroes (instead of just picking them from default like in XCOM) adds an extra layer to the game.My only criticism is that although I played fairly well (not perfectly optimized) I found myself unable to complete the final battle and I'm unwilling to sink another 30 hours into playing it all through again.I'll just say I beat the game and watch the ending on YouTube. No one will know. :)			"

												The game has a simple, yet unique story.  Battles are somewhat repetetive (# of enemy increase and the variety/strength).  Some random events can hurt/help -- though they add some depth to the story (these can be annoying because of the random outcome.  I'd prefer clear cost/effect choices).  It has a good art style, voice acting, and runs smooth.The multi-generation aspect is sad but fun. There are 3 main class types that each have 3 sub-classes; the game would be better if you could select how the regents (you've selected to breed) would train their subclass kids.  It is hard to get the classes/variety/spread that you want when you have to select from a limited pool of heroes, which is more limited based on bad stats and infertility.The game actually has some cool strategic items that change how you use characters.  Some problem though:1) having to research them when you are trying to keep your hero stock up2) can't level up relics and use the new weapons3) they list the units you will face, which might make you consider equiping wunderpants or knockback/stun attacks.  But when you are trying to level up a specific hero to get a relic or upgrade a relic it is hard to transfer an hunter/alchemist/caberjack out for the other (since you only get about 4 combats to level them up in their lifespan).4) you won't have enough troops to exchange in/out of your line-up if you are doing bad or getting unlucky on child births and stuff.In general, the RNG % attacks is better in this game than in Xcom, but still pretty similar.  Scatter for explosives and clinking attacks for melee that miss.  I wish to see a turn-based game that has reliable attacks that increase/decrease damage based on distance traveled, energy used, combat positioning, targeting (that sort of thing).  In RNG games likes this and Xcom, I find myself reloading a lot on challenging difficulties or getting upset in ironman modes after high % attacks miss consectivelt and through you off.I'm not really a fan of fog of war, or at least how it is done in Xcom and Massive Chalice, (very similar).  Plenty of turn-based games go without it and do a good job.  The only one I can think of that uses it well would be Frozen Synapse -- but that game is like tactical mind games.I'd reccomend this game to those that like turn based combat rather than a 4x or something along those lines.   Comparable games would be the Expedition: Conquistador/Vikings series and XCOM.   It has some flaws, but all in all it is alright and you can pick it up for a cheap price on sale.			"

												Was honestly torn on this game at first.  But 9 hours later I love it.  It gives me bite sized tactical adventures which I really like.  I like that my heroes die of old age and force me to work with what I got, giving the game an almost puzzle like quality that I need to solve.  As someone who likes roguelike games, and tactical squad based turn based games, this is a fun game.			"
