												This game has way too many good reviews and not enough bad ones. It's how I got tricked into buying it.This got very boring within (EDIT: apparantly, only 0.9 ) hours. I gave it two play sessions. Didn't realize how short they were because I just wasn't having a good enough time. You never need to use the buddy cop system, as your AI controlled partner is unreliable and often just gets gunned down. Beating missions gives you xp you can use to level up any cop you want, and you can just max out all skills on whichever one you choose. So, there's no real reason to ever choose any other cops once you've picked two. Also, the levels are all samey. You kill waves of enemies (or arrest them as they come around corners) until you get to a checkpoint. Rinse, repeat. It's not as fun as Hotline Miami, which several positive reviews have compared it to. Save your money and look at getting something else.Also, there isn't really any storyline. If you're going to get this game, wait for it to go on a huge sale (like 75% off).			"

												Artificial difficulty all around. Thugs get harder to kill and have better aim at later levels and this removes the strategy aspect of the game. The game has no real AI all of the thugs just run at you and try to shoot at some distance depending on how hard the level should be. The ""story"" is uninteresting and not engaging at all. You have to grind levels and doing the first mission a thousand times is the best way to do it, which is boring as hell. If you like grinding and grinding just to keep playing a game then this is the perfect game for you, but I regret buying it because it gets repetitive really fast.Since I agree with almost everything TotalBiscuit says in this video, here's a link to it.

												I was playing on nightmare difficulty, because normal is extremely easy, the middle difficulty which I think may be called hardcore still doesn't present much of a challenge, and nightmare is extremely difficult.I found it best to use only one cop at a time, because enemies instantly snap and shoot your A.I. cop partner as soon as they see them. I only switched to the other cop to save time running across the level to clear other rooms of the building, because sometimes the A.I. in the room I wanted to clear weren't walking in circles close enough to a door or a corner.Because I was guaranteed to lose any firefight with more than 2 bad guys, the only way I could pass missions was to hide around corners and wait for the enemy to walk infront of me or a door and then arrest them instantly with a melee attack. Pushing a door into an enemy causes them to fall over and become stunned for a few seconds, and cannot be shot while stunned.I expected this game to be a fun, somewhat tactical shooter and only experienced frustration.

Note: I played significantly longer on our site's press account. It's shared from that account and I jumped on on here to try one last time and to be able to post my thoughts.It would be fairly unfair of me to assign a review score to LA Cops just yet. I haven't made it to the end and probably never will if things don't change in a significant manner. Fortunately, a developer from the team making the game responded to some of my ranting on Twitter and assures me that at least one thing will be fixed; that nagging sensation that any game that has a player control two characters should have a co-op mode. They are adding a co-op mode. They're also working on the AI and I've suggested various other solutions to current problems but it remains to be seen what happens. Needless to say, co-op mode and a second player would probably be the best fix.Now, let me explain to you why this is important. Beneath the colorful, 70's exterior, beneath all of the ridiculous humor thrown in about cop stereotypes, is an extremely frustrating game. There are a few reasons for this but the primary of them is the partner AI and the way you control him or her. Your partner can only be controlled by commanding him or her to go to a specific location. There is absolutely no way to control which way they face, other than to attempt to continuously re-position them so that they stop walking while facing in the direction that you want them to. This is important because the partner AI is currently so dimwitted that they won't interact with anything outside of their cone of sight, no matter how loud or threatening the approaching AI are.This is all well and good, a bit obnoxious but it can be worked around. What can't is the fact that the game is heavily dependent upon locking onto targets. The enemy AI has extremely good aim and will almost certainly kill you within a shot or two if you don't get them first. Here's the problem with that. You have to control your other player with the crosshair. Locking on locks the crosshair to the nearest enemy. You can't cycle through enemies to lock onto. So how are you supposed to control your partner well while simultaneously locking on?Well, you don't, really. A good breach is easily shot down by the fact that setting your partner up and then swinging back and locking on is an insanely difficult thing to do. Cycling through targets would at least make it easier, if not a perfect solution. But then comes a new problem. So you've killed the two that were in the room. Three more are charging you from another room after hearing gunfire. Do you take them on yourself or risk trying to finagle your partner into a good, tactical position. In my experience, both of those are losing ideas. I've repeated the same scenarios upwards of ten times and only finally completed them through what seemed like pure, unadulterated luck.Therein lies the problem, and this isn't even including the oversensitive controller settings that fling your crosshair the other way when you let go of the joystick and take all of the nuance out of aiming, forcing you to stick with a equidistant circle that you can aim on. The second character is near useless, barring guarding a door or serving as a chance at redemption when you hear the all-too-often ""cop down"" and the challenges are balanced for being able to accurately maneuver two cops. I would have loved to have been able to draw a path for the AI and tell them when to move out in an almost Rainbow Six-like manner. That could have been a brilliant experience. As it stands, though, it's just too difficult, even on normal, to trudge through it, and most of the fault for that lies with the AI and the way that you control them.			"

												LA Cops does the rare thing of combining the worst of Hotline Miami and the worst of Resident Evil 5 without any of the positives.I was kinda interested in this game, seeing how it looked like a 2-character tactical shooter. Looked a bit like HM in that it had quiet planning moments interrupted by bursts of gun action. Seemed okay, so I picked up on the sale.The game looks good, the game does an okay job of telling you the controls, the difficulty curve is reasonable. However LA Cops is hindered by a series of absolutely baffling design choices that run what should be a fun tactical romp into a completely frustrating, sluggish, wasted oportunity of a game. Here are my main gripes with it:- When using keyboard for the first time, you'll get the impression that the game is designed to be played with a controller, since there seems to be a sticky aim, movement with the WASD keys is a bit unresponsive and the angles can be kinda weird. However, playing it with a gamepad you'll get the impression that the game was designed for KBM, because the reticle is used for things such as moving your partner around or selecting the sticky aim, but on controller mode you can only make the reticle move in a predetermined radius around your character. So no matter how you play it, you'll be unconfortable.- Sticky aim doesn't stick to the enemy you want it to stick to. Rather, it will stick to whichever it feels like. This is especially annoying when you're trying to tag an enemy right after telling your buddy to burst in killing everyone, which will result in you failing to tag the enemy and finally just shoot wildly in their general direction which, considering how chaotic combat can get in the game, will probably get your partner, you, or both, killed.- There is no allied AI. You're supposed to be a team of cops, but the only thing your partner will do is stand in place and act as a turret. You will have to tell him/her, EVERY TIME, where to move next. Which, in a game where teamwork and covering each other's backs seems so important, feels even weirder of a mechanic. The game actually kinda picks up when you're left with just one cop, and the mere inclusion of a ""follow me"" command would have turned it into a game *heaps* more pleasant. Enemy AI, when it works, will consist on running up to you, standing there, and shoot. Straightforward, but lacking.- You can't seem to switch cops, despite the prompt telling you to press R to do so. The only time I've been able to switch between my cops is when one of them ""dies"".- AI will derp out, sometimes your buddy will run past an enemy that's shooting him/her, sometimes the goon will ignore them, sometimes they'll get stuck on a door, sometimes will hear stuff they shouldn't be able to hear, and sometimes will not pay attention to something that's happening 5 feet from them. That obviously compounds to the ""I won't move if you don't tell me to"" friendly AI issue mentioned above.- You can't scroll past the boundaries of the screen to check the rest of the map. There is a minimap, which is not explained, and you can zoom out, but you can't see what's a bit further than what's centered on your character, making planning and awareness kinda moot since there's gonna be people coming from places you can't possibly know.- Restarts affect to your score, which kinda bugs me.So, to sum up: it controls weird, it is tedious, both enemies and allies hinder the game flow even further, some expected features half work, others are directly absent from it. My advice is to actually play it before you buy it, because despite looking slick and entertaining, for me it has been an exercise in frustration and unpleasantness.4/10.			"

												Bad game if you can even call it a game.Completely based on random chance. Enemies can sometimes shoot you through walls that cannot be shot through. They can also turn around when you are sneaking up behind them, taking half your health or instantly killing you with no attack animation. AI is so bad that they will ignore compatriots being shot or apprehended in the same room as them. Or, if you are unlucky, come across the map while you are still working through the level and jump you. Your partner will sometimes ignore enemies and be shot dead, or sometimes just aimbot them in a random 5 second spurt of pseudo-intelligence.Weapons are bad. The uzi sound is deceptive, making it by far the worst weapon in the game to use, but extremely deadly in the hands of AI who aimbot you. All weapons shoot at the same speed, with enough accuracy to snipe off-screen enemies. Yes that means you will be fishing around the edges of your screen, waiting for your crosshair to turn red. Then you click to fire your weapon, and you will see your score go up. The game takes no skill or strategy, it is just completely broken. There is a gun that turns your partner into a pile of gibs so they can't be revived essentially making certain levels like the last one impossible. Speaking of score, isn't it supposed to be a cop game? Why is there no penalty for killing civilians? Game pace is done poorly. The only way to stay on top of enemies is to snipe them from off the screen like I explained before they can shoot back. Otherwise you will be overrun by 6+ shotguns and uzis that are all capable of killing you instantly. You can do the same to them, but they will be surrounding you and more often than not, standing behind objects that can't be shot through unless you're at the perfect angle they are at. While writing this review I died in a loading screen two times so it's definitely not a coincidence. This is an artifact of poor coding. The game state exists even when there is a ♥♥♥♥ing loading screen. Hello???? Why?The camera angle is bad no matter what because the UI will block you and the field of view is tiny except on levels that don't even need the zoom out. Enemies see you before you see them and don't make any sound until they are already attacking you. Most of the time you will just hear them shooting at you and then a half second later yell about donuts. Also, you can't effectively kill enemies while changing the camera angle. Bad control scheme, not thought out well at all. Not thought out, period.Art style is bad, it is just pixelated groove crap, doesn't remind me of the setting at all. The characters and voice acting sucks. Why do these 70s cops say stuff like ""Triple Kill"" if you kill 3 guys, why do they say ""Cop Down"" when you or your partner dies? It's all stupid. Product placement for a fake product is GTA level cringe. The theme is so badly done you will literally be following an objectives tab that tells you ""Destroy Drug tables"" for most of the game. They could have just made a good game. So much wasted development time. The only thing I like looking at other than the funny donut loading screen is Jo Murphys sexy body. She is really hot and will be my wife this July. This game has less than 30 minutes of play to it, but tries to give u more by making you level up. The difference between leveling up and not, is when you start Nightmare difficulty like I did while level 1, you will get 1 shot killed by enemies and need to shoot them 3-4 times. You can cheese all the levels to completion and just level up that way. I never even made it past the halfway point for damage or health by the end of the game, and I was still 2-shotting with all but the assault rifle which is always a one hit kill due to being this game's Godmode Gun. It also got to the point they had to have a shotgun or grenade to kill me in one hit. So it starts out slightly difficult, then it is just really easy. I can't complain since I got it for free in a bundle with Worms but this is not a game worth 15 dollars, it's not worth your time whether you are on a tight schedule or not. Trying to figure out how TEAM 17 went from Worms to this♥♥♥♥♥♥is mind boggling. Not even the ♥♥♥♥ing achievements work right. What the ♥♥♥♥??Tl;drGraphics 5/5 (Just terrible and can't tell what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on half the time but Jo Murphy is one hot momma and my wifeSound 2/5 (The music is okay. For the first 20 minutes of the same 2 or 3 tracks being looped.)Controls 0/5 (Bugged to ♥♥♥♥ a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ some controls completely broken i.e can't switch to partner unless you die, crosshair disappears when meleeing)Gameplay 0/5 (Really stupid final boss with a boring ""Do this 3 times"" mechanic after a boring ""Blow up 76 things which take multiple hits to blow up"" yes, 76 ♥♥♥♥ing things, stupid♥♥♥♥♥game)Difficulty 0/5 (Game is not skill based. You'll only die because of purely bad luck. Better to restart anyway than deal with a♥♥♥♥♥♥hand, all the levels are about 2-4 minutes in length if going slowly for the sake of avoiding ♥♥♥♥ing shotguns)Blam this peice of crap.			"

												jule16 update: still bugged, achievements blocked, nothing changed for more than a year. Who ever praised this game? Except for being a good concept? Phony guys.Top-down-view shooter about ""good"" cops whacking and occasionally arresting some bad mobsters, intriguing by its 70' fuzzy visual style and cover-your-flank-partner mechanics. I'd like to praise that game, I'm really more into upholding law, rather than go frenzy like in the Hotline Miami or Hatred. But at current stage of game development, I really can't vouch for LA Cops. So far it is a broken experience, therefore I suggest you to simply stay aside.Details:Visuals are 70' style, everybody male have mustache or beard, and looks really groovy at first sight. Until you see some ""cutscenes"", especially with Katsuo. Ever heard some noise about facial animations? There are none. Totally faceless characters. That's the point where fuzzy getting into foul.The main problem of the game - is the lack of content. 8 levels of campaign mode can be finished in about hour or two (depends from difficulty level and your luck).Game mechanics are quite simple: you have a level with rooms infested by gangsters, which you need to storm either by yourself, or with help of your partner on crime scene. So you storm the place, kill or incapacitate mobs, complete some secondary goals like freeing the hostage, or destroying the pile of ""drugs"". Simple not mean good, though, for its pretty luck-based. The first levels can be opted by planning-before-moving, but, after 3rd level, you'll see a pure roulette: to kill or to be killed... And since the mobs tends to swarm in packs, and shoot through impenetrable walls once they discover your location, with drastic damage and accuracy... You'll be dying alot out of no reason and thanks to bad camera view angles and not working properly control buttons.The most anticipated - bugs! First, the controls: for some unobvious reasons you can't switch your cops, until you die on mission. After that buttons seems to work... for some time. But the main irritant right now is the fact that you can't finish the game properly - after you deal with the last main mission, and see the credits, your progress with the Casino mission will be forgotten. That means you can't get achievements for completion of the game.Also I've noticed several questionable game design solutions. On the start screen there are only two options, single player or multiplayer. So to quit the game I use Alt+F4. Next dubious thing is that you need to complete every level triple times, since completion on the highest difficulty don't mean you're good with easy and medium difficulties. Conclusion:So far it is not worth any money asked. The amount of content is just slightly more than we had in the demo versions of games not so long ago. Yeah, before they started to sell betas as full-scale games, that is. The whole ""Copper"" thing is not relevant, you're doing almost the same things as in Hotline Miami, just not so messy. And that is thanks to simplified mechanics, compared with That Another Game. So, to answer the question ""Is it a poor man's Hotline Miami?"" - I must say that it is a fair assessment.My mark now will be 4.7/10. I can revise it some time later, if they fix at least problems with achievements... But now, it is broken piece of unfinished code that could be a decent game, were it made properly Before release and sales.			"

												It seemed like a fun 70's cop movie/less psychadelic and seizure inducing version of Hotlime Miami that definitely worth 4-5 dollars so i picked it up in a sale. The story is a nice parody (with no reason for side quests without cutscenes). Everything else is a bit more problematic.- Movement is somewhat clunky- Line of sight not clear at times- Partner AI is bad- Enemy AI is set to swarm just to hike up difficulty- 1 hit kill grenades even on fully upgraded guys (it only needs a lot of grinding at first levels), from suddenly appearing waves. Yeah i know, so Dark Souls...- Civilian casualities might happen in the flurry of bullets, and while you get a debrief like normal but for some reason it wont register the level completed. At least id didn't do it for me. Just as the whole game didn't, because of this problems.			"

Early Access Review
								For lovers of Hotline Miami there's a lot of potential to be found in LA Cops, even if this early access release is pretty barebones. Yes, all of the agents are already available and the level that's been implemented feels complete. But at the moment it's pretty short and can easily be finished within 30-60 minutes. That number includes repeatedly dying and therefore replaying some of the sections over again. Let's keep in mind that it's an early access title, but I have to be honest, I've seen games with more content than this. Anyway, let's forget about that for a moment and continue with this little review.LA Cops lets you control 2 cops, in realtime, but you can switch between them on the fly with the press of a button. Your partner won't move along with you; he or she will stand still and cover you as long as enemies move in their FOV. Unlike Hotline Miami this game doesn't entirely rely on fast movement, but you actually have to carefully plan what to do. It requires a bit of strategy and tactics. It's recommended that you let your partner cover the corners so you can let the criminals come to you, if you don't get killed in the process, that is.The graphics are cel shaded and look absolutely gorgeous and stylish and have that 70's look that the developers are aiming for. Just excellent. The game really looks 2D but actually is 3D and you can freely move/rotate the camera around.I haven't really paid attention to any music, just to some sounds, so I'll have to update my review later with better impressions. Still, the gunshots sounded good and the voice acting was also pretty solid, but limited.And of course, there's plenty of room for improvements: the AI, for example, needs some work. I also frequently got stuck in the doorway/between the doors and got shot that way.The camera is too low/has a funny angle so it's sometimes hard to see. I understand this adds to a tense atmosphere, but it doesn't always work as far as gameplay is concerned. Obviously, real cops also never know what can happen so, again, I understand the choice, but when I stand in a large room with 4 or 5 enemies that I could've easily killed if only the camera gave me more room then, for me, it's a bad choice. Hopefully they'll improve it in the future.Also, the UI is clumsy. If I select an agent I want to instantly see their stats. I don't want to click on another button to just see that. For upgrading them it makes complete sense, but their stats can easily be shown on the character selection screen. And I also confused the ammo bar with the health bar while playing, but that could also be me not paying enough attention and wanting to just jump in.And yes, we all know this is work in progress and I'm sure lots of things will change in the next couple of months, and lots of stuff will also be added so I can't tell you yet if it will be worth the money, but for now I will absolutely recommend it. I'll try and update this review to reflect future changes and additions and that way keep it as accurate as possible.[Rating: 79/100]			"

THE BITESIZE:SIMILAR GAMEPLAY TO: Hotline Miami.WHAT TO EXPECT: Very short. Minimal gameplay. Minimalist art style.  Fiddly controls. Fast, frantic action. Lots of dying and restarting. Local multi-player added post release. Problems completing final mission(s).ACHIEVEMENTS: BROKEN.STATUS: ABANDONED.WHEN TO BUY:  NEVER.  Unless fixed.More info below....THE LOWDOWN:L.A. Cops can probably best be described as an inferior Hotline Miami played in an isometric view.  The game oozes doughnut eating, retro-style cop shows from the eighties through its minimalistic graphics, audio and voice-overs. Gameplay has been designed to be very simple, choose two cops and arm them with two weapons.  Take control of one character at a time across several crime hotspots at different L.A. themed locations.  There are only two game styles in mind: go stealthly and make arrests; arm up and go rambo!  Completing missions awards experience which can be used to upgrade your squad. Eight story missions variable length missions (from very short to a few medium.  Mostly short.) Five (or so) optional missions.  Six upgradeable characters to choose from.  Each with their own starting stats. Upgrade characters with experience earned from missions.  Including: Speed, Health, Damage and Clip-size. Five weapons including: handgun, shotgun, SMG, Assault Rifle and Grenade launcher. Three difficulty types: Normal, Hardcore & Nightmare. Local multi-player.  Untried.THE GOOD:+ Minimalisitc art style suits the concept but will not be to everyones tastes.  Personally I preferred it to HM's retro pixels.+ Minor RPG elements.  Though you can upgrade particular stats to specialize characters you will only really ever use two.+ Mission briefing cutscenes add enormously to the overall 80s cop show ambience.  Voice-overs are bang on!THE BAD:- Not enough missions.  Even if only five or so were added, or the mission length were increased it would be enough.- Locations are generic with no real differences between location other than were cover is to be found.- Controls are sometimes flaky in key parts.  The worst is when you press F expecting the focus to switch automatically to the nearest goon but it doesnt and you die.  Die again!  Again, and again!- Not enough enemy types.  Would have been good to have alot more themed enemies, like gangs, armed robbers etc.- Last mission and some optional missions are bugged.  They are not saving correctly.  Therefore cannot gain 100% in achievements.- Shoddy developer support.  Problems not fixed for several months.  Maybe they have gone out of business.  Game looks completed abandoned.AND THE ORDINARY:* Missions are almost all linear apart from a few optional ones. Their only purpose is to increase experience.* Could have done with a few more weapon models or types.* Soundtrack & game audio is well-made, fits the ambience but its the minimum I'd expect.* Basic A.I. that relies on speed to defeat players.  Functional at best.* The alert mechanic works mostly but if you mess-up placement of one character and switch more of the time they will be dead before you can re-act.* The three difficulty types provide some decent replay value.VERDICT:LA Cops is a game of two halves.  Gameplay is very limited and simplistic, yet fast-paced and at times it can be fun.  Though its campaign and levels are short, it looks designed for repetitive play.  The speed of the AI on fast PCs is as annoying as it was in Hotline Miami, and loses hands down in terms of style and panache in its use of dialogue and tropes.  If you dont have quick reflexes, this isnt a game for you.  Though in LA Cops the isometric view helped my senses process the situation more easily.  Focusing on the next target is supposed to help but unfortunately its very fiddly to do this on your preferred target, often causing the cops to die.  On the later missions mistakes are fatal.  Suffice to say if you didnt enjoy Hotline Miami, you probably wont enjoy this game.  The developers did add local multi-player after release (maybe more for the console crowd) but even that must have failed to bring enough interest to make the game successful.  Maybe adding a PvP mode and Steam online support would have made this a little more palatable to PC gamers.L.A. Cops should have been worth a play or two but there just isnt enough and the final missions are broken.  I did enjoy playing some of it but if you want to complete it - its a total waste of money.  Its a shame because if you enjoy fast & frantic, punishing but rewarding gameplay then this may could have been for you.  If you are still not put off, then I would urge caution on how much you spend.  The game's length suggests a much cheaper price than its retailing for.  Its been likely buffed so when it comes sale-time the price will no doubt be reduced to a more reasonable one.  Thats just my opinion of course.			"

												This game has some interesting mechanics... i havn't played multiplayer yet and maybe that's just the strong part of the game; each one cop and then planning your raids over voicecomms...but the singleplayer has some flaws, though i was having fun the first hour into the game..If your play this game with a controller, like i did, the game controls quite good, but placing your fellow cop is somewhat a problem as you have this fixed radius around your in which you can place your partner... with a mouse you have 'free roaming' instead of this fixed circle, but kb/m plays not that well with the rest of the games mechanics.My biggest problem was not being able to switch characters, although this is a function and it would've saved me quite some deaths (your chars have a health meter; you can refill it by eating donuts that are spread around) as i was obligated to stay with the character that has low health to run into new rooms. If i was able to switch i would take the other char and run into the room with full health.Also you can switch weapons, but only on your active character, since you cannot change you have to let one die to get access to the weapons lying around for the other char... but then you revive your partner and he has his basic gun again and you cannot change that weapon again...so in my eyes this is a gamebreaker... fixing this would let me at least recommend the game for single player use; for multiplayer i can already recommend it, and it's best both players use a controller (x360) to play the game.

												If you want to play more Hotline Miami but already beat Hotline Miami 2 and you want the next thing to be a much inferior version with boring, done-a-hundred times jokes, a perspective that doesn't work with the gameplay because it basically makes you get stuck at every corner in the game and an AI-partner that's about as smart as a bag of hammers then LA Cops sure is the game for you.PS. The controls aren't good at all as they don't allow you to make any snap decisions.			"

												I really want to like this game but bad controls and unfinished mechanics try my patience too much. The aiming is sticky and terrible, and the awful 90s console shooter lock on doesn't help. Yes game, I *do* want to aim at the enemy behind a wall in the other room instead of the one right around the corner. There's some perverse enjoyment out of bumrushing thugs toting shotguns to arrest them, but it's not consistent when sometimes the AI just instantly turns around to shoot you in the face. I would have liked tracers (just so I can see where my shots are going) and the look ahead function that Hotline Miami - a game that isn't focused on guns - has because they'd actually be useful here. It would be more bearable with a friend, but sadly only local coop is an option. Don't buy this unless it's like 90% off or something.			"

												LA Cops is a game with simple, yet good and enjoyable mechanisms. The scenario isn't well written and makes no sense.Although in my opinion, the cutscenes are successful and really gives you the atmosphere you need. The gameplay itself is fast-paced and looks easy but if you do not plan your moves you'll find yourself hitting the 'retry level' button numeroustimes. LA Cops is a great game with a slice of 70's style...			"

Early Access Review
								I LOVE IT! It's a realtime squad based tactical shooter where you can switch between two different cops with the press of a button and the AI takes over the other to shoot but not move. This means you meove your cop into position and face him/her in a direction to cover a doorway or corner and then move the other cop into position, leapfrogging and so on. It makes for fun, tense situations and surprises. Occasionally panicked shootouts occur but most of the time you feel like a badass methodically moving through the building taking out bad guys with one shot. You can pick up their weapons, like shotguns, micro-uzi(semi auto), M79 thumper grenade launcher, M16 assault rifle, and more in the full game I believe. It plays like a combination between a top down/Iso version of Hitman meets Hotline Miami. In fact, It's a LOT like Hotline Miami with two switchable characters. It would be a ton of fun if it was co-op, which I am hoping they find a way to add. The art and music are great. The weapons are satisfying to shoot. The AI is pretty decent already with a few rare idiot moments like getting caught on a doorway, but good overall. The polish of design and mission structure is very good. Now for the bad.......there's not enough of it. Once again an early access game launches with not much more than a proof of concept. I love the game and look forward to it, but I'm not super comfortable with them charging $12 for 1 level of a game that may not get finished if sales aren't decent. I think developers(I am one) need to start being realistic about what they are asking of consumers. Don't ask us to pay full or even half price for a game with less content than a demo that may never be finished. This game once complete would be worth $14 to most of us at most. It will most likely live at $9.99 after it's first month on the market and I feel it should really be priced around that now. The one mission included, Level 5 of 9, has four stages and takes about 20 minutes to play through. I can see myself playing through maybe another 3 times if I get bored. That's an hour of gameplay. I spoke to the developer on the forums and they are awesome, open and friendly. They are not hiding anything and have been wonderful in everyway. It is for that reason that I don't regret my purchase and I can recommend the game to you all. The price is subjective.......great game, little content now.....your choice. They did say they hope to have monthly updates.  I can't wait for the full release.			"

												LA Cops is a strategy(?) game where you control two 70's stereotypes of cops at a time to kill all the criminals. After you get used to the controls, the game works pretty well, but if you're like me, the gameplay is really in the vein of ""where can I put the other CPU cop so that he kills everything for me"". If you really wanted to (and, if you were good at this game) you can finish it in an hour or two. Team 17 really does have a good sense of humor. If you've played any of the ""Worms"" games, you'll see that same sense of humor in THIS game. The real problem here, though, is that when that style of humor is dragged out over a sparse narrative with no substance, it gets stale VERY quickly. This game is fun. Don't get me wrong. So is tossing the dice in Craps. But if the stick-man is throwing out stale, tired tropes about craps at me the whole time I'm playing, I'm moving to another table. Pick up this game if you're looking to play something while something else is downloading. It's cheap, the gameplay is challenging enough to engage you for a little while, but there's nothing much there for you beyond that. That being said, I wish there was a button not to give a ""Yes"" or ""No"", but an ""If you've got some money to blow, and don't care about it"" button.			"

												I see a lot of negative reviews for this game, hell even the cynical brit himself gave it a slating during his wtf is section, but I think it's time I say what everyone is thinking; These people need to GIT GUD.There is nothing wrong with this ♥♥♥♥ing intense fast paced donut scoffing simulator!If you are dying all the time, level up, get some better guns, upgrade all your♥♥♥♥♥♥and see just how EASY normal mode is!I've played through the majority of the game already I just have the last level to do, and at the time of writing this I've spent a mere 2.8 hours in this glorious game and yet people have spent longer than I in the game than I have and can't get past the first level?!It's not that they can't,  it's that they need to rethink their tactics, synergise their weapon choices and even use below the belt tactics to make their bust.One example from total biscuits  video was when he placed the AI partner in line with a door ready to shoot enemies as they come through, he leaves the partner in direct line with the doorway, therefore he will get gunned down because he is in a vulnerable position, now if he had been placed to the side of the door  he would have less chance of being spotted and his cone of fire would be directed where it needs to be, with a Shotgun equipped this is lethal! I'm sure there is plenty else people do wrong, but once you can pass level 1, replay it arresting 3 or 4 of the perps to get an A grade, that's 4 XP points, each tree is 20 points so you need to do a fair few runs to reach max level, but it's worth it because you will one shot most npcs on normal mode with a pistol.I think this game is awesomeSoundtrack 5/5Game play 4/5Graphics 4/5Storyline 3/5It's a short game for sure, but I like the challenge of beating each level on increasing difficulty and maxing every characters stats.

												LA Cops ReviewPublisher: Team17 Digital LtdDeveloper: Modern DreamRelease Date: March 13, 2015GraphicsThe graphics in this game are quite good overall, with clean 3D looks, and retro 70’s feel this game nails it. One of the biggest flaws that I noticed was in certain rooms the floor had lines that confused me and looked like walls, causing me to get shot. The destruction is nice with particles when objects and NPC’s get shot, and colors are bright and vibrant. With a steady 60FPS occasionally dropping to mid 50’s during cut scenes, the overall look and feel of this game is very good.GameplayThis is a very well playing top down game, it is a quick game to pick up and learn, and the tutorial is very fast and easy. The game is fairly well balanced but occasionally an enemy who is faced the opposite way will turn around and kill you immediately. The lock on system is easy to use and works well, but I find it unnecessary as it is smoother to just point and aim.The mini-map is pointless, made small and shoved into the corner, I find myself forgetting it’s even there. The weapons are well balanced and designed. The NPC is either half brain dead or Einstein, when it comes to finding where you are. The missions and cut scenes are funny and entertaining enough to keep me enjoying the game. Overall the game is quite enjoyable and is very funny, but is not very entertaining the second time around.ControlsThe controls are decent, with the aiming and lock-on system being this games forte. The viewing controls are great with easy to use zooming and rotation of the camera, it is easy to see big parts of the map so that you can plan out your next move. The only thing I didn’t care for was the movement system, the WASD movement system is setup in a way that W is always up and accordingly for the other keys. Normally in a top-down this is no problem at all, but this game’s maps are oriented very diagonally making it challenging to move in the way you want to, leaving you vulnerable and open to enemy fire.StoryThe story is funny and entertaining, with the cut scenes being my favorite parts, this will keep you intrigued though the whole story. With a theme of 70’s cops in LA doing crazy jobs from hold ups to drug deals, and music to match, the story is very well laid out. My only complaint being that it is a very short 8 levels.AchievementsWith only 13 quick and easy achievements, the game seemed somewhat short. Though a few were a challenge to get.Overall Overall, I think this was a very fun and entertaining game, with good graphics and a well thought out story, I found this to be quite a good game. With an original purchase price of $14.99 on Steam, I would wait to get a sale on the game as I don’t feel it is wholly worth that price. "

												Playing from start to finish all in one day, I have to say it's a really mixed experience. Let's break it down shall we=======The Good=======- Idea/ Theme - The idea of playing a old style L.A cop in a top down shooter is a interesting idea. - Graphics - I do enjoy the graphics/looks of it, it's not over the top and doesn't feel awkard or painful to look at. Some might see this different but I do enjoy the look of it=======The bad=======- Friendly A.I - Having played this on the most recent version at the time of this review, I have to say the A.I is still bad, my partner can only shoot within a radius about maybe 5m in a cone shape, if he is shot from behind he will take forever to turn around leading to his death. If a enemy is using a rifle and stands just outside the cone he will kill my partner. If my partner is in a tight corner of a room, he will get stuck and won't return fire if the enemy is in his face. I was hoping with the leveling system that the more you level the better radius my partner can see, better reaction and so forth...sadly that isn't here and most times I find I have to hide my partner and use them whenever I need a quick heal. - Enemy A.I - The enemy A.I is 50/50 sometimes they will shoot through a corner that even you don't have the angle to shoot from, they sometimes get stuck on doors, blindly charge to your location (was hoping they would take cover or call for help or something) and sometimes they don't shoot even if they are 2 steps away (found that when they have the grenade launcher they just charge until they are 1 step away from you...it's rather strange.- Civillans - Down the road you will meet some friendly npcs however they just run around screaming asking for help, I found myself charging them to secure them hoping to put cuffs on them or escort them out so they are both out of my way and score maybe some points...I found this doesn't exist and most missions I find the enemy shooting through them without damaging the civillans meanwhile they would eat my bullets and charging me -200 points on my score.  They become annoying as you want to avoid shooting them but find yourself in the position of saying hell with it and killing everyone in sight just to be over with it. -Combat/Controls- Sometimes I found aiming and shooting not responding correctly. I was aiming at one enemy close range and my character somehow aimed above the enemy's head and at a bookcase behind him...this is even using the lock on feature and having a max character. I find this happening a few times throughout my playthrough.======The Mix======- Story - It's ok for what it is but didn't feelt excited or interested really- Missions - the missions are rather straight forward, you have 8 story plus a few extra side missions, this you can blow through pretty fast especially if your a hotline player as you will find this so much easier to fly through. If you haven't then you might face some trouble now and then at certain points but it's very easy to get by once you figure out the routine and camping spots. Most missions within the story are clear, hold out and destroy a few items with the odd boss now and then. - Leveling system - Neat to have a little leveling system in which you improve your character's speed , damage and even loadout. However you can't hold a secondary weapon when carrying a large weapon, I found this annoying as most police type games will allow you to carry a secondary and primary helping solve ammo issues. Not sure why they choose this way but I found myself running into large rooms of enemy and running out of ammo forcing to charge with the melee attack...oh yeah they be afraid of my handcuffs alright :P=====Overall=====It's something neat to play around with or if your wanting some quick easy achievements however I would wait for a sale as there isn't much replay value, I know the devs have been adding improvements and adding missions but at the moment and with most players coming from Hotline, they will feel like this is nothing and burn through the content way too fast to make it worth the full price.

												Your greatest enemy will be the controls.The idea is great.. however...1. Sometimes enemies will ignore a gunshot right next to them, while at other times a single shot will sent all opponents piling into the same room as you.2. Enemies can shoot you from outside the screen and their range is far greater than that of your AI partner.3. The view makes it hard to know when you've lined up a shot correctly, especially given the hectic pace of game-play. 4. The story excerpts are completely unrelated to the game-play or each other.5. There are some clipping issues where you can shoot repeatedly and have your shots be absorbed into the corner you're hiding behind, while the opponent you are targeting takes the same shot and kills you instantly.

Posted: August 30, 2015
												 LA Cops is basically Hotline Miami, with a partner - which is a great premise! Unfortunately I didn't find the game fun at all for several reasons. Let's do the good stuff first. The game looks and sounds great, the presentation is spot on and the writing is fun. The game is a Hotline Miami clone with an isometric view, with the addition of a second character you can give limited orders to and swap over when you're shot down, which adds a lot to the run and gun formula when it works. As for the bad... The AI is atrocious and worse still, completely inconsistent. Enemies tend to walk in slow circles, grinding stoically against walls until they complete their trajectory. They walk by obliviously by downed and arrested comrades, and sometimes they miss a gunfight going on in the same room. But sometimes they don't, and come running from a couple of rooms over. Similarly, you can issue your partner an order to stand by, and she'll fire at anything that comes into her line of sight - the problem is you can position her, but you can't tell her were to aim, so it often takes a lot of fiddling to set up an ambush (which is one of the things that would make the game awesome if it worked properly). The isometric presentation is also a huge problem. There's a reason why Hotline Miami is top-down, and this game illustrates that beautifully. Lining up shots is a huge pain; I think you're meant to rely on the lock-on option, but that also causes problems, since its implementation basically sucks. Instead of sticking to the enemy closest to your reticle, it... well, it seems to do whatever the hell it wants to. Which usually means that while a maniac is running at you with a shotgun, you're stuck aiming at an oblivious target through two walls. The stylized presentation also often makes lines of sight unclear - is this grey gap rubble or a hole in the floor? can enemies see me through this? Finally, technical issues galore! From the off I had a ton of problems - the game doesn't run fullscreen at my 16:10 monitor resolution, The key to swap partners just doesn't work, ""kill x number of enemy"" achievements got stuck for me and my DS4 controller just won't work properly with it (the first game I've had problems with.) All of these may be due to a problem on my end, and the sort of thing I'd forgive an indie game for. Still, doesn't help. If it feels I'm bringing up Hotline Miami too much, well, this game makes no bones about being indebted to it. But in trying to imitate (what I consider) a masterpiece, LA Cops shows just how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ talent and thought went into creating its inspiration. In HM... well, I won't say all deaths always feel fair, but they are always fun; not so here. I stuck with the game, trying to enjoy it, until timed missions and ""monster closets"" made their appearance, and enemies became a bit more bullet-spongey. At which point I gave up; And it's a shame, because I really wanted to like it. Well, crap. I hate giving an indie game a bad review. As always with this sort of thing, this is just my opinion, I might just be crap at the game, etc. etc. However, if you're still tempted do have in mind that unless the last couple of missions are way larger than the first six or so, the game is pretty light on content. (I wasn't able to play the game with a controller. Who knows, maybe the game works a lot better with one? Also, the game has co-op, which may again make it worthwhile.)			"

												So I wrote an epic, character-maximum screed against this game (which I truncated here to save face). Let's just say it's yet another mostly broken, half-finished, completely unsupported game on Steam. Not worth $3.99 on sale and an absolute crime at $14.99 retail (I mean this, games like this should be held libel for consumer fraud). Honestly, this is worse than Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust (also from the same publisher), which is already considered one of the worst games ever. This thing looks and plays like Superman 64 so if you're looking for a Hotline Miami clone, this ain't it, bud. Not by any strech... It's all the aspects of that game done horribly wrong and backwards. Like HM, the game itself is hard and unforgiving, but only because it's so badly designed not because of any logical design schemes.Oh and good luck getting the controls to respond or trying to make it to the midway point without constant crashing. I tried this out on 3 systems and Windows 10 was the worst of the bunch. My playtime should be of no indication (5+ hours), since I've play this only out of sick fascination (it's seriously one of the worst games I've ever played) and to show game developer friends of what NOT to do while designing a game. Also, there's a self-aggrandizing YouTube documentary from the developer, Modern Dream, who cry actual tears while waxing watery sentiments with their head up their♥♥♥♥♥♥about what it means to be an indie game developer. Apparently it means ripping off end-users on your crap, buggy game to in order to pay for your high overhead. Companies like this should be shamed out of existence. Good on ya, guys. Thanks for adding more Steamy♥♥♥♥♥♥to the pile.Bonus: It seems the developer are from Leamington Spa in the UK aka the birthplace of both Shakespeare and the punk band, The Varukers. Good things, both! So I figure I might hire some local crust punks to recite Shakespeare's least-respected play, Titus Andronicus in it's entirety via megaphone (its theme is vengeance!) while throwing expired Chinese food ordered from FU Garden (a real takeout restaurant in Leamington) at everyone who worked on this game. Someone wanna start a Kickstarter? Let's make this happen.Also, there's no way in hell the positive reviews on here are legit. Just sayin'.			"

												Well, after owning this game for about just under a year, I thought it was time to give some feedback... LA Cops isn't bad, BUT it isn't fantastic YET either. The game has always shown some promise, but it has took it's time proving it. I'm a big fan of top-down shooters - my all time favourite being Hotline Miami, as well some road-based ones, like Death Skid Marks. LA Cops is the soul definition of Early Access. I owned this when it was fresh in development, and it has improved alot! It's mechanics are greatly improved. At one point of owning it, I thought the developers had bailed! But thankfully, I was mistaken. :)I'm going to give the game a thumbs up, because I have seen this improvement for myself, gameplay and it's coding (achievements FINALLY working...). But it does have a long way to go. Namely depth of story, charm and some polishing up with smoothness of gameplay. It's no Hotline Miami, but then again, nothing ever will be. And who's to say the team behind this even want to be a clone of HM?! Anyway, here's some words of warning...Buy this at your own risk - afterall, it's an early access game! What are you expecting? A game in development to run before it can walk?Buy this game on a price drop - this saves your own disappointment, if you buy this on discount and don't enjoy it, well it's better than being £11 down, at least you got it for less.And finally, simply way and see. The game has had some bad press, and negative reviews on here, but you never know what's next! But don't say I didn't warn you.Here's my best selling point. LA Cops = Beastie Boys ""Sabotage"" - The Game.			"

								This game is once again not my normal type of game but it was fun game to play.They capture the 70's theme very nicely and cut sence are nicely done, the AI are always different the 3D top down style does take a bit of getting used to and once you do it is easy to play.It is early access but the game has gotten some updates over its time and they are still in the process of doing more updates, the game comes with good amount of level's with more to come.I recommend this game on the fact its funny and it is a challenge to play.

Early Access Review
								I have clicked recommend button, but I do have a few issues after playing the Early Access. I like the overall theme to this game, and I like top down games but I feel the camera angles could use some working, even with the player rotating it, I feel the isometric isn't working on the angle its on and causes cheap deaths. With this kind of game, I think they should either go with a hotline miami top down view or change the gameplay to an xcom turned based style game. There is a mix between the 2 since you can set up your 2nd cop to auto shoot anyone in his line of site but then it just makes it cheap as he never seems to miss.I also feel like you should be able to kick the doors in, I mean you ARE cops!Obviously, this is an early build. I am intrigued to see how it goes at launch but for now I feel like the game hasn't found the right balance yet to achieve me feeling like a bad♥♥♥♥♥cop out of old school miami vice. "

Early Access Review
								This is just one level out of eight but already you can see that the game will be fun. It's very much like Hotline Miami just with 3d graphics and two characters which makes the game a bit more tactical.  I hope dev will go the 'tactical' path and add more stances, cover system and maybe like add automatic action system for the inactive player? It really Early Access. To be honest it's as early as you can get ;) I would say if you really like Hotline Miami and 70' cops theme and like to find bugs and maybe have an active role in game development then go for it. If not then just wait for more content and see what direction the devs will go.Here you can see a simple playthrough and see game mechanics:

								Even though the game is early it is fantastic and I cannot wait to dive deeper into this beast. The brutality reminds of Syndicate mixed with Hotline Miami with a 70's cop movie or TV show. Graphically it took me off guard because I thought isometric strategy but it isn't that at all! You can rotate the camera and the game plays real time. You can position one cop and control the other to create surprise attacks for the enemy. I played with my XBOX360 controller and once I had figured out the controls it felt smooth. Also the character names and designs are pure gold. The AI is good for an early build as well. If it manages to get co-op then it will be a gem for sure! Keep your eye on this.Also keep your eyes peeled on www.pixelswithoutborders.co.uk for a full review when the game is released!			"

Early Access Review
								Original Review still at the bottom, but I had only one gripe with the game. It was too short. But the Devs have quickly fixed this within a month, and now there is some 5 20min levels. The game itself is amazing. You control 2 cops, move them both around and all, by switching in between them at will. The gameplay is satisfiying,the story is kinda...weird, but the levels are all great and will make you want to play them again and again.Also, the game has tons of nostolgia behind it. Plenty of referances Hawaii 5-0, Batman, and old TV shows, which, to this day, I enjoy more then anything else. This game is a must buy for 70's cop show lovers, and if you're not, well, wait for a sale or just buy it right away, because,well,its pretty goodIts short, maybe 30 mins. But god its brilliant. Spot on gameplay, amazing music, and its just...brilliant...That being said, the reason I gave it a thumbs down is because it will only last 30 mins at most. If your looking for a game to hold you off until Hotline 2, this is it. Just wait a bit longer. $12 is a lot for 30 minsOk, ill post this here again.Chuck G Nukem Givn awy Hitmn Abs Just now  @AronI know that. And as I said to foxyshadis, the second that this game gets one more level, I will update this review to a thumbs up. I love the game, its a game version of Hawaii 5-0, and cmon, who wouldnt love that(One of the guys names is even williams) BUTI want people to see that as of this date, the game has 30mins-1hr. Aron 7 hours ago  Hey there, thanks for the review. I'm an animator on this team and just wanted to chime in and mentioned that while the early access version is only 1 level, the full version is 8 levels, so there is a lot more content than 30 mins. There's hours of fun to be had! Chuck G Nukem Givn awy Hitmn Abs Aug 1 @ 10:16pm  Delete@foxshadisEven so, i'm reviewing the game as is. The second they add another level or two, I will update this game and give it a thumbs up. But I want to people to realize-At this date, 8/1/14, there is one level in the game. foxyshadis Aug 1 @ 8:57pm  Their statement says that the main priority for the final game is making more levels.The above is the reason I gave it a thumbs down. I love the game, but there isn't much game here. As soon as they add another level, I will update this review and give it a thumbs up			"

												Don't get me wrong, I have really enjoyed this game. Art style, shooting mechanics, and characters are on point; but, there are a few quibbles that I have with this game. The controls, and switiching between them, is a bit groggy and either control set makes the menus very hard to navigate. The XP system is largely flawed as well. Some one can constantly mine the first mission until they have a fully upgraded chsracter, making the rest of the game too easy and repetitive. I really want to reccomend this game more but this seemingly easy fixes that havent been fixed are holding me back. I will reccomend it none-the-less  because of all the potential it has and to send a message to other developers that topdown shooters like this should be made more often.			"

								This is what Hotline Miami shouldve been. THis has so much potential and I cant wait to see the additional levels. Before buying I was aware that there were only two levels available and I made the decision to purchase to help support the further development. Normally I hate top-down shooters. But when they are done right - and this is done right - then they can be great fun. If they continue to expand on the game and not screw up the best attributes then this will be firmly set in its place as one of history's few truly awesome top-down shooter/strategy games.			"
