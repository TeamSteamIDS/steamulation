												This game is weird, silly, overly long, and one of my favorites ever. I really enjoy the turn-based battles and the different ways you can use your troops. The writing is weird and funny and actually really great. Your protagonist basically likes everybody and is willing to go on super random quests just because some random lizardman/skeleton/orc/witch/whatever asked her to.  although at one point she does call an owl a ""stupid chicken"", which for some reason made me laugh for five straight minutesHighly Recommended.

												Remember the sudden emptyness that lurks into your mind and heart when the newfound relationship with great book or amazing game reaches it's end? This is exactly what happened to me when I have finished King's Bounty: The Legend. The game was not perfect, but I have grown fond of her and did not nearly have enough. At that moment I had to have more, so I have taken up on Armored Princess.After finally finishing the installation and starting the game a feeling of familiarity spreads inside me. However the game is little too familiar. How would it not be when it uses the same engine as The Legend and changes only little. Developers went as far as to using the same models and pieces of artwork as in The Legend. As you have probably guessed, the first impression was not one of the best. However do not let appearences fool you, the important thing is here. New challenges, locations and even few units.The story continues few years after the happenings from The Legend, where you have (have you?) succesfully saved the World from demon invasion. However peace was soon to fade, after the hero left to seek adventure in other dimensions, demon army have returned with newfound strenght. At this point you take control of princess Amelie and set on a quest to find the old hero and bring him back. Same as in The Legend, story provides nice background to the exploring and fighting, developers follow the example set in The Legend and provide you with plenty of texts and bits of humor.So should you get the game or not? If you are new to the series I would first grab either The Legend  so that you can follow up on story, but it is not necessary. And if you have played The Legend and liked it, you should definitely get it, because it takes everything that was good on The Legend and adds some polish.			"

												This game is really quite charming-- cute colorful graphics, nice animations-- but also fairly challenging. It's turn-based combat, more like Civ than any RPG. You can run five creatures at any time; you'll have your favorites, but as you have to buy replacements and the supply varies by region, you'll end up trying quite a few different fighters.  (It might be overwhelming if you had to learn them all at once, but you get introduced to them region by region.)  It's very satisfying to win a battle with no losses.  King's Bounty seems to be largely remaking the game every couple of years... the next game, Warriors of the North, is very very similar to this one.  Given that, might as well go with Amelie who is more fun than the barbarian hero of the other game.			"

												I took a chance buying this game as I had never played any of the franchise, I am glad I did. It plays much like Might and Magic in terms of the view and interaction with gold,Treasure and packs of monsters. The graphics are better and has a good soundtrack. The difference between this and M&M is the use of castles and keeps. The castles here are really places to recrui different types of monsters or soldiers, you dont upgrade elements of it during gameplay this game is more bout the battles. You can also run around the map as much as you like as there are no turns during exploration only during combatcombat follows a turn based approach where it goes into a grid mode and you move and attack then the enemy does the same, The game is a much faster paced game than the might and magic franchise and looks great.Thoroughly enjoying it			"

												It's a good strategy game for those, who like challanges. I'll make my review positive only for that, because I don't like this sequel. Here is why: the overall story is really bad.When I say bad, I mean REALLY BAD. The dialogs are cranky and jokes mostly based on the fact that the main character is a woman. Isn't that bad enough for you? Well, remember that box full of guardians you had in The Legend, which was so much powerfull back up for the main plot? Here you got a pet dragon! Yeah, you get him RIGHT on the beggining a-and... nothing. It's just same box, but looks like a dragon. No dialogs, no cool sense of something awesome (because you always can have a dragon or two in your army... i mean, seriously, just a dragon?). Yeah it's cute, so if you like ponies or something you can get the fun of it (before he become grown up).So I'd better buy The Legend again and play it one more time (plus to another 2 times i played it before). I still return to this game sometimes to fight the battle or two, but I can do it by playing HoMM3 with my friend, which is more preferable.			"

												This is an old school turn based RPG game.The storyline isnt going to knock your socks off but the gameplay will.  There are many different tactics to win battles even within one class and there are 3 to choose from.How you build your army often dictates your tactics and vice versa.  The locations of items and spells are random so you wont always get the same items or spells available making it a very different game every time you play it.The only downside to me is once you get deeply immersed and want to get the best score or go for a no loss playthrough then you do have to adopt an element of cheesyness like running past encounters to get access to better items and armies.  But the game has already got you by the balls at that point.  Enjoy.For people who have Kings bounty I liked the improvements they made with this sequel.  The classes are a lot more balanced out and the rage system improved.Oh and crossworlds is essentially this game with a lot of extras so if you can afford that I would recommend getting that as well rather than think of buying it later.

												Intriguing and elegant in art and storyline. I truly was captured by the beginning of this, especially with the concept of an Amult of Time being shattered and a village being shielded while an Archdeamon attacks it. Once you learn the controls, and there is a small curve, it becomes tedious with a lot of battling (if you don't use cheats). There are multiple fetch quests that take away from your primary mission of finding a friend and saving your village, more so than Final Fantasy, and none of the side quests relate to the storyline and barely connect other NPCs. Battle... I didn't like... Most of the time it was chess with different types of characters, but I pushed through it and once enabling cheats, it was more of a ""how long can I play this until I realize I dont like this series anymore?"" Got this on sale, I would suggest if you're into these types of games, do the same.			"

												Played the first one on Sega megadrive. I still like the turnbased style. However, I installed this one and The Legend, both crashed instantly. After searching what the problem was, I had to manually fix it and now it works fine. Don't know why 1C hasn't fixed that stupid crash.For the people that have the same problem, the game ini, shows resolution in 0, so it can't startup., manually change it to something small, 1024 by 1280 and it will start. Then you can fix the resolution to normal in the game.This line:setf ~screenresoultionx 0setf ~screenresoultiony 0The camera/movement control is a bit annoying at times, other than that nice game.

												The Good: Pretty graphics, addictive and fun combat with varied spells, skills, and troops, many islands to explore, large unit varietyThe Bad: Impossibly difficult early on, running around the entire world to restock is tedious, having to exploit the game and scrounging isn't fun at all, mediocre storyArmored Princess is a fairy tale game of a princess who gets sent back in the past to awaken Teana (mother Earth in a way) to help stop an evil force that will destroy the world. You are also trying to find a man named Bill Gilbert along the way who plays a key role. To awaken Teana you needs 7 stones that are scattered across a few islands. Of course this involves a few boss fights and many battles. Armored Princess is extremely difficult to the point that 90% of the people who play will uninstall it after you get off the first island. This game is brutal on any difficult other than easy and using the warrior class.The problem with Armored Princess is that it requires too much grinding. For a turn based strategy this is expected, but this one goes way too far. You need leadership points to increase your mass unit capacity. Each unit requires a different amount of leadership. You also need gold to buy them, and the problem is this comes way too slowly. You either need to be able to level up quicker or enemies need to be scaled back. You run around the world in real time collecting things in between battles like leadership points, runes for acquiring skills, gold, units, scrolls, and other items. Some enemies roam around the world and some are blocking loot. You can right-click on the unit to see how you will fare against it. Enemies that are very weak compared to you will run away and you can end the battle by just letting them go. Enemies that are all the way up to invincible are impossible to kill. You need to level up and acquire more powerful troops. Sounds simple right? Not at all.The problem started after leaving Debir, the first island. I was killed very quickly no matter what strategy I used. You can buy more units but they are in limited stock. Once you buy them all out that's it for that location through the whole game. You have to wander around the islands finding stores that sell these. Most units are pretty useless such as horde units. You can have over 1,000 but each unit only does 2-3 damage. They also get killed very easily and are just a waste of gold. So, I found myself running around exploiting the game trying to scrounge up what leadership points I could find, scrolls, gold, and anything else I could get. This is not fun one bit. I don't want to inch up behind a roaming enemy just to get 70 leadership which can get me one lousy unit. Even if you find all leadership flags on every island it isn't enough. You have to level up and buy equipment to get a lot of leadership. At one point you can fly around which means you won't run into enemies, but you can only travel to other islands by your ship.Battles are really fun and addictive and that is what kept me going. All the units are very unique with awesome abilities. You also get a dragon that sits off on the side of the battlefield that can use it's abilities. You also have a spellbook that allows you to cast one spell per turn. Enemies move around the hexagonal grid and attack. You eventually learn what units are good against others. The more units you have stacked the more damage they do. Yellow numbers are overall damage total and the red are the amount of units in that group that has been killed. It feels great when one of your groups can knock out a large one from the enemy. There are things that block parts of the grid off that you have to walk around, as well as neutral obstacles that will attack the troops or give them passive defensive abilities. Battles are just so much fun and become really addictive, but how you level up your character and choosing the right troops are key to winning.That is if you win any battles at all at one point. Being forced to do side quests to level up to earn leadership and gold is just a real pain. Several times I wanted to give up because it was so unfair. I would wipe out all the armies that were equal in strength to me and lower. I would level up a bit, scour the islands for weaker enemies, rinse and repeat for 50-60 hours. It does get tedious and boring after a while because this is all you do. When you finally level up enough to get  stones you feel like you are finally making progress. In all honesty, 1C should have just made you a bit more powerful and allowed you to level up faster or something. The whole scrounging thing was just insanely annoying and difficult. It doesn't help that if you run from a battle you lose your entire army. If you are wiped out you start off at Debir castle with a few lousy units. What if that one powerful unit was the last at that store? Where am I going to find another one? Who knows. There are dozens and dozens of stores spread out and that one powerful unit could be anywhere.There also aren't any extremely powerful troops overall. They only become powerful in quantity. There are troops that you can only have a few of like Red Dragons, Ancient Ents, Ogres, Golems, and other large troops. I wanted to see a few one unit troops that were extremely powerful. The troop availability is also random so you never know what you are going to get. I just found going from island to island after each battle to restock just got tiresome.The story itself is mediocre with the typical text-based fairy tale adventure of elves and orcs and dwarves. You won't remember the story a year from now, but it is entertaining while you are playing. I just with this game wasn't impossibly difficult because it makes it not fun. Most people will result to cheating using the console command to acquire levels and leadership. When you get to a high enough level the game is fun, but until then you will struggle and probably quit.~Score: 7.5/10			"

												The King's Bounty series is a series that fell under the radar but deserves some attention. It's a well-balanced series that is extremely fun and addicting, offering a blend of strategy and RPG that just falls together really well. If you like Heroes of Might and Magic III and you enjoy RPGs, you are very likely to enjoy this game. It falls in the category of games that are very niche but is quite beloved by those who are the target audience.			"

												Just going to point out the armored princess doesn't wear pants. Moving on.Great turn based strategy/tactics play. Can be challenging but definitely rewards the player for thinking things through. If you like turn based games then definitely give this game a look. Just don't look too long. Since the protaganist lacks pants and all.			"

												At first when i saw the previews for the game i thought to myself ""This game looks really lame not really my kind of game"" So before bought it i downloaded the demo. Man was i so wrong about this game being lame. I enjoyed it so much that i bought it a few hours after i got the demo. This game is very fun and addicting. I highly recommend this. The game has a RPG/RTS Feel to it. I normaly don't like most RTS games, but this game does well and for being a turn base game. This is one of those 'Hidden treasure' games.			"

												Took me a while to get into this, but I am addicted. I am a huge fan of tactical rpg's like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics, so I bought this in the hope it would sate my need for a new game of that genre. I think it did the trick. The learning curve was kind of frustrating, as this game seems to be pretty difficult. There are cheats, though I tried not to use them (they made me feel dirty). The story is pretty 'meh' from what I have experienced, but I have mostly just been clicking through all the dialogue, hungry for battle. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to any fan of the tactical rpg genre. I would also suggest playing it for at least 3 hours before judging the game. I will definitely be playing more from this cult series.			"

												An easygoing, brutally immersive RTS/RPG which will suck hours of your life which would have otherwise gone to such ephemeral concepts like ""work"" and ""family"". My only complaints are the hideous difficulty cliff experienced after leaving the first island, and the fact that the heroine has her boobs out everywhere. On the other hand, the fact that the main character is female and you cannot choose a male is so amazingly rare that it kind of balances out.			"

												This is one of those rare occassions where an IP bought by a third party ends up in the creation of some fantastic games. Faithful to the old King's Bounty and Heroes of Might and Magic games, great music, tons of stuff to do, meticulously crafted environments and enemy placement, and quite a challenge at the harder difficulties.Crossworlds is not that great of an expansion to Armored Princess. The new Orcs and the adrenaline system feel tacked on as the three classes have little to benefit them as they do for the other units in the game. Balance is stil a bit of an issue. The mage is still the best class in the game (although not nearly as broken as in The Legend), dwarven units are far too strong, and the upper tier human units still feel somewhat invulnerable. Still, there's little reason not to get all three games (The Legend, Armored Princess, Crossworlds) if you're thinking of picking up what is probably a swan song to New World Computing's classic.

												King's Bounty: Armored Princess is a pretty good SPRG which unfortunately suffers from balancing issues.  These issues may only be early game (or maybe not) and they may have been resolve in Crossroads (I didn't find out Crossroads was a rebalance and extension of the base game until many hours into my playthrough).  On my first playthrough I started on normal and cleared the first island.  Upon exploring the second and third islands I found out every single encounter was rather at the top two difficulties - the fights would have been nearly impossible for me.  I restarted on easy.  On easy, 75% of the encounters in the entire game were probably rated easy.  To say the least, there wasn't much of a challenge ... but I still enjoyed the game.7/10			"

												The King's Bounty series is one of the most addictive, under-rated games I have ever played. It takes the concept that Heroes of Might and Magic started and blows it away. Customizability, an RPG feel with multiple quest endings and various ways to build your hero, and the shackles of Turn Based play torn off with a real-time system all rolled into one attractive looking package. Day and Night cycles are an added bonus. Plenty of units gives you a plethora of style choices in how you make your army, an endless supply of items to customize to your style of play, upgradable items where you have to battle it's inner ""Guardians"" to boost their powers, set items, and even a growing pet dragon? BOSS!Top it all off with the fact that it is much more affordable that Heroes ever was, and this is a must-have for any fan of the RPG Hero vs Hero strategic war genre. Tonnes of play time + huge replay value = Win.Dear Heroes of Might and Magic. You are now obsolete. Thank you that is all.			"

												Real-time Heroes of Might & Magic clone with less focus on castle defense and more RPG elements. Very derivative but has a long main quest with a large world map. More exploration and plot-heavy than HoMM, but not much else is original about it. Armored Princess has a lot of new features so I'd recommend just getting this one over the original since they're almost the same game. Completely average and muddled with uneven difficulty, this might be worth picking up if you're a fan of HoMM.			"

												Esto va pa la serie entera de King's bounty.El juego en si promete, pero que va, nunca logre entrarle. La historia es pobre, no hay mucho que sacarle tons no me senti metido en el juego. Si si, yo soy un mops nuevo y el mae malo esta haciendo un desmadre tons saco pecho y se las parto. El mae malo mato a todos los maes bravos, tons me mandaron a mi de arma secreta: super pollo. No funca.Jugar en si es divertido por un ratico, pero se pone tonto muy rapido. Todos los combates son la misma vara en otro mapa. Uy! Este es un calabozo! Uy este esta afuera! No tiene efecto alguno aparte de verse distinto.La verdad no jugue mucho porque nunca me atrapo, me aburri rapidito. Cuando uno tiene que hacer un esfuerzo pa jugar el juego mas a ver si le gusta, pues fallonazo. Prefiero usar ese tiempo en otra vara que ya me atrapo.			"

												King's Bounty is a suprisingly lavish production: an entire, non-linear world to explore, filled to the brim with vast armies to fight.  Its turn-based gameplay is surprisingly deep and varied, and in between battles you have the freedom to explore the map and hunt for treasure. It has addictive RPG mechanics and dozens of hours of playtime. Its story is grand, although it is told primarily through text. It's beautifully designed and fun to play. There are also drawbacks though. The game doesn't do a good job explaining its systems. Figuring out morale, leadership and stacking can be a challenge. My biggest problem was with the blatant misogyny in the story though. In the world of King's Bounty, women are defined by what men want from them. Quests involve saving women, changing their appearance to make them suitable lovers, giving them gifts and proving their suitor's worth, more than once even convincing women to give their misogynistic stalkers another chance (or optionally, kidnapping them). The relationships in the game are possessive, superficial, and even abusive. The player can not intervene, only support them or choose to remain neutral (which costs you). Even the protagonist, Princess Amelie, has to convince her father to let her save the world by either pouting or throwing a tantrum. After she saves the world from demons, she is effectively told that her primary duty is to marry and have kids. The game does not critique this nor allow the player to critique it. It's even part of the gameplay: female warriors can have the 'beautiful' stat which causes men to miss them, Amelie can wear dresses into battle, and in one of the standalone expansions, you can pick a wife and her babies will give you bonuses. Women in KBAP are shown as shallow, greedy, treacherous and dependent wretches. Those who are supposed to be sympathetic are obedient martyrs. But I guess the cover gives it away: Amelie's 'armor' is obviously designed with something other than battle in mind. So, good game, but so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up that I'm not going to recommend it. Yes, I think sexism is a bigger concern than whether games are good.			"

												In Kingâs Bounty: Armored Princess you take on the role of Princess Amelie in a time period set after âThe Legendâ in which the previous hero left to seek out other worlds and find new treasures. In the heroâs absence, the demon Baal invades your world in an act of revenge (for being banished by the hero in the previous game) and through a slight accident, you are sent to another world instead of the royal advisor. Upon arriving there, you discover that you are the prophesized daughter of the gods and are tasked with retrieving 7 stones scattered across various islands. Gameplay in Armored Princess is very similar to âThe Legendâ and returning players will find the new changes very easy to adapt to. Instead of a chest of rage with 4 spirits, you now get a single dragon who learns a slew of different special abilities. Also unlike the chest of rage, the dragon is actually useful throughout the entire game except for boss battles, where dragon use is disabled. Another new addition is the use of âwandererâ magic, spells that can be cast on the world map that give you a buff lasting a set number of battles.I found the gameâs interpretation of risk, where enemy armies are ranked by their leadership, to be very misleading as some heroes that had ranks of âimpossibleâ or âlethalâ late game were pretty much a pushover for easy XP and gold. Had I realized this sooner I probably could have shaved another ten hours off my playthrough. Additionally, the game seemed kind of small with its âbuffet tableâ style of serving up different locales across an archipelago (compared to the huge areas in the previous game). There are also various graphical glitches and typos throughout the game, and some of the writing is a bit hackneyed.That being said, Armored Princess is a fun-enough sequel to âThe Legendâ and is worth picking up, especially since it frequently goes on sale for less than $5!

												As a long-time Heroes of Might and Magic III/IV fan, I really enjoyed this game.I actually liked it more, because I prefer the tactical battles (tactical RPG) to strategy.There are some issues:1. On normal difficulty, the game is quite tough. 2. It's quite possible to get stuck. E.g., the first time I played, I eventually ran out of money. Also, you need to advance in rank to handle more difficult adversaries. However, there's no way to level-grind and there's a limited number of adversaries.  I'd suggest playing once for 5-10 hours, figure out a few things, read a guide, then start over. When you start over, get a good troop mix and try winning with no losses.3. I had my user directory on a network drive. The save functionality did not work well. Avoid that.			"

												That's a actually great sequel for the first game, even though I strongly advise you to read about the classes before actually choosing one to play. Since we're at it, while in the first game the mage was one of the best choices, here in Armored Princess it's the hardest class ever. If you don't wanna have a headache, I'd say go for the warrior class, it's always a safe bet. As for the ""special powers"", instead of having a Rage Box, this time you're gonna have your own personal dragon to assist you on your quest. There're plenty of troops for you to choose, many special items and countless side quests as well. Either way, if you're not really a games collector nor you're purchasing the whole franchise's pack, I strongly advise you to get the ""Crossworlds"" version instead of this one alone, as it comes with this game included and also an expansion for it. Have fun!			"

												The game focuses on somewhat repetitive, but nevertheless addictive, battles. There is a lot of mildly aggravating back-and-forth time spent finding units available for hire to replenish one's troops, as well as finding enemy parties weak enough to assault without taking catastrophic losses.Although the story is not the focus of the game, I enjoyed the writing. There is a sarcasm and a cynicism about government authority and an irreverent sense of humor throughout. The story comes satisfyingly full-circle in the end, with a victory of the now fully-developed hero over the enemy who had threatened destruction in the beginning of the game.Though the plot is almost entirely devoid of choices, and the player ought to accept and complete as many quests as possible along the way in order to level-up, there is room in the selection of units and of player class to style your hero according to your personality. For example, playing as a Paladin, I used mostly human units (from among the several races) and made efforts to protect and/or revive as many of my fighters as possible during each battle.The music is quite good, particularly the Sacred Quest / Sacred Campaign / Siege theme (the latter of which, the combat incarnation of the theme, imparted an epic quality when it kicked off at the start of the final battle).EDIT: Oh, and as others say, you should buy the ""Crossworlds"" version of the game rather than this one, as it includes some additional content.

												King's Bounty: Armored Princess is more of what made The Legend a great and encompassing game. This time you are stuck with a dragon pet; which isn't the same as the summons from the box in the first game, but does the job all right. You play as the princess from The Legend and you engage in the same battles, same type of story and same type of locales. This would be bad if the first game wasn't a lot of fun, but it was and thus Armored Princess is more of a good extension of a great game. If you played The Legend and loved it and want more of it, Armored Princess is for you. You will spend roughly the same amount of time with it that you spent in The Legend depending on your difficulty. A must have for Strategy fans!			"

												Sigh.. I just can't quit you...KBAP, otherwise known as, KBAP, is the long long overdue sequel to King's Bounty, and the predecessor for the Hero's line of games. I don't really feel like getting into depth here, so let's do a TLDR version.Good,Constant challenge, fun ""mini"" game of kiting strong enemies when exploring in order to get access to powerful stuff early on.Ways to cheese the early game if you are patient enough by grinding spells/rage use in the easier battles.Just overall a great meta game, no play through feels the same, since all the gear and available armies to recruit are randomized. You learn to work with what you got, or get pummeled. Or just restart.3 different ways to play, so it seems. Mages sure to kill all the way up to the late game, then spell damage just won't keep up. Though it's still possible to dominate, you just need to focus more on status magic and summons first. Fighter is easy mode, except when facing bosses. Pally, I dunno, end game was just a weaker fighter. Seriously, that resurrection focus blows because the best troupes can't be resurrected, the spell may not even appear in game, and uses SO much mana.Is this a proper game review? Probably not. Anyway, it's super addictive, goes on about ten hours longer than it should, and has quite a lot of depth to it. I was 200+ hours in and still learning stuff about the game mechanics. A must by for strategy buffs. heh, forgot the cons:randomized game elements can Eff up a 30 hour game or so, and the mid game is hell, for around 5 fights or so.			"

												Probably my most favourite strategy games of all times and I've played them all. Thanks to King's Bounty I found a new joy of playing videogames again. On the surface it's a HOMAM ripoff of course but beneath it it's got so much more life, vibrancy, sparkle and  new ideas than the ever more listless iterations of HOMAM it has completely overshadowed its old teacher. The Legend, and especially it's perfected sequel Armored Princess, boasts THE best and most enjoyable tactical HOMAM-like combat of all games ever made, no contest.Unfortunately the publisher decided to milk the series dry and came up with two more sequels, Warriors of the North and Dark Side. Both games have the same exact engine with very few innovations. They're basically glorified custom campaings made in the Map Editor. The sparkle and magic are mostly gone and what we got was lifeless, dull grind, designed without much care or thought, probably by just a fragment of the original team (or maybe just a few interns), just to squeeze a few more dollars from the franchise. Avoid at all costs (Warriors of the North is still passable if you become a KB addict but definitelly avoid Dark Side).But the first two games are unambiguously great, full of with and playful brilliance, and will forever remain in my heart.
