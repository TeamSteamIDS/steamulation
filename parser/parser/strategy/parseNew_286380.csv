												Strata is a game of layers, from it gameplay, presentation, and internal design. It's immediately accessible, yet provides the tools for a nearly endless array of puzzles, with a beautifully designed art style complimenting the relaxing, minimal audio arrangement. It doesn't assume to be more than it is, nor attempt to break your expectations of what it appears to be, but its narrow ambition isn't a con in this instance, but a deliberate decision that makes Strata and exceptionally easy to pick up enjoy puzzle game that's satisfying without getting bogged down by an abundance of challenge, perfectly finding its place in an offspring of zen puzzle games.It takes but a moment to understand Strata's one mechanic, that of layering colored strands so the top color is that of the square underneath, but the gradual expansion of the size and complexity of levels keeps it from feeling mundane of simplistic. The lack of any constraints of penalties while solving puzzles allows for experimentation without consequences, which keeps the stress of trying to solve a particularly challenging puzzle at bay. Those wishing for something a little more difficult though will find solace in attempting ""perfect"" levels, which requires you to complete them without undoing any moves (essentially planning all of your moves from the start and having to remember to execute them in exactly that order). It doesn't change Strata from being a fairly breezily easy game for the most part, but the extra objective is a nice touch for those looking to work their minds a little more fervently.What drew me into Strata more than anything though was its mellow, inviting art style and beautifully composed sound design. The presentation is clean, but exceptionally stylized, with angles and camera movements positioned perfectly to make the experience feel like it is one giant moving picture. Layering strands creates patchwork designs of an inconsequential look, but somehow meaningful in their randomness. Each button press sparks an instrument to play in the background, making for a symphonic sound that grows as you get closer to completing a puzzle.Like Lyne and Kami before it, Strata is a basic but addictive puzzle game, that's offers a relaxing change of pace from the hyper violent and sensory overloading games of modern day. It might not ever be more than a nice ""in between"" game for most people, but at a low price point I would still instantly recommend it to anyone looking to chill out for a few minutes at a time (or more, given the large amount of content here). There's not much more I can say about it, so I'll keep this relatively short and simply say Strata is exactly what it appears to be, which is a charming puzzler that you ought to allot some time to yourself.

												Strata follows closely a recent trend of musically and aesthetically inclined simplistic indie puzzlers, such as Lyne, Kami, Hexcells and Circuits (the latter two to a lesser degree). Each of these titles offers a deceptively simplistic puzzler that hides a significant layer of complexity beneath. Strata is no exception, and of the lot, it is a strong contender for being my favorite of the bunch.The premise for Strata's puzzles are simple; you begin each puzzle with a squared grid, with most squares representing a specific color. For each row and column, you must assign a single thread of any specific color of your choosing, with the goal of covering each colored square with its respective shade. The rub here is that many threads will overlap, and the only way to succeed in Strata is to ensure that each respective colored thread remains the top most thread on each of the same colored squares. It sounds simple enough, and in the beginning, it is. You start with a simple 2x2 grid, just to learn the basics, but quickly move on to the more common 3x3 and 4x4 grids, with far more challenging 5x5 and 6x6 grids ending each respective segment.There are 7 sections, each containing 4 separate groups of puzzles, with each group varying between the aforementioned 3, 4, 5 and 6x grid types. Each of the 7 sections contains a slightly different music pattern from the rest, with the latter several carrying wildly different tones than its predecessors. The pleasant piano notes that accompany each click of the mouse and the movements of the threads standout to me as one of the driving forces behind my continued playing of Strata; the relaxing tones urge me to attempt one last puzzle, as does the enjoyment of the miniature sonata that accompanies each victory.The visual aesthetic that accompanies the lovely music could not have been more perfectly placed, as there is nary a single unnecessary graphic or flashy fixture to interfere with the mood already set by the already relaxing musical performance. The movement of the colored threads in-game and in the menus remain smooth throughout, lending to the elegance of the piano with each movement. For the simplicity that Strata provides, it's impressive the level of challenge that presents itself upon reaching the higher numbered grid sets. While challenging, I've yet to come across a single puzzle that instilled anything other than a relaxed state of mind while I slowly piece together where each thread should end up. and with only a few ""perfect"" segments under my belt, I enjoy the thought that my time with Strata is far from over, as I have several segments I've yet to even attempt. Ignoring this title on the notion that simplicity may accompany inadequacy would be a crime, and with the low price, I wholeheartedly recommend Strata to anyone in need of a relaxing time waster between responsibilities, and especially for anyone who enjoys a pleasant puzzle now and again.

												Beautiful sound design and very well presented deductive logic game.  After getting the hang of it, the puzzles aren't very different from each other.  However the background instruments that play notes as you progress a puzzle and then a short melody at completion make for a soothing puzzle experience.  One might compare this to Kami; Strata is more aurally pleasing while the puzzles from Kami are more challenging.If you enjoy unique aesthetics in visual palette and sound design and aren't put off by the fairly straight forward puzzle solving, you should enjoy Strata for at least a short time.

""Become a weaving puzzler""Another amazing puzzle game on Steam. After making connections in ""LYNE"" and doing folds in ""KAMI"" now comes ""STRATA"". It' just simple, unique and challenging ...You have colored ribbons from both sides and must weave them in the right way.  You play in a matrix with colored fields. The last ribbon on top must have the same color as the field color. Such simple it is, you should be alarmed: it's absolutely reverse thinking. Unfortunately there are only max 2 layers of ribbon possible in every level.The game difficulty raises slow and usually it becomes harder with more colors. It starts at 3x3 fields and 2 colors, later it goes up to 5x5 and 5 colors and 6x6 and 4 colors. Something strange is that you have to play a lot of levels (there are over 500 in this game) . For a set of 3x3  9 levels, for a set of 5x5 25 levels, and 6x6 even 36 levels. Sometimes the menu is bugged and the achievements are also not working right. But altogether it's quite fun and you play for some hours a nice game.			"

												Looking for a beautiful, relaxing game? This is it.Similar in feel to Kami, Picross, Splice, Lyne.Everything from the graphics to the music, to the gameplay is incredibly zen and gives you peace of mind while still managing to engage you. Very easy to get into, even without the excellent yet simple tutorial.What made me first discover Strata and Kami was the wonderfully clean art-style, I was very surprised how well orchestrated the game is with small bits of beautifully crafted sounds. There seems to be no loading times for each puzzle which makes everything feel like it flows together beautifully, adding to the already peaceful setting of the game.			"

Review: ""Simple. Elegant. Challenging."" This three simple words from the game description describe it perfectly. An interesting, relaxing and pretty Puzzle game. Feels like a mix between practicing piano and weaving.Pros:- A relaxing game with a beautiful selected color palette.- There are piano chimes and chords playing when you're completing the levels correctly. Really motivating and melodic.- Lots of levels with a developing difficulty to have fun and improve your skills solving them.- Minimalistic, very clean to the eye and mind.Cons:- It could have been interesting to choose what instrument you would like to play when you're making the Puzzles. Maybe a violin, a chelo, or guitar. The piano sound is perfect, but some other options to choose are never behind.Score: 9/10, simply a perfect Puzzle to play to get distracted from a busy work/study day and relax.			"

												Strata is aesthetically minimalist but still manages an elegant beauty. Its sound design effectively communicates success and failure in a manner befitting the 'zen puzzler' mould it is trying to fill. Its minimalism extends to interface in a way that promotes the kind of 5 minute drop-in gaming that makes these games so addicting. Still I can't recommend this game because it fails in the one place that really matter, it's a weak puzzle.For the first 10 minutes or so I really enjoyed Strata, a simple but engaging puzzle format that seemed to have a lot of room for variation ahead of it. Then it hit me, there is a simple mechanical stratey to solve literally every puzzle of this format regardless of the size or number of colours. However complicated a solution may be it is always trivial to solve in reverse, this leads to the game quickly evolving into  busywork. Even for this low price with all the pretty packaging a bad puzzle is a bad puzzle and a thorough waste of time.I kept hoping that in the later sets the game would through in some new spin or twist on the mechanics, unless it appears in the final 6x6 it never comes. I feel like there is something hidden within this concept that could be saved, maybe a block type that is set by the bottom ribbon or requires a particular ribbon combination? In its current state the game is nothing but dissapointing.MINOR ISSUES: the game had a few navigation bugs in the level select menu which require a restart to make the game playable again. Some of the ribbon colours seem too close to each other leading to silly mistakes, this wouldn't be a big deal if the perfect system didn't punish undoing.			"

												Strata, as a puzzle game, is fundamentally flawed. I purchased it as part of a recent bundle, along with some other abstract, aesthetically pleasing games. Strata undoubtedly looks and sounds nice. I was impressed by the game's obvious polish before I started playing. Once I started, however, I encountered the issue which makes me unable to recommend this game in the slightest to anyone looking to solve puzzles. Every grid in Strata can be solved by a ""greedy"" algorithm. There is no confusion possible, as if multiple options are present, it doesn't actually matter which you pick; all will work. It is therefore hard for me to call Strata a puzzle game. Were we required instead to match the bottom square, solving puzzles would be disturbingly straightforward, as any move that wasn't immediately wrong would lead to a valid solution. The present game merely requires performing the easy solution in reverse, which while perhaps a memory challenge still does not a puzzle make. This backward structure also leads to an unfortunate quirk. The majority of grids could be solved without using every colored strip, but this isn't permitted. You must instead place any extraneous strips first, partially obscuring the puzzle without actually affecting your solution in any way. It feels a bit silly.I can't help but think that the game's designer was aware of this flaw to some extent, since they mention in the description that ""[o]ver time patterns emerge and your tactics may evolve."" I mostly wrote this review because I had never encountered this problem before. Every other puzzle game I've played had some claim to being objectively puzzling, generally by being an instance of an NP- or PSPACE-hard problem (like sudoku or sokoban, respectively). In contrast, generalized Strata puzzles are very clearly in P, and it seems many other players have stumbled upon the same simple algorithmic solution.Strata's artistic design is fantastic, and it would probably be a joy to play if you were looking to relax while looking at colorful arrangements. Unfortunately, it lacks puzzles.			"

												Surprisingly simple and entertaining puzzle game. It delivers what the trailer says with its elegance and simplicty. A VERY enjoyable experienec in the vein of LYNE and other puzzlers that don't hurry you up with timers and other stuff. You take your time and try to solve the puzzles with the chance to perfect them, which is just not undoing any moves.With varying complexity and a huge amount of puzzles, there is plenty here to keep you entertained for several hours or to save you from a boring day at work.Recommended!

												“Strata” is a 2D puzzle game which players are asked to create the correct pattern using different colored ribbons. Its artistic textures create a soothing gameplay.The game starts with 2x2 tutorial puzzles. Tutorial is nice and easy to understand. It shows the player what his/her goal is, and how the ribbons are used. In the puzzles, the player is given a set of different colored ribbons. These ribbons can be placed on rows or lines of the diagonal puzzle ground. Puzzle grounds have colors in intersection of rows and colors. As expected, when ribbons are placed on rows and lines, they intersect. Puzzle logic comes from this intersection. Whichever ribbon is placed later, its color occupies that intersection. Players’ goal is to create the same pattern on the puzzle ground.This game has a static logic for its puzzles. That means there are no new additions when player advances to later puzzles. Logic is always the same. Only things that change are size of the ground and number of the ribbons’ colors. Smallest puzzles’ grounds are 2x2 and largest ones are 6x6. If I calculated correctly there are 485 puzzles (excluding tutorials) separated into 7 sets and each set is separated further into 4 waves. It is worth noting that this static logic may be a deal breaker for some people.Puzzles’ difficulty is tricky to talk about. There is a trick to solve the puzzles. This trick can be used to solve even the most-complicated-looking-level. If player can figure it out then very few puzzles are challenging and rest is easy. So it is safe to say that unofficial puzzle goal in this game is to solve the trick. Levels can be considered as tools to figure it out.During my gameplay, I came across some minor bugs. These bugs did not affect actual puzzles; they were all in main menu. The game has a menu that resembles a navigation system instead of standard button menu. And this menu can sometimes act weird. Luckily the game can be restarted in a few seconds so even a restart doesn’t make player loose anything. Regardless, they should be fixed.As a final note, games achievements are all easily achievable. So this is a good game to get a “perfect game” status if you are interested in such things.Pros:+ Good Art: The game has nice textures and uses pastel colors, which makes it easy on the eyes.+ Soothing Gameplay: Art style and realistic instrument (piano, classic guitar and bell) notes that play after almost every player action create a relaxing environment.+ Originality: Puzzle logic looks really unique.Cons:- Repetitive: Because this is a puzzle game, it is not necessarily a bad thing. Also it is a little expected. That said, using the same logic throughout the game results doing the exact same thing again and again.- Minor bugs: The game has some minor bugs that don’t affect actual puzzles. Still they should be fixed.Verdict:It was nice to play a game that actually made me relaxed for a change. These kinds of games show that games are not all about action or achievements; so I recommend it. Still it is worth noting that this puzzle game is mostly recommended to people who care “solving puzzles” more than which puzzles they solve, due to its static logic. P.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

Levels are sorted into 7 sets. Each “set” has its owns sub-categories. (4) One as an appetizer to start slowly and the others going wider and wider from a 2x2 size up to a 6x6 size. A sub-category can have 9 levels up to 36 levels!The game is relaxing: it has no time limit for beating a level and the music is relaxing. The only thing that makes not the game too relaxing is that you can’t undo your last move: you need to restart the whole level. Another relaxing thing is that the game plays a different sound every time you make a move.Now let’s talk about the game’s concept: the aim is to fill the canvas with the right colors in each cell of the table. To do so you have different colored ribbons to use in each row and column. To color a cell you need to overlap two ribbons, the last ribbon colors the cell. The game is pretty easy while playing a 2x2 size but become more tedious (impressive) with a wider size.(#) :Despite the great potential of that game, there is no new concept along the game. So after you’ve mastered dozens of levels from each size, there is not much to play with to be entertained unless doing the achievements perhaps.			"

												I recommend that you play this game, but not that you buy it - at least not at full price.The gameplay itself is very nice. The visuals and sound are beautiful. The puzzles can be challenging, but not overly so - especially when you get the hang of working backwards. In short, it's a nice casual game.So why the negative review? Because it is buggy as hell. Navigating the menus often glitches, making the game unplayable until you force-close the window and restart. Worse, the achievements are bugged. They are handed out long before you actually meet the necessary criteria. You might think that's a good thing, but really it just steals some of your motivation away, robs you of part of the feeling of accomplishment when you complete a set perfectly.A quick look at the game's forum will show you that these bugs have been around for years, yet there has never been a single appearance by a dev to respond, let alone fix, these problems. They dumped the game on Steam as-is and then washed their hands of it. I will not encourage anyone to financially support a company that doesn't stand by their products, but abandons them immediately after launch.If you can find the game in a bundle (as I did, fortunately) or at an extremely steep discount, then you might enjoy playing it for a few hours. But I would rather not see an unsupported game be sold for full price. And it's a shame, because with a couple of small bugfixes, this would have been a positive review.			"

While being fun ad engaging, Strata carries a uniqe blend of music which helps you enjoy the game as you play it.

												Strata is a fun puzzle game.I was afraid, at first, it wouldn't be good on pc as this is thought to be used on tactil devices. But not at all, it working perfectly on my computer.It's taking you step by step increasing difficulty into finding the perfect path to cover all those squares.After the 4th set, I got used to the game and it became quite easy to finish the rest, even with more squarre and more colours. It took just some time.After the last step of difficulty, it just felt just more of the same over and over for the last two set of puzzles.Despite this little downside, I enjoyed the game a lot.And so, I recommend it for people who like puzzle game. Watch the video to get the idea on the puzzle you will get.PS: Don't pay attention to my number of hours on the game, I idled a lot on it :P.Luuna.			"

												Peronally I'm an avid fan of games that tease your brain and give you that ""Aaah"" feeling when finally figuring out the puzzle you're presented with.Sadly I have to say that Strata disappointed me in that regard. Strata was fun for the first ~5 minutes while I still got to know the game mechanics and figured out how it works, but then it fell into a state where the levels got bigger and bigger, but I just kept repeating what I did before, again and again. Strata is very static and does not offer variation whatsoever. It is possible to complete a level in many different ways, but repeating a level over and over again just to find all possible solutions, from which many of those barely even differ doesn't sound very appealing to me.If, on the other hand, your goal is to find a game that simply keeps you busy while progressing through it with time, but doesnt really present any difficulty, you might find Strata interesting, but for me the things that Strata has to offer were not quite enough.

												Did you love Lyne? If so, this is the BOMB.COM for you!Strata isn't fast-paced. Or action-filled. Or multiplayer. Strata is relaxing. Calm. Fun. It's a very simple game: draw lines on a grid, so every square is covered by the same coloured line. But here's the twist: the colour needs to be the same on the top. What starts off as a simple, easy game becomes a mind-boggling addictive puzzle. I could spend the same amount of time into Counter-Strike as i could with Strata. It's that good. Soon, you'll be matching up lines everywhere!But gameplay isn't the only thing. Strata is beautifully designed, with clean, neat, paper-like formatting that is both relaxing to the eye and wonderfully complex. In addition, the sound is well done. Timing right with the game, it eases you straight into a position of comfortability and easy-mindedness.Beware! This game most certainly isn't Borderlands 2, but it is well worth 3.99 (2.99 on sale), for a relaxing puzzle game that you can play for hours on end. Just remember to take breaks once in a while.

												One of the more enjoyable ambient-puzzle games that have been popular as of late, though also fairly exhausting. A lot of it comes down to an exercise in memorization until you've really got the core mechanics down to the point where you can just eye a puzzle and figure out the first spot that needs to be set in stone. There's plenty of content here, though; 28 sets of puzzles altogether, and the size of each set is based on the size of the boards within (3x3 boards have 9 puzzles, 4x4 boards have 16, up to 6x6 which have 36 each). I don't think it's the kind of game that you can play a lot of in one sitting, though, but as a game to occasionally come back to to keep your mind sharp, I'd definitely recommend it.			"

A beautfil, empty shellStrata is immediately appealing with its minimal but stylish visual design. You're playing with hamonious swatches of colour, with simple rules: you're throwing ribbons diagonally through a grid, with the goal of matching each square's colour to that of the topmost ribbon passing over it.The problem is the lack of variety and progress in the puzzles' difficulty. True, there are hundreds of puzzles available, but no new element or rule is ever added to make things more interesting. And the algorithm to solve the puzzles becomes obvious after a short while, meaning that bigger grids may take a bit longer to solve, but are not more mentally challenging than the smaller ones.While the minimal visual design is good enough to hold itself up until the game's end, I cannot say the same about the sounds, made solely of highly reverbed piano and strings notes. It gets too repetitive and irritating after a while, even if the last sets of puzzles change the instruments to guitars and christmas bells.Worse still, the menu is completely buggy, making it frequent that you can't move to the next sets of levels or even quit the game properly (use alt-F4 when this happens to force-quit).Overall, Strata is simply too basic to entertain. It may have been a decent casual experience to play in short bursts when it was still just a mobile game, but as a PC title, it is lacking.			"

The game is a bit buggy at times, e.g. it sometimes freezes when you move around menus or levels too quickly and some achievements pop-up when you haven't rightfully earned them yet.

												Neat puzzle game, kind of refreshing.If you want the game to be more challenging, avoid getting the alghorithm spoiled, it's way better when you figure it out on your own eventually.Once you figure or find out the alghorithm the game uses, it can become a little stale, but it is still good fun and a nice brain exercise, even if you know how to solve it, you can work on memorization and it's always satisfying when you realize your brain has digested the formula and now you can solve these in a few seconds without taking any notes or the such.

(Namely the review by Montag who only have 0.6 hours on record, which supprisingly have 6 people that found his review useful.)I got it in a bundle, but I'd recommend this game even with the original price.

												Easy, peace, casual.It have quite a lot puzzles, and each of them is easy to solve, so you can play it everytime you want.It doesn't have a quit button, I mean not the origin one which you need press 1-7 times ESC button and some bugs here may cause a loop which means you will never get that quit button at the origin menu. So when you play and want to quit, you need to press ""ALT + F4"".And also it's too hard to distinct the colours in some levels, especially when every colour is covered by the actived colour lines, you can hardly figure out the colour below, unless you remember it.For unknown reason, didn't got the last 2 achievement...I'll see it in the future :D			"

												If you enjoy puzzles that give you a sense of accomplishment when you complete...this game is 10/10 the game for you. Very reasonable price, and simplistic yet endearing game play and artwork. As soon as you get the hang of it, you'll zip through the puzzles until...no longer shall you trudge through 3x3 puzzles, but you reach the ever increasing difficulty of 4x4! A whole new style of getting it just right to learn, and many many more to complete, this goes on until 5x5, and ending up with the God-like 6x6! With achievements that are 100% completed from just playing the game and completing all the puzzles, this game will test you over and over, putting your patience and intelligence into question.Get it, play it, win it, love it.

												The most Zen game you'll ever play. And I don't just mean its design. Its minimalist art style and pleasantly satisfying piano cues make it a joy just to be in there.     But there is also the actual puzzle solving aspect. The puzzles themselves have an abstract way to them, and they'll put your mind to work. You'll wrack your brain figuring out the proper way to solve a stage... but just when you're about to give up, you'll simply see it. Clear in your mind: the solution. You'll suddenly find yourself in the zone, and you'll be solving stages in a breeze, amid an unstoppable flow of clarity.  It's a feeling that is hard to describe in words otherwise, so I highly recommend you experience it yourself.			"

												Strata is a weaving puzzle game that presents a challenge unique to the game itself. The puzzles may look simple at first, but soon you may realise there could be multiple solutions (or weaves) to a problem. If you're eager enough try out all the possibilities and patterns and invent your own strategy, like what I did, you will get hooked to Strata in no time.The design of the puzzles are not only beautiful, they look visually mesmerising as well. The game is so rich with a wide array of colour palettes, I can't help but to stare at the completed puzzles and be filled with wonder. Strata is a must if you love puzzles with a mix of artistic elements, or even apply some weaving techniques in real life!			"

												Strata is a very simple idea that works well and is nicely delivered. It starts as a pleasant casual game in that you can just walk away from it an any time and it's out of your head in a nanosecond, but while you're playing it.But....A possible criticism is the change in difficulty curve every time your square increases in size. There's a large jump between 3x3 puzzles and 4x4 ones and the further one progresses the less casual it becomes and the more concentration is needed. Strata stops being so casual and becomes fiendish once you're sucked in unless you use the hints I guess. But I'm not a fan of just following instructions.			"

												Strata could be so frustrating--except it's so careful not to be. I mulled over purchasing Strata  for a while.  At first I was worried I wasn't smart enough to get too into this game, but it's very forgiving and the sound effects are calming, almost meditative.  I have lovely moments of insight, where everything just clicks and the ribbons weave so perfectly, and I have times where I ponder and redo... and occasionally look at the hints.Don't worry about difficulty: it draws you in slowly and gently and gives you all the time you need.

The ambience is very fitting for each set of levels. Calm, soothing. Feels like you're in a whole different world.You get a choice of colors and amount to solve grid puzzles. Do solve the puzzle, the correct colors must be met with a ribbon as the second layer over that box. You will notice patterns with the ribbons that may hurt your eyes if you stare at them too long, but you may also notice patterns without the ribbons to help you get started and where to go. It'll come with experience the more you play and keep trying.The learning curve eases upward at first, but might spike up a bit if you weren't prepared. You do need to concentrate if you're trying to solve it mentally before you make your first move.It's worth the price, wouldn't wait for a sale.----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												Strata, plural for stratum, is a Latin word which means layers. Its game machanics are very simple. A block can only be crossed twice, from the diagonal left and the diagonal right. However, only the second line that crosses which matches the colour of the block is valid. You just need to know which block comes first.If you haven't played Lyne (which deals with patterns) I recommend that you do that first, as a warmup, because this game takes another step further (deals with colours). It should not be rushed, just take your time.Difficulty is determined by the types of colors and the size of the grid (from 2X2 to 6X6). In 2X2 systems it is fairly easy to predict the flow, and if you gained more experience through the game, you will notice there is an algorithm to the solutions, but from 5X5 onwards it will twist your mind a lot. At that point it was literally impossible for me to figure out which goes first without using the hints as the sequence is too complex.However, there are some bugs which the developer is not around to fix anymore, but it's easily fixed by quitting the game.8/10			"

												first things first: the game is great and normally I'd recommend it to people who like to think (or look at pretty colors) but because of the bugs and the developer's reluctance to fix them makes me only recommend it at the deepest possible discount. it's already been bundled, gonna happen again, I'm sure.achievements, if you care about them, are completely broken and unlock at random times (like the set complete one after finishing the first level), and the menu tends to bug out more often than not, making you press esc several times (or alt+f4 once) to be able to quit, while you can't even read any of the text because everything overlaps. also, the game saves progress to the windows registry, which is ridiculous and makes me wonder why the game has cloud saving in the first place when you can only change one setting, the resolution, and it pops up every time you start the game anyway.tl;dr: great game but a buggy mess, pick it up if you like puzzles but only at a huge discount.

												Don't be fooled by how simple Strata looks.The game walks you through how to play it pretty quickly and effectively, but other than that, you are on your own. The rest of the game is just you, your brain, and the piano keys tinkling blissfully in your ears.Any casual player can pick it up and jump right in, and any puzzle/indie lover can dedicate hours to solve and complete each set and wave of puzzles down to straight perfection, like me. For $3.99, this game gives you a crapton to work with.My only complaint is that after playing the 5x5 puzzles for awhile you will start to feel it, and I mean feel some sort of brain exhaustion. Don't marathon this for 12 hours on end. Especially as some of the levels can have god-awful colour schemes, you don't want to risk eye strain or your sanity just to perfect a few puzzles.That being said, 8/10 would let wreck my brain again.

												Strata is a minimal stylish casual puzzle game.I like the visual design, the music and the simple core idea for the puzzles. However, the developer failed to add any advanced puzzle mechanism around that simple idea, which I think is the most import aspect for a puzzle game. (unless the simple core itself is already challenge enough, like Sudoku)Strata becomes really boring once you firgure out the the easy common solution, which is Instead of trying to match the color of 2nd line to squares, match the color of 1st line to squares and remember the sequence. The correct solution is the reverse of that sequenceI enjoyed the first 15min of the game, and then I ""worked"" (not played) for another 2+ hours just for 100% achievement If you want a casual game, Strata is not that bad, but if you are into puzzles, this game is not for you.

												one of the few puzzle games that I've been a constant supporter of. From a year ago when it started on greenlight it has come out as something truly zen without sacrificing gameplay for it's simple and beautiful art style.    How it works is that you click on a banner color and select where it goes, the way the puzle works is that you have to fill out all the spaces without having any colors over the wrong spaces. The music is minimalist but peaceful. You don't have to play from start the finish you can freely choose which chapter you want to play but keep in mind they do become more elaborate and complicated as you go.

												Pros:* Animations are smooth* Sound design is quite enjoyable* Tactile feel probably is even better on tablets/phonesCons:* Visual design is not so good - colors will sometimes be hard to distinguish, especially when initially washed out on the board (e.g. black and blue in level ""Persist Wave 2"")* Incredibly limited both in concept and in difficultyConclusion:Originally, and while going through the 3x3 boards, the puzzle concept itself seemed quite good.  Unfortunately, this partcular puzzle concept is not scalable, so that once 4x4 boards were introduced, the pattern became absurdly apparent and all levels since have been solved by mindlessly applying a single algorithm again and again.  While the implementation is mostly enjoyable, this limitation in the concept itself means I cannot recommend it.			"

												Strata reminds me of puzzle games like Flow and Picross. Like those games, Strata has a simple, grid based ruleset whose depth comes from the many variations of the playing board. The simplicity of the game's interface helps keep the focus on what is important. No wading through unnecessary time-wasting elements searching for the game or fun play. Each little action results in relaxed musical riffs which set a peaceful tone. This, coupled with subtle animations gives proper weight to each click, making the game have a sense of physicality which grounds the player in the interaction. And Strata makes fanatastic use of color. For that reason alone, give it a shot.			"

												I actually didn't mind this game, but downvoting to balance out the score a bit. Strata is one of these games that is ""ok"" - easy to be content with, but difficult to love.The premise of the game is to select ""ribbons"" in a certain order to fill out a grid with the correct colours. The design is minimalistic and rather soothing. The game is actually pretty fun at first, but has serious scaling issues. The problem is that every puzzle has the same solution - I don't mean that the ribbon combination is the same, but the thought process to solve each puzzle is identical. Once you pin down the logic to solve a 4x4 grid, you just do the same thing with a 5x5 or 6x6. With puzzle games I like to occasionally feel that I am very close to solving a problem, or that I am just missing a small piece to complete it successfully - Strata will never give you that feeling, that's why it is only mediocre to me.5/10			"

												A throwback to the dedicated puzzlers of the 90's like Honeycomb Hotel, all wrapped in a beautiful modern package.This is one of those games you need to play fullscreen in a quiet room to really get the full experience.  The art is minimalistic but the brightly coloured ribbons accent the view more and more as you progress into the larger levels.  The music is very calm and suits the game very well, and every action you take introduces some small melody or sound.In terms of actual gameplay, the main mechanic is intuitive and something I don't personally remember being done before, so props to the devs for that.  The ribbons are a really fresh take on grid-based puzzlers and make some some surprisingly deep puzzles.  And since there's more than one way to solve most of the puzzles, your free to form your own style of play.For the price, I highly recommend picking up this gem if you're into casual puzzle games, or if you just want to chill out.Very relaxing game.  Well done.			"

												Strata is a very vivid and indie style puzzle game. I love the design of GUI. With many level to finish, you time will be occupied. But I found a bug which happened sometimes during the Set change, the number ? x ? was overlapped and couldn't change the set. I give this game 9/10 because I love puzzle game. I apologize if I say something offensively about the bug of this game.			"

												Relaxing and zenlike, this game is simple but intellectually stimulating. Well worth the small price. It also contains a LOT of puzzles that provide quite a lot of play time compared to the price. The music/sound is minimal, but pleasant, consisting of ethereal piano flourishes in time with your choices of moves. And there's really no way to lose or fail, only different levels of winning (i.e. perfect score or using a couple hints/undos), so the game won't frustrate or stress you as some puzzle games might.That being said, the menu can sometimes glitch when you're trying to navigate it, leaving you stuck at a certain puzzle list. It's nothing that can't be solved by ctrl-alt-deleting your way out and relaunching the game, though. It also lacks a volume control beyond ""sound on/off"", which can be solved by adjusting the system volume instead of the game volume. These mild inconveniences are literally the only things I have to complain about, which is high praise indeed!			"

												这游戏比较像ichi，hook和hexcell，更讲究“正确的顺序规律”，而不像LYNE可以靠反复尝试筛选出正确答案（当然成就本身也没有LYNE那么吸引人）。另外，这游戏要是能画辅助线就好了，后面到了6*6的12条带子就算能一条条逆推出正确答案也经常忘记顺序反复重来有点烦，如果能像hexcell那样用右键标记一下就方便了。最后，本游戏的成就设定有点迷，完成全成就甚至不用把7个大关中任何一个全部完美。差点忘了评测的原因……不过这游戏似乎也没有国区定价，写推荐对广大国区玩家大概也没什么卵用哈。（我还是去年从HB慈善包入手的，又一个迷一般的设定）			"

A great game to pass the time, even if you only have a couple minutes to waste, you can ponder over how to pass just one level.A good challenge without the frustration.

Please stop reading if you still want to enjoy the game!Think what do you expect when you are about to draw the last stroke? The last but one stroke? And so on.Or, what if it's not the topmost stroke that matters, but the bottom one?Hope I didn't make a boo-boo in my proof; I kept getting PERFECTs for tens of levels in my first tries, except for some mistakes in moving my mouse...

												Strata is a minimalistic puzzler. You're presented with a grid, from 3x3 to 6x6, with various coloured squares. Each colour is represented by a selection of coloured ribbons at the bottom of the screen. The objective is to cover every square so that the topmost ribbon colour matches the square. All rows and columns must be used.Each level has 4 stages of hints so you can reveal them one by one if you're struggling. The 4th hint more or less reveals the solution. To get a 'perfect' solution you have to do it without hints.PresentationVisuals: each of the 7 areas has its own colour palette and the completed puzzle lattices are very pleasing on the eye. If you enjoy mulling over colour swatches for your home decor then this will be right up your street. The screen background even looks like textured wallpaper.Music: there is no constant tune. Instead, your moves are accompanied by soothing piano chords. If you get it right you're rewarded with a satisfying tune. If you get it wrong the jarring off-key notes will tell you in no uncertain terms. It's rather ingenious and for me it endured longer than the average ambient sounds you get with most puzzlers before the novelty wore thin and I finally switched it off.Menu system is nicely integrated with the visual theme. A ribbon extends to the next/previous (named) area. Within each of the 7 areas are 4 groups of puzzles with varying grid sizes and number of ribbons. Perfected groups/levels are marked with a crown. In total there are several hundred puzzles.All in all the whole experience is classy and tasteful.PerformanceOn a couple of occasions I had a strange glitch where moving between areas resulted in text being overwritten but restarting fixed it, no biggie. Otherwise this is a low-demand game that should run smoothly on any hardware and offers all screen resolution options. It gets extra brownie points for being fully cross-platform.DifficultyFor the first hour or so it gets a bit tricky but here's the thing. It didn't take long for me to work out a method which could be applied to any puzzle and from then on there was no challenge at all.I won't give away the method but after I discovered it myself I found it described in the Community Guides if you're interested. In a nutshell, if you can build a sequence of up to 12 numbers in your head (or use a pen and paper if you don't consider that cheating) and then repeat them backwards then you have the aptitude to beat every puzzle easily.Even if you don't manage to work out the method, you can use the hints system to reveal the solution, reset the level and then copy the solution for a perfect score. It kind of makes a mockery of the Steam achievements for this game. You'll notice a relatively high completion rate on the global achievements chart and this is the reason why.The only differences between the first puzzle and the last are the size of grid and number of ribbons. The gameplay is identical. No new mechanics are ever introduced.ValueIf you judge value by the length of play time then, with hundreds of levels, this is undoubtedly a bargain even at full asking price.Some might argue that repeating exactly the same puzzle hundreds of times without any variation would result in the player stopping out of boredom long before the full content of the game has been explored and therefore it should be a $1 game. Whatever your opinion is on the matter, if you wait for a sale you can't go far wrong.Steam24 achievements, all progress-related. If you complete the game you get all achievements. I found that a few of them dropped before they were supposed to. In any case, I consider this an easy game to get 100% - even if you don't cheat (see above).No trading cards. It does have Steam Cloud which is useful with this type of game as you're likely to want to carry it around with you on multiple devices.VerdictStrata is beautifully presented and for a while the puzzles are engaging, but it's like being served the same delicious meal over and over again on various size/colour plates. It won't be long before you get sick of it and hanker for something else.This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												A decent puzzle game with good music and graphic. You only have to click the box outside the puzzle map to play and complete, and each click causes a effective sound with certain key you can feel a melody with. For the puzzle part, click the box and pull the ribbon to match its color with that of the site. It looks easy at first sight, but the ribbons have to cross, and only its upper side at the cross point can be seen. The layers are critical to solve the puzzle. Larger maps (6 x 6) are complicated and challenging.To add some cons, achievements are partially broken. I could get the complete achievement much faster than devs should have intended. I don't think people will complain much about this though.			"

												Strata is a puzzle game where the player has to ""weave"" colored ribbons over a grid of colored squares. Sounds easy, right? The thing is, the color of the top strip matches the color of the square it covers, which is much easier said than done when you are juggling 6 different colors, and a 6 by 6 grid.With a few hundred puzzles, and a little over 10 hours of enjoyment, this game is definitely worth the $4.  Hell, I still have it installed and I play it from time to time. It's really great for helping with anxiety.			"

												A pleasant puzzle game with dulcet piano tones. A perfect minimalistic game. You are eased into it and progress steadily with no sharp difficulty curve. The goal is to lay the ribbons down in a certain order so that the color of the ribbon on top matches the color of the boxes underneath it. You may find challenge in the later leveles as the puzzles get bigger... or you may not. A great game to pick up and play when you have a little free time. In fact, it's best you play this in small doses because it can feel a bit repetitive if you try to play a whole set in one setting. One minor note to keep in mind, the achevements are a little buggy but they are bugged in your favor so nothing much to fret about.			"

One must figure out not only which colored ribbons go where, but also in what order. For the price, this is a wonderful game to get if you want to pass the time and/or are into puzzle games. The music in the game is very beautiful and calming, and the shapes and colors really are nice to look at. I have been enjoying it so far, and I think you will too!			"

												Buy this if: a. You're the friend people go to when they need knots untangled or Rubix cubes solved;b. you like games like Lynec. you like sophisticated color palettesd. you like simple but soothing music for your background in puzzle gamesor e. any/all of the aboveMy only criticism is that sometimes it doesn't seem to register that I'm clicking on a ribbon box - takes several tries to activate it. A blemish on an otherwise well-crafted game; might be a Mac bug, or might be something in my system, though I've yet to have any similar problems in any other game, which is what leads me to believe it's the fault of Strata, not my baby laptop. That aside, well worth the money and quite enjoyable.			"

												This is one of the most soothing and relaxing games I have played in a while. Don’t get me wrong. It’s still very difficult. I love the music. It reminds me of Eufloia. It’s one that I keep coming back to while sitting on a plane or have some other time to kill. This would be a perfect game for a tablet. My official score based off of my just now made up matrix….Graphics = 9Sound = 10Gameplay = 7 (it gets repetitive but I keep coming back after time away)Thought Provoking = 8Replayable  = 4 (I have a feeling that once I finish the game I will be done with it)Worth the Money = 10Thanks for a great game!

												I really love this game.  It's a simple concept that can be deceptively difficult at times and the aesthetic makes this a very relaxing and challenging game.  The puzzles are paced well to introduce new concepts for solving the later puzzles and the hint system gives you just enough so you can really understand how the puzzles work.  Just play it.			"

												This is an astonishing game, to put it simply. The concept is simple, layer the strips so the colour indicated in the square below is lain on top. The resultant puzzles are deviously difficult at times but the ability to quickly retrace your steps or, even, restart the problem makes sure the challenge never becomes frustrating. The visuals are simple, yet lovely and the sound design is perfectly done.			"

												Strata is a calming and pretty way to spend time. The puzzles are not too difficult once you get th hang of things, no, but they are nice and calming. If tha is what you are looking for, then this is definitely the game for you. The musical notes that sound as you play are a very nice touch and the colors are very appealing. It is good for lesiure, if you want to play a slightly challenging logic game with a beautiful design.			"

												This is not so much a puzzle game as a symphony of sound and colour, a relaxing yet somewhat challenging cooldown from the troubles of the world and a brief, beautiful escape from everything. You play it and it's as if nothing else matters, or nothing else is even happening. It just washes over you as you experience it, and calms you wonderfully. I would recommend this to anyone.			"

												A worthwhile addition to your library if you enjoy puzzle games. There are a LOT of puzzles in this collection so you're definitely getting your money's worth. Some replayability too since you'll want to go back and try to 'perfect' some of the puzzles, i.e. complete a puzzle without using the Undo command at all.Music is ambient with some piano notes that dynamically highlight your moves. Nothing special but sets the mood nicely.			"

												Unlike other puzzle games I've played, Strata does not introduce new complexities to the beginning premise to help keep it new and interesting as time goes on. Once you've figure out its ""gimmick"" you won't find yourself getting stuck. Luckily, that gimmick had enough depth for me that I still enjoyed it.Ignoring my hours played as it was often idling on my secondary monitor while playing multiplayer turn-based games, it had a great number of puzzles to solve and is certainly not shy on content.

A minimalistic, simple puzzle game about planning ahead where you're supposed to match specific ribbon colors to their specified colored squares in certain orders. How it works is probably better explained visually on a how-to video; one's on the Steam store page. If a mistake is made, an un-do option is there. You can do a ""perfect"" run of a level if you finish it from beginning to end without mistakes.The only sounds in the game itself are simple instrumental sound effects when you click on things.The game's likely to be best played in windowed mode so there's an easier time closing it with ALT + F4 or the close-window button. This game doesn't exactly have an exit-game option.The game comes in 7 sets of 4 waves each (like set 1 wave 1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-1, etc.) with each of the waves containing a specific amount of levels based on what kind of grid will be there. If a wave in a particular set is going to consist of 3x3 grids then there will be 9 levels in that wave, if it's a 6x6 wave then it's 36 levels, and yaddayadda. 6x6 is the largest kind of grid this game has. With all those levels it's a lot more likely for the game to eventually become repetitious since you're doing the same kind of puzzle over & over again with just a little more to work with each time.The levels obviously get more complicated & difficult as the square grids and the colors that need to be used increase in size & number. Halfway in though it goes from a 5x5 grid to a very simple & sudden 3x3 and then progressively goes up again but up to a 6x6 instead. I'm not sure what they were going for there with the increase to decrease to an increase in difficulty.There are 7 sets but it looks like the last 2 sets were supposed to be optional or separated from the base game in a way as their themes and sound effects are completely different from the previous 5 sets.I don't know what it could be like for anyone else but because practically the entire game is turned 45° I was constantly finding myself with my head unconsciously tilted to match for the more complicated grids. I get that the angle is meant to pretty-fy the simplicity of the game but with it being a puzzle game where you're focusing on square grids you'd probably just want the grids themselves to be angled vertically.Apparently all of the puzzles have certain patterns on them from what I found and can all be easily solved with a few algorithms, which themselves can be found through experience or guides. That means that if these found methods are used then it becomes less of a puzzle game where you have to match colors in the right order, and more about finding certain patterns on the current puzzle to apply the algorithm on which just further increases the repetition. That said, algorithms don't actually have to be used here and can still be treated ""regularly"" as a puzzle game but because the formulas exist it just practically breaks the ""puzzle"" part.Strata starts out fine but eventually it just becomes a repetitious game down the line pushing away the ""puzzle"" part because of the existing methods to solve all of the levels.

												This game gets a lot of bashing for being too simple. I on the other hand will call it for what it is. It's a 4 dollar treat with the current tags ""Casual and Relaxing"". That's a puzzle I would suspect hardcore puzzle enthusiasts to crack. I for one find it really nice that you can turn the game on and know that you for sure will be able to beat some of the puzzles. It get's me in the same mood as doing a jigsaw puzzle. You know you will get there in time and you will enjoy the way there. With that said I would recommend this for anyone who wants a puzzlegame that is less punishing but a treat for the mind.			"

												The good:I like the concept of the puzzles.  It's unique, and does take a little time to think through.  Subtly a memory puzzle at times.  Very consistent, which can be tricky to make in a puzzle game.  The presentation is also generally quite pretty, and the music is nice and relaxing, and each move you make sounds rather musical as well so that's nice.The bad:Repetitive. No surprises here whatsoever, and once you come up with a strategy for the early puzzles every other one works exactly the same way.  I like the puzzle idea but now I feel like I've done as many of them as I'd ever want to.  Game awards a crown for a ""perfect"" score, which just means no undos - this could benefit from some kind of extra challenges, I'd say by taking advantage of the multiple solutions each puzzle has in its current form.  Game feels meant for a touchscreen, and I wouldn't want to play it with a mouse.  Also, no indication on a puzzle screen how many more puzzles are left in the set - I've taken to tallying them just so I know how far I have left.The ugly:While I've never had much issue with the gameplay (aside from what I think is fat fingers on my part but I could be wrong), the interface is bugged to hell.  Sometimes I'll exit a puzzle set (seems to happen when I exit one without completing it all the way) and the puzzle set select screens bug out and overlay on top of each other and navigation becomes impossible.  When you complete a level and all the ribbons slide away, the two on the bottom don't quite make it all the way off the top of the screen before blinking out, implying that the game was never really intended for a landscape view (and really, the left and right 1/3 of the screen is almost empty the entire game).  Most damning, the achievements for completing and perfecting an entire puzzle set trigger on completing and perfecting the FIRST puzzle in a set, meaning you can get 14/24 achievements from playing a tiny fraction of the available puzzles.Verdict:I do not recommend spending more than $1.00 for this game.

												Strata is a great little puzzle game that accomplishes just about everything it wants to be. The animations, music and design are all very smooth and pleasing.

												This is a fun, relaxing puzzle game. It's interesting enough to keep me returning to it, but not overly complex to the point of frustration. It is also low-pressure, with no time limits or real penalties for mistakes. It does have a few minor bugs. First, to exit the game, you back out of each level until you return to the title screen, then press Esc. Sometimes the screen will glitch, causing you to move to random levels instead. When this happens, the only way to exit the game is to press Alt+f4. The other issue is that the color selection doesn't seem to register consistently. I don't know if it is an issue with the hitbox, or if it drops mouse clicks, but I often find myself placing a ribbon with the color I was previously using instead of the one I attempted to select. It doesn't occur often enough to make the game unplayable, but it is a minor annoyance.			"

												Strata is a nice, meditative puzzle game. If you need to chill out and soothe your nerves, Strata does a good job, while simultaneously working out the logic centers of your mind.Basically, you have to figure out a way to make sure the top color matches the box it goes over - but then you have to worry about other colored boxes. It's basically a foil for Yosumin. While I enjoy that puzzle game, dear God does the sound irritate. Strata is low-key and immensely enjoyable.			"
