												Pausable Real-Time Strategy on a seamlessly zoomable, historically accurate map? Yes please! It's kind of like a combination of the Paradox titles and Total War, which, in my book, makes a winner. What we see here, are the very beginnings of the future of strategy games. This is a must have for all strategy fans and history buffs. Innovative and truly unique, Hegemony is developed by a small developer with limited funding, and sometimes it shows, but really, I cannot recommend this enough.			"

												An interesting real time strategy game. You are Phillip conquering the city states of Greece to create your Hegemony. It is certainly a game that shows the trouble of directly maintaining a large empire. In the beginning, you only control a few cities which means it is easy to micromanage your troops. The map is very large, consisting of hundreds of cities, that you most likely need to capture to win.  The big issue in this game is logistics. Troops need food, cities need supply lines with other cities and farms for food. You need supply lines to mines to secure income. There is no way to conquer the map with just one army. Troops need to resupply and replenish. Philip starts out surrounded by enemies around him. Expanding too fast in one direction will leave you overstretched. Some cities are very bothersome to invade. No farmland to sustain your armies means you need to either bring workers or sheep to resupply food. When you get there, they seem to have an army far too large for their food to accomodate, and you better hope that you win otherwise you have to assemble the troops again and march all the way across the map to try again. You also need to watch that cities don't starve. If you conquered a city and they have no food, they will start to rebel. Ignore it too long, and you have to march troops to reconquer the city. Repeat that a couple dozen times and include a couple Greek powerhouses like Thebes and Athens that will constantly raid your cities. And then there is the whole land of Persia which seems to take up half the map. I haven't reached there yet, so I can't see how hard it will be. It will be a huge pain to muster troops from halfway across Greece to invade though.Buy this game if you like real time strategy games that start simple and become logistical nightmares as you progress.

												An excellent game that focuses on the life of Philip II of Macedon, Father of Alexander the Great.Pros-Logistics system - your soldiers have to eat and that food has to come from somewhere. it makes burning farms and raiding supply lines a viable strategy for starving out a city. it also forces you to pay attention to the edges of your empire and protect the land outside the city.-Naval combat and landings - makes you want to murder every man, woman, and child in Athens.-Campaigns - The main campaign follows Philip as he conquers Greece. Two other campaigns focus on the Peloponnesian war (One as Athens and the other as Sparta). There is also a sandbox mode that lets you play any faction in the game. The scripted campaigns are the most fun.Cons-Graphics are mediocre at best-Sandbox is bland - You can build an empire but the AI only reacts to you and rarely takes the initiative.Overall 8.5/10 - If the graphics don't bother you then any strategy gamer will really enjoy this game.Note - i know it says i only have two hours played, i bought the game from the Developors site before it was on Steam and played that version.

												It's as promising as it tells it is, except for diplomacy which is kindof limited but more than enough (heck, it's greek city-states: Why ally with neighbours while you have your own hegemony/league?).Also, the game allows you to play differend kinds of factions with differend kinds of gameplay (for example, the Paeonians are mainly a cavalry faction with no hoplites, the Illyrians got no cavalry while having a huge empire so they have to focus on intelligent defending, and Crete has to rely on naval raiding-conquering tactics).

												I've played this game over 200 hours (not on steam i've also got a non drm version). This is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. It has is problems :AI only raides and not really attack you, AI armies builds are kinda strange and AI does some stupid things like not changing the home of a unit without one. But the scale, the managing of food/units/reserves etc. is extremly fun and satisfying.  Zooming in and out feeling like a real commander, caputering slaves and let them carry food, fighting over flocks of sheep (to be honest that is cool :P) and the biggest plus is the campaign witch you can play on your own pace, you can follow the missions you wanted and in your own order. I just an all out great strategy game like I never seen before. It is a bit dated and part II is coming (Rome still in early acces). Just buy this game, have fun and wait for Rome to go out of early acces and have even more fun. The developpers are also great guys, listining to the community via there own forum and the steamhub, support indie devs and buy this hidden gem! I give this game a 9 out of 10.			"

												A deeply clever little game. Not for everyone, and a few (modest) historical liberties have been taken, but it models ancient warfare in a way that feels authentic -- much more so than the Total War series, which it superficially resembles. In fact, the Hegemony series' zoomable realtime map is what CA should have been doing years ago.This is a game about operational planning as much as tactics and strategy -- army composition, march order, recon, logistics and timing are essential to victory -- and each region is almost a sort of puzzle to be solved. Approach it as a new kind of challenge, rather than a conventional 4x, and you might be pleasantly surprised.			"

												Has something a lot of strategy games are missing: supply lines. Every war campaign feels much more authentic now. You can also organize troops in cool looking battle lines with historical commanders in charge. Sometimes you don't have enough space for them though.What I think is very awesome about the game is the quest system through which the scenario is being developed. It is like when you zoom out you see a pillar in every region which tells you about the respective history based quest line. Looks very nice and fitting. And the story is not strictly linear!

												I really like these games. It's like if the Total War games were all Real-time but scaled down to a more manageable, non-turnbased level. There are dozens of factions to choose from each with strengths and weaknesses and varied starting positions. If you don't want to play the grand campaign that focuses on Greece and parts of Western Anatolia, you can try to unite Greece as Philip of Macedon. You've got supply lines, varied unit types, naval combat, raiding, infrastructure and so much more. It's definitely a blast for anyone interested in either Real-time Strategy, 4x or Ancient Warfare.			"

												I bought this during the summer sale but it well worth the standard price. Its a simple concept (raise troops, pay them, feed them, attack your neighbors) but finding the right balence makes it much more complex than you might think. Definitely a different spin than any of the other strategy games you might also be playing, EUIV, Total War, CKII. Supply Lines/Logistics- Your cities each have a predetermined number of trade routes based on the economic power of that city. Some have 2, some have 16. These can connect to farms (which produce food, with varying amounts for each season), mines (which produce gold when worked by workers or slaves captured in battle), and they connect to other cities. Food moves along these routes with different capacities based on how long it is. Some routes that are very close (like a city to the farm next to it) can carry up to 100 a week and longer routes usually start at a base level of 15 per week, but can be upgraded by paying gold. Your units replentish their losses only if they are on one of these supply lines. Finances- You don't have a treasury like in other games, only an income. Your finances are viewed as a weekly income/cost. Mines produce up to 80 gold a week whereas upgraded roads can cost up to 90 as well as your troops having a weekly upkeep. So at any point your spending overtakes your income, units don't get paid and their moral starts to drop. The same will happen with food, but you don't have a kingdom production/expenditure because food can only get to your troops and cities if you have sufficient supply lines.Battles- Your troops fight in real time on the campaign map like Paradox games but you can deploy and position them like in Total War with bonuses if your cavalry charges a unit or if you flank an enemy. A unit's moral drops a little for each soldier that dies and it will rout if the moral drops to 0. Cities act in a similar way but with a number assigned to its seige strength. When you are sieging a city, its constatly dropping, with larger hits if you use catapaults, and when it gets to 0, it becomes yours. If a city or fort has a garrison, it will shoot back at you. When a unit routes, it will regroup at its home city and replentish its losses. This will always happen, unit don't get destroyed, even if every troop dies.Cities- When you retake a city that is part of your culture or basiaclly within your historical territory, it becomes part of your empire. You can recruit native units, the same you can recruit at your capital, and they can change their home city to any with the same culture. If you have every unit with its home set as your capital, they will only replentish its number from that city so it's best to try to spead them out. For example, if your capital is in the middle of your empire and your troops take losses on the edge, manpower will be taken from its home and move along supply lines to that unit. Cities recouperate manpower slowly and when it's at 0, your troops won't fill their ranks unless you change their home city and they recruit from there.Culture- When you expand and take a neighboring city that is not native, they will remain hostile to your occupation. This manifests as needing a garrison to prevent it from rebelling and joining its original nation. You can station your own troops from native cities, hire allied troops if that city is friendly/allied to you, or hire mercinaries from that city at an increased cost. They will have a specific culture and can have their home city assigned to any city with a shared culture.Final thoughts- There are still other aspects, generals, naval combat, objectives/rewards, population and migrants, stockpiling food, etc. but the tutorial covers these aspects. The tutorial is only educational for the first hour or so, like I said, simple concept. The difficulty comes with taking these basic rules and balencing the food and gold across your empire, your troops to attack enemies and your garrisons to counter raids and supress uprisings. The introductory capmaign starts you as Phillip of Macedon as it guides your expansion. After a bit though, you have learned the game enough that you don't need a tutorial and just need some practice. I easily sunk 40 hours into that capmaign just taking my time, finding the most efficient way to set up supply lines and cheapest ways to maintain garrison without depleating my manpower reserves.That being said, I highly reccomend this game. The intro campaign lasts long enough to justify the price and it has plenty of replayability because you can go a different direction because the map is enormous. There are also other campaigns with the Peloponnesian War being very complex as well as a sandbox mode- play as any faction with no rules or time limits. "

												If you're me, you'll immediately pick this game up without looking at the reviews because you're a Greek History nerd.  If you're me again, you are deeply satisfied with the results.Hegemony Gold is a game set during the wars of Ancient Greece, specifically around Philip II and the Peloponessian war.  Instead of a game like Total War, all battles are set on the same map and provide a difficult challenge.  You have to make sure your troops have sufficient morale and food or else they'll rout and either be captured and executed, or have to reform at the nearest city.  It basically focuses more on the logisitics of war than the battles.  Very interesting and highly recommended.			"

												Players who e.g. like the Total War Series should give this a try as well as a low cost alternative. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been much marketing investment for the game overtime, though the concept is quite interesting. The game does not split up into a strategic and a battle map respectively, but lets the player scroll into the action from a more abstract point of view.The fact that the player’s army size is limited, there are revolts, supply rules and the player faces at least constant skirmishes with his neighbours constitutes a permanent challenge. However, units gain experience, including the reduction of supply needs and the possibility to provide cities with walls helps the player to control his expanding territory. Furthermore the game is great for people interested in the history of the period. Though not overwhelming, graphics are actually lovely and it is definitely worth giving the game a try if you are a strategy gamer. "

												A rich, unique grand strategy experience that manages to deliver a fair amount of tactics to boot! It's the only game, that I know of, that allows you to fight the Peloponnesian War (yay triremes!), so it's a must have for any Thucydides fans out there (you know who you are). The $20 price tag is fair considering how many hours of gameplay you can squeeze out of it; if you can manage to grab it on a sale so much the better. Overall I'm very impressed with it, especially considering it was made by four people...			"

												Hegemony is a grand strategy game from indie developer Longbow Games. It's pretty similar to Total War in a lot of ways, except that everything happens on the world map. All the action is in real time, but the player can pause the game and issue orders at will. This becomes very important as your empire expands, because the map is very large and past a certain point you'll likely be fighting multiple battles at any given time. Overall, it's a much slower-paced and deliberate kind of game than AoE or Starcraft that depends more on careful planning than actions-per-minute, but still much faster than turn-based strategy. It's also a rather low-stakes game, since no particular battle field defeat is likely to be fatal to your empire, and you can pretty much always recover with some time and effort. Outright losing a campaign would essentially require intentional self-sabotage.In terms of production values, the game clearly shows its creators' lack of resources. The unit models lack fidelity, the map is somewhat plain (aesthetically, that is, in mechanical terms there are a wide variety of environments), the sound effects are functional but get repetitive quickly, and the less said about the (thankfully rare) voice acting, the better. Still, none of these issues impact the gameplay itself.Like Total War, units are created as groups rather than as individual guys, and fight in formation. There are only a few broad unit categories, and most of the factions (especially in Greece proper) are pretty much the same, but most factions have at least one unique unit, and some of these really do alter strategies quite a bit. Basic tactics revolve around a battle line of heavy infantry, and an unskilled player could probably get through the game eventually just by swamping the enemy under as many hoplites as possible, but a mixed army with ranged support, light infantry for flanking, and cavalry for fighting the enemy light units will perform much better if used properly. Units have a morale stat, and the goal of most battles is to break the enemy's will rather than fight to the death. Broken units drop their weapons and attempt to flee at top speed to the nearest friendly city, at which point they return to their home town and join the reassembling unit there. If they are captured, they can either be executed or enslaved, without moral judgement. Units recruited from the player's native faction gain experience with each victory, which the player can invest in a few different stats (speed, morale, rate of food consumption, and siege skill).There is also naval combat, though the trireme (with Athenian and Persian variants) is the only ship available. it's a little bit finicky, to be honest, since how much damage you do is determined largely by the angle and speed at which the ships collide and they maneuver like, well, ships. It's usually just about who brought a larger fleet, or being lucky. Fortunately it isn't very important unless you're conducting amphibious invasions or raiding naval trade routes.A lot of the strategy in the game revolves around supply lines. Trade routes are constructed by the player, but in most cases it's pretty clear where they're supposed to go and it's mainly just a matter of connecting the dots. These routes produce a bit of gold, but their main purpose is transfering food. All land combat units consume food, and if they run out their morale will quickly drop to zero. Since demoralized units are pretty much useless, keeping an eye on your food supplies and ensuring that the far-reaches of your empire don't starve is in many ways more important to victory than the actual fighting. Harrassing an enemy's trade routes and pillaging their farms to starve a city's defenders can be a very effective strategy that the AI practices routinely. Since food production varies by season throughout the in-game year, the timing of a campaign can be very important. Do you want to move during harvest time so your armies can forage off the land while they slowly overcome the well-fed defenders, or in the middle of winter to more easily starve the enemy but at the risk of your units collapsing from hunger? There's no one ""correct"" strategy, but your tactics will have to reflect the specific conditions you're marching into.There's no base building in Hegemony, which ordinarily I would be disappointed by, but here it works for me. All structures have fixed, pre-placed positions on the map to reflect the actual geography of Ancient Greece. In addition to cities, there are forts, mines, watchtowers, farms, and shrines. The first three can be deconstructed, and are often found ruined, but the site can always be rebuilt. Forts and watchtowers are pretty self-explanatory, mines can be filled with either paid workers or slaves to provide gold, which acts as a population limit, and different types of shrines (heroic, logistics, and healing) provide different benefits to the units of the faction that controls them.There are three campaigns in the game and a sandbox mode. The campaigns are a bit more structured than Total War since the player is given specific objectives throughout, and the rewards for completing them are often substantial, but there aren't any time limits and once you complete the tutorial section of the beginner's campaign the map is completely open. I spent about 60 hours conquering the entire map in my first playthrough of the Macedonian campaign, even though I had technically finished all the objectives much earlier than that. As a history student, I personally really appreciate the Civilopedia-style background information on pretty much everything in the game, and the developers make it clear that they've done their homework.There are a number of different factions in the game, and a diplomacy system, but it's very simplistic. Other factions have a fixed hostility level to yours, based on the historical relations between them, and a variable intimidation statistic that depends on your relative strength and how close they are. These factors affect the frequency of attacks, and how much it costs the player to establish a truce or an alliance. The most important effects of the faction system are on the main gameplay. A faction's hostility determines the size of the garrison required to supress the inevitable rebellions, while allies fall under the player's control immediately and don't require a garrsion at all. Allied units are also slightly superior to the mercenaries recruited from most conquered cities, though they still have weaker morale than the player's native units, and don't gain experience. As I mentioned earlier, each faction also has unique units which can only be produced from their native cities. I often choose my targets specifically to gain access to a particular unit I like.In conclusion, Hegemony is an extremely innovative game which makes up for low production values with simple but deep mechanics. Highly recommended to all strategy fans.			"

												I love this Game. Played so much. Such Satisfaction. Play as the Persians and change the course of history and utterly destroy those pesky Greeks. Western thought be damed all hail the God KING!!! or Play as Athens and take over Persian anatolia instead of Alexander, maybe play as Sparta and lead the greek armies or stuff up history untterly and play as a tribe living near the Danube river and destory both Greece and Persia. The map is seemless zooming all the way in looking at your capital then zooming out to see the progress of your Hoplites in a battle in seconds. The game looks simple and easy to manage after a few hours of getting the ropes. Which is good, peaceful infact when compaired to Franchises like Paradox or Total war. However don't be fooled, It might seem simple but you will have desk slamming moments if your not prepared to defend against sudden attacks. Horsmen riding in on there dammed horses oh so evily taking out farms just before winter. Before you know it you have a huge food deficit. Your new conquests start rebelling, ohh whats that? (sigh) oh great Athens has arrived on the other side of your empire with 6 ships packed of Hoplites wanting there city back. One of 2 things could happen you laugh gleefully as you mange to wipe out the invaders or..........Laugh gleefully in a few seasons in game taking it all back and Executing all the enemies that surrended to your blood bathed armies. REVENGE!!!! The map is huge with many places ploped in if you know your Greek lore and Mythology with a decent amount of historical facts tossed in for good measure.  With 3 campains and a sandbox mode able to pay as any faction. Some people may complain about the lack of diplomacy but who needs it. Old men talking to old men to form alliances and such is such a drag to the young, fit and ready to campaign hoplites just conquer it all. If anyone has an interest in classical era Greece then this is the game for YOU! if you like Phillip II of Macedon and his son Alexander and his rise, this is the game for YOU! If you enjoy the 30 years peloponnesian war with one campaign centered on the Athenian Empire and the Other on the Spartan led Peloponnesian league, then this is a game for YOU! if you like conquest, Then well yes you guessed it, you should just get this game. This company just released their new title Hegemony Rome where you can play as Gaulic tribes and Julius caesar taking it for Rome then you should just get BOTH GAMES!			"

But i always thought, this would be much better if you could play all the city states.Guess, what, in this you can! It may not be as fancy as total war, or as intense as hearts of iron but it has a lot of intricacy and detail, it is well worth a look. Especially if you like ancient greece.			"

												This game is actually quite good, it certainly is a strategy game all it's own, it certainly doesn't beat any graphics contests and is not quite satisfying instantly, but as you forge an empire with supply lines and subjugate and enslave your enemies, continuously fighting new foes you begin to appreciate how great a game it really is, it's actually really hard to start snowballing, unlike most strategy I play. And if you want to, you can play as Persia or Scythia and conquer all those silly Greek states!			"

												Hegemony is my favorite strategy game because the developers filled it to the brim with their love and care, which is 100 times more important than what I term ""technical graphics"" - number of polygons and texture detail. The game truly captures the feeling of ancient warfare by altering accepted gameplay; For example, building town walls makes occupied cities more likely to rebell and thus requires larger garrissons (why shouldn't they feel more secure and independant behind walls?). They have also shifted the scope of the warfare, from the genre's standard province by province conquest, we now have a methodical, strategic border creep, city by city. This game gave me some amazing moments. The most recent from when I first started the Spartan campaign. I felt resonably confident and thus cranked up the difficulty all the way. It started off well, I controlled a single island-city on the Ionian coast, which is perfect for figuring out your surroundings. Yet, I had sufficent numbers of spartan recruits and a large subsidy from home to be comfident. Then I made my biggest mistake, by building more ships and an extra brigade. I was dangerously overstretched and thoughtlessly attacked the closest city on the Athenian-held coast with my hoplites. Unexpectedly, the city was reinforced, my spartans lost and I deep in desperation. I felt just like the Athenians after Sicily.My army was rebuilding, yet my manpower was used up by either replacing ships killed when I was't looking or still under construction from my earlier expansion. So, I used my single remaining ship to transport a starting spearman brigade to the south (spearmen are this game´s equivalent of WW2 France). There lay a tiny island city basicly undefended and even my spearman brigade could capture it. It had neither farms nor mines. It didn't matter, I only wanted it's manpower. I thus used it as a naval base, freeing up my spartans for infantry. That is beacause captured cities can only produce mercenaries, which means expensive, second-rate troops. They can still produce ships at the same price and quality - wood is wood and ships are ships. My main base was still short on manpower and for the remainder of the year, I had to cower behind my walls as the Athenians burnt my fields. I knew I would take my revenge upon them, yet all I could do was send my spearmen to do the same to them. I knew I would later take that city, fisting my hands. I soon did.			"

												Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece is a very intelligent game, both immediate and deep. I would define it as an ""operational grand strategy game"". The emphasis is obviously on logistics: the real trick to success is keeping your troops well supplied and in good shape, and that can be hard, especially during sieges and winters. Sieges in particular are rather well represented in a fun way, as you'll need to block enemy supply routes, both on land and on sea, while keeping your own open. Strategical maneuvering is also very important, and delaying the movement of an army might mean the collapse of your empire. Your state is almost like a house of cards: lose a key region for your supply network and your income, and you'll find yourself in big trouble. The AI itself is very skilled at exploiting those weaknesses in your grand strategy, and you'll find yourself often at war on multiple fronts. Unlike many strategy games, as you grow there won't be any kind of avalanche effect: you will have more resources and more troops but your borders will also be longer, and you'll find out that you can't deploy that many troops in a specific campaign anyway: small and mid-sized kingdom still pose a very tangible threat even when  you're the biggest empire on the map.The tactical part is simplistic: it's an RTS at that, but the mechanics are a bit lacking. Also, proper tactical maneuvering is still very important but most of the time you'll find that there isn't a lot of room for maneuvering.Other than that, this game has a huge plus: the immersion value. It recreates the era pretty well, and to this day I've never seen a more detailed recreation of Ancient Greece in a videogame, with many historical kingdoms and city-states making their appearance in Hegemony and so many missions you have to complete to establish your dominion over Greece. You'll never get bored as you'll always have things to do, and the historical grand campaign lasts many, many hours.In short, I highly recommend the game. It's a very original and innovative title, and if you like historical immersion and strategy go for it: you won't be disappointed. "

												Hegemony is a top tier real time strategy game. In it you must expand your starting kingdom through war and diplomacy. There is also historical campains which start in certain senarios, however I have not played these and therefore will not comment on them.Pros:- In this game you have to plan your campains wisely, each season will directly impact food production, which is central to gameplay. The impact of feeding your troops (logistics) really deepens the campain over other strategy games such as total war.- The camera can be scrolled in and out to see the larger picture or into great detail. It reminds me of the supreme commander camera.- Aestheticly this game has an interesting ""board gamey"" style, with units lookng like peices on the board. I enjoy this art style as it is unique from other games.- The map is huge, and gives players vast areas to conquer.- There are small histroy notes scattered throughout the map which help immerse you (and are interesting to history buffs like me).- The music is simple but also helps immersion into the ancient greek world.Cons:- The diplomacy in this game is very shallow, and boils down to paying your enemies enough so they will stop invading you so you can focus on eating another nation.- You will constantly be raided by Athens throughout the entire game, as Athens has naval island bases scattered throughout the greek world. This is not really a con as it gives a difficulty boost to the game, but it can be annoying.- The unit diversity is not very high. All the greeks have the same hopilites, barbarians have the same medium cav, thrace has the same peltasts. However, some of the greek factions have hopilites which are stronger in combat, some are stronger at seiges. Thracian petalst are vastly different to greek peltast. Persians have elite heavy cav. You will find the unit diversity to be simple, yet effective.In conclusion, this is a very enjoying strategy game which is great for strategy gamers and history gamers. Given that this was developed by a small team, it is remarkable how polished, complete, and high quality it is. 9/10			"

Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece squashes every bug, adds in tonnes of content, and stands as one of, if not THE best, Grand Strategy RTS games I've ever played.

												This game is SICK! At ten dollars, this is the steal of the summer sale thus far. Combining elements of Grand Ages: Rome and Rome: Total War with some realistic tactical micro-management that really makes you plan ahead and not get too sloppy, Hegemony Gold is a game that will make anyone who always gauges the quality of a solid classical Empire-building Sim between the City micro-management and the combat system set this game as the new benchmark for utility.It's just deep enough to be historically relevant and to make you think a bit before you act, but not so deep that you get lost in the details or want to bash the keyboard in frustration as there is just too much to be handled at once.Hegemony Gold gives you just enough combat challenge to keep you on your toes while keeping a steady flow of the cycle of conquer, expand, and maintain element that keeps things realistic and challenging.This game is both challenging and fun, a real bargain and true gem.

												Changed my review to recommend.  If the game won't start, run it from the Steam folder on your computer directly.  It works then.This is a great game that is simple in it's concept but difficult to master.  It is ""smaller"" in scope than the Total War games but has one thing they don't.  When fighting a tactical battle in Hegemony you are actually picking the terrain you will be on.  Unlike Total War where you are picking one of several pre-made tactical layouts.  In Hegemony, you *can* pick your place. Great game for a very low price.  Steam should try and support it by at least putting the work arounds as a sticky topic.  STEAM read this:   I would buy more expensive games from you but I can't trust that you work. You have no policy to handle complaints, so you won't see much $$ from me.			"

												This game is about Macedon. But not yet another game about Alexander the Great !It's even better, it's about his father, Philip II of Macedon, whose achievement was even more incredible than conquering Persia and India : he unified Greece.Yes, he is the Guy who beat Athens, Thebes (The Dragon of Beotia) and even Sparta !The game is about tactical battles, some simplistic diplomacy, strategy, but more important, logistics.Troops need moral. And moral needs food. And food doesn't magically move itself from fields to warriors. You need supply routes.The main campaign is driven by a lot (and I mean a lot) of Objectives. Some of them, historical, being mandatory for your progress towards victory. All of them having their own rewards.Battles are tactical, with use of charging and flanking being very important.The game is not perfect (far from it). Graphics are mediocre. It can sometimes be teadious.But the journey of Philip II to become the Hegemon of Greece is just amazing.9/10			"

												I like the historical aspects of this game. I also like the historical accurate units and buildings and like. What I do not like is that you fit 40 slaves into a mine, and that is it, any over, you dont get any more income. I dont like that the recruiting is 1.9 or .5 a wk depending on settler size of city, now it maybe historically correct but discounting the national unity and the drive at which philp gave to drive out any invading army is also abismal at best. He recruited on loans of money and patriotism. Now with all that said, I like the mechanic that is used to simulate revolts. I will say over all that this game is worth cosideration at a lower price due to my dislikes and the fact that there is no real ""set mining material to refine"" mechanism. I mean you get the locations of mines, but not the products of the mine or the actual costs for the materials. That would make the game more interesting instead of capping mines at 40 slaves to make 80 coins a turn and there is no budget really other than income vs expense so no way to really do anything beyond yearly reports.I know I am probably being alot more critical of the games than most people but honestly I have done research, quite alot recently, and found that most games dont really want to go into how economies or military actions, etc actually affect the population nor how it affects international diplomacy. I am not knocking the developers by any means. They did a great job of the historical elements. I just hope that they have planned for the new one more units and more economy and more historical events. A suggestion to the developers for the new game, Add Galleys... Galleys and Gladass were ships that helped most countries rule the Med region for years. I am shocked that you didnt add at least a shortened version for the greek campaigns... Unless you just coupled them with Thrimes. Then I understand.			"

												Hegemony is truly a game about building an Empire. Once you begin expanding your Empire you will soon notice that you need more food, Supply nodes, Gold, troops and suitable defensive locations in order to just exist. You can never be satisfied because just outside your borders lies the mines and or fertile lands that may fuel your next campaign across Thessaly, The Danube River, Asia Minor or many, many other provinces that, once within your grasp, will enable you to recruit allied/Mercenary troops to complement your native army, land and sea supply lines to feed your cities and army, gold to fuel your diplomatic and military needs and more territory to call your own. Speaking as someone who has a degree in History and knows a lot about antiquity and Mesoamerican civs, the game does a amazing job of presenting Ancient Greece, it's warring states, cities, people, and events. If you have any interest Greek History, Military tactics and Geography, this game and it's successors are exelent as a introduction on the matter.To Quote Phillip II, the great: "" My son, ask for thyself another kingdom, for that wich I leave is too small for thee"".

I came back to this recently and realised what a gem it is! I've been playing heaps the last couple weeks and it's bloody awesome :) Watch out for rage mode as you are concentrating on one part of the map then realise a bunch of skirmishers have slipped into unguarded parts of your kingdom and stolen all your mines and burned your farms. Usually enough of a casus belli for me to divert my entire campaign to burning all traces of their civilisation and salting the earth - Carthage style.10/10 would raze and pillage the Paeonians again just because they burned my tomato crop again.

												I simply cannot believe when I read this comments here, some people wrote bad review about this game, then recommend the game to others ?! I woudn t recommend this game to anyone, because game is simply bad and poor, maybe good idea, but bad realisation. My opinion 3/10!			"

												Very good game which has hundreds of hours to play if u like to play in sandbox, but the campaing in itself is too short and the missions seem a bit forced towards the end.			"
