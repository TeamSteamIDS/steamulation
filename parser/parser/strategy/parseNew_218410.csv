												I don’t like real time strategy or tower defense games, you can’t out click a computer and they usually cheat.  So it’s seem odd that I would even buy this game, let alone log 196 hours (wait, how many? I’m not even done with the Play+.)  What made the game appeal to me was the RPG element.  I like RPGs, it’s reassuring to know you can grind and level up to make up for your lack of skill and intelligence.The game offers 25 stages plus bonus levels that are all replayable (didn’t realize that’s not a real word) at not just different difficulties but also with a different mix of enemies.  There are only six characters (towers) but each has 10 or so skills which adds to the variety.  There are 19 enemies including repallets (figured that wasn’t a real word) and five bosses.The best part is the characters.  The dialogue and interaction is engrossing often hilarious.  The replay mode unlocks Azra’s diary with extra (also hilarious) insight to her background and the other characters (SPOILER ALERT!! Slak knows how to read and write.)  In conclusion (that never gets old,) Defender’s Quest: title too long is a great mix of tower defense and RPG.  Most importantly, it’s fun.  If you had to pay all 15 bucks for this game, it’s worth it.  If it should happen to be on sale around Thanksgiving or Christmas (or whatever other holiday you celebrate on your fast track to hell) you’d be a fool not to buy it (unless you’ve got something better to do with 196 hours, like work.)

												You start it up and notice the game doesn't rescale to your desktop native res and you feel like just passing it by but with all those great user reviews I stuck for a while... and the game itself is rock solid. Fun RPG/Tower mechanics with a lot of variation and the reward for succesful experimentation is goodies that enable to tackle even harder challenges. The story/characters in the game are fine and entretaining as well but it's the gameplay that will keep you enthused and enthralled and maybe even captivated till you fully master it. Even if you just beat it all on normal mode it's well worth its asking price. Pick it up and enjoy, easy to recommend even for non genre fans.			"

												This poor game has been languishing in my library for ages without getting any attention from me beyond the intro, only to finally be given a proper playing yesterday evening. It's now 7 in the morning, and I've only just now turned it off because it is just that good. Honestly, when I first got it I had a set of other ""big budget AAA"" style games that I decided to play instead because they were basically ""shinier"" and supposedly great, but so far I'm having a lot more fun with this game now than those games then. I wasn't expecting much from a tower defense style game, but it actually has a story, humor, some challenging gameplay, and rpg elements (all the things I thought I would have found in those other titles). In short, I should have thrown out my preconceptions initially and just played this game, I'd have had a lot more fun from the jump instead of just now months (maybe year?) later.			"

												7.5/10If you ever need proof that Flash Games can be worth paying for, take a look at this.With so many TD games out there, it's hard to choose a good one. This is a good way to ease into the genre, with solid mechanics and just a sprinkling of plot and simple yet engaging characters. Mix in a little touch of RPG elements for upgrades and skill trees for your human ""Towers"" and here you are. There are many routes to victory, and challenging achievements to encourage you to try replaying with a different strategy. You get what you pay for and because it's built in flash it runs on ANYTHING! Worth a pop at the price, even more so in a sale.			"

												This is a surprisingly good little tower defense game with RPG mechanics. As a commander, you can recruit troops, equip them with weapons and armor and control their few skills when leveling up. It is pretty basic, yet very deep. The levels are single screen and grid based. You place your characters down and they automatically attack as enemies approach them. There are 6 classes, a basic melee, long range, healer, ice mage, slow defensive breaker and all powerful dragon with short and long range attacks. It costs PSI to place your characters, and more PSI to retract them (to move them).How do you get PSI? Well you start with it, but then as you kill enemies, you gain more PSI and you have a maximum of course. You are defending a summoner against the waves of enemies and the summoner (your player character) can take a beating and has plenty of HP, so the game is forgiving, but rewarding if you make it through the level without being damaged.You can 'boost' your characters at the cost of PSI. There are many levels of boos that enable skills that you've unlocked through leveling up your characters. When you level up your characters, you select their perk. Which has a simple perk tree of skills and passive abilities. It is a nice little system, but I find myself making the same perk choices instead of diversifying.Oh and death is not perminant for your characters. If someone dies, just use PSI to bring them back. If your player character dies, you lose the level and need to restart. These levels are quick, especially at 4x speed, so nothing is really lost.While the game boasts a rich story.... I found myself hitting the skip button. I just don't play games for the story. You read the story as you unlock new levels and progress through a Mario World style map with all of the levels plotted as map points.The game is very easy to pick up and play, but not just that, it encourages replaying the levels with 3 different difficulties (and a 'casual' difficulty as a 4th). If there's an insurmountable level.... replay old levels *cough* grind. But replaying old levels never seems like a chore, its more of a joy. Even if you keep replaying the same level on the same difficulty, every playthrough is different, since your characters level up and you can change your tactics.The game is a lot of fun, and while its deep, its never overwhelmingly deep. There's not an overwhelming micro management either, even if you can micro manage everything.I highly recommend it. Its a fun little game, relaxing and never gets all that intense. I found myself playing it on 4x speed and that seems like it should be the average speed. Is it worth the $15? Its a game you can sink hours and hours into, so you'll get a lot of relaxing playtime for your dollar.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Defender Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a 2D game with a unique blend of TD and RPG from Level Up Labs. It features characters / companions who act as 'towers' and need to be strategically placed around the map to defend your main character Azra. Unlike a tower defense game, however, you can level up and equip items for your companions to help them improve in combat.You take the role of Azra, a royal librarian of the Kingdom of Ash which is currently being ravaged by a plague. Azra gets infected and thrown into 'The Pit', a place where all dead or dying are placed to keep the kingdom safe because those who die from the Plague become 'Revenants', undead monsters that are immune to physical harm. Azra soon discovers that she has the power to enter both the living world and the 'Half-Way' world, a place between the living realm & the realm of the dead. In this realm, she can summon her companions to fight the Revenants in their spirit form and eventually kill them.PROS:+ Refreshing new mix of genres+ 8-bit sprite art style that works well with the game+ Character / Companion progression is deep and extensive+ Well designed Maps and Mazes+ Very challenging difficulty levels+ 6 base classes (towers) which can progress into different builds depending on your play-style+ Dialogues between characters are humorous+ Steam Workshop supportCONS:- Cutscene art work could use a lot of improvement (especially the character designs)- Story is a bit weak- Balance issues (some classes are outright better than others)- Some necessary but boring grinding sessions to progress- No real 'HD' or Widescreen Support- No Steam Cloud SupportCONCLUSION:It is a GOOD GAME and one of the better tower defense games out there. I can easily recommend this game if you're looking for a challenging and unique game since it mixes RPG elements to the tried-and-tested Tower Defense genre. The 8-bit sprites, animations and effects are nice and work well with the game's art style although the Cutscene artwork could really use improvements. The levels are very well planned and are fun to play. Finally, the in-game dialogue between your companions is funny and quite entertaining.I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price since it’s only $14.99 or your regional equivalent. With simple graphics, this game is not system requirement heavy and can easily run even on netbook computers making this a perfect game when you're on vacation, working, passing the time, or in any other situation where you are not with your main gaming system.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												One of the best TDs that I have played. There is a very nice background history in the game, very nice (and challenger) lvls, achievements, rewards and, well, everything I want to see in a TD. There's a lvl system for each unit, making it unique, where you can equip with some unique items. Awesome, worth every penny.			"

												To start off, I just wanted to state that I am NOT a fan of tower defense type games. I find them repetitive, grindy, bland, and not innovative.BUT, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a true gem in the tower defense genre. It combines the elements of a tower defense game along with rpg elements, which gives the game a surprisingly fun twist. Instead of just placing troops that do not have meaning around, I was able to level up my characters and as I progressed I learned their stories.Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is not only a tower defense game, it has a story, unlike many games of the same genre. The story was nothing special, but there was a story nonetheless.If you're an achievement hunter (♥♥♥♥♥) like I am, then you'll be disappointed because a few of the achievements are a bit grindy. On the other hand, the developers were nice enough to allow you to go into the Options and increase exp and gold gain by 300%. I cannot stress enough how this option is amazing and that I think more devs should implement it, because of how grindy some achievements are. This also makes the game a little bit more on the easier side. I hardly ever lost a round. I can count on both hands how many times I've lost. The game is very simple, I was able to beat the base game without generic recruits. I did recruit the generic characters in order to obtain all the gold stars/side quests. The UI is also very simple. Skill trees are simple. Everything about this game is very simple, easy to learn, and relaxing.If you're looking for a casual game, then I'd definitely recommend this game. A lot of times, I find myself on this game when I am watching tv or a movie.Overall, I'd definitely recommend Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten. It's a true gem of it's genre and should not be dismissed so easily, just because it's a casual tower defense game.			"

												At first glance, Defender's Quest appears to be a silly little indie game with big dreams. The characters are bright and cartoony, and their dialogue is marked with sass. Their battle sprites display whimsical touches, like the ranger who spins her bow before firing. One of the promotional spellbooks Azra can equip, the Book of Face, introduces the Internet's beloved Trollface to the otherwise sword-and-sorcery setting. Focusing on the one-liners would be simple, as they are good. However, the core plot has heft: it would make a good Dungeons and Dragons campaign or fantasy adventure novel. Royal librarian Azra must survive in a quarantine pit the size of a small nation, while she's pursued by mysterious figures. It features conspiracy, betrayal, and explosions. Careful gamers shouldn't be surprised a USDA-certified English major wrote the script. The wacky comedy and childish in-fighting among Azra's companions allows the team to quickly bond. These light-hearted intra-party friendships and feuds add personal stakes to the more pervasive dangers of the pit. The story is delivered in slideshow style before every town and battle, tying the narrative neatly to combat.Combat is handled like a tower defense game. Enemies travel in waves from spawn points. As they walk into the attack range of stationary heroes, they suffer the effects of the heroes' attacks. The heroes are unable to move from where they're summoned, as they're doing combat on a spiritual plane where bodies just get in the way. The cornerstone of battle strategy comes from placing the six types of heroes in the appropriate location. After recruiting story characters (such as Slak, the madcap, murderous berserker), faceless extras of the same type become hirable. If that's all there was to combat, it would be a delightful diversion. However, each character gains experience points, which can be spent to learn new combat skills or boost existing ones. Once learned, most of these skills can't be used immediately. Characters must be boosted in battle, which draws from the same Psi pool Astra uses to summon allies and cast spells of her own. It can be a challenging balancing act to position the proper allies, keep them boosted, reposition troops to respond to new threats, and maintain wide scale battlefield control with Azra's spells. Thankfully, slowing the game's speed (and pausing it altogether) are simple options. The keyboard commands are simple to learn and encourage faster play, but nothing's wrong with the mouse either.With all the moving parts that go into battle, the multiple levels of accessibility are a nice touch. Each character has nine different attack modes including ""attack the strongest enemy"" and ""attack the enemy with least immunity to status effects."" Understanding the interplay between these attack modes isn't necessary for most of the core game, but integral to completing the optional levels. Furthermore, failure isn't necessarily punished. The default settings infer experience and money penalties for losing battles, but these can be changed based on individual preference. Redistributing skill points to explore different character builds costs money, but not a fortune. The steepest cost is the time it takes to click through all the advancements. The largest concession to the casual-vs.-hardcore debate is the option to increase experience points. Players who care more for the story and the thrill of rapid advancement can run with it. Players who want their hardcore bragging rights can lift their noses at the low-hanging fruit. True challenge-jockeys can set their sights on the more exclusive achievements, many of which are challenging even with gushing wells of experience points.Defender's Quest is a short game, but provides plenty of options to extend the experience. Completing every level at the highest difficulty takes about twenty hours; increasing the experience and money levels in the options decreases the playtime. However, the New Game+ mode, which becomes available after completing the base game, adds considerable challenge. The core story stays the same, but combat's modified with new enemy powers, new maps, and new bonus stages. The New Game+ also provides a delicious means of upgrading the magic items earned in the core game, unlocking unique modifiers for each relic. As enjoyable as these new features are, Azra's journal is the best addition to the New Game+. After every major battle, Azra updates her journal with commentary on the story. In the process, she details her internal struggles and fleshes out the world. The extra character moments in Azra's journal are enjoyable enough that their inclusion as bonus material seems strange. They'd serve the story better as part of its body rather than as bonus material.In spite of all this praise, Defender's Quest isn't perfect. Despite the snap and crackle of the script, it features several glaring spelling and punctuation errors--especially in Azra's journal. Purchasing equipment isn't as interesting as other elements of character customization, but the numerical benefits encourage frequently clicking through upgrades. The music is initially encouraging, but loops quickly. Thankfully, it can be toggled independently of the sound effects, which provide texture and valuable combat cues. The final battle song is a notable exception. That beast should be blasted loud and proud.Between its addictive gameplay and sliding difficulty scale, Defender's Quest offers gamers a great deal for such a small investment of time. It probably won't make a true believer out of anyone whose parents were killed by tower defense games, but it's good at what it does: drawing people in and refusing to let them go until they've finished ""just one more level.""

												Now that we have real reviews I wanted to give this game a better response.As a long time tower defense player, I have to say this game is in the top 3 of all time. I'll try to explain why I love it so much, and why I'm so excited for the sequel that was recently announced.MechanicsThis game provides somewhat traditional mechanics if you're familiar with TD games. Players can build units on the perimeter of the path only, so there is no blocking/routing mechanics to worry about. Unit's have different attack types that are better and worse for some situationsWhat is unique about this game is that units level up in a persistent manner between levels, allowing your units to grow over time, This included an entire skill tree for each class of units that can be customized to your play style. Additionally, units have a weapon and armor equipment slot and the game does a good job of making this meaningful by introducing rare equipment a bit later in the game.Levels are replayable so you can grind your team a bit if you feel a little weak or would like to beef up a bit before a boss level. To compliment this aspect of the game, each level can be played on different difficulty levels, which provide bigger rewards at the cost of a higher difficulty. This aspect of the game kept me going back and trying to beat my records and old levels in order to get some of the better rare gear.Lastly, the game features a fast forward mode which is a welcome sight for those who play a lot of tower defense games. It really helps grinding out those later levels.StoryIt's rare for a TD game to have an in-depth story, but Defender's Quest does a great job with this. It's not ground breaking, but it certainly sets a nice tone and even introduces a bit of moral dilemma that plays into the unit mechanics later in the game. I won't spoil it, but I will say that the level of narrative impressed me, and kept me engaged until the end.Graphics/SoundsAll standard stuff here. You can look at the screenshots and get an idea of what you're into. In general I'd say that the graphics do a good job of matching the needs of the gameplay, and the animations are smooth and crisp even during hectic late game levels. The graphics change into a pleasant style during story segments and do a good job of relaying the emotion and facial expressions of the characters.SummaryAll in all, this game really scratched a Tower Defense/RPG itch that I'd been craving for a long time. If you can pick the game up on sale and like TD games I'd recommend buying it without hesitation.			"

												Defender's Quest is the best Tower Defense game ever made.  It combines a well-done story with solid RPG mechanics and crisp short tower defense scenarios.  If you are on the fence about TD games this is the best way to ease yourself into the genre.  In fact, this might be the only TD game you'll ever enjoy - and that's totally ok.  It's as good as this genre gets.			"

												I've played a lot of tower defense. I used to play Warcraft III custom maps where the tower defense genre was cut from. Defender's Quest does a nice job of putting a well developed story with well developed characters into tower defense gameplay without it feeling pasted on. It keeps it simple. There are only a few basic towers to choose from, but each tower acts like a character in your party and you can equip most of them with weapons and armor (no weapons or armor for a dragon and no armor for the barbarian/main melee guy). The maps are laid out well enough that consideration to where to place your troops does make a big difference.There is also a nice take on the gameplay by offering 4 difficulty levels. You get rewards for completing the level, but you get bonus rewards for not taking a single point of damage. If you do that, you can get a lot of extra scrap (money) and unique items.What I'm doing on my second playthrough is going as far as I possibly can while only buying recruits and never any items on the easiest mode. When I hit my first failure, I go back to the very start and try to complete each level on the hardest mode possible. After I fail once, I will go down to an easier mode and so on until I am right back at the easiest mode and therefore, the furthest out I've ever been.The main game is not that long and there isn't a ton of replayability to this game once you complete it. That is why it is only worth a few bucks...but it's worth a few bucks. I hear they are making a Defender's Quest II and I hope that is at least as good. Even when it is, this is still a pretty fun tower defense and something that feels more refreshing than you might think when you come back to it after a long time.			"

												When I bought the game I thought ""well, there's just another TD game"". But, it turns out that it's not your average build and kill game. For the first 4 hours I've been trying to finish up the story of the game. The story took me in and I just wanted to know how it all ends. If you are thinking about buying this game read on to see why you probably should. After playing 12 hours of the game I have finished the main story and went on to do some harder difficulties and other challenges. This game is fun in it's own unique way. Not only do you get an interesting story to follow, but also get stuck in character menu thinking how you should level up the skills for each fighter. The only hotkey you will probably need to remember is ""space bar"" for pause. That is the only thing you will constantly hit to allow yourself some time to think before everything goes to hell. The game can be challenging even on the normal level. ( The level difficulties go as follows: Casual – Normal – Advanced – Extreme). After your done with Normal, you can move on to a New Game+, which is way harder and more challenging. And yes, this is an RPG game. You will probably spend more time looking at the level up menu for characters rather than fighting monsters. It's not bad at all, but be prepared to think and compare different builds for the same class of fighter. There are 7 types of characters – Berserker, Ranger, Healer, Ice mage, Knight, Dragon and Librarian ( who is the thing that you actually need to protect).The simple graphics was also done in a pretty good way. All characters are different and you can easily tell the difference. Everything looks the way it should in this kind of game. The only thing I noticed is that when the Ice mage casts his spells it can be quite hard to see the enemy and how much health they still have. On a positive note, the graphics look smooth overall and you won't feel like your playing the game from the 80's at the same time. To add to this I can also point out that the soundtrack is very good. It fits the theme of the game very nice and allows you to feel emotions from the battle field and from dialogues. I am yet not sure how many hours you can play until you finish everything, but I would guess it's quite a bit. I think this game will keep you from sleeping for at least a few hours after you should have gone to bed. I honestly think that this game is a must have product for not just RPG and TD lovers but also for average gamers. If you have missed the sale don't worry, you won't regret buying a game for a full price.  "

												EDIT UPDATE!!! THIS GAME WAS ALREADY AWESOME BUT MR.LABS COMMENTARY ABOUT HOW DELUXIFIED IT IS HAS MADDDDDEEEE MY DAY. cAPS ftw.<3 Also still a great hilarious game.To be honest, when I saw this game I only  picked it up cause it was cheap, but damn if i were to talk about a game that game me the most value for my dollars, well it would have to be this one. If you're a fan of playing games through again, with like a second more difficult mode, that gives more insight into the story, well then this one is definitely for you.If you're a person who likes turned based rpgs, there is alot of the elements of being able to take your time and strategize, while all the same, you can just charge through really quick once you know your strengths, and how to use them most effectively.And lastly, If you love a good laugh that was written and delivered amazingly, you should totally name all the main characters after your friends and loved ones. It makes for a good laugh, and you think of your friends, slightly helping the social aspect of the brain, while completely being absorbed into this great single player game, that will make you think your not alone in playing it for so many hours...and if you're not really alone inside your head, well that makes the adventure even more interesting!  Such a great game. I recommend it a few times over.			"

												What can I say?  Watch the videos above.  Look at the user reviews.  People LOVE this game.  The Devs, LOVE the people who love this game.  They gave us a FREE HD remaster.  They even give you a Demo to try before you buy.  What can I POSSIBLY say about this game that hasn't been said already in all of that?  It is one of MY favorite TD games, if not the best TD game out there.  It's simple, not too flashy, not too frustrating, humorous and has RPG elements.  These Towers aren't just thoughtless machines driven to kill because you ordered them to...  No, that one there?  That's Slak the shirtless Berserker with the deranged mind and the awesome sword ripping up those ghouls on the tip of that island, right in the middle of the carnage where he can do the most damage.  GO SLAK KILL, KILL, KILL!  BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!  Yeah, these guys are my peeps, my group, MY ARMY.  They ARE SO MUCH MORE than towers.  So what can I say?  PLAY.  THE.  GAME.   ~'nuff said.  >:)			"

												Unreal that this has slipped through my radar for almost 3 years. A tower defense game where your towers are people that you actually care about, not just fire tower #23. The mixture of RPG elements just puts it over the top. Extremely worth the money and I'm only 2 hours in!P.S. The writing is pretty damn funny at times.			"

												A mix of RPG and Tower Defense. This was my first game on steam, and I bought this because it was on sale and very very very cheap. So I dip my finger on the steam pond because of this game, and now I am drowned in a sea of games. Buying a very cheap game, I don't have any high expectation about this, but instead I got a very good game, a quite funny story, and for me personally because it combined two of my fave genre. If it happen to be on sale with a very very cheap price, then buy it...			"

												Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is one of the best tower defense games I've ever played.It's simply like that, easy to learn and hard to master. The normal gamemode is soo easy even if you only play with the main characters (for the achievement). But after you completed the normal gamemode, you get the harder mode, where you play the story again, but with additional missions for specific characters. There it's going to be impossible to beat the game without using your brain.Totally worth its money! Gogo buy it, you'll have many good hours ;)			"

												Well, reviewing a title that is available for 2 years now seems useless, yet i'll do it anyway :-)Judging by the graphics i wonder why i even bought it. Maybe because i like Tower-Defense-Games.But i was suprised with this cute little quillet.What exactly is it?It's a TD-Game without towers. But with people. Typical RPG-People like berzerkers, mages, healers and rangers and...And you'll keep your ""Towers"" throughout the game and they'll receive XP and level-up. You can even color them and give them names.You move through a story with cutscenes, but mainly you'll fight waves of enemies with your party.The good: Borderless fullscreen AKA non-exclusive Fullscreen. Yay. Scaled to your resolution OR changed resolution. Nifty! Don't like the speed of advancement? Change XP/monetary reward to 300%! Or 50%. Leveling and outfitting your ""towers"" is a nice approach. You'll have veterans and noobs to place on each map. Speed adjustment from 0x (pause) to 4x. Nice. Pausable at all times. No pressure there. You can adjust your partymembers fighting tactics and even make them persistant (attack which target first, use high power abilities on lower foes etc.) Beside your party you'll have your main hero that has misc. spells at her disposal. TD-like you can play each map in different difficulties with proportional rewards. It pays to replay an older mission on EXPERT! The way they make you ""like"" their facebook/twitter-page was really cute. I almost felt bad NOT to click :-) Workshop! For those extra hours to waste It has a real story with cute cutscenes. I admit to have skipped much of it, but for some it may add immersion.The bad: For some, it may possibly lack depth of strategy/difficulty. It looks more like a ""casual"" tower-defense. Ok, to be nit-picky: The skills you're able to choose are too few. No big descisions to make, you're getting themall more or less anyway.TL;DR:Bought ""Defenders of time"" at the same time and it seemed much more promising. Oh boy was i wrong.Kicked ""DoT"" off of my HD after 2 minutes and played this one for hours. Graphics is not everything.This is a fun and refreshing towerdefense-game where you keep your ""towers"" and level them up. Also you'lltry to outfit them with better weapons and armor. I surely had my fun. Would be even worth fullprice!			"

												I have played a lot of tower defense games.  Overall I would recommend this game and would rank it in a top 10 tower defense games category.Pros:-Extensive gameplay-Smart balance and upgrades-Good amount of levels-Good and unique character balance-Demo gives you a good taste of what to expectCons:-Level upgrade limits to 9 (desired one or two more)-Limit of character upgrades of 60-Due to the two above, there are a last 2 or 3 levels that were not possible to complete.Desired (or recommended to the Defender's Quest team):-The map is a cool concept but felt there could have been a couple of paths in the desert with some unique desert concept or monster-Custom level designer			"

												Like many others have said, let me start this by saying I don't like tower defense games. At all. Those have never held my interest for too long. Despite this, I bought this game after Rock Paper Shotgun showcased it many, many years ago.If I had to choose my favorite indie game, it would be Defender's Quest for sure. Nothing else comes even close. The developers have done a great job at supporting the game throughout the years, first by releasing a Gold version (that is the current Steam version) as well as planning to release the HD version of the game that comes for free for all owners of the game on Steam. Defender's Quest 2 is also in the works as of writing of this review.If you like tower defenses, get this game. If you like witty dialogue, get this game. This game shows what an indie game can be when it's done right. I can't really find any real flaws out of it.			"

												A mix of tower defense, strategy, and RPG genres combine to make what is Defender’s Quest. The game revolves around a linear campaign to save the world from the forces of, um, evil. My only strike against this game is that the RPG element feels rather tacky; for awhile you actually care about the skill points you assign to your party but once you have a solid dozen or more of characters you pretty much don't care anymore and just assign skill points in a sometimes arbitrary manner. That said, Defender's Quest is a good game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys thought provoking tower defense games.			"

												It's like Final Fantasy finally meets Tower Defense!Defender’s Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is yet another tower defense game on the list. But surprisingly, this one comes together with a little twist attached to it. It’s an RPG Tower Defense Game! Yeah, you've heard it right. Someone actually combined both of those genres. Initially it may sound like an unlikely combination, but like salt and caramel, they've really complemented each other in surprising ways.This game is a 2D game with a unique blend of Tower Defense and RPG created by Level Up Labs. Rather than having ""towers"", you have party members that you need to strategically place them around the map, of which purpose is to defend your main character Azra. Unlike a simple tower defense game, however, you can level up and equip items for your companions to help them improve in combat. A very nice combination indeed!You take the role of Azra, a royal librarian of the Kingdom of Ash which is currently being ravaged by a unknown plague. Azra gets infected and thrown into 'The Pit', a place where all dead or dying are kept to maintain the kingdom safe from plague. Those who die from the plague become 'Revenants', undead monsters that are immune to physical harm. But Azra soon discovers that she has the power to enter both the living world and the 'Half-Way' world, a place between the living realm and the realm of the dead. In this realm, she can summon her companions to fight the Revenants in their spirit form and eventually beat the crap out of them.There are around 30 levels to survive, but you'll lose more time than you think while playing them. You can actually go back and try to beat levels on harder difficulties. (The range starts from Casual, continues with Normal and Advanced but doesn't forget to include the Extreme difficulty.) Doing so, throws a tougher, more varied group of enemies at you that offers greater XP and loot to help you in your journey.During battle you can change the attitude of your party members. You can tell them to favor boss monsters, to attack only the weak enemies, to use the more powerful skills on stronger enemies and so on. In addition, your companions have boost levels that you need to increase in order to give them access to their strongest skills. However, doing that you spend precious energy, called Psi in the game, every time you boost their abilities, which will sometimes force you to make tough decisions.You're also given a tremendous amount of control when it comes to the game's speed. You can pause everything, while still being able to place units and upgrade them, or pump the speed all the way up to 4x if you're the impatient type of gamer. Defender's Quest is very respectful of the player in every number of aspects. Controls and hotkeys are configurable, cutscenes and conversations can be skipped and rewatched later if you choose so, and I'll tell you a secret. The rate at which experience is earned can also be increased from the options. The developers put a lot of love in their game as you can see. That being said, you can get to the end on normal difficulty in five hours or less. But personally, I've spent more than 14 hours going back and forward to complete perfect runs on every stage. There's plenty of optional content that will make up for your hard earned money.Other than fighting through the story, at a certain point you will gain access to a list of challenge bonus battles (including two endless battles). These will offer you yet more experience as well as precious unique books to augment your main character fighting skills. Bonus battles will automatically be unlocked once you earn enough blue and yellow stars from fighting in normal battles.Once you complete the normal game, you will unlock the New Game+. Which is the story written all over again, but at a much harder level, with even better rewards and the ability to upgrade all those unique items you've found during the normal game. The New Game+ will also have it's own bonus battle list.Pros- The Deluxe version of the game just got released! And has features such as: From improved graphics to expanded new story content, better performance and more of everything you've loved about the original version!- The in-game dialogue between your companions is funny and quite entertaining.- Friendly developers that are willingly to fix any bugs you're reporting them. They are hard working to create the best experience for their game even after four years of the release!- Support for Achievements, Trading Cards, Steam Workshop and Steam Cloud.- Now available in 60 FPS.- Behind the scenes journal detailing the game's development.- RPG elements and clever options keep replayability high.- Lots of levels and difficulty settings.- New Game+ included.- Awesome plot driven gameplay to keep you entertained the entire game.- Multiple endings to keep you coming for more.Cons- Not many actually, I love it exactly how it is now. The Deluxe version improved every aspect of the game, fixing everything that was wrong or poor made.- Steam Workshop disables achievements.- No voice acting included in the Deluxe version.- Defender's Quest 2 isn't out yet, give it to meeeeee already!ConclusionI just can't say how good this game is. It's the definition of perfection. Defender’s Quest let's you change from a casual to an insanely difficult game without having to load a different savegame. From a slow moving battle, to a fast moving one. You can grind endlessly for experience or take your battles to the doorstep of impossibility. This is a game for all the types of gamers. And also a great way of introducing someone into the Tower Defense genre. You choose exactly how you want to play it. This game deservers to be the indie Game of The Year and in my heart it will always be the best tower defense ever made! I highly recommend it even at full price for reasons such as: They've created an upgrade for the actual game even after a few years of the game's actual release, keeping it FREE for the owners of the original game!This review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Level Up Labs, LLC for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

												While this is a decent little game, I think it fails to really deliver on its core promises. It's worth some money and time, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.The game bills itself as primarily a tower defense game. Tower defense games generally require you to come up with a strategy to defeat the enemies given a particular map and set of resources. Defender's Quest maps are much simpler, and to a large extent don't require much strategy. That's where the ""RPG"" part comes in. There's not really any role-playing going on, but your characters get stronger and you can buy better weapons and armor for them. The maps don't rely so much on strategy as on having characters that are high enough level and have good enough equipment. And that generally means grinding for XP. So when it comes to the advanced and extreme levels, it's not that the levels are possible but you have to have a better strategy. The levels are simply impossible to start with, and the only way you can beat them is by leveling up your characters.In short, it's not a good tower defense game (because the challenges rely primarily on having high-level characters not strategy), and it's not a good RPG (because there's no real role-playing, just ""numbers going up"" as you and the enemy gain levels and equipment). So I think it rather fails the ""tactical depth"" promise.The second promise is customization, and it does have options to rebind all the keys and change the XP scaling, character names and colors, etc., but I don't think it's a big deal. The developer also put thought into how he could accomodate people with certain disabilities (like epilepsy), which is nice.The third is story, and I suppose that's where this game does best. The story isn't great, but it does give a reason to keep playing and it is fairly humorous in some parts.Technically, the game is well-made, even if it appears dated. I can't recall any bugs in the game, and it has been very stable. The game runs at 800x600 resolution, which is fine for me. The sound effects and music are well-done, but lack variety, which is okay for me.I just wish the game rewarded thinking more than it rewards grinding. It's worth a try if you can get it on sale.

												Defender's QUest is a tower defense game that has a heart. The video trailer is pithy, suggesting that the game and its creators don't take themselves seriously, but don't be fooled. The story is simple but effective, not avoiding the cliches but embracing them and making them its own, but not with the wink and nod of the lampooner, but of a storyteller with an earnest wish to convey to you the world they've imagined. I found myself playing this game long after the challenge had worn away, drawn not so much by the game that had grown to be child's play after intense leveling, but rather by that very soul the creators instilled in it. I found myself surprised by this, and was sad to find it 100% completed and with nothing more to offer. I will pick you up again in time, my friend, for the happiness you offered was not forgotten.

												Surprisingly entertaining. Simple play style, very typical tower defender. The little cutscenes were well written and fun. If you are the type (like me) to enjoy tower defense and other point-and-clicky type games, you'll probably like this. Hell, I definitely got my three dollars worth of entertainment out of this (hail steam sales). The horde-type bonus challenges are neat, and I like the little option to customize palettes for your troops. Makes it easier to tell at a glance who is who, which actually matters since you can level and spend skill points differently making even identical character classes possibly very different in combat. Even paying full price for this would probably be worth it. I can think of PLENTY of expensive triple-A games that I didn't play for almost 50 hours, or get nearly as much pleasure out of playing.

												I really love this gem. Is one of those games that keep you thinking even when you are not playing. Also one of those games you want to play one last round even when you shouldn't (even with the 16x fast forward option making each round last between 10 to 15 minutes, be ready to stay up all night).It has an awesome level design that allows you to test different strategies. The game offers plenty of options, even when you are using the same type of units, you can customize them to suit your needs. For example, you can have an archer causing bleeding next to another archer causing armor-piercing damage.Developers released few months ago an HD update for free. So, this game has basically everything you ever wanted from a game. Good gameplay, good replayability, good story, options, customization, short/long gaming sessions and awesome developers releasing updates even when this game was first released back in 2012.			"

												This is my favourite game in years.It's a tower defense game where each of what would normally be a tower is actually a character that levels up, like in an RPG, complete with a customizable skill tree, equipment, etc. These levels are earned from level to level, so you're constantly improving your party.This superficially simple gameplay concept is backed up on all sides by a great story, deep strategy elements and amazing replayability.StoryAzra (or the name you choose) is the royal librarian that ends up in The Pit, a wretched place full of zombie-like creatures called Revenant. Using mysterious special powers (that excellently explain the tower defense gameplay) and the help of a band of ragtag adventures you'll pick up it is your job to guide her out of the pit. There is more at stake, and the plot has plenty of developments to keep you interested, but what surprised me the most were the story's pacing and its humour.No story segment lasts more than a minute or two, excluding the ending but not the opening, yet it tells a cohesive and engaging story. You'll never feel like the levels are just there to pad out the story or vice versa.Strategy & ReplayabilityWithin levels you get to place your defenders along the paths your enemies will take to reach Azra. Doing so spends mana, so unless Azra has a lot of Mana (maximum mana increases by increasing her level) you'll need to consider which allies to summon. You can 'boost' these allies to unlock more attacks and increase their core stats, up to 5 times, this is equivalent to the traditional tower defense game's tower upgrade. Combine that with being able to place allies whenever you want, advanced targetting settings and certain allies working very well together while others negate some aspects of other powers (frozen vs. burning) and you have a deeply rewarding tactical system.Is this required to enjoy or finish the game? No.The ability to play and replay any level you've cleared at any of 4 difficulties means that you set your own pace and your own challenge. On the lowest difficulty you can basically breeze through the game and just enjoy the story, never having to put a lot of thought into tactics or grinding, and the hardest difficulty will have you either rethinking your tactics or grinding a few more levels.Clearing the game once, with any of its 5 endings (only 2 distinct ones really, one just has 4 different versions) will unlock new game+ mode parallel to the regular game mode. This features new powers for all enemies, several sidequests telling the story of one of the characters relevant to the plot, the ability to understand the 'ancient language' spoken in some of the dialogue and a 'journal' that offers lovely (and often hilarious) glances into the protagonist's mind as her journey progresses.It will challenge you and reward you, and this is completely free extra content that was released months after the game was originally launched that is automatically included. I've put dozens of hours into this game and still revisit it regularly to see if I can't beat a few of the levels I still have problems with on a higher difficulty or to work on my Hero Mode run.Summary:+great plot+great tower defense gameplay+great RPG-style customization+replay levels+multiple difficulties+multiple endings+best way to do new game+-graphics are serviceable, but nothing to write home about-no voice acting (which to me is better than bad voice acting...)-Defender's Quest 2 isn't out yet, give it to meeeeee!

												This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I don't typically like tower defense games. The gameplay is very streamlined and intuitive, and the progression/difficulty curve stays very balanced throughout. Each class is unique, and while the skill trees are not as complex as they could be, they do definitely have an impact on gameplay, especially later on. The humor is excellent, and the additional story bits and journal entries make New Game+ worthwhile. Also, beware the sheep.			"

												I've played the pre-steam version a bunch. Back when it had ugly art (it's still ugly, but it improved a lot!), but it already had the soul it had today. It's a solid tower defence with RPG elements. It just works! I especially love how you can change xp/gold rates to amounts you want, so you could play this game without grinding at all (which many TD games tend to be flawed in when it comes to RPG elements). The story is OK, the writing is OK, but it's all extras for the main course: a solid lengthy TD game. Well worth a 10 buck price point if you're fan of the genre!			"

												I feel bad for letting my love for this game unshared for so long, so I'll take advantage of the steam promotion to atone for that fault. That game is just the best tower defense I ever played. The story is great, the mechanics are innovating and the hero mode and the RPG-like skilltrees make you care for your teammates (which act as your towers). The NG+ and NG++ have alternative stories that give you a great replayability, and there are side quests and hidden achievements as well! And if you don't like the farming side or if the difficulty is too high for you, everything can be adjusted directly in the menu, and the game data is crystal clear and can be modified to cheat to your heart content if that makes you happy ^^ 97/100			"

												As tower defense games go, this is a really good one!  I really like that on each level you can change the difficulty from calm to challenging to frustrating - so I can set it for whatever mood I feel like playing in.  And leveling up as you go, then going back with stronger warriors to beat older levels on higher difficulty really feels rewarding.The story has some humorous and somewhat interesting bits, but it's a mostly simple backdrop to the tower defense that drives the game.  Once you complete the story, you can go back for the more difficult story+ mode which adds several sidequests to fill in some blanks.  It gives the game a nice bit of extra replay value.			"

												I tend to find Tower Defense boring, if it doesn't have a gimmick, or mix in other genres the way Orcs Must Die does. Here, the gimmick is RPG elements, and music reminiscent of Final Fantasy IV. That works for me.There is a ton of content; each map can be replayed on two higher difficulties for increased rewards, after beating it. And then you can replay the whole game in NG+ where enemies have altered behaviors. You can also change the game speed at will, which is something I'd love to see in more Tower Defense, to speed through the parts where I know my towers have things covered and I don't need to watch enemies walk into them and die.

												This game. This is most likely the biggest surprise in my entire library. I originally bought this game about two years ago. The Steam Trading Card system  had just launched into beta (remember when everyone thought it was going to be huge and a card could be worth $5?) and I had gotten in. Curious to test the system out, I found I at the time did not own any games on the short list of applicable games. I immediately did two things. First, I purchased Half-Life 2 since I had played that game on another account and knew it was good. Second was I started scanning the list for cheap games. This was on a daily deal sale the following day. I checked it out and saw that is seemed like a pretty generic, if solid, tower defense game. Felt like one of those particularly good flash games on something like Kongregate or Armor Games. Still, for 5 bucks, I figured it was worth a shot. And I wasn't entirely wrong in my expectations. This does very much feel like a buffed up flash game in a lot of ways. And then I asked myself if that was a bad thing. The gameplay is simple and understandable yet plenty difficult. Creativity is encouraged and different strategies will be required. The graphics weren't amazing, certainly not HD (though a HD update is on its' way at time of writing) but I feel like the art has character to it. This of course is helped by the fact that there actuually is a solid storyline in the game, more than many games I've played. The characters don't have a lot of screentime for development, yet I still feel like they are real. All in all, this game I found to be a very good surprise. Don't expect a AAA level game, but do expect a game whose simple charm and solid gameplay will leave you satisfied. This game doesn't amaze, but it does the one thing that all games have to do. It's simply entertaining. The devs (who btw are super communicative and dedicated to their games) really did a great job with this one, and I look forward to their future work. 9/10 - Highly Reccomended			"

												Defender's Quest is a huge little gem of a game. I believe it offers the most hours of fun per megabyte of any Steam game I've played yet. I really enjoyed playing through it twice and sweating enough to unlock all the achievements.The game scales in difficulty exponentially. This means that the easiest battles are actually the earliest, and that the game gets harder as it progresses. This is a welcome change from most games, but it's taken to an unnecessary extreme at the end. Finishing the final 10% of a full 201 star playthrough will be where you spend the majority of your time. Thanks to the level cap - which you will get to - you'll hit a wall in your ability to improve. That makes it feel repetitive and slow, because you're just repeating the same few battles over and over again, trying to make little tweaks to survive. Most of the game isn't like that, but it's a frustrating way to finish.The game's story and characters are quite memorable and well-written. The dialogue is funny. I wasn't expecting that at all, especially from a tower defense game. It's actually one of the main reasons I'm looking forward to the sequel: I want to know what happens in this world to these people.The graphics are a huge let down though. With no way to scale the sprites are locked in a tiny window. I found myself squinting just to tell what was going on. And I heavily considered lowering my resolution just to make things bigger. Thankfully an HD re-release is in the works, but the level of fidelity as is leaves the game looking like a B-level mobile game. Defender's Quest is not without flaws, but if you enjoy challenging tower defense gameplay where the story compels you to move forward then it's well worth a purchase.			"

												By far my favorite tower defense type game. Between the original flash based release on Kongregate, the standalone version after I purchased it, and the Steam version that was added later I'd guess I have 3x the time listed playing this.What has impressed me as much as the game itself are the continuous updates the game has received WELL after the launch of the game. New Game+, more quests and backstory scenes, art overhauls, etc.If you like tower defense games I would definitely urge you to give Defender's Quest a try!			"

You level up your towers (heros) so they are stronger for future levels, or harder modes which gives you a sense of progression even when you are failing a round terrible on your first try.

												My first sleeper surprise this year.  Hardly anyone sings praises of Defender's Quest, with its basic visuals, repetitive music, and seemingly cloned gameplay.  I'm sure other games have tried combining RPG and Tower Defense (just as Puzzle Quest did with RPG and match 3 puzzles), but I was sucked into this game quicker than I imagined.  The story is dumb but you come to like the silly dialogue and characters, and the stages tend to change just enough (at least on higher difficulties) so you have to keep on your toes.  Some levels will remove your archers for example, while others may force you to prioritize on certain enemies rather than the collective.  This is a great game for people who enjoy Tower Defense with the loot collecting and skill customization of RPGs.			"

												A straight and forward tower defense game. If you like the genre, I very very highly recommend this game. If you don't like the genre, I doubt any game would be able to change your mind, and suggest that you carry on.Defender's Quest managed to impress me by literally exceeding the average in every way I can think of.+ Not a rehash of another tower defense game - it didn't really do anything extraordinary within the genre, yet I can't think of a single game I'd call it similar to.+ Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the story is actually good, the characters fun, and the funny parts actually funny.+ There is no ultimate strategy that works for the game (build/upgrade order, etc). Each map forces a new strategy based on the availability of locations to place your characters, and enemy monster types.+ There are dozens of maps, with 4 different difficulty settings, all of which have a New Game+ version which play differently. This game will take many dozens of hours to complete.+ The music is good. Nothing spectacular, but for the genre and the pricetag, exceeds standards.+ Lots of things to play with in the options menu.+ Family friendly - I would see absolutely no problem in an 8 year old playing this game.

												Greetings as always!  The short of it is that if you like tower defense this is a good addition to your collection.  Even without a sale the price is worth it, though this game could have been more appropriate for a tablet I didn’t feel cheated and was left satisfied overall.Graphics and Audio:  The art is basic, no way around that, but it gives a certain charm with that understanding.  Unlike many games this one understands that the core is gameplay not graphics and audio.  Instead of doing a poor job I feel that the developers made the most of they could without cutting quality or requiring a tripple A budget., can’t really complain and the second game looks like they are bringing it to the next level without cutting that charm.Tower Defense:  The game is simple enough, you ‘build’ towers by summoning characters and level them during the match which dramatically increases their power and unlocks a new attack (assuming they know the skill).  The combination of skills needed (like piercing armor or slowing) along with the unique pathing of each unit type gives a lot of strategy.RPG:  The leveling system is decent but a bit shallow; this really isn’t an issue as the game’s leveling mechanics do exactly what is intended.  Along with some gear (weapons, armor and books) and a small bit of color customization for your characters it certainly could be better but I left the game content.  This small addition gives you something to work towards, a reason to 'grind' levels over and a method to make levels harder wtihout require silly levels of micro or creating a game that simply overrun with templates and walkthroughs that anyone can copy.Story:  The narrative is good, the background and story told is very interesting in the premise although it could use a bit of work in the telling.  The mix of silly humor and playful tones keeps the game light without undermining the games overall serious story (looking at you Slak!), no, you aren’t getting BioWare story telling, but you aren’t getting generic forgettable story arc A either.  I’d definitely read a novel based around this fiction.I’m not really sure what else to say, it is a solid game, especially for the price.  Even more so if you are looking to scratch that tower defense itch that seems to be dried up for now.  I hope you manage to enjoy it as much as I did.			"

												[Spoiler-Free Review]Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is the definition of a hidden gem. The game is amazing, but criminally overlooked.The game plays something akin to a Fire Emblem: Tower Defense where stat and character growth elements are mixed with strategy and storyline. Acquiring new gear for your party (via extra challenges) as you progress through the story arc elicits the same feeling of excitement, joy and wonder I had when I was a child exploring Final Fantasy for the first time in glorious 16-bit. The music is genius in it's simplicity, the graphics are a throwback to the olden days, and the story is interesting from the get-go.If there's fault I can find within the game it's that the difficulty balance in some of the stages leans too heavily on the easy side (when set to normal difficulty in-game). I find myself pining for an extreme or endless mode, or better yet, a colosseum with extremely rare equipment and rewards.Buy this game; It's going to amaze you.			"

												Being a sucker for tower defense games, I snagged this game up fairly quickly when I noticed it was on sale. This game is simply awesome, it has everything a TD enthusiast could ever hope for. The game is quite challenging, which I consider a plus when playing TD games. I hate when TD games are overly simplistic and require very little strategy to win. Even when your characters are max level and you've obtained all the best gear it's still quite hard in the later stages of NG+.  Unit placement is extremely important as well as choosing the right skills/passives for your characters based on the level you're playing. On that note, the game has quite a few levels in the main storyline along which a bunch of bonus levels in the NG+ mode. The artwork is nice and the story is pretty decent. The characters are very likable and a bit comedic at times. I usually mute games and play my own music but I rarely did that with this game, the soundtrack is quite enjoyable. Overall I would give the game a solid 8/10. Looking forward to playing the second game when it's released.  "

												A fun spin on the tower defence genre. Adding character growth and party management similar to something like Final Fantasy Tactics stop it from becoming stale like a lot of other tower defence games. The stat trees don't seem especially deep, but they're interesting enough in the early game and everything seems well balanced.The story is simple but well told, the art style is also very simple (the 6th party member/character type in particular looks a little goofy) but the character of the game shines through it, and your party members are all expressive, interesting and actually quite charming. Lots of good, strong female characters here as well which is refreshing.Each level has an advanced and extreme version, which will require you to come back later when you're stronger. They're unnecessary to progress, but they will give you extra goodies if you go back and do them.Currently on sale for $1.50, which is a steal, I'd consider it well worth it at the regular $15 for fans of good tower defence or tactics based RPGs.

												I didn't come into this game with any expectations. I hadn't even heard of it before I saw the trailer on the bundle, but this game actually ended up being fantastic. I couldn't put it down once I started. The gameplay is well-balanced, leaving you with many levels just barely cleared once you get to the higher levels. While I did expect more from the RPG aspects (I literally built every unit from every class identically), I enjoyed the story, and found the game keeping my interest for quite awhile for an indy title.Though, out of everything, I have to say that the best part of this game was its music. The soundtrack for this is amazing. It definitely makes every battle feel epic, and does change to suit the mood at certain key points.Overall, I'm so glad I played this. Thumbs up from me.			"

There's the ""kiddie"" games that try to be completely unoffensive and appealing to all ages, and the ""mature"" games that are filled with blood, but there's hardly anything that successfully matches the charm of the former with the seriousness of the latter.

												You know, just when I compared the genre of tower defense to a 90's boy band and most aspects of Final Fantasy as tedious wank, there comes a game that I probably would be beaming hate rays at. This is that game, and I can't beam hate rays onto it because it takes all the irritating bits out of Final Fantasy such as grind and artificially lengthened gameplay out, and combines it with what makes tower defense ♥♥♥♥ing awesome: Intensity, efficiency, control. It would be up there with the classic Immortal Defense (and if you haven't played Immortal Defense, rectify that), but the story, despite being written by a 'real English major', flat out stands there and doesn't do anything. It doesn't♥♥♥♥♥♥me off either, though, so I guess it can stay. The game's still pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good!			"

												If one were pessimistic or dismissive, it would be easy to look at this Tower Defence game and dismiss it for being generic and dated-looking. However, that would be doing the game and the developers a real disservice.Granted, the 16-bit style is one you're either going to like or not, but it is executed very well indeed, as the use of colour is very done so that it remains pleasing on the eye and never jarring. The execution and balance of the game overall is very polished, and belies the developers' size - it really appears to be well-tested and difficulty is a very smooth and progressive curve. Pacing is similarly excellent, and it definitely evokes that magic ""just one more go"" response. The icing on the cake is the story, which is nice and humorous without being too cheesy or vulgar, so it greatly appeals to a wide audience. As comedy is a very difficult thing to write, they have done a fantastic job here; it's very tongue-in-cheek, and it fits the game perfectly.The meat of the game lies in having characters as your ""towers"" to place on a map. You can purchase extra characters to a maximum of 6 of each, and level them individually. The range of characters are well-defined (such as straight-up brawlers, archers, mages, healers, and even big ol' dragons), and afford some forethought as to their placing on the maps.The length of the game is good, running at a good few hours minimum, but with the added replayability of New Game+ and more. Whilst the game might seem a little high for something that looks like an old game, it is well worth money, as it will entertain you from start to finish.For fans of the genre, this is a must. Even for casuals, it's highly recommended.			"

												This is one of those games that blindsided me when I tried it. It has a ""just one more try"" quality that kept me playing for hours, and a charming story and cast to boot.The upgrade system had me bogged down at times (i.e. paralyzed by options), but there's no denying the level of engagement this game provided in strategy and planning.There are few games that tempt me to replay existing content for better scores, and this is one of them. (Especially the sheep level!) Give the free demo a shot! And clear your schedule :)			"

												It won't seem like it at first, but this is a seriously addictive game. While the resolution does suck, it's not worth giving up on the game just for that reason and you get over it pretty quickly. DQ is a lot of fun, and is the perfect game for those days where you're not 100% sure what game you fancy playing.			"

												TL;DR: If you ever even remotely enjoyed a tower defense type of game, you seriously need to play this one. If you haven't but like rpgs, this is your best bet to find out what a great TD can be like, with the RPG elements to help carry you along. Really, if the (very generous) demo to this game doesn't get you hooked, then tower defense may simply not be your genre, and at least now you know. ;)*** ***Defender's Quest is one of those games that without too much fanfare and fancy graphics simply get gameplay right. The rpg elements are well embedded, the story is not just an excuse for progression, the dialogues are well written and funny, the music is good and sets the mood nicely - but it's really all just about the balanced, fun, just-one-more-level gameplay.It takes place in a plague colony, where the afflicted are turned into horrors controlled by a necromancer master villain. Your hero realizes she's capable of bringing herself and her allies into a halfway world, where the horrors and ultimately the villain can be fought with. While this is a simple enough premise, the way it brilliantly ties the story to the game's mechanics is one of the stellar design aspects of the game. (More on that here[www.fortressofdoors.com], if you're interested in game design).Due to the fact that you customize the appearance of your pawns, equip them with weapons and armour, and train them towards permanent experience that you can put towards an interesting skill tree, you end up becoming more attached to them then if you just had ""towers"" to play with. Especially your set crew of 6 archetypical towers/heroes is a fun bunch with entertaining banter in the (skippable) cut scenes, and by the end of the game you are genuinely interested in their actions and story decisions.I appreciated the attention to detail that allows you to customize both the difficulty and the game experience: active pause, different speed controls, highly configurable hotkeys, customizable general difficulty on top of the ability to replay maps on different difficulty levels (which actually play differently, instead of simply increasing the number of enemies or turning them into sponges). And then there's the Game+, which may just be even more fun to play than the normal game - if you can survive it. Plus, there's the sheep. Good luck with that. ;)With its 30+ grindable main levels, the endless levels, a couple of different endings, a Game+, side missions to unlock and many interesting achievements, there is a very generous amount of content there for the price. Plus, a full HD/60 FPS upgrade is coming soon, for free, with redesigned graphics (the one aspect of the game that many may find lacking), so what more do you want?Maybe what you want is Defender's Quest 2, which is expected to come out some time in 2016 - giving you plenty of time to finish playing 1 first. :)			"

No mazing, but the mazes themselves are alright. Tower placement is emphasizedCons:-Only a few types of towers, and you usually don't get enough Mana to build many/upgrade them anyway-Some classes outright suck compared to others (cough, dragons, cough)-On the other hand, some classes are NECESSARY to complete every level (assuming you're not playing on baby mode)-Unlocking everything is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't bother unless you want to spend 800 hours on this game afking while your towers do the work for you			"

												Great passtime game. Awesome feature about it is that you can eliminate the ""farming"" that many games have you do to gather experience and items by going into the options and setting it to a decent rate for your own idea of pace. In this pixelated game, graphics aren't that great, though the gameplay makes up for it if you are the sort that can handle other low-graphic games.Only thing about this game I can really complain about is the repetition in game style.8/10 Will play more of.

												I think I picked a good time to play Defender’s Quest: Valley of the Forgotten (Deluxe Edition). The graphics are much better, the game has improved performance, a x16 speed is included, and much more. The smart changes and relentless support make this an extremely good and content rich tower defense game. I didn’t care much for the main story though, but more on that later.I rather start with the gameplay where this game shines its brightest. As you progress through the 6-hour campaign, you unlock different heroes that function as your towers. Each hero you plop down on the field has four boost levels that can be purchased. You can only place heroes on predesignated spots as the game isn’t about mazing as much as thoughtful placement in a level’s limited space. Each hero has a distinct role to play such as Knights being able to pierce and destroy armor or Healers keeping everyone alive since some creeps attack and casting debuffs on enemies that amplify your damage. There are six hero types in all – Berzerker, Archer, Priest, Ice Mage, Knight, Dragon – that can be used to defeat the Revenant horde.Heroes and the player character, Azra, can also be equipped with items. Azra can equip two different books that can enhance spells or affect the stage such as heroes having a free Frenzy buff when placed. Books are earned from bonus stages which are unlocked via the perfect stars earned from completing levels without letting Azra receive damage. Heroes can either equip a weapon, armor, or nothing at all. You can purchase equipment and recruit more heroes at towns. You can also earn unique items from tackling the higher difficulties for specific stages. The unique items are worth it as they can also serve a purpose in NG+New Game Plus adds a significant amount of content for both the reading type of player or TD lover and does more than make the enemies tougher and stronger. You’ll run into new side-quests that provide additional story content or jokes and run into a couple of new characters. One of them is the Hermit, a crazy person who can upgrade all the unique items you’ve earned and give them new, powerful properties. There are also new developer journal entries that can be unlocked by playing if you want even more things to read. Those entries can be surprisingly interesting to read since you can see the thought process behind some of the decisions made for the game. You can also read about what the different inspirations were for other parts including the names of the unique items or the Ash religion. Both the side-quests and dev entries came with the Deluxe upgrade.Running back and forth between the standard game and NG+ to perfect all the levels, collect uniques, and upgrade the items will probably take a bit more than 20+ hours for players if the standard settings are kept. Keep in mind that you can alter the experience, scrap (currency), and penalty rates in the accessibility menu which is a great thing indeed. Don’t forget about if you ever start to feel as though the game is becoming grindy as you go back and forth between stages in order to level up or earn more money to overcome the later levels. I had my fill of the game around the 20 hour mark and have no desire to go back for the time being.Now we come to the main story. I did not enjoy the story told through the cutscenes for almost 90% of it. I thought the main antagonist, Zelemir, had some interesting qualities that were revealed during the later levels, but then there’s also Slak, the Berzerker, with his loud and wacky personality that felt really forced or possibly not meant for my age group. He came off as pretty lame with his style of humor and insatiable need to murder things. Maybe I just disliked how he spoke with Capslock. I thought the writing in the journal entries were better and more interesting as were some of the side-quests in NG+. Some of the journal entries explained the main characters in more depth and made certain events much more meaningful due to understanding the significance of certain actions. Some were tainted by Slak’s handwriting and jests which didn’t make me laugh.Finally, I’d like to cover some other parts of what this game has to offer. The game saw heavy usage of the speed multiplier from me. I didn’t use the x16 multiplier very often, but man, what a time saver for when you have a solid strategy prepared for a level. You can also go in the other direction and slow down time, but I used the Pause feature instead with Spacebar. B, for boosting, is also another good hotkey to know. In addition to the x16 and performance optimizations, the game runs in 60fps which makes fast forwarding very pleasant. There is also the HD art style version of the game which is on by default now, but you can go back to the older graphics if you wanted to when you’re in the overworld map. The drawings for the cutscenes are vastly improved and I wouldn’t want to go back to the original. The retro aesthetics might be preferred by some people though, so it’s nice that you can switch whenever.  The game is very good with all the options it offers in general. Oh, also Steam Cloud and Steam Workshop are there now.Defender’s Quest is an incredibly solid TD game with enough content to keep you entertained for a while. That’s assuming that the gameplay sinks its hooks into you as I don’t think the story is the major draw for players, unfortunately. The accessibility options can also make the experience friendly to newer players. DQ has been one of the better Tower Defense experiences I’ve had in recent memory so I hope the sequel turns out well too.			"

												Rating: Highly Recommended!One of the best tower defense games I've ever played and a truly compelling role playing game as well.  The execution is almost entirely phenomenal bar some minor hiccups: overworld navigation can be a bit slow paced due to camera/view, potentially a bit too much humor at times,  and a couple sporadic difficulty spikes.  I also believe some of the new game+ features/areas shouldn't have been removed from the first playthrough, but the initial playthrough is still very engaging regardless.  The accessibility and extensive options of this game really shine and open the game to all sorts of players and styles.  There are a couple features that would make this game a bit better; Steam Workshop modification integration and maybe an expanded built in level editor.  Overall, a well-executed, deftly-plotted, and damn enjoyable experience that deserves your attention and support. Don't pass this one over without giving it a fair shot.P.S. Still not convinced?  Try the demo and embark upon your own quest.     "

												Defender's Quest breathes new life into the dusty genre of tower defense by mixing it with the story and characters of a role-playing game. I must warn you that it is incredibly addictive; it contains oodles of extra content as well as multiple rewards for choosing more difficult paths through the game. And once you're done with it all, you can begin anew to see if you can complete the famed ""Hero Mode"". Add in mod support and a gracious team of developers and you can see why this game has something for everyone.			"

												I first played the demo version on my old laptop (R.I.P) four years ago after seeing it on XGen. I was really addicted to it, even though it was short 'cuz it was a demo. I was amazed by it's unique gameplay, setting and mostly the music. I remember that I kept humming the soundtrack for it all the time. I then forgot about the game, and soon, my laptop broke. Fast forward four years later, seeing this on sale in Steam. When I saw it, I thought ""Hey, why not buy it after all these years?"" and so I did.The game now looks different, however the soundtrack and the gameplay is still the same. Then I looked into the options and saw you can change the art style to the original one. Obviously, I picked the original, since the game feels more better that way. It's better to play it like you've played it before. I really recommend this game because of the unique gameplay, and you could probably fall in love with the soundtrack. I am currently humming the map theme now as I type this review. There's really not much else to say, since it's better if you experience it first-hand. Go on, get it while it's on sale. Totally worth it.			"

												Defender's Quest is a fun tower defence game infused with a little RPG element while having a strange yet humorous plot. The majority of the game isn't much of a challenge, so I would recommend this game to those who are new to this genre. However, that's not to say that avid tower defence players would not enjoy this with its strategic gameplay consisting of many unique map designs as well as the combination of old school tower abilities such as slows, critical damage and AOE effects. The RPG element in this game is very minor (you have the ability to upgrade skills and buy or find equipments) and without it, this game is your typical tower defence game. This is a great game to pick up to play for all kinds of gamers and non-gamers!			"

												I bought this game over a year ago and I still occasionally like to play it.  It's a satisfying, simple tower defense game with RPG simple character tech trees and RPG items, along with a story.I tried to ignore the story, but some parts of it can't help but seep through as I'm playing, and I think the story adds a nice dimension (especially when compared to other tower games where it's map after map and nothing to tie it all together).Because the ""towers"" are characters, and those characters level up, every puzzle tactical area eventually becomes easier.  But also every tactical area has 3 (sometimes 4) levels of difficulty, so it adds some mileage to the whole game.This is so far my favorite tower defense game and the most compelling.			"

It looks basic, but beneath the surface lurk customisation through talent trees for every unit, and the protagonist (who must be protected in each stage). The games retro style suits it, as it's a classic TD game that doesn't really introduce anything new to the genre. However, this is not a bad thing as it is a very strong game and doesn't need anything 'special' to draw people in. I'm a huge fan of TD games, and this is definitely one of my favourites.			"

												Should've reviewed this a long time ago. The game is a fun little tower defense/RPG hybrid with something like six modes of difficulty for each map (with each difficulty mode having different enemies/different enemy abilities, not a simple boost in health), replayability in the form of New Game+ with extra content, and an interesting story with humorous characters. The base game consists of thirty maps with a story cutscene before/after each and two different endings. There are five challenge maps and two endless maps that can be accessed after completing enough story maps.  I haven't finished NG+ recently, but it adds at least five more. The game was released on Steam in 2012 and was on Kongregate and other sites before that but the devs have continued to support and update it for free - including adding Steam workshop support, sidequests, a journal for the main character, and most recently this HD update. The HD update only came out a few days ago, so it's a little buggy (infrequent crashes for me, but since the game autosaves I haven't lost any progress), but the previous version is still accessible and it's possible to port your save file in from the old version. Given the devs' record of support, I'm sure the HD update will be close to bug-free soon.			"

												Over the last five years indie games have gained a steady and impressive following among both PC and console gamers, giving rise to a rebirth of many classic game types and the birth of many creative new game styles as well. One of the game types that has benefitted the most from the rise the indie market is the Tower Defense genre, and there are few games that exemplify the quality an indie title can reach like Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten.At first glance Defender's Quest does little to inspire confidence in the overall product. With a rudimentary title screen and an almost complete lack of graphics options the game will seem lean on content to start with. Even the cinematics in the game are somewhat jarring and a let down, consisting of still images that, in all honesty, would feel more at home in a flash game than a title developed for sale.Delving deeper into the game, however, will quickly show you the quality that lies beneath this initially lackluster veneer. The in-game graphics are a wonderful modern take on the 16-bit era, colorful and with enough animation to keep battles fairly lively and interesting. While the graphics options are sparse at best, the game wows with how much customization it allows in its gameplay experience, allowing players the option to tune experience gains, character downtime penalties, and even monetary gains to suit most players from the most hard-core strategy gamers to those who are looking for a more relaxed experience. Despite the less than stellar presentation for cutscenes the characters themselves are all colorful and fun, and the art design itself only fails due to a lack of consistency between cinematics and gameplay. Characters offer a rudimentary RPG-style skill and level up tree, and combining that with the ability to level up characters mid-level to gain access to more advanced combat techniques gives the entire game a great deal of depth. The equipment system is underwhelming, with new swords and armor offering nothing in terms of rewards beyond an incremental stat boost, but the entire design shows a great deal of promise, if not polish.Gameplay is often quick, but can be paused to allow the player time to consider strategy as often as one needs to. Overall the difficulty curve on the game is well managed: with rewards turned up the game is a relaxing affair that still manages to hold your attention, while turning them down increases the difficulty and need for strategy without ever becoming unfair. Controls with either the keyboard or mouse are generally responsive and convenient, and there is next to nothing in the experience that will frustrate most players unduly. Level design is well handled as well, with the levels scaling nicely to present new placement and enemy challenges as the player progresses through the game.With an intriguing storyline, good characters, and incredibly scalable gameplay that allows it to appeal to audiences of varied skill or dedication, Defender's Quest succeeds in presenting its players with a high-quality product worth investing your time in. While visual presentation suffers due to a mish-mash of different styles, it is only a minor flaw in the face of an otherwise well-made and solid game.Final Rating: 8 out of 10.Despite its visual shortcomings many game designers could learn a thing or two from Level Up Labs about accessible gameplay. By appealing to users seeking a hardcore strategy experience as well as those looking for a more casual game the creators have come up with a stand-out strategy title for both markets.			"

I really liked the characters, the plot, and the pacing of the increase in difficulty.For the price you cannot go wrong with this one.

If you like tower defense and irreverent humor, buy this game right now. NOW I SAY!			"

												Should've reviewed this a long time ago. The game is a fun little tower defense/RPG hybrid with something like six modes of difficulty for each map (with each difficulty mode having different enemies/different enemy abilities, not a simple boost in health), replayability in the form of New Game+ with extra content, and an interesting story with humorous characters. The base game consists of thirty maps with a story cutscene before/after each and two different endings. There are five challenge maps and two endless maps that can be accessed after completing enough story maps.  I haven't finished NG+ recently, but it adds at least five more. The game was released on Steam in 2012 and was on Kongregate and other sites before that but the devs have continued to support and update it for free - including adding Steam workshop support, sidequests, a journal for the main character, and most recently this HD update. The HD update only came out a few days ago, so it's a little buggy (infrequent crashes for me, but since the game autosaves I haven't lost any progress), but the previous version is still accessible and it's possible to port your save file in from the old version. Given the devs' record of support, I'm sure the HD update will be close to bug-free soon.			"

												Well, through 6 hrs playing, my first impression is that this is a decent RPG mixing with some tower defense elements. As a tower defense game, it is too simple in strategic depth. You don't have too many strategies available in game. But as a RPG, it is not outstanding as well in comparison with other typical RPGs. Its attraction to me is that this game is story-driven and the story is engrossing enough to keep me playing for hours. At the start, a dying girl is thrown into a pit to accept her destiny. But she doesn't. For unknown reason, she returns from the halfway to the hell. In return, the terrible experience on the verge of life and death gives her a new spiritual ability, making her capable of leading people to fight against the undead. As the game progresses, the mystery behind uncovers. This girl gradually comprehends her unavoidable destiny. She would meet many companions like warrior, archer, monk, mage and even the dragon. They would give her a hand on her road to save the world...			"

Highly recommended!			"

												Don't be fooled by the modest visuals - this is a fantastic game. As an RPG Tower Defense hybrid, it's a blast. Solid mechanics that allow you to micro-manage as much (or as little) as you like, while offering simple tweaks to XP accumulation, allow for a high degree of accessibility. On top of that, the story is great. It does its own thing without relying too heavily on established fantasy tropes, and also mixes in some really successful humor - it actually reminds me a bit of Avatar: The Last Airbender.If you're going to pick the game up, I'd highly recommend heading to the game's site. There's a sequel in development, which will have a score by no other than Nobuo Uematsu, and pre-ordering it there will net you a free copy of this game as well.Bonus Note: For a more classic RPG experience, don't pick up any additional recruits in the towns you visit along the way. Instead, use only the characters you get directly through the story, and bump up experience gains to 300% - this will lend itself to a few special achievements, minimize micro-management headaches, and generally let you bask in the glory of your awesome, uber-powered characters.Bonus Note+: The New Game+ is incredible, and so worth playing. It adds side quests, and a journal (which is actually really well written), giving loads of meat to the story and characters that was only hinted at on the first playthrough. Stick around for it - it'll be worth your time.			"

												It has a surprisingly simple premise (Tower Defense, but each tower has stats, skill trees, equipment, etc.), but it's execution is absolutely excellent. The gameplay alone could carry it, but it is further bolstered by a somewhat cliche but surprisingly engaging story. Add to the mix multiple difficulty variations on each stage and a New Game + that actually expands on the mechanics rather than just bumping up the numbers, and you have an excellent, lengthy, and entirely worthwhile experience.

												I'm not convinced that RPG progression + tower defense is a very good model. Or at least it's too underdeveloped in Defender's Quest. There aren't nearly enough varieties in skill trees or enemies or items to justify the levelling and equipping. And while the levels are well designed, the balance isn't quite right and I ended up playing through most of the standard game on max fast forward (granted I was doing +300% hero mode, but large parts of the game seem pressuring to go hero mode).That said, this game is absolutely adorable and totally worth it on a bad laptop. And so far in New Game+ everything's a lot better.			"

												Absolutely the best Tower Defense game out there, and even calling it ""Tower Defense"" seems to sell it short. The RPG elements can't be overstated; they give you a reason to care about your ""towers"". The character writing is chuckle-worty at times, and the story, while it's not Oscar worthy, is very good. I've been looking for a ""play a round or two at a time"" game to play, and Defender's Quest fit that perfectly (except I would end up playing ""just one more"" more often than not). I can't wait for the second game.			"

												You might be forgiven for overlooking Defender's Quest. Exceedingly generic title attached to yet another tower defense game... of course, you'd be missing out on a whole lot if you let that get in the way of you playing this game.Let me get this out of the way first: I don't like tower defense games. They usually bore me or frustrate me, and in worst case scenarios they do both at the same time. Defender's Quest deftly combines core tower defense play with RPG elements, a story that'll actually hold your attention, and beautiful artwork in and out of combat.Say what you will about simple spritework: it looks fantastic here. Units are distinctive, animate well. I absolutely love the artwork out of combat, and the writing is fun as hell. I came to really love the cast, and was sad when it was all over- well, not for long. Game features a New Game+ option that not only ups the difficulty a ton, it gives you access to plenty of sidequests and some very powerful items if you play your cards right. I've seen some complaints about this game lacking in depth of strategy- I don't find this to be the case, especially in maximum difficulty New Game+ battles. But one of the many wonderful things about this game is that its accessibility options allow you to tune the difficulty to your liking. Are you terrible at tower defense but want to see the storyline play out? They got you covered. Still having trouble? You can grind experience on earlier missions, too. Do you want this game to give you a merciless red♥♥♥♥♥beatdown and make you hate your life? Also an option! A+ to the devs for making sure the widest audience possible could enjoy their story until the very end.Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a wonderful little gem of a game that should not be ignored. Highly recommend you give it a shot- I have a pretty good feeling that almost everyone is going to find something to like here.			"

												This game is so Awesome! If I was some award giving guy I would give this game so many awards. The writing in this is Fantastic! and will make you smile, Unbelievable! The characters are Incredibly! likeable and because of that you will like them, Astounding! The gameplay is Wonderful! as well and what you would expect from a Tower Defense game of such caliber, Extraordinary! It is literally my GOTY, Miraculous! Other note worthy things to say is that Striking! Stupendous! Thrilling! Breath-taking! Thaumaturgic! Superb! and some might even say Radical!The Story is what really shines here, ""You"" basically almost die but don't, instead you come across your first companion Truth and Justice not to mention Thunder, Lightning, Carnage, Chaos, Triumph, The Executor, and lastly of course Khan and Charissa, where you'll need to slay a bijillion and one Revenant and collect their Magic Skulls in order to make the Ultimate! Rye Bread with Noodles Dish and save the world.Literally the only negative is that I beat it and now finally over, at lease until I get alzheimer's (Can't Wait!)My only advise is don't mess with the EXP gain option until NG+, it is an RPG hybrid after all and like all RPG's it's easy to over level and things might get too easy, Don't let that happen! So stick to the defaults, and be sure to play the NG+ for even more story, Inconceivable!Oh and you can trust this review I'm an expert. Astonishing! http://i.imgur.com/P5mez.png "

												It's a really good and simple tower defense game with heavy RPG elements, despite the base game being around a decade old. All the monsters require strategic placement to defeat and are very fun to fight, except abominations, and are very well-balanced, except abominations, even into NG+. Also, abominations are overpowered.It has a decently interesting story that isn't ruined by abominations, too.Oh, and abominations are the worst.P.S. ♥♥♥♥ abominations.LIKE ♥♥♥♥ING SERIOUSLY HOW IS IT FAIR FOR THEM TO CARRY 3+ LAYERS OF TANKY AND INCREASINGLY FAST ENEMIES THAT HAVE TO BE KILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER, ESPECIALLY THROUGH WATER OR ON MAPS WITH SHORT LANES? ♥♥♥♥ ABOMINATIONS "

												I am not a huge fan of tower defense games, but this one reallycaught my interest for long. The storyline is interesting and characters are well written, even if not completely serious. This game mixes traditional tower defense with some RPG elements. For example instead of towers you are using characters that can level up, gain skills and better equipment, even the thing to protect is simply your main character.Visuals are not this game's strength but they don't distract from the game and do their job well enough. If you don't hate tower defense games, try this one out.			"

												Defender's Quest is a novel rpg take on the tower defense genre. That in and of itself would make an interesting game, but the designers saw fit to include an interesting story to explain away the game mechanics as part of the plot. While the central theme of plague and the risen dead is dark, the dialogue between characters is lighthearted and oftentimes funny. Such a combination of serious undertones and bright interplay amongst the characters helped me enjoy the game quite a bit.Insofar as the actual mechanics are concerned, this is not a ""maze building"" tower defense game. The enemies will come in waves along pre-defined paths with limited placement for your defenders (the towers, essentially) available. Defenders can be upgraded by ""boosting"" them through five levels which unlocks any abilities they may have earned through levelling and a rudimentary talent system. Speaking of levelling, this is where the rpg mechanic comes into play; every level gained by a defender gives you talent points which you can use to tweak the character and gain new abilities. While the talent system is very basic, it does give you a feeling of satisfaction to distribute your points when a defender levels or you gain access to a new class. While there are only six classes of defender to use in the game, the customization inherent in the rpg progression system means there is the possibility of some differentiation. Additional defenders can be recruited in towns across the game's story map, wherein the plot is advanced and new battlefields are opened up. In battle, these defenders are placed with the same resource you use for upgrading, but recruiting new defenders gets progressively expensive with the game's story mode currency (won through battle). That same currency is used for equipping your defenders with weapons and armor, so there is an opportunity cost. As additional currency can be won by going back and fighting harder versions of prior story mode battles at any time, you never truly feel strapped for cash.As the game is 2d, the question isn't whether the graphics are advanced, but how good and cohesive they look. Cut scenes to advance the plot are drawn with a style which gels extremely well with the battle sprites and look pleasing to the eye. Opinions on art styles will vary, but the cleanliness and cohesiveness of the game's visuals can not be denied. There are no sloppy looking sprites in this game and your defender's colors can even be customized to a limited degree to further suit your tastes. Unfortunately, while the animations of your defenders (and especially that of a certain antagonist at the very end of the game) are fluid and pleasing to watch, the animations of the monsters which you are tasked to kill are very basic and stilted. Still, most of the time said monsters are drowning in a sea of pleasing damage numbers as your defenders are chopping them to pieces, so perhaps some gamers will be able to overlook this as I did.According to steam, I was able to extract 13 hours out of this game and there are still bonus challenges to complete and a new game plus mode to experiment with. Whether that is worth the price of admission is a decision that I encourage you to weigh carefully if you would normally pass up a game based on length: it is lovingly crafted and an enjoyable experience that I can recommend to any rpg fan, even those who aren't familliar with tower defense games.The long and short of it: 8/10, buy it.

												Buy This:If you love tower defense If you love 8 bit era RPGsIf you enjoy a humorous adventure starring a bunch of misfit heroes. Defender's Quest is another tower defense game with a few twists that put it above the curve. For starters, rather than building soulless towers that you have zero attachment to, you employ RPG style characters to defend your ""Librarian."" These characters can be named, stylized (to a slight degree with color options) and then leveled the more they're used. They each even have a system of perks that can be unlocked through the course of the campaign. You can employ as many as you can find the dosh for, but each requires ""mana"" to be deployed in battle. This is a finite pool that is replenished by killing baddies. The maximum mana you can have increases as your librarian levels as well, so in essence it is a clever way of keeping the player from throwing 70 towers up at the start of a new mission and steam rolling. The game also has a pretty humorous story line, and memorable main characters. There's unique items you can unlock for your favorite minions, and even a brutally hard Game+ mode if you desire even more once you finish the campaign. With such a low price point, this is a must have for people who like old school RPGs, tower defense style games or both.			"

What's more, there is a New Game+ that not only increases the challenge but adds new levels, new lore etc.  All in all a well thought out game to pass the time, and will have you laughing out loud at the story, and cursing as you go for the perfects.

Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten (DX edition) is a fun yet somehow shallow tower defense game. It's one of these cases where Steam's binary review system forces me to give a 'thumbs up' rating followed by a long text with all the caveats.TLDRIf you're looking for a relaxed, not-to-deep tower defense with colorful graphics, thematic music and some tongue-in-cheek dialog you might try this out. If you're looking for the best-in-class tower defense game, this is not it.detailsThe game has us accompany Azra, the royal librarian of a fantasy land, through her journey across the land where she must overcome various evils. You wouldn't play this game for its story per se but the dialogs and well crafted scenery and overworld make for a compelling reason to keep playing. Via overlay tutorials the player is introduced gently into the actual gameplay of placing and managing your figthers. While the start is great you soon realize that there isn't a lot of depth to the gameplay. I've played Warcraft 3 custom maps that had more mechanical variety in their tower defense than this game.The mechanics merit a closer look because they are the Achilles' heel of this game really. There just isn't a lot to do other than the basics : placing your figthers (towers) and upgrading them, using your global hero powers now an dthen. There's no option to call a wave early for extra cash, no towers that teleport mobs to the beginning of the maze, no flying units that ignore the ground paths altogether, no possiblity to send your own troops against the enemy, etc., etc.Mostly you'll be fighting against zombie like creatures which is justified by the story but it gets stale fast. There's a missed opportunity here for including a much more diverse set of enemies that challenge the player to adjust their strategy and tactics.Outside of combat you'll have the opportunity to manage your party by purchasing equipment, acquiring new fighters up your fighters by assigning points in a talent tree. The game limits itself to 6 classes of figthers (towers) all of which are nicely integrated into and justified by the story. Every figther has a unique role and there's little possiblity of straying from that role via the talent tree. You want your archers exel at ranged combat and your freeze mages to excel at slowing down foes. That is that. I dare to say that this game suffers from a mild sort of RPG syndrome: the inclusion of RPG elements (experience bars, talent trees, interchangeable equipment) for the mere sake of it.The developers have included many interface features that are very useful in this type of game, like being able to slow or speed up time at will or being able to reuse your previous tower layout if you failed a mission. Being able to control the game's speed at will makes for relaxed play sessions and there's even the option to scale experience points and loot rewards if you feel the pace is to slow or to fast. One of the decisions that astonishes me is that the developers decided to hide away some content like side missions and additional dialog in new game plus (ng+) mode. Since this game's story and presentation are on the strong side (for this genre) this baffles me. I've tried my fair share of ng+ and In the way of difficulty or mechanics there isn't much that varants a second playtrough. Defender's Quest is rather the kind of game that you play through once to see the plot come to its conclusion and then move on to something else.This game supports the Steam controller ouf of the box and the layout is quite sensical. When using it though, the game would often hang in dialog scenes or null pointer crash. No such issues presented themselves however when playing with well though out keyboard layout.All in all, I've had my fun with Defender's Quest and I'm looking forward to see the devs expand upon it with Defender's Quest 2 which is currently in development.Edit: the game supports modding via the Steam workshop. While there aren't very many modifications available as of writing (February 2017) this is certainly a big plus!			"

												Not a good game.It was as if the devs made sure it had all the elements to sell, but none to make it fun.Not an enjoyable 17 hours.  I wasn't smart enough to stop.(1)  The tower defense gameplay was poor.  The appeal of tower defense games is usually to try and optimize your defense to be efficient and effective as possible against the oncoming force.   In Defender's Quest there are very few places where your characters can be placed rationally.  In other words, there was only one strategy to place your characters when you setup.  Since there were no other real elements to the game, this made it very boring.  When you lost a mission, you couldn't try and refine your process as there was nothing to refine.  You just needed to level up to get stronger.(2)  The character leveling up process was poor.  I decided to buy the game because the game boasted an RPG leveling-up process.  Although this is technically true, you DO HAVE TO CLICK A BUTTON in order for them to get more powerful, it could have been done automatically as your choices were thin, uncreative, and obvious.  Again, there was no game element in it.  You put the point where it was supposed to go and done.(3)  The storyline was not worth it.  I don't remember the storyline other than it seemed shallow.  The characters were the best part of the game.  Each character seemed unique and full of personality, but the storyline needed more to take away from the poor gameplay.  Because I liked the characters and I thought they were unique, it was a big letdown to find out later that you get more characters just like them gameplay wise.  Here you thought you had a unique crazy berserker guy or a badass ice mage, but no, they are just one of many.(4)  The enemies were uncreative.  The enemies were similar across the board.  At no point do you need to change your strategy based on the different types of enemies coming our way.    Some tower defense games have VERY uncreative enemies, but they don't need varied enemies as the game element is in the placing of the towers/characters, abilities, and tower synergy.  Defender's Quest did not have that.			"

												Although the concept for this tower defense game is neat and the gameplay is somewhat entertaining, the progression is a little too slow. After 9 or 10 stages, I found myself having to backtrack constantly to keep up with the levels of the monster waves. Granted, it's possible to adjust the experience and scrap that you gain from encounters, but the standard difficulty shouldn't have to be modified just for that purpose. While the artwork and story seem to have drastically improved from the original work, a couple of errors can be spotted every now and then, and the plot remains a bit mediocre. Although I'll continue to play this game to its completion, I doubt I'll purchase the sequel if it largely resembles this first title.			"

												A delightful indie gem, Defender's Quest combines some of the funniest writing I've seen in a game with a terrific twist on tower defence. The campaign is cleverly designed. Each battle has four difficulty levels. You can push through the storyline on a low level, and indeed you need to at the early stages. However, there is plenty of incentive to come back and try it again for special items, experience and rewards. Battles are short and varied so there is not really a sense of grinding; indeed, it is interesting to come back with new options through skills and classes.There is plenty of scope for strategy in the battles. There are six different classes, each having different skills and attributes which can be levelled up. They can be boosted during the battle, and can be recalled and replaced. There can be incredibly tense moments late in a battle when a powerful enemy is closing in and you have to frantically recall fighters to put them into better positions. The ability to pause or slow time means that success depends on your strategy, not your reflexes. The variety of battle maps and enemies make for a different experience in each battle. There are genuine laugh-out-loud moments throughout the campaign, which adds to the pleasurable experience of progressing through it.The New Game+ is the finest example of this mode that I've ever seen. It's not just another run through the campaign at higher difficulty, it actually adds side quests, wonderfully-written journal entries and other bonus to make it well worth playing through again.In short, I highly recommend this game. It's one of the best I've ever played.			"

												This is a great game to scratch my castle defender itch. I had already blasted though one on the android store and searched and found this on the more preferable platform.This gives you great difficulty ramping and replay value for every level. The storyline is unique to my knowledge, and I found it refreshingUnits can be fully customised with apperance, name and indivial levelling up to give great diversity to your defence(So obv i named my units after my friends and it makes it that touch awesomer)OH and i thnk the one thing that I LOVE is that there is a story, an INTERESTING story with INTERESTING characters, it makes me want to play on to see where the story is going or see what my crazy warrior will say next. I love this game.			"

												One of the hidden gems of Steam right now.  Coming from a guy whose never really understood the interest people have in tower defense games, this game is just flat out fun.  The story is decent, characters are a little obnoxious but interesting, and everything about it is just so darn likable.  The combination of RGP, Stratedgy, and tower defense elements is something I personally hadn't seen done before, or at least not so well, and works better then it has any right to.  While the main game is relatively short, the amount of extra stuff to do and see in new game+ is a testament to just how much post-release work the developers have expended on this game.  Defender's Quest is an unquestionable labor of love and it really shows.  I picked this up on a the cheap during a steam sale and loved it so much I bought another for a friend and pre-ordered the sequel.Is this the best game I ever played, probably not, but was it great experience, definitely.  The games easily worth full price, but if you can get it on the cheap, I highly recommend you don't let it pass you buy.			"

												What a surprise this little indie game was!To sum it up: it is an RPGish Tower Defense game, with great story, great difficulty curve, hours of play, good music, nice humor... all in all, one of the best TD ever, periodThere are so many great and new features in this game: the RPG part is not to be overlooked, since your towers are characters that you encounter, befriend, explore the past... and upgrade like a tower! The scenario is very well thought and written (I laughed with some characters jokes, and got annoyed by some others), there are SO MANY levels, SO MANY items to buy, and it is SO HARD to finish the game on Hard mode (I gave up, I have no time in this short life) or find the secret side paths (I KNOW there are some dammit!).No seriously, I had NO expectations for that little game, but wow! I was impressed. I DO recommend and I look forward to this studio's next game!			"

												Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is an RPG/Tower Defense hybrid. At first, wasn't sure how well the genres would mix. Now, I can say they mix well, at least for this game. It reminds me a lot of Shining Force meets tower defense with realtime combat. The storyline is great, and not overbearing. I enjoyed reading the cutscenes quite a bit. Good sense of humor put into the game as well. I have not beat it yet, so this is based on what I have seen a few hours in.Positives- Great writing/story. Enough character development to understand the story and the role you play in it. At the same time, not necessary if you just want to skip to the tower defense part (though it is worth reading, I assure you).- Decent variety of tower/class types to choose from. You can choose if you want to specialize in a particular type of defender rather than being forced to use them all. Like most tower defense games, you will want some variety though.- Many quality of life features such as individual settings to save for each defender, prompts asking if you want to place defenders in the same place as last time when repeating a map, quick sell options when upgrading equipment, dialogue skip buttons, and many more. The developers were very considerate of our time to include efficient options.- Good replay value. Can go back to the maps you have done before to grind or to try a more challenging version for better rewards.- Well composed music. The music assets are very fitting and relaxing. A great addition to an already entertaining game.- Very robust controls. Clear usable keyboard shortcuts for almost all functions. Many different time controls to slow down or speed up combat to a pace you are comfortable with. And of course, with the ability to pause.- Permanent gear and skill upgrades for the defenders. As opposed to many tower defense games, there are progression elements that will stick with your defenders between maps. Buying/earning better weapons that will stay with your defender until you upgrade helps this feel more RPGish. Skills can be retrained for a reasonable cost of in game coin.Negatives (To be honest, there are not many negative points for this game in my opinion)- Lacking in character customization. While I realize the game is telling a story, I would have liked the ability to choose the gender of the main character. Perhaps if the campaign is completed, there will be something after that for the end game. Not sure.- On the matter of customization, I would have liked to do more than just change the colors of the defenders. Hair styles, a few different faces, nothing major.- Not enough variety in character drawings. This one is a bit nit-picky, but I am struggling to find complaints :p The only time you really see the character drawings in a form that matters is in the cutscenes. The problem with that is the same stances and reaction drawings are recycled throughout the game. I would have liked to see a bit more unique drawings for varying situations.- While the music is a great asset to the game, it does not repeat or transition cleanly in some cases.- Some of the skill progressions at low level seem a little lackluster. For example, a 2% chance to bleed targets per hit feels a bit useless when many of these things die relatively quick. I would prefer either high chance or guaranteed trigger with low or weakened effects to balance it. Granted, I am sure these abilities work well on bosses and larger enemies.TL;DRA great game with a mix of RPG and Tower Defense elements. Excellent musical scores, and a good storyline to boot. Well worth picking up at full price or on sale. I highly recommend this game.			"

												I really enjoy tower defence games when they are done right (sol survivor). This was totally retro, full of witty humor, a decent story line and enjoyable characters. I played the pre-HD version and liked the ""ghetto style"" animations. The HD update made the game so buggy! I know they have made some updates, but not played it since. If they fix the bugs (bad ghouls going off the screen/game stopping for no reason), then I highly recommend this game!			"

												Fun game, if somewhat limited and repetitive after a while. The undercurrent of humor makes reading the story particularly engaging, and the battle tactics, while somewhat simple, are still deep enough to be well worth checking out.If you need more challenge, there is an achievement for running through the game with no generic troops that makes you think more about optimal placement. New game plus adds some side stories, but they are in addition to playing the whole game again. Still, it was interesting to see all of that.Also, the recent graphical upgrade makes it look much more smooth, and that's always nice.Haven't played much since that to see what else they might have added, so there may be more to like than what I've mentioned.

												This hybrid has no right to be so awesome for someone who cares neither for tower defense nor RPGs.  I had a followed some of the development, but the demo surprised me and I ended up playing the frell out of it.  A few days after a cousin gifted me the full version, I'm ready for the New Game+ mode.  It's not short.  I simply played nothing else for days.  The rounds are generally quick, units are almost always leveling up and resources are earned for equipment purchases.  I did a bit of grinding, but only to earn achievements and unique items.While I don't know if the current demo has the same issue, my save import missed an inventory item.  Fortunately, the the data is stored in easily editable XML files and help was available in the forums.			"

												Defender's quest is a mix of a tower defense + rpg elements and the result is a very addictive game.You're Azra royal librarian casted into the pit because you got the plague, but for some reason you get a strange vision about a golden man and discover new powers capable of destroying revenants for good, now gathering new allies you on a search trying to get out of the pit for your freedom, but also learning why you're special.During the game you will unlock a total of 6 classes of heroes each with different pros and cons, archers low dmg but great range, knight high dmg but slow attack speed, berserker high attack speed medium dmg, ice priest area attacks with crow control skills, priest healer and buffer and dragons overally awesome.There's a total of 30 levels each can be replayed on higher difficulties for more rewards (xp or unique gear for your defenders) but doing higher difficulties requires higher leveled defenders so they can unlock/upgrade skills and passives, unlike other TD games you upgrade the hero to give him a bonus in all stats and unlock his following active skill, which requires previously to level them up outside, kind of confusing but easy to understand as soon as you can see it.There's a set of really hard achievements such as get 180 gold stars without buying generic heroes, reaching wave 100 on endless challenge, and killing a extremely overpowered sheep.Once you beat the game newgame+ gets unlocked, tougher waves, newer gear, 7 side quests which some of them add a lot to the plot, journal logs after every level for more detailed lore about Azra's thoughs about everything than been happening, and items to upgrade the unique gear obtained from doing 3 star levels in normal play, can switch back and forth between both styles at will.Highly recommended even at full price, good TD system and interesting storyline with some (a lot) of funny scenes, i even played 4 hours on a row without even realizing.

												Once you've played one or two tower defenses, you've played them all, right? YES. Well, almost completely yes.I hate this genre with a passion. I enjoyed those first one or two tower defenses I've played, and I'm consistently disappointed with every successive iteration that there is basically no variation whatsoever, especially given how crowded the genre has been. I think it's to do with tower defenses being easy to make, in terms of design, programming, and graphics, so that a lamentably successful game can be made on a dime.However, I do have to give this one game a recommendation. As much as I dislike the genre, this one definitely feels fresher. It blends significant RPG elements into the usual formula. Firstly, it has an engaging story, with plenty of humour and quirky characters. The levels support the story, including the occasional boss fight. Your ""towers"" are in fact your party members, belonging to six classes, who gain experience from encounters and level up to gain additional skills, or hone their own skills further. This allows for plenty of variation amongst your party, although I found myself sticking to a single formula for each of my types.The gameplay itself is not typical of tower defense. There's no placing your people so that they block enemies; they must be placed on the sidelines of a preset path. Also, there isn't an emphasis on placing more and more towers to increase the length of the gauntlet. Although you can place all 36 members of your party in a level, doing so is generally not recommended, because it is far more efficient to simply upgrade the party members you have. The end result is a far more sparse tower defense game, one that greatly favours tactical placement, and consequently, can be fun for the most jaded tower defense anti-fan.I also appreciated the difficulty system, whereby you can choose from three difficulty settings when playing each level (and a fourth that doesn't exactly count, for casual gamers). You can also come back and play the level on a higher difficulty setting, with different enemy types and levels, to get greater rewards (like unique items). It really added to the longevity of the game. Add in some challenges to complete, and you well and truly get your $15 worth.So, for the first time, I have played a tower defense that has left me wanting more! I'm keeping an eye out on Defender's Quest 2, which is currently in development. If you too are as jaded as I am, don't instantly discount this one. Give the demo a try.			"

												What a surprise this little indie game was!To sum it up: it is an RPGish Tower Defense game, with great story, great difficulty curve, hours of play, good music, nice humor... all in all, one of the best TD ever, periodThere are so many great and new features in this game: the RPG part is not to be overlooked, since your towers are characters that you encounter, befriend, explore the past... and upgrade like a tower! The scenario is very well thought and written (I laughed with some characters jokes, and got annoyed by some others), there are SO MANY levels, SO MANY items to buy, and it is SO HARD to finish the game on Hard mode (I gave up, I have no time in this short life) or find the secret side paths (I KNOW there are some dammit!).No seriously, I had NO expectations for that little game, but wow! I was impressed. I DO recommend and I look forward to this studio's next game!			"

The strategy isn't to difficult to follow, but there are harder difficulties for those who want to challenge themselves.

												Verdict: A wonderful take on the often stale Tower Defence genre, with light RPG elements, solid gameplay, excellent art and soundtrack and a simple but endearing story. 8/10Story: The story is simple and humour-orientated, but endearing and, at times, surprisingly engaging given that is delivered through static art cut-scenes and text speech bubbles. The characters are distinctive, fun and memorable. 7/10Gameplay:  The gameplay is solid Tower Defence with light RPG elements. You equip and level up your heroes, which you place as towers to fight off the waves of encroaching enemies. Placement is key, such as placing your ice mages a good distance from your fire-breathing dragons as their abilities will counteract one another, or ensuring your knights will be able to shatter the enemy armour before your archers rain down their arrows for maximum impact. 9/10Graphics: Simple, pixelated graphics are stylistic and get the job done but have been done better elsewhere. Sprites look good, environments are dull and a bit repetitive. The cut-scene art is fantastic. 6/10Sound/Music: The sound effects are basic and appropriate to the pixelated presentation. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is superb. 8/10			"

												This game mixes the Tower Defense genre with RPG elements.The gameplay is like a normal Tower defense: you must protect something from the enemies that comes from some paths. The  ""towers"" are berserkes, archers, dragons and more. You get the first new unit for free, which is a character that interfieres in the story, and then you can recruit more. Each character has his own level, and with levels you can teach him more skills. You can (and should) also buy them equipment.Ingame you can level up these units so they can do more damage and use more skills. Your main character can use spells to help your units, so you can attack enemies actively, heal the allies, etc. All of this is not free, of course you need resources.I can't talk too much about story because I'm skipping most of the dialogs, but it is not crap. The characters are good (one of them, Slak, is a ♥♥♥♥ing god).The difficulty... well, I can't say too much, because if you get stuck on one level you can beat previous levels on a higher difficulty level to level up your characters.I really recommend this game to people who like tower defenses.

												This is a great game within its genre. It's an atypical tower defense game with a cute story that's interesting enough to keep you playing. Although the gameplay itself does that sufficiently enough, it's a good addition to a genre that usually lacks such features. Your 'towers' are people and due to it having a story, some of these characters have a personality and that makes it a lot of fun. You can level your towers and have them learn new skills as well as equip them with better weaponry. The game initially isn't hard, but the option to make it so is available for those longing for a challenge. All in all, if you enjoy tower defense games but are looking for something new, I'd say you can't go wrong with this game.If you're not into tower defense games, you might still want to give this game a try as it does certain things common amongst games of its genre differently, and that might just be enough for you. I had a lot of fun with this game and picked it up rather cheaply, for having put over 20 hours in this game I cannot do anything but recommend it at this point. I am looking forward to Defender's Quest 2, it's coming people!			"

												Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is perhaps the best tower defense game I ever played. It introduces new enemies and heroes (turrets) at a comfortable and accessible rate, so you never get swamped or overwhelmed, and with 3 difficulty levels for each stage, there is plenty of replayability and opportunity to level up your team.Every unit and enemy has visible health, damage, range, bonuses and stats readily available for you, such that there is no information or mechanics hidden from the player. You even have complete control over the timing, being able to pause the game to micromanage, or play at various speeds from 0.25x to 16x game speed.The in-game world has enough charm, and the characters enough personality and depth, to drive the story and the gameplay progression.I say tower defense, but there are also plenty of RPG elements, such as buying and upgrading weapons and armor, upgrading abilities, and even naming your recruits and heroes, and customising the colour of your recruits' clothing. Naming your knights after King Arthurs' Court of Camelot, for example, or your Mages after your favourite magical girls, lends tremendously to immersion.The performance is excellence on almost anything. I get around 40fps on an old dual core Thinkpad at 1152x648, thanks to the native C++ engine and the game's 2D nature.A staple of any tower defense library. I hardly can wait for the sequel._____________________________Note: I have played through this game several times before the Deluxe upgrade, when it still used the Adobe Air framework, (if I recall correctly,) which was bothersome to install on Linux, and had a resolution cap of 800x600 and a framerate cap of 30fps. The Deluxe HD upgrade allows 60fps gameplay at almost arbitrary resolutions.			"

												Tower defense with rpg elements... that sounds... curious if not insane doesnt it? And yet if its possible at all to pull it off, defenders quest did it in a non cringeworthy, astonishing way.Personally, im greatly against mixing genres just in order to appeal more potential customer groups. More often than not, these crossovers result in shallow, trash experience. Yet from time to time, games like this one pop up where every part of the game is as its supposed to be, while at the same time, they still manage to blend perfectly.If for absolutely nothing else, you have to praise defender's quest for the execution. Its something that seeks its equal.If you are into tower def games. GET IT. Highly recommended.			"

												A simple yet effective tower defense rpg hybrid. Overall the game offers an interesting challenge. My only peeve would be that it still gives your xp for failed missions to raise your heroes stats, making the strategic element more forgiving.			"

The game actually has an interesting storyline, although admittedly I havent finished as of now. It has a degree of difficulty that I've come to enjoy in my tower defense games, IMO most of them are too easy!Why not give it a try, $15 isn't much for such quality. And guess what, it's on sale until the 23rd (June 2016)!			"

Product received for free
												Tower defense with rpg elements... that sounds... curious if not insane doesnt it? And yet if its possible at all to pull it off, defenders quest did it in a non cringeworthy, astonishing way.Personally, im greatly against mixing genres just in order to appeal more potential customer groups. More often than not, these crossovers result in shallow, trash experience. Yet from time to time, games like this one pop up where every part of the game is as its supposed to be, while at the same time, they still manage to blend perfectly.If for absolutely nothing else, you have to praise defender's quest for the execution. Its something that seeks its equal.If you are into tower def games. GET IT. Highly recommended.			"

												At first glance, this is a decent TD.Each map has dificulty scaling from brain-dead-easy to challenging-enough-to-keep-you-on-your-toes all the way to so-hard-you-will-have-to-come-back-once-you-have-leveled-up-more.The story is more engaging than many RPGs and shows great humor.The achievements are a decent mix of ""collect as you go"" and ""work hard to get this"".The upgrading and customization of your ""towers"" adds a lot of strategic depth which is only hightened by the weapons and armor you buy/upgrade.And then you finish the game and find out that there are achievements to play with just the story dependant heroes (Hero Mode). And the challenge increases by a factor of 7.And then you finish the game doing Hero Mode and find out about New Game +That's where the game really shines. Because not only is there a whole lot more story, greater challenge in all the previous maps, more achievements AND extra maps... there is also Hero Mode +And then there are all the bonus maps...The game is bursting with content, oozing challenge out of every pixel and spurting out humor.No. Don't wait for a sale. This is not a game you MIGHT want, it is a game you can't NOT have.PS: There is also a sequel coming. Oh, and a free HD version for everyone who has the game.These are the kinds of devs you support.

												An excellent tower defense game that's very fun to play. The story is engrossing and well written and it has a nice difficulty curve. It also sports the best new game + modes I've ever played. I plan to buy the sequel to this day 1, and I plan to play the awesome free HD update that this game is getting from beggining to end. I'm hard pressed to think of any part about this game I didn't like. It can be a bit grindy but that's only if you decide you want to try to beat all of the difficulties in 1 sitting. For those of you who like to slap a game into hardmode from the getgo I guess I'd advise you to stay away because hard mode will kick you in the nuts, light you on fire, and then throw you out the window unless your characters are ready for it.Great game from an awesome indie dev team. Well worth your time and money.			"

												This is a tower defense/RPG hybrid where your towers and home base are all characters that level up between battles, giving you points to spend on stats and extra abilities. No tower mazing is involved, and there are enemies that can attack your towers, necessitating armor, dodge, and healing abilities in addition to strong damage output, slowing attacks, buffs, debuffs, and knockback. Defender's Quest succeeds in blending tower defense and RPG gameplay thanks to strong design on many levels.pros:+ core gameplay is fun -- character and enemy design are good and placing/upgrading your characters always feels strategic+ excellent balance and tuning with multiple difficulty settings+ the interface is intuitive and well-designed+ there is a good amount of content in the game+ graphics may not be fancy, but they're attractive enough and nothing is an eyesore+ good soundtrack and SFX, although more length and variety in level music would be nice+ somewhat engaging but not overly distracting story with effective world-buildingcons:- weak customization: although there are many global spells and character upgrades to choose from, there's rarely more than one viable choice for top effectiveness.- the comedy in the game, while quite funny in its own right, is very silly and can clash with the dramatic aspects of the writing, hurting immersion and undercutting character development (looking at you Slak)Overall, this game is a real gem and I highly recommend it.

												I usually prefer to wait until I finish a game before I review it (barring episodic games but even then I finish the episodes that are available THEN review) but I enjoyed this game so much I figured I'd might as well review even before I finished it -- especially since it seems like there's so much to do! First of all, I'm not normally a tower defense fan; I actually picked up Defender's Quest as part of a Humble Bundle female protagonists deal. I don't even remember why I decided to try the game on a whim but I'm SO glad I did. The story is interesting and, even better, funny. There's tons of really good characters and the devs have done a good job of creating a story that walks the line between silly and serious pretty well. In terms of the gameplay, like I said -- I don't particularly enjoy tower defense, mostly because the ones I've played previous to this have all seemed far too complicated to be worth the time and effort. Prior to Defender's Quest, the game that I've enjoyed the most in the genre was Plants vs. Zombies. Defender's Quest is a step above that, really, because DQ actually attempts to have a story and character development, though the basic goals of the two games are the same. I'd say DQ is a little bit tougher than PvZ, if only because there's a lot more variability in the maps, whereas PvQ was a fairly straight-forward flat plain. DQ offers maps with multiple enemy spawn points (three is the most I've seen so far), different terrain (e.g., water vs. land), and various restrictions in routes for enemies (and placement for allies). I especially enjoyed the way you can change battle speed to slow down -- or pause -- the enemies spawning to catch up or speed up (4X is amazing) if you're sure your allies can handle the enemies without much management. It's a nice mix that I liked, because I prefer to micro-manage at the start, rather than during the battle. Even better is the different battle difficulty settings, so you can go back and replay battles on a harder setting (same map, different enemies) PLUS bonus challenges and (so the achievements would suggest) a new game plus mode -- means there's tons of stuff to do. Playing DQ actually makes me want to go out and find similar tower  defense games to play because I enjoyed this one so much -- which is probably the best compliment I can give a game!			"

												There are tower defense games, and then there is this game.  Typical tower defenses are simple romps through forgettable waves and stages but when you attach a fleshed out game with a complete story and your standard RPG elements, you find yourself enjoying this one.  It's also not too heavy on the system requirements so I can play it perfectly on my tablet, in bed, with a cup of tea, a few candles going, and the roommates upstairs having sex.			"

												Tower defense meets RPG.  Somehow it works really, really well.Worth noting that I usually hate tower defense games.  I think I got this as part of a Humble Bundle or something and only installed it when I was really bored one night and suffering from insomnia.  It made my night a whole lot better.  Characters of different classes replace what would normally be different defense turrets in other games, but you level them up individually with a skill tree unique to each class.  These unlocked skills and stats stay between maps, so you might have one archer set up for fantastic range while you set another one up for massive damage and a third for rate of fire.  This keeps the game interesting.  Also, none of the maps feel impossible to achieve a perfect on, as long as you're strategic and patient.  There's also a New Game + mode.  In retrospect, I'd be willing to have spent full price on this.EDIT:I went back and played through this game over the last couple of weeks and realized how good of a story it has.  The game manages to mix serious and humorous very well.  The writing is better than most games that cost five times as much.  I even pre-purchased the sequel directly from the developer because of how much I enjoyed this game.			"

												I bought this one because I remember playing it as a website's free flash game and I had very good memories of it. This game makes a perfect mix between Tower Defense (something I love) and RPG (which is a 'meh' to me). Defender's Quest may look like a 10 minutes casual game but it's not. It has an incredibly long story and it's full of challenges. You have a great control over difficulty in this game as each stage has 4 levels of difficulty, which also makes this game very replayable, as you'll need future gained strength to beat the 4th level of past stages.Despite of my lack of interest in RPG, the mix with Tower Defense is so good and balanced that I really enjoyed that part. You can have your very own and custom gameplay, as you plan your own team, choose how they evolve and choose the gear they equip.Defender's Quest is a great tactical game, it gives you a lot of freedom to test different strategies and it can give you different gameplay experiences based on your own choices and it doesn't get repetitive, something that is easily found in any other Tower Defense game.Gonchito approves this! (Yeah, I'm so great that I speak about me in third person).			"

												A qualified upvote == ""Tower defense"" games tend to be too similar to each other and that is this game's chief fault.  You can increase the difficulty but there's not a lot of real strategy.  5 troop types and overpowered range troops make the game a cakewalk in 90% of the scenarios.  There's virtually nothing new or surprising about the gameplay.  The humor and simple story line were consistently amusing though.  Bottomline?  If you like tower defense games, you'll like this one too.  A 7/10 game.			"

												If you love tower defence game, you will not regret picking this one up. So ok yes it only has fixed path maps, but it just does them so well, and with the character skill trees it really does vary it up just enough. The game does have a few problems imo but honestly I didnt even really notice them till I was well into new game + cause I was having such a great time with it.  So yes the skill trees could have been mapped diffrently, yes there could have been more map variety, yes weapons & armor were really really vanilla, yes there was soooooo much room for spell variety, yes there was so much more dialog and story your left wanting in the end. But in spite of these flaws the game completly shines over them. And to me did it in an endearing, charming way that really made me fall in love with it. It really left me just wanting more of it (which made me squee when I heard there making a DQ2)But at $15 us it would have been worth every penny, let alone the $5 I got it for. I just cant recomend this one enough for td fans. I will even go so far as to say its a must have for td buffs.			"

												This is a great tower defense game with lots or RPG elements included.  Instead of towers, you have heroes you position along a path to defend your leader.  As these heroes fight, they level up and can be built into different styles of tower depending on the skills you take.Pros- Lots of good tower defense gameplay- Lots of well done RPG elements so you can modify each hero and personalize your play style- Good story and interesting characters- Lots of great items to equip to make your heroes (towers) even more effective- The game rewards replay of older levels on higher difficulties by giving your heroes (towers) more experience and the ability to unlock special items- Lots of replay value with all the difficulty levels and all the things that can be unlocked.- Challenging maps that sometimes require you to think outside your normal setups.Cons- Older graphics- Gameplay can be repetative if you're just interested in the storyOverall this is a great game that I would highly recommend to an RPG or tower defense enthusiast. The game gives you the option of both relaxed gameplay and very challening maps if you want them.  (It also rewards your party for completing said maps.)			"

												A highly-recommended tower-alike game where the difficulty ranges from ""cakewalk through the game to see the ending(s)"" to ""oh my god, son, you gotta grind some more"" (protip to everyone - turn XP gain to 300% in the menu, just trust me, it's helpful and if you intend to play over Basic difficulty for more gear/do the ""plot characters only"" achievements you'll want this). Has an astounding new game plus feature with almost as much care put into the difficulty balance, adding sidequests, a new gear tweaking system, and a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move or twelve in endgame. You also get spells to control the flow of the battle more, a half-speed option for tougher segments or micromanagement if you prefer, and none of this will ruin your sweet, sweet achievements in any way. Game wants you to play it, not get stuck in place for weeks on end.Top 3 of its genre, guaranteed, and I only say top 3 because I know some people disagree with me on what the other two'd be. (for what it's worth I put this above Defense Grid, but I thought Defense Grid blew compared to Sol Survivor and its multiplayer).			"

												The crappy graphics and the whole ""flash"" vibe prevented me from buying this. But then the neverending stream of glowing recommendations made me take a chance that I don't regret. It's a fantastic tower defense game that is much deeper than it's terrible graphics hint at. It has serveral cool unlockable skills and a really tough new game+.Anyone who likes tower defense games should really try this game, it's fantastic! "

												this game has bad artthe rest is AWESOME. story is good. gameplay is solid. if i were to describe the gameplay its something like an rpg, except the combat has been replaced by tower-defence. each character you meet that joins your army can be placed down on the map, then it will attack with whichever move is off cooldown at the time. it speaks for itself that you have to place these ""towers"" in an tactical superior way, so they help each other kill the revenants (zombie type mobs with a variety of mechanics such as, but not limited to, attacking back, being able to swim,..).RPG:despite this being part rpg this does not contain any ""choice"" as regards to storyline (except maybe 1, though its very clear which one is superior). you do get to pick traits out of trait trees and make every character unique in its fighting style. also you can equip all your characters with weapons and armor (except the last kind, though you will understand when you get there). different weapons do no have different boons, the more expensive ones simply do more damage. same goes for armor, the more money it costs the more defense it gives. the customizability is in the trait system, definitely not the equipment system.tower defense:each tower is unique, and at the end of every match you get xp and perhaps a trait point (lvl up) to decide how you want to build it. you can improve your tower during the match though, with the match currency called spi, this will give him/her access to more moves. you can not block paths, or build any kind of obstruction to make the mobs change course. this is one of the tower defense mechanics that is missing (can't have it all).overall i would have gladly payed the full price for this game. it took me 20 hours to finish one playthrough 100%, and a short dabble in the new game+ feature. that is less then 1 euro per hour.played it on a windows 7 ultimate laptop, 3.3Ghz, 8GB ram, 3GB nvidia gpu with only 2 crashes, and very rarely some fps drop.

												An original approach to story design and a nice take on tower defense, Defender's Quest places you in the role of Azra, a librarian who gets epic powers to fight the otherwise invulnerable undead.The story has been designed from the ground up: taking the game mechanics of upgradable towers who gain experience to become stronger (""like an RPG""), a story to fit the mechanics has been devised. Quite like when you were presented with the task of making up a story and including certain words or characters, only Level Up Labs made a game out of that. The benefit is mostly avoiding pitfalls growing out of weird game mechanics. IMHO, while the story did not blow my mind it is still very fine and the result works quite well.So, like any tower defense, you defend a place from creeps that have different stats and abilities by placing ""towers"". In this they're game characters who have their own class and the associated, developable skills, i.e. attacks, buffs and debuffs. Azra summons them up and places them into the labyrinth in suitable locations. Every character is useful and has their role: to spell it out no one works as an instakill device against everything. The enemies always follow shortest path towards Azra, so you can plan accordingly even when some enemies can swim. Finally, if the troops fail, you can beat the horde back with spells. Everything uses kills for money.On the world map, you move along a linear path that sometimes diverges for sidequests. Every space is either a level with attacking waves of enemies or a town where you can buy weapons and armor and recruit troops. Story advances in every space so you're never bored unless getting stuck in a difficult level. That does not happen often, for the easy levels are really easy and you can even go to casual difficulty and/or set experience and money gain to 3x normal for faster leveling up without any penalty. You do get better rewards for higher difficulties, and to master a level it has to be beaten on extreme: this always rewards you with a special item granting the incentive for beating them all, if the associated achievement won't do it alone. You can also return to beat the levels again after you've grown in strength.When the levels run out, there are several ""challenge"" levels to beat, two of which are of endless type with ever-so stronger incoming waves. After beating the game you can also give it another go with NG+ that is more difficult with monsters getting additional special abilities. NG+ also adds several additional sidequests and its own version of the challenges.While the flash graphics aren't eye candy, the music is engaging and the residing mechanics will let you enjoy the game for several tens of hours. However, trying to beat every level perfectly can become tedious, for the levels get tougher and tougher as you advance. Typing this, I've yet to beat the last few levels on extreme. Still, I would heartily recommend the game for tower defense fans: I sure got a blast with it. I especially recommend going for the Hero Mode+ challenge (and to lesser extent the Hero Mode++).			"

You end up surviving a plague and finding that the plague is far more dangerous than first imagined and is under the control of somekind of being that is raising those who fall to the plague as undead and using them in a unkillable army.i won't give anymore away, but it is quite a fascinating world they've created.

												Here it is almost 4 years later and we're about to get a HD remake and then the sequel. This game still holds up as one of the best tower defense games of all time. It's got RPG elements like leveling, skills and equipment alongside an engaging and entertaining story. There's plenty of depth and content and with the upcoming HD remake I'm looking forward to playing through it all over again. The graphics still look alright despite the age, there's a certain charm to the cutscenes and art style in general. This is going to change once the HD remake comes out but it will still be there as an option for those who want it. The music's good and everything in general is really good. There are a multitude of difficulty customization options and even challenges for achievements or in game rewards, such as never hiring anyone and running through the game with only the story characters (which is really hard) and then running through it again on New Game+ with these same people and getting all the levels beaten on all difficulties (which is almost impossible). There's so many strategies and options available that you will be playing this many many times.			"

												This game was amazing back when I first got it for cheap cheap from a Steam coupon. I saw it was a tower defense game, and I said to myself, ""This is only a few bucks, I'll try it out."" Oh my, I didn't know how much I would love this game.Defender's Quest is a tower defense game with RPG elements, mainly experience points, skill trees, and a good story inbetween the gameplay. It the game has humor, which is rather welcome. The gameplay is where this game really shines.This is simply the best tower defense game I've ever played. You may have played a tower defense game before, but you haven't played Defender's Quest. It has a lot of depth to its gameplay, it has a very intuitive UI and an unobtrusive tutorial that is very helpful. Tutorial can be turned off entirely in the options, if you really want to. While you're at it, you can increase the experience and gold you get from the game to make it easier, or crash it into the ground and make the game harder. The music fits the game's atmosphere perfectly. I haven't even mentioned that you can mod every aspect of this game yet. Go look in the workshop; the creators of the game made a free sci-fi version of the game just to show you how much flexibility there is in regular modding.Everything I've mentioned was made better with the recent update. I recommend this game wholeheartedly. 10/10.			"

If you like tower defense, this is a no-brainer.  If you don't, it' still an excellent game by pretty awesome devs.  If you are a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, well, I'm sorry your eyes keep you from enjoying good gameplay?  But other than that there's nothing to complain about here.Also beating the game once is apparently just scratching the surface.			"

												Never thought RPG and Tower defence genre could have a great cross-bred like this!Like any other TD games out there, your main mission is prevent any enimies from reaching the party leader standing at the end of the road. The horde which is consist of a few types of zombies, slug-like creatures,... keeps coming in pre-defined routes. In fact, there's nothing quite unique in the mechanic of TD in this game.However, the true gem lies in the RPG aspect of the game. What's a TD game without towers? Nah, your towers now are replaced by class-based characters ranging from a psychopath to a cute dragon. Many elements of RPG genre are brought into the game like skill tree, equipments and again, classes. Trouble with fast moving creeps, you have an Ice Mage to counter, or facing heavy armor zombies with the might of a Paladin.Not every maps are so hard, but you still need to grind a little for exp and especially epic items. (well, not really that epic but atleast they have purple titles)To be honest, you can't expect a long and heart-touching story with dozens of play time for such a small game like this, but for almost 3 hours so far I'm quite satisfied. Finally, thanks jatan11t/GAR for this lovely gift :)			"

												This is a super addictive tower defense game.  Take on the role of a Librarian who is thought to contract the plague and tossed into ""the pit"" a canyon seperated from the rest of civilization where plague victims spend the rest of their days.  She takes on a mysterious power that allowes her and people she connects to mentally the ability to completely destroy the undead revenant that the plague victims become.  Like other tower defense games you need to protect the goal from hordes of invading enemies with units or towers that you place along the pathways to destroy the enemies.  However, unlike other games, this one has a story, and your characters stay with you, level up and grow along side your main unit.  This game comes complete with mod support from the devs so that you can change things in a seperate module as you like if you want a more/less challenging playthrough, as well as letting you change character designs and spell effects. 8/10 will play again.

												This game brought back refreshing memories of old school tower defence games I used to play. Unfortunately once you play a few tower defence games it seems like you have played them all. However, Defender's Quest is unlike all those other games with its humour and fantastic story to boot. I had laughed so hard at some of the comments between the characters when they interacted that I had to explain to my friends what I was laughing at. The game itself plays very well. It is not terribly difficult to beat the game, however new game + and the secrets hidden in the game are very difficult. Unfortunately it took a community of players to find all the secrets in the game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you like the challenge. If you are an achievement hunter this one will take some time and patience, or just some forum searching.			"

												I forgot I had this game and I am ashamed that I forgot I had it. I had a lot of fun playing this before, as I did just now, but it is late. I feel it deserves my thumbs up. I'll tell ya why.You are a lady who finds people to join you and help out as the story progresses. The story is quite nice. The people are funny and will often make jokes and claim that they hate the hero, when really they don't.The actual gameplay itself is typical of most tower defense. You have a grid where you place your units (the 'people' that joined you), and they fight when something is near. What I like about this game is that the different types of units work together. I won't go into any detail about this because you'll probably want to experience it yourself.Each level is split up into four difficulties. So if you're feeling brave, you can try the hardest. Even if you fail your units will still gain experience points. If you're feeling like a wuss, try the casual setting.The units have skill trees which you apply 1 point on each level up. I find this to be very rewarding, although sometimes when you complete a level you may have to apply a buncha points (I had to apply about 20 before after one level). C'est la vie.It is well worth the whatever I paid for it. I don't remember buying it, but I am very glad I did. You'll not be disappointed if you're a fan of tower defense games with a hint of humour and a nice storyline.			"

												You play as  Azra, a librarian who's been plague-infected and thus thrown into  the Pit. This deep and vast place was supposed to be her graveyard but instead, on the brink of death she learns of her new powers and purpose. Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten  is a tower defense mixed with RPG elements. It features a decent story spiced with funny dialogue between party members (unfortunately not voice acted). There's quite a few maps and the new game+ along with endless mode brings a whole lot of content to the table. It's also worth keeping in mind that the game gets really, really hard towards the end of the ng+ playthrough even with end game gear and abilities.Highly recommended for those who enjoy tower defenses.

												(9/10) Simple defense game in an already over-crowded genre, but man they executed it to perfection.  Retro 90's pixel art style, mixed with a ton of options and depth, mixed with a huge pile of scaling difficulty replay, mixed with a ton of clever scenarios and an overall mix of 'tower' people which allows alot of personalization and gives a ton of room for different play styles to all succeed.  So, yeah, if you like defense games, just get it, play it, enjoy its quirky story and characters, but stay for the *almost* never ending replayability			"

												This is an absolutely fantastic little game. Yes, it's tower defence. Yes, it's fantasy-ish. If either of those put you off, don't let it. This really is one of the best-executed games I've played this year. The difficulty curve is spot on, the ""feel"" of the game is a nice balance between OTT planning and casual tower placement, and the whole thing just hangs together very well. It's an asbolute gem.Greatly recommended. I love it.			"

												Pros+ Fun tower defense game with great gameplay+ Can adjust difficulty+ Amusing dialogue+ Can customize units+ New game + adds new features that provide replay valueCons- Graphics are unimpressive- Music is repetitive- Cut scenes look like they were made in MS Paint- If you want the achievements, you can't utilize the unit customizationOverall score: 8/10Defender's Quest is a great tower defense game for fans of the genre. It is the only tower defense game I can think of that has a decent plot, which I think adds to the game's charm. You can also adjust the game's difficulty without any penalty. (300% gold and EXP is very useful when you need to grind.) I also like how I can name and customize my units. So many tower defense games have you fill the screen with identical units, so it's nice to create an army of unique people.I'm not very picky when it comes to graphics, but I think the game could really use better graphics and music. It's not a deal-breaker, but it does take away from game to some extent. Also, I like playing for achievements, but some of the game's achievements prevent you from using one of using one of the game's best features; namely, you can't utilize the unit customization since recruitable units are not Hero Units. I think that's a disappointment, but this is only a problem if you actually care about achievements.Overall, Defender's Quest is a fun tower defense game that has lots of charm. If you enjoy tower defense games, I'd definitely recommend Defender's Quest for some classic tower defense gameplay.			"

Posted: November 9, 2015
												I wrote a review for this about a year or so ago but thought I'd rewrite it as I have some different and new views on the game.First off, this is a tower defense game that revolves around a well written story with a nicely done narrative that includes all the who/what/when/where/why questions, along with moments of subtle humor and despair. On the first play through you get all the character dialogue that propels the story but not a whole lot more. On the second play through you get the main character's (Azra unless otherwise named) thoughts after each mission is completed. These journal entries go pretty in-depth for being subtext you don't even need to go through. There are some 30 entries and I do recommend reading them.The game starts with the Azra wondering where the hell she is and finding the first warrior, Slak, entering into a battle against the Revenant (the dead). The story progresses and you will find all the other characters (read 'towers'). There are six others you find and you can have up to six of them in that class, in total allowing you to have an army of 36 towers and Azra.The Berserker is a hack 'n' slash guy. He wields a sword, wears no shirt, and thirsts for blood.The Ranger is your snarky and quick witted bow expert. She often griefs Azra on menial things such as, ""not being pretty enough to have her plans work out.""The Healer comes off as overprotective and cautious but holds the team together.The Ice Mage is cold and has cynical tendencies but wields the power to stop hordes of foes.The Knight is rightous and pledges himself to Azra. He takes down the strongest enemies by ripping them of their armor.The Dragon is the last to join the group. She acts like a god and thinks the humans beneath her yet is impressed at how far Azra and her companions have traveled thus far. She also enjoys eating sheep.With these characters you can create varying strategies on every battlefield in the game. Some will require a near exact positioning that you'll figure out by trial and error, while others are more liberal in placement. You can pull off a ton of combos though and it's cool to find something that synergizes well.Now, along with all the characters, each has a skill branch (not tree since there are only two directions it goes) and with each level you get one point to put in each skill slot. Most of them are damage boosts for their attack tier (each character has a five tier attack that is upgraded through Psi that is earned by killing enemies in the level) and the rest are passive buffs. They can include skill cooldowns, range, crit/poison/bleed/blind/armor piercing chance, slow/stun/burn, group damage amplifiers and tagging enemies so they take more damage.Azra also has six spells she can upgrade. There are three damage and three buff spells. A direct lightning attack, an area of effect crystal explosion, and a full screen flame attack. The buffs are sending your characters into a frenzy to increase attack speed, massive healing, and pushing back waves of enemies. There are also unlockable spell books that can be equipped to provide boosts.There are three weapons in game that two classes can use. Swords for the Berserker and Knight, a bow for the Ranger, and staffs for the Healer and Ice Mage. Progressing through the story increases the price and damage of future weapons. Armor can be equipped to them as well, heavy and light variants. The max level each member can achieve is 60 so you won't be able to max every skill on each character. The good thing about having multiple in a class means that you can have someone with a high bleed chance, and give the other person the higher armor piercing chance. At any point you can pay a small fee of scrap (currency) to respec their builds.So that's the gist of the game. Pretty straight forward. Where things really get rolling are on the new game +. Much more challenging and rewarding. A new currency of ""skulls"" becomes used to upgrade the special weapons and armors you aquire through missions. It's pretty hard to get all the skulls as you'll need to grind to get your characters to a high enough level to beat the much harder than before levels. There are also a few puzzles hidden here and there that you need to keep an eye out for. I had some trouble with it and found a guide and without it there would've never been a way I'd have caught on.All in all, more than your run of the mill tower defense game, great story, fun and unique characters, scaling rewards that only get better and better through all the challenges, and tons of replayability as there is mod support. Oh, if you really want a challenge, there's an achievement to beat the game and new game + with only the original characters, not using any of the extra hired ones. And then getting 180 stars (awarded through level completion). That took a ton of time.			"

You don't have any actual 'towers', you have characters, who gain xp, level up, you equip them with weapons and armor, and manage their skill trees. There is 5 difficulty level for every encounter and there is also a game+ mode if you finish the game, which means a lot of replay value :)This game wasn't even on my wishlist. If it weren't for the -90% steam sale,I would totally miss this gem. And I am already awaiting the sequel...			"

												I have always found it really hard to get into the serious RPG game genre like ""Final Fantasy"" and ""Chrono trigger"", not because I dislike the hundreds of hours you have to put into it but the actual combat system have always been booring to me. It gets old way to fast and I get sick of it after a few hours, no matter the great story or character developement I never came back to those games. It was more of a pain and tedious grinding than fun and epic adventure.""Defender's Quest"" however kept me in my seat. It's basically an RPG mixed with tower defense, the best of both worlds if you ask me. I like everyone else play tower defense games because of it's gameplay, which is why this game is great. I took out the part that I hate in RPGs and replaced it with one of the most replayable gametypes that there is, which makes me wonder why no one have come up with this earlier. It seems that alot of games are jumping on the ""Mix RPG with other genres"" train which really makes me happy to see. This game is great from what I've seen so far and great for anyone who have always wanted to get into RPGs but been scared of due to the grindy and difficult gameplay. I have played ""Final Fantasy XIII"" and didn't know what the heck I was doing 15 hours into the game, it felt like a fancy pokemon without the fun. I'm currently only 6 hours in and feel comfortable already, Yes this game is hard and you will have to grind to get the best gear. However, each level has a difficulty setting like any mobile game, making it really easy if you want to speed through the story, still providing a challenge and bonuses for those willing to get them.I am currently only 6 hours in I cant wait to play more, I'm just hoping the game is as lengthy as an actual RPG, which if it isn't might be off putting. And it's worth noting that I only stopped played due to a game crash, it is the first time it has happened so I cannot say if it i a regular.Either way I do sincerely recommend this game, it is currently on sale, definitely worth it for the price tag, grab it now to save some cash.

												This is one of my favourite tower defense games to date. Having your ""towers"" be unique characters that individually equip items and level up adds a surprising amount of depth and customization to the game. It seems so simple, but it's a huge improvement over the generic towers of most games in the tower defense genre. Also, the game does a really good job of letting players dictate how difficult they want the game to be, and provides a good number of incentives to replay levels at harder difficulties (including powerful unique items). More games need to learn from this; let players decide how they want to play!Add to that terrific targeting options for towers, fast-paced gameplay, steam workshop support, and even some nice music, and I am very impressed by this game. Highly recommended.			"

												Puzzle Quest (the original one, at least) was an excellent hybrid of a fantasy RPG and a ""Bejeweled"" puzzle game. Defender's Quest is an excellent hybrid of a fantasy RPG and a tower defense game. I found the RPG elements and the story/premise of DQ to be well incorporated into its tower defense game-play, perhaps even more so than it was in PQ's ""Bejeweled"" game-play. The artwork in PQ was a little better than it is DQ, but DQ's artwork is stylistically well implemented and is arranged organically, especially in the maps/stages. If you love RPG's and tower defense games, or even if you love one and merely like the other, this is a great game to get - especially when considering how cheap it's going for, on Steam.			"

												Don't be turned off by the graphics of this game.  It really is something special.  It's lane defense, pure and simple, but it does this so well, making it an rpg where all your towers can level up and improve through skill trees unique to them.  The graphics are a bit primitive, and the story cut scenes might turn some people off, but give it a chance.  The story is what sold me, as it's incredibly funny without having to go through the self aware brand of humor.  It's just really well written, with great jokes and comedic timing.  The gameplay is very satisfying and there's a lot of things to do, thanks to new game plus and challenge modes.  You can even tweak how fast your characters level in order to speed your game along.  I cannot recommend this enough because it's just fun and gives you so many options for play.  There's even an option to increase game speed to make those usually slow lane defense games super fast, for either convenience or increased difficulty.  Wonderful little title.			"

												This game really surprised me, I thought it was gonna be yet another meh tower defense game, but it's way better. You can gear up your defenders, find amazing items by completing the previous levels on harder difficulty, level up and place skills points to each of your defenders, recruit, shop, etc...The cons: Not that many different enemy types (around 20 maybe?), pretty standard graphics, memory leaks and low fps issues (you have to restart the game each 2 hours or so if you don't want an eventual crash...)The replay value of the game is not the best, but completing the entire game with 4 stars on every levels will take you at least 20 hours. The game took me over 35 hours to get 100% achievements.Also the game has a very funny comic style story. I suggest getting this if you're into tower defense games and even if you're new to the genre!			"

												 I picked it up because it was 90% off....and 3.4 hours later I'm at Act IV, even if for some it may seem repetitive or easy, it's worth it, since the game makes you have to think about positioning and things like that, like most TD games. You can also equip items to your ""towers"" in order to make them stronger and there are also skills that improve them a lot, which as opposed to just upgrading the ""towers"" so they do more damage and things like that. I like these kind of games a lot, I would say since back when Warcraft III had that kind of deal going. I am sure there was in Starcraft, but I wasn't able to access B.net at that time. For me the fact that it's an RPG/TD caught my attention, because I like RPGs and well, combining RPG with Tower Defense is no easy deal, right? (Can't say I have experience with something that has both, always have gone for one of the two.)10/10 would recommend.			"

												As a fan of tower defense games, I play a lot of them.  This is one of my favourites.  Excellently presented, it feels sort of like a classic RPG in tower defense form.  Units have basic skill trees, and can be upgraded by leveling up or equipping gear.  Various overarching abilities and perks can be used by Azra (the main character) in the heat of battle as well.The story is also quite interesting, and didn't feel like it was just tacked on to the gameplay; both aspects are very well realized.  I highly recommend this one for fans of the genre.			"

This means -- you can play the original game and slowly level up at a normal pace, OR you can turn on the 300% bonus and level up super fast, blasting through your foes and the missions (with no negative consequences to the story or achievements). The ACHIEVEMENTS are fun to attain, even more so since you can craft the game that you want.  The TUTORIALS are spot on, easy to follow, and makes the gameplay very quick to learn and execute. The STORY and ILLUSTRATIONS are well done and add a lot to the game's enjoyment and depth. Better still is that DEFENDER'S QUEST is part of the Steam Trading Cards program. Definitely recommended gaming.			"

												This game is a brilliant tower defense game. You take a very active role in upgrading towers/people and using active powers. There is a robust upgrade system for your hero and each type of tower/role. The game has an EXCELLENT story with unusually distinct and interesting characters. As for longevity, there is a new game+ mode that adds new side quests involving a completely new story line! There is plenty of incentive to go back and replay levels at harder difficulties because the rewards are improved and there are different enemies, which can drastically change how a level plays. Seriously, this game is great value at full price and a steal if you ever see it on sale. If you like this genre, just buy it already!			"

												I know there are a ton of tower defense games out there... and even a few that propose to add RPG-like elements.  Defender's quest is different, and different good.  The game strikes that perfect balance by replacing the ""towers"" with NPCs.  The difficulty ramp-up is near perfect for a game and gives you as much challenge as you want without subjecting you to any levels where you fall off a difficulty cliff.  If something's just a little too hard, or you're trying to get a better result?  Level up your guys or buy them beter equipment.Yes, the game runs at a fixed resolution and no, the cutscenes (which tell an engrossing tale) are done with limited animation, but that's really OK.   The limitations don't detract from the game and you can tell all of the love and time and effort went into perfecting gameplay and giving you plenty of it.  If you're lukewarm on tower defense because you don't like the repetition, this game's for you.  If you're a die-hard TD fanatic, this game's for you.  Accessible, perfect ramp-up, plenty of content, and a story.  Definitely this game is one to get.			"

												Pretty decent tower defence, interesting story, and i enjoy the semi-persistant character/tower concept. The resolution is a bit funky, but it does adress it to a degree. Keys a re rebindable, both by several presets or do-it-yourself.Progression looks fairly balanced, though you will on occasion need to replay a previous level to buff up.I haven't delved into the workshop content yet, but that was an unexpected and welcome addition.I'd definately recommend it, and it appears they are working on a second one with a whole new story/world. keepin an eye out for that~			"

												I have always found it really hard to get into the serious RPG game genre like ""Final Fantasy"" and ""Chrono trigger"", not because I dislike the hundreds of hours you have to put into it but the actual combat system have always been booring to me. It gets old way to fast and I get sick of it after a few hours, no matter the great story or character developement I never came back to those games. It was more of a pain and tedious grinding than fun and epic adventure.""Defender's Quest"" however kept me in my seat. It's basically an RPG mixed with tower defense, the best of both worlds if you ask me. I like everyone else play tower defense games because of it's gameplay, which is why this game is great. I took out the part that I hate in RPGs and replaced it with one of the most replayable gametypes that there is, which makes me wonder why no one have come up with this earlier. It seems that alot of games are jumping on the ""Mix RPG with other genres"" train which really makes me happy to see. This game is great from what I've seen so far and great for anyone who have always wanted to get into RPGs but been scared of due to the grindy and difficult gameplay. I have played ""Final Fantasy XIII"" and didn't know what the heck I was doing 15 hours into the game, it felt like a fancy pokemon without the fun. I'm currently only 6 hours in and feel comfortable already, Yes this game is hard and you will have to grind to get the best gear. However, each level has a difficulty setting like any mobile game, making it really easy if you want to speed through the story, still providing a challenge and bonuses for those willing to get them.I am currently only 6 hours in I cant wait to play more, I'm just hoping the game is as lengthy as an actual RPG, which if it isn't might be off putting. And it's worth noting that I only stopped played due to a game crash, it is the first time it has happened so I cannot say if it i a regular.Either way I do sincerely recommend this game, it is currently on sale, definitely worth it for the price tag, grab it now to save some cash.

												This is one of my favourite tower defense games to date. Having your ""towers"" be unique characters that individually equip items and level up adds a surprising amount of depth and customization to the game. It seems so simple, but it's a huge improvement over the generic towers of most games in the tower defense genre. Also, the game does a really good job of letting players dictate how difficult they want the game to be, and provides a good number of incentives to replay levels at harder difficulties (including powerful unique items). More games need to learn from this; let players decide how they want to play!Add to that terrific targeting options for towers, fast-paced gameplay, steam workshop support, and even some nice music, and I am very impressed by this game. Highly recommended.			"

												Puzzle Quest (the original one, at least) was an excellent hybrid of a fantasy RPG and a ""Bejeweled"" puzzle game. Defender's Quest is an excellent hybrid of a fantasy RPG and a tower defense game. I found the RPG elements and the story/premise of DQ to be well incorporated into its tower defense game-play, perhaps even more so than it was in PQ's ""Bejeweled"" game-play. The artwork in PQ was a little better than it is DQ, but DQ's artwork is stylistically well implemented and is arranged organically, especially in the maps/stages. If you love RPG's and tower defense games, or even if you love one and merely like the other, this is a great game to get - especially when considering how cheap it's going for, on Steam.			"

												Don't be turned off by the graphics of this game.  It really is something special.  It's lane defense, pure and simple, but it does this so well, making it an rpg where all your towers can level up and improve through skill trees unique to them.  The graphics are a bit primitive, and the story cut scenes might turn some people off, but give it a chance.  The story is what sold me, as it's incredibly funny without having to go through the self aware brand of humor.  It's just really well written, with great jokes and comedic timing.  The gameplay is very satisfying and there's a lot of things to do, thanks to new game plus and challenge modes.  You can even tweak how fast your characters level in order to speed your game along.  I cannot recommend this enough because it's just fun and gives you so many options for play.  There's even an option to increase game speed to make those usually slow lane defense games super fast, for either convenience or increased difficulty.  Wonderful little title.			"

												Defender's Quest starts off as a pretty simple tower defence game with a goofy fantasy story and basic presentation, but then you start getting deeper into the game, unlock all the character classes and upgrade your characters more, and you find that there is actually a ton of depth and playability here. What's more, it never loses its intuitive and elegant design as it becomes more mechanically complex, and the game does a fine job of presenting you with a tough challenge but essentially giving you all the tools you need to overcome said challenge. Success is not determined simply by grinding to level up your characters, but rather by finding a way to better manage your resources until you find the optimal way to succeed.This was one of my sleeper hits from 2013, and it's one of my favourite tower defence games on Steam, up there with Defence Grid: The Awakening and Plants vs. Zombies. It's a great starter tower defence game and introduces less experienced players to its mechanics in a very manageable way, but it also provides the depth and strategy that you just won't get from most of the free flash-based TD games you can find online. It's a fresh take on the genre and its very well executed...just don't expect to be too engaged by the cutscenes and character interactions that break up the combat missions. They're occasionally funny, but often rote and unnecessarily long. But that's just about my only criticism of the game - everything else is rock-solid.			"

												As a person who started his TD career in WC2/SC i'd say this is some of the most fun I have had playing a tower defense game. Instead of using Towers you call forth allies to your astral plane (Current Map) to help defend yourself from Revenent's (The bad guys). There are several different Allies to choose from and each ally can be specifically tailored for any given purpose. There is a suprising amount of depth involved in deciding where to place your unused talent points. Each character is Namable and has cosmetic customizable options. Naming a Character after yourself makes you want to use that character which is alot of fun to role play. If your into that sort of thing.The town's have places to recruit new allies and buy new weapon and armor. The map plays out alot like Mario World or the equivalent and you can go back and beat older levels on harder diff's to get better gear and level. There is also a storyline written by some type of Wrinting/English major and the writing isn't too terrible. Some if it will give you a laugh and some will just make you scratch your head. But all in all this game is a lot of fun and is definitely worth the little money asked.-Casey			"

												What sets this game apart from Bloons? What makes it more entertaining than most TD's I've played? I'd say it's the story and different kinds of gameplay styles that seamlessly make its way into the regular gameplay. It has so much content, finishing the final level only means that you have the New game+ and new side quests to explore. The comedic dialogue, though not the greatest, does provide an interesting read. The 'towers' or more specifically, classes, vary in type and techniques. There's not a whole lot of grinding, which plagues most RPG's. It's a simple game to learn and is easy to pick up. There's little to no penalty to losing a wave (though you can actually change that if you'd like in the options) and the game should run fairly well on most computers. It does rarely crash, though the game autosaves for you so no harm done there. It's not overwhelming for the casual player, and it provides a good challenge for the competitive types.Plus, you can get friggin' dragons in your party for god's sake.			"

												Tied in my mind with Defense Grid for best tower-defense game to date. Where Defense Grid's strength is the perfect distillation of the tower-defense formula, Defender's Quest remains toe-to-toe with it because of how it radically adapts the basic idea of tower-defense -- deploying stationary defenses along a path or series of paths -- to work with a highly original fantasy setting and a set of solid RPG-like mechanics. The presentation, while not sophisticated, is incredibly appealing, and the writing is nothing short of superb.  It's also endlessly replayable, and the New Game + mode actually gives you a reason to do so.Highly recommended to everyone, tower-defense fans and non-fans alike.  As with Defense Grid, If you're a fan, you will like this; if you're not already, this stands a good chance of converting you, and if it doesn't, then you never have to wonder about another tower-defense game again, as you'll know it's just not your bag.

												I got this game in a bundle and didn't think much of it at first glance because of the graphics. I started it up just to confirm that I could dismiss it, and four hours later, I came up for air and I realized I was having a blast! Defender's Quest is amazing. Don't dismiss it because of the graphics; the graphics' quality has no bearing on the gameplay. DQ is challenging, amusing, difficult, easy, and rewarding. Great music. Good story. High replayability because it has 34 maps, 4 difficulty levels for all maps, new game+ with all maps, and eight bonus challenges! And it offers some crazy difficult achievements. If you have any interest in tower defense, strategy battles, turn-based combat, indie games, or RPGs, get this game right now. It is one of most fun games I've ever played.			"

Tower defense fans must try this game. Good humor exchanges among the characters adds color to the story.Replayability comes with challenges - and you can expect it from this game from its New Game+.Workshop offers many new contents but at the moment it is rather dull probably because it's still new.For 5 dollars you can't go wrong.

												A fairly fun tower defense game with some RPG elements to it. The fact that I've actually spent 20+ hours on a game I spent less than 5$ on was definitely worth it. The writing can be quite funny (a tower defense game with a story, you better believe it), and the completely nutbag characters are quite charming all in their own special kind of ways.For short bursts, or a long session, this game has the capability for both.

												If you enjoy the tower defense style then this is a no brainer. This game is very good. Instead of towers, you manage a group of character with different skills. You recruit then, equip them, boost their abilities and finally use them as towers. They can die in the fight btw, you have to be careful. The difficulty is tuned just fine and the extra challenges will give you even more headaches.			"

												A fun little tower defense with RPG elements. The protagonist is a librarian cast into a plague colony, and sets out on a quest to escape. She quickly discovers latent supernatural powers that allow others to defeat the zombified infected. She serves as the objective that must be defended. Besides the standard ability to summon units to defend her, she's also capable of casting spells for harming or buffing, and can equip spell books to further enhance her abilities.Throughout the game you'll encounter characters who join with you, unlocking new classes of characters (berserker, archer, healer, etc.) that you can hire and summon to defend you. The classes come with simple skill trees that unlock new abilities or enhance them in some way, and every individual unit can be leveled differently from the other, enabling a more diverse army to choose from.The game is made for a wide variety of skill levels. New players and seasoned veterans alike will find something to challenge them when the game gets rolling, and you can replay maps as you please for practice or for XP/money. The map's rewards are better for higher difficulty settings, and can reward unique equipment for success. The game can seem like a grindfest, but the devs wisely included the option to increase XP/money gains and to ensure all units get equal access to it, regardless of whether or not they entered battle.The story itself is very competent. The characters are largely likeable and the writing and humor is enjoyable. The cast tend to have something of an emphasis on their quirks, but mostly avoid becoming bland one notes with varying degrees of depth.The game is not without its flaws. Completionists can find that the New Game+ might become something of a chore, the skill trees are rather simple in their execution, and certain parts of the story or characters can become tiresome (looking at you, Slak). If you can put this aside, you still have a fun and funny game that's worth a look. Grab the demo and give it a spin. You can even transfer your save file if you choose to purchase it, and the game is set to receive an HD update (at the time of writing) and sequel.			"

												Highly recommended.This is a great game. I put about 200 hours into this. If you enjoy defense strategy like Defense Grid or Orcs Must Die then this is for you. It seems easy at first but it becomes more difficult as you play. You will receive a true challenge on the very hard and the newgame+ levels. What I liked most about this game is that you can play the game relaxed or increase the difficulty for a real challenge. The storyline is decent and keeps you engaged. If you find yourself in a challenging spot for newgame+, I would encourage researching level up and placement ideas. Lots of fun and well worth the $$. I will be purchasing the next release.			"

												Let's be real here. I bought the game solely to support Lars Doucet's great blog post about [apparently cencored ""competing"" company >_>] on his Fortress of Doors website. That and the just-smug-enough trailer I was thrown with when I loaded the Steam page for the game. I don't really plan to play it. I mean who actually plays games they buy? I just like to support good and interesting games and devs with good policies and great minds.Pros:+ Deluxified off-screen nudity is much appreciated.Cons:- It was in summer sale when I bouth it.Definitely recommended! Sounds like a whale of a time. I wouldn't know.Cheers! I'm back to playing fighting games and Melee.			"

												Edit, update: apparently the graphics will be getting a *free* HD update, which is exactly what I felt was missing with this game. My recomendation is to WAIT for the free HD update before playing. Go ahead and buy it now if it is on sale.Counter review to all the fanboy hype for this game, as I just bought it on sale since it looked good and I needed something to play on my mac book.This is JUST any other tower defense game. Because every tower defence game has its own unique mechanics for upgrades. The only thing this game ""blends"" is RPG lore/tropes into tower defense as a theme. This is done in that you upgrade individual towers and each tower levels up on its own. That's it. The blend is just graphical, and it does that poorly because the graphics are poorly done. I don't want to be harsh because I want to give the indie devs the benefit of the doubt in that they couldn't aquire funding/talent for aethistics, but this is worse than a free flash game I could have played instead. Another problem which just elludes to really ameature/cheap UI development is that the game cannot go into fullscreen correctly. It just remains at 800x600 and the fullscreen option simply draws a giant black box on your monitor and centers teh 800x600 game. Why couldn't they have actually developed the UI before releasing it...? Not really a pleasing game to play, way better TD games imho. A game like ""Castaway Tower Defense"" has much better graphics/UI/visual-imersion than this for example and is free.As for the writing, it is cute but not good. Some of it is just wrong regarding vocabulary which is odd since one of the selling points was that it was ""actually written by an English Major"". For example, one of the bad guys loses his entire army and complains that his forces were decimated. Just bad and confusing writing, as the verb ""to decimate"" means to reduce by 10%. This is something that the Romans would do to their own troops to instill fear into them, to punish them, and to prevent rebellion. It is not something that would happen if you lose all of your army, that would be to have been obliterated or to annihilate.			"

												This is easily the best tower defense type of game that I have ever played. The difficulty starts off quite easy and gradually adds new unit types on both offense and defense. The regular game never really gets too tough but once you start up a new game+ the gloves come off and it stops holding your hand altogether. Persistant leveling and a well written comical story seal the deal and really suck you in. Cut scenes are minimalistic but very well done.I bought this game on sale without really knowing anything about it other than it looked cool and was really cheap yet I really wish I had bought it sooner. A lot of indies get a lot of undeserved hype while this one got none that I heard of. Really fun game that everyone should own.			"

												Tower Defense + RPG is a great combo. Instead of tons of anonymous units you have a few units of each of several different classes (berserker, knight, healer, ice mage...). Each has permanent (across battles) level ups and equipment, then in battle you 'boost' the units, which upgrades them for that battle. It works quite well, and all the mechanics actually make sense in the game world.			"

												When I bought this game, I expected I was getting a mediocre game that would help me pass the time while I looked for other, more interesting games to play.  It turns out that the videos on the store page somehow make the game look a less interesting than it actually is.There's something quite satisfying about surveying each level, and positioning your troops such that different types of troops are in positions that allow them to function as efficiently as possible.  It's fun to get progressively better at optimizing what your (growing) set of troops can do.The second playthrough was a little less interesting.  You're left with either choosing to grind for experience for your troops, or to turn up the experience multiplier (which feels like cheating to me), so I can't say there's much replay value.  However, that shouldn't stop you from buying the game and playing through once, if you're so inclined.7.5/10. "

												This is an AMAZING game. It is an RPG Tower Defence. Instead of towers, you have a party of people, which are put in to 6 different classes. You only get a max of 6 of each class, so placing them on the lvls more important than other tower defence games.As a bonus, everyone in your party gets XP even if they were not put out, which makes getting those lvl 1 guys you just got up to a lvl that they can be helpful much easier. Each party member has their own lvl as well, and each class has 5 different skills they can use in total. However, when on a lvl, you must 'boost' them to get access to the high lvl skills. This, in turn, makes the game very strategic. Do you put a few of your people out, and boost them to Max at the start, or do you put more people out, and only boost them to lvl 2 or 3. If you like Tower Defence games, and are looking for a challenge, then this game is right up your ally. And, as a bonuses, the story as actually pretty dam good too.

												A indie tower defense game with alot of heart and soul ,backed up by rewarding players for good use of tactical placement of heros and use of powers. The story also deserves credit for being simple and easy to follow, while also having depth and complexity. The animations themselves are not impressive but between the serious and quirky story or the unyeilding waves of horrible monsters chomping at the heros the game has plenty to dig into and intices players to dig back into the game a second or even third time to experince new thrills and challenges.

												This is a brilliant mix of Tower Defence and RPG. Great, and actually horrifying story, despite the cartoony cutscenes and pixelated gameplay, but also filled with wacky humour.You can replay levels on harder difficulty for special unique weapons or extra exp or scrap (money) rewards, and once you finish your first playthrough, you can play a new game plus with a twist: you get extra (difficult) sidequests which sometimes are just extra rewards, but others thoroughly expand the story.All in all, good gameplay, great music, hilarious but also serious and tragic characters and story. Definitely worth the smal price.			"

												A good RPG, a good tower defense game. Gets all the basics of both right. Worth playing, even paying full price.The only bad part is the story is kind of stupid, and tried to explain the fact it's a tower defense game in probably one of the most bizarre ways you could imagine. The story itself isn't exactly bad, but it's the typical ""you are the chosen one"".My dislike of the story is a subjective claim, however the core game play is  there.8/10Dumb story, and could have had more depth to the skill tree.

												Tower Defense + RPG is a great combo. Instead of tons of anonymous units you have a few units of each of several different classes (berserker, knight, healer, ice mage...). Each has permanent (across battles) level ups and equipment, then in battle you 'boost' the units, which upgrades them for that battle. It works quite well, and all the mechanics actually make sense in the game world.			"

												Yes. 10/10 would buy again.This is a example of a good tower defense game coupled with an actual story. While one could argue that the graphics are low tier and would fit more as a flashgame it deserved its placed on the steam market. Why you ask? Everything fits in the big picture. There is not a single thing that seems out of place. It's a well thought out game no plot holes to fill only loot to get.I enjoyed playing it, revisited earlier locations to achieve my 100% on certain maps. I still didnt complete the whole game 100% because you can actually increase the game speed by a certain amount and sometimes on really busy maps the game crashes. Mostly near the end of the mission which makes it even more unforgiving.You will get your moneys worth of tower defense, the occasional chuckle during dialogues and the fullfilling feeling of the 100% hunt.

												This title is a quite interesting option for the Tower Defense genre. Besides having a simple and intuitive gameplay, it also has some nice graphics, a good soundtrack and also a decent story which helps with the game's immersion. Throughout the adventure you're gonna have the chance to upgrade your characters, which is something that I always thought that it was much better than just coming up with something new right away. As for the replay value, you may feel tempted to unlock some other achievements even after you're through with the main story, which is something nice, I guess. Just to finish, this is another option that offers the players trading cards, so if you're a fan of the genre, go ahead and give it a try.			"

												I believe this might be one of the best games on Steam. It's a very, very challenging tower defense type game with a really good story and fun customization that can be changed quite easily if you end up going down a path you don't like. You can name each character and customize their sprite when you get them, and i believe you can get like 12 of each of the 6 units but I'm not entirely sure because there's achievements for beating the game with only the base 6 characters that I started with right off of the bat.This game also has a pretty large amount of content and challenges for you to comeplete, and I highly doubt you'll 100% this game to be honest. That might not sound that great but I just find that amazing since it's ""only a tower defense"" type game.It's a pretty aged game so you can easily find guides and videos of the gameplay out there if you're actually interested in it, which I really, really recommend you become. I cannot give this game enough praise to be quite honest			"

What tower defence have you ever played with an awesome story, or with a story all together. Love the factthat you dont summon the same unit over and over. Each charater levels and progresses at his or he own rate, you can choose skills for that class when they level up and you can choose what the look like. all around my new favorate. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! :)			"

												This one is a soft recommendation for meDefender's Quest is an interesting twist on the tower defense paradigm. This time, your ""towers"", are RPG heroes you're summoning on the battle field. This makes for a much more interesting story, with many characters voicing their opinions on what you're doing (usually to complain about it :p). The story itself isn't revolutionary, but it's servicable.Unfortunately, by making the game an hybrid of TD and RPG, Defender's Quest brings with it the bad aspects of RPG. Mostly, the grind. There will be times where you're facing a level which you simply can't win because your characters/towers aren't levelled up enough. So you will have to grind by doing other stuff (like replaying levels on a harder difficulty) before coming back. It's even more notable and grindy when you're trying to keep your adventuring party small, like the games encourages you to do (by raising recruitement prices, but also having some achievements that only unlock if you never expand your roster).Another problem with the small roster is that in many levels, there are some optimal positions to place your 5 or 6 people, and then you're pretty much done, you fast forward to see your team hacking and slashing away for several minutes until the level is done. There are some levels where you will more active, with your main character having to use its spells, and you having to replace some of your team in better places. But on the whole, it's a rather static tower defense, since you have limited number of people, an enticement to bunch them together (for increased efficiency) and a limited mana pool to summon.All that bad stuff being said, Defender's Quest is still way better than most tower defense. The writing is good, the levels are interesting and you can always stop at any point. The main game is pretty easy to finish, while the main game plus will offer a bigger challenge, but also new items, additional missions and optional quests to keep it fresh, and reward you for staying with the game. So on the whole while i wouldn't classify Defender's Quest as one of my favorite games, it does get a soft recommendation from me.			"

												Let me premise by saying that I'm a fan of Tower Defense game and purchased this game at 90% off for a grand total of $1.49, as such, this game was an absolute steal!The game feels well paced, making sure you have the ability to beat the next level with adequate skill, but rewards you for taking the time to perfect a level. If you're looking for a deeper challenge, you can replay earlier levels at a higher difficulty, or if you're feeling stuck or underpowered you have the option to go back a few levels until you're prepared to advance.The actual game itself revolves around a band of characters replete with customizable appearances, skills, invetory, and a set base class that allows for a wide variety of playstyles and setups. The actual mechanics of the game are designed to allow you to either place your towers (units) down and work from there, or micromanage them for greater effect. As you progress you'll be unlocking spells to engage you further and allow for more in depth strategy.That all being said, I find myself falling most in love with the games charming and quirky characters that really sell the rather contrived story. Through the course of the game you'll meet a wide variety of personalites that play off of each other with a dry sense of humor and extremely comedic results. They each feel consistant and defined, and it's always a pleasure to see how they interact when they're not dealing with the plot. Even the main character has witty dialogue and interplay with the party, making you feel legitimately connected to people who are essentially stationary sources of damage in the actual game.The only point that could be held against it is the fact that the graphics and art style feel 'cheap'. The world map and actual gameplay is set in the old sprite style that we've all seen for the past few decades, and it makes the game feel dated. When you're watching the games cutscenes, you're stuck looking at a few stationary characters that look like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ combination of paper cutouts and Protector characters. It's nice that they took the time to set up full cutscenes and dialogue, but the graphics just aren't there.As it stands, I'd say that this game is a real gem. On sale for 90% I'd say 'buy it' every time no matter who you are. If you find it on sale for anything over 25%, at least give it a good look, hopefully you'll like what you see. For the full price of $15, it's still a great game for fans of the genre.This has been Necromanticer and 'Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten' is my favorite game in the Citadel			"

												Defender's Quest is a great fusion of Tower Defense and RPG. The approach to fusing those two (sub)genres is unique and done well. Primarily a tower defense game, I would recommend this to people who like that genre, definitley - and to people who apathetic toward tower defense games due to the RPG elements that make the game stand out from other tower defense games.However, if you just HATE tower defense games, then it's probably not for you. BUT you never know...there's always the possibility of ""the game"" that opens you up to a genre...To summarize, it's an awesome game. I started playing it way back when it was in alpha testing and watching the game progress from - a really good game then, to a polished great game. I give it 10 bags of popcorn ...and 2 kit-kat bars. </obscure reference>			"

The highest settings DAMN thats a real challenge for real i read they are making a second game i cant wait for it. new game+ here i come :D			"

												Seeing how the game was flash based and not too heavy on visual details, I was skeptical about this game. I usually compare tower defense and flash to something on Kongregate, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Its a Tower-Defense RPG hybrid where your 'towers' level up as you progress through the maps. Each stage has extra difficulties to come back to for additional challenge and rewards through unique armor or weapons that you can give to your teammates. You can change the AI for targeting, which comes in handy during challenge stages and boss fights. When you're done with the game, you can also replay the game with New Game+ and unlock your previous team (while facing minions with new abilities, and unlocking unique item powers). The story isn't anything new, but the characters are engaging enough to let that slide. The music isn't anything to write home about, but it strays from being too annoying like most flash looped music (the title screen being the exception).  If you like Tower Defense games, Defender's Quest is polished in the right places and worth the weight, especially on sale.			"

												Tower defense is not at all my jam, but Defender's Quest adds enough other stuff (and pulls of the defense part painlessly enough) that I've ended up really liking it. I'm only about halfway through, but, well, I was only expecting to dip my toes into it when I launched it today, and instead it ate up most of my evening.Essentially it's tower defense game with RPG mechanics and a story. Like, a proper story, that gives most RPGs a run for the their money.  That and the RPG mechanics give an attachment to your characters (who act as the ""towers""), and a sense of progression, that make this game so much more than most tower defense games. The game seems to reward focusing on a small but powerful party, and I just find ""making my friends way better at murder"" more rewarding than ""build a bunch of catapults."" Also, it's pretty funny.There are a few problems; the art for the cutscenes is pretty bad (although the pixel art in battle is pretty charming.) Some of the humor falls flat or, more often, breaks character. And adding the pointless subtitle didn't make the name any less generic. Still, it's overall a fun and addicting experience.			"

												Never expected this much from this game.As usual I logged on Steam and found this on sale with just 1.49 USD.Looking at the screenshots it seems like it has some RPG-maker graphics and it is a tower defense game.Man I am really not a fan of tower defense but after scrolling down the review section I see a lot of thumbs up; so I decided to give it a try.And it sucks.... ME IN!The game plays like traditional tower defense, with RPG elements like levelling up, buying armour and upgrading skills.This gives a feeling of progression since in more traditional tower defense game its all about strategy. Every battle is a new battle, nothing carries on to the next level.In this game, your heros are permanent allies. You recruit them from towns, form your own little army and grow them accordingly to your preference. Story wise its ok and the dialogues are funny at times. The presentation of the whole game is quite neat and easy on the eyes so you dont get alot of useless stuff displaying to you.There seems to be quite alot of levels as well as a new game plus where you get unique stuff and enemies which adds replayable value.The only downside is that it seems the skill tree could get some more diversity. Like it would be awesome if a standard warrior can have different styles or something.But all in all this is a solid game and is definitely worth grabbing during this 1.49 USD sale. The fun far exceeds the cost. But if you missed the sale and it goes back to 14.99, I would recommend you to think twice before buying.			"

												The first tower defense game I played was Desktop Tower Defense, a simple game that is on a grid and sends wave after wave of enemy at you.  This was a fun game mechanic and it would pop up with different themes in different games through the years. But, it was not until Defender’s Quest: Valley of the Forgotten that I found a game that used that mechanics to great effect in an Role Playing Game fashion.The opening of the game shows you as the main character being dragged out of her house and thrown into the Pit. She has the plague but also realizes she has special powers.  From here it opens the ability to play the game.  She can bring warriors into the Half-Way Realm and allow them to kill the revenants, monsters people turn into after they die of the plague. The story starts taking twists from there as you follow what has really been happening to two kingdoms and what the ultimate goal is.There are a host of characters that arrive in the game and each comes with their own personality.  The first people you find are barbarians, who wear no armor and are humorously suicidal in their combat tactics. Then you meet the rangers, who are far more practical about their need for survival. Each of the units you meet have a person who is going to be seen in cut scenes and helps give you a feel of the personality of that unit.Each of the units levels up, gains new skills, and can even be upgraded with new equipment.  Most of this is done in towns.  When in a town you can recruit units you have access to, but need to keep a close eye on the cost as the more units you have, the higher the price for the next one.  Gear comes in two main forms armor and weapons. There are also things that your main character can equip, but those mainly augment her abilities and are not purchasable.  When a character gains experience they level up just like you would expect in a normal RPG. Each unit has a skill tree with two branches. This means one barbarian might do a lot more damage and another might recover from wounds faster, it is up to you how you want them to work.This game was not  anywhere on my radar and that is sad because it is a great game.  The units seem well thought out so as to be different and fit a certain use at a certain time. The story told through still frames is well done with attention to facial expressions and a great sense of humor. This game is a great one, and the team at Level Up Labs is already working on another.			"

												Though I may not be one to play many tower defense games, this one has really grasped my attention. At first glance, it may look like a bit of a low graphic, and average drawn out sprites/characters, but that's not where the game is supposed to shine. Even the, the story is surprisingly detailed, and you learn to appreciate the characters. Where it shines most is the gameplay itself! A great game to have in windowed mode while doing other things, it's a pleasant distraction, very refreshing, and easy to learn. There is a ton of depth with characters having their own skill trees, each defensive unit becoming special in their own way. It has good areas to level up quickly if you want to power up, but it doesn't feel necessary. In fact, the game has a good pace, and you could pick it up and play just a few minutes, or a few hours! The ability to slow down, pause, or speed up combat is so pleasing to have also, allowing me to follow a flow I'm comfortable with, never too pressured, but always leaving you thinking. I highly recommend it for the price, and tower defense lover would enjoy this, and even those new or not keen on the genre will feel comfortable with it. I know I was!			"

												As far as tower defense games go, I normally play them a little bit and then grow board of them. That was not the case with Defender's Quest. I've found myself unknowingly playing for hours. As with all TD games, you raise your heroes, while managing your resources. After battle, you gain EXP which levels your heroes up and scrap (gold) to buy equipment to make them even stronger.You can easily choose to play with an army (up to 6 of each hero) or you can play with only the main hero from each class for an extra challenge. For those who dislike grinding for exp and gold, you will be pleased to know they have included an option to boost the exp and gold gain by 300%.I highly suggest this game if you enjoy TD games.			"

												Seriously greatness. It combines what is addictive about Tower Defense games, with my favorite parts of Class based Dungeons esque Party systems. I love skill trees from my MMO side, and there is a great amount of flexibility on the difficulty scale. Small learning curve. I've played it non-stop since I bought it, kind of game I can play for 3 hours, then jump back to whenever.TL;DR Buy the game, you won't regret it.			"

												Pretty fun game at a sweet deal of one fitty. Tactical tower defense game with some rpg aspects to it. Storyline is pretty good, some characters are pretty humorous and enjoyable. It does get hard, being an avid tower defense player back a few years, I thought this would be cake, but was I wrong. There a few challenging levels and a few buggy-glitch levels. If you see a hand in one of the levels, you can't kill it (I think). Aside from a few small bugs that you can beat by utterly destroying the level, this is a solid game. 9/10 would play again.			"

												Absolutely loved this game. It has a great blend of tower defense plus RPG that makes it unique and enjoyable. The dialogue is quite often hilarious and a touch ridiculous. You are able to choose your own ending, which I enjoyed, and once you finish the game a bonus version is unlocked, granting new enemies, weapons, and side missions which greatly extend the game play. Each level also offers the opportunity to increase the difficulty three times, with greater rewards each time you beat it. It's a great game for when you don't want something too heavy or involved but still a bit challenging.			"

												Defender's Quest is a great fusion of Tower Defense and RPG. The approach to fusing those two (sub)genres is unique and done well. Primarily a tower defense game, I would recommend this to people who like that genre, definitley - and to people who apathetic toward tower defense games due to the RPG elements that make the game stand out from other tower defense games.However, if you just HATE tower defense games, then it's probably not for you. BUT you never know...there's always the possibility of ""the game"" that opens you up to a genre...To summarize, it's an awesome game. I started playing it way back when it was in alpha testing and watching the game progress from - a really good game then, to a polished great game. I give it 10 bags of popcorn ...and 2 kit-kat bars. </obscure reference>			"

Each charater levels and progresses at his or he own rate, you can choose skills for that class when they level up and you can choose what the look like. all around my new favorate.

												There isn't much that hasn't already been said about this game, so I'm not going to write a super long review.DQ:VF is a very fun Tower Defense-RPG hybrid game.  I bought it with hesitation, very unsure of if I'd like it or not.  It's loads of fun, the story seems good so far, the characters are detailed with their own histories and little quips they say to each other, sometimes humorous.  The gameplay itself works like most TD games except you place heroes that act as your towers, and they can level up and learn new active/passive skills.  Outside of battle you can also equip them with different gear to give them better offense/defense.I got this game after they came out with the Deluxe edition (mainly upgraded visuals) and I'm glad I did.  I'm sort of a visual person, and I like what I'm playing to be pretty and polished.  I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the Standard version as much, but this free visual upgrade to Deluxe is awesome and well done.According to their website the devs have already started working on a DA:VF 2 and I'm pretty excited about it.  I'll definitely look into it as more info is released and most likely buy it.This is one of the best TD/RPG hybrids I've ever played.  The gameplay is light and fun, and you can tell they put a LOT of time into the story and characters.8-9/10 Would highly recommend.			"

The ones that make you say ""meh"" after less than 30 minutes of continuous playtime. And then - we all had this experience - there are few Tower Defenses that capture you for hours.

												I love the game. The only tiny bit of feedback I hope they use for the next game is to make it so that when you need to click through multiple boxes (such as in the first few missions when showing where all the ui elements are as well as having all the 'stranger' dialog) have all the close buttons in the same place.The thing that pushed me over the edge to giving a try for sure was the let's play on youtube - if anybody else is on the fence like I initialy was, give the first of those videos a look! :D (Developers Play: Defender's Quest)			"

												An excellent tower defense game that is traditional in all the ways I love but innovative where it counts. Instead of placing towers, you're placing party members. Like a traditional TD game, there are resource points you acquire within a round that you can spend on placing new towers (i.e. allies) or buffing the towers you've already placed. In Defender's Quest, this resource is called ""PSI"", which is essentially the ""mana"" of Azra (aka: you, the commander).  Howevever, Defender's Quest also gives you two other resources to spend BETWEEN rounds: gold and experience. Experience is used to unlock abilities on an ally's skill tree, thereby making them available to use in battle. (Each skill is assigned a power level and is not available in battle until you buff this ally to that level using PSI points.)Gold is used to hire new allies into the party or to purchase armor/weapon upgrades for individual allies, which immediately and permanently boosts their stats (i.e. unlike skill upgrades, these are conferred immediately at the start of battle---no PSI points required.)Every level can be replayed as many times as you want to farm XP and gold, and every level has multiple difficulty settings that earn you better gold/XP rewards for beating them. (There is no penalty for running away.) Beating the highest difficulty on some levels earns you a legendary weapon or armor, far more powerful than anything you'll find in shops.The only bad thing I could possibly say about the game is that the art in the cutscenes makes the game's aesthetic somewhat comparable to something you'd find on a flash portal. By flash portal standards, the artwork is amazing. By overall industry standards, the art seems a little amateur. The in-game art is pixely and SNES-tastic. I criticize only the cutscene art here. But in the end, it doesn't even really matter, because the cutscenes have no effect on gameplay, and you can even skip over them all if you like. The game itself is A+.If you like Tower Defense, it's one of the better TD games in the Steam catalogue.			"

												This game has some interesting features to set it apart from other tower defense games, however it is so badly balanced that I cannot recommend it. About an hour into the game the difficilty ramps up so much that you are forced to go back and play levels you've already finished and play them repeatedly to grind enough xp and money to upgrade enough to be able to finish the new levels. If this one thing was fixed it would be a definite ""recommend"" from me.			"

												An enjoyable tower defense game with RPG elements.  (Characters level up and have skill trees that carry over, although you can reassign points for a fee.) The need to ""gold star"" everything keeps this game replayable for quite a long time, and there's a challenge to complete the game in its hard mode without the many generic units you can hire, making the game extremely difficult at times. (In fact, functionally impossible at the hardest versions of some levels. Fortunately, you don't need 100% completion for those.) The game is also pausable, for those who find some tower defense games too frantic to enjoy.  There are some points where you really need to set the game to slow-mo and pump out the spells you get as their cooldowns time out just to cling to life for another wave, though.  It can, however, chug when you get to very high levels, and have INSANE numbers of effects going on at once.  I've also had it crash from a memory overflow from having too many sprites on the field in one of the ""endless"" maps where they just send infinite units your way.  Beyond that one flaw, (which you can avoid by just not trying to play the endless mode truly endlessly,) it's a great game.  I highly recommend.			"

												At first I was not 100% sure about buying or passing mostly owing to the simple art style and the fact its a tower defense which are a dime a dozen now days, however after looking at reviews and seeing some high praise and checking the forms and seeing active Dev's interacting with the community decided to give it a try.The first thing I met was a user agreement which is fairly common now days however unlike others I actually read it was very simple and easy to understand made a nice impression and told me about their attention to detail before even accessing the first screen of the game, this attention to detail was further proven once within the game the customization in just the options menu alone warrants this game being noticeable, I can't say if you will find it worth your money but if you have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket or see this on sale (well worth full price in my opinion) grab it.This game and its Developers are like a Unicorn in this day and age they clearly care about their players and the product itself Will be keeping a eye out for future releases from them.If you have any doubts look at a few of the stickied threads to see the developers love for the community and the game, and notice that to date there are 377 Positive reveiws and only two negative :P			"

												Are you looking for an old school RPG mixed with tower defence? ... No?... well you should because this game is awesome! Witty story mixed with fun combat, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten will be the cause of taking you away from socialising for many hours. From the start where you have only one berserker defender who is about as inappropriate as a fat guy in a speedo... to the ending where you have a multitude of dragons who for some reason look like they are grinning at me in some kind of sneaky/pedo like fashion .  You will be entertained by the dialogue and the awesomeness of slaughtering more enemies than you can shake a stick at. Pick it up for $1.45 on the steam sale and you will not be upset.			"

												First off, I do recommend this game when it drops to around 5 bucks at most. I picked this game up on sale. At 15 dollars, no, this game is not worth it at all.This is a simple tower defense game which only occupies a few screens across the entire game. Really isn't much to it. Feels like you are playing in a room or two.The game is woefully unbalanced. For 90% of the game you can breeze by with only using Archers playing each level on it's hardest difficulty. This also means beating the game and then playing in game in it's second quest, which is just a repea of the game but harder. Problem is, the game is mostly a cakewalk until the end of the second quest where you hit this wall. And that is where the main problem is....Grinding. FOr some odd reason this game has you grinding. This game takes Tower Defense and ads the worst element from an MMO - Grinding. Now, to beat the game I have to grind the same maps over and over and over, jsut to beat the final few levels.Overall, did you find this while it had a 5 dollar price tag like I did? Buy it. It's fun up until the grinding hits. Did you find this game as it's full, overblown 15 dollar price tag? Avoid it completely.			"

[UPDATE: Less-amateur art, less-trash performance... still just a clicker.]Enjoyable at first, in the end, only tedious. No real challenge... or even tower defense.Where most tower defense makes you think about how best to place towers and what to upgrade when, this game is completely stripped of thought. You learn the optimal locations for each ""tower"" type early on, and, as evidenced by ""hero mode"", the levels are almost all designed with a choke or two that takes full advantage of a single group's optimal patterns, so most levels play like this:1. Plug one, rarely two, ""tower"" groups into obvious optimal sockets locations OPTIONAL: Spam archers2. Upgrade (Mostly whenever, you'll have plenty of 'power'.)3. WINThe ""RPG"" side certainly gives math nerds something to obsess over, but it's similarly simplistic:1. Level up!2. Damage +1 OPTIONAL: Reset points at any time, because you somehow screwed that upThat's it. You want your healers to heal, of course, (skip Holy Light completely) and to take advantage of each ""tower's"" secondary effects, (armor break, chill, bleed, range, light/blind, devour) but for the most part, you'll just have to decide which usually low-end skill or two to neglect. Usually the lowest. You can safely ignore most defensive skills. (The actual numbers are utterly pointless because adequate info to calculate DPS and some secondary interactions aren't provided, and you learn how effective everything is by ""feel""/sight same as any TD game anyways... but don't tell the math nerds!)And that's the game for you. The art is bland, the story is absurd, but occaisionally amusing. Nothing to see here. While not a ""worst game ever"", if you're out for an actually good tower defense/game, look elsewhere. You might enjoy this if you're a math nerd, part of the Number Enlargement crowd, or just want something easy and amusing to click on and only plan to throw a few hours away with it anyways. Don't expect the game to get better as it goes on, it just doesn't. It never could, because it's fundamentally flawed.[FOR OLD VERSION:] Unfortunately, I have to add: system requirements are a trollishly bad joke. The game runs in Flash/AIR and suffers from the usual ""looks like an old DOS machine could run it/practically requires a super-computer"" issues. On a less powerful CPU, it may take twice as long to get the same amount done, and you will lose input control if you button-mash the one spell you'll want to button mash. But don't worry, you'll only notice it at critical moments, and only cause you to lose your ""perfect"" completion on a couple 45 minute boss battles... before you learn. Or your RSI flares up.			"

												Defender's Quest is a Tower-Defense/RPG Hybrid (Think Final Fantasy Tactics meets Tower Defense).Defender's Quest tightly focuses on three things: tactical depth, customization, and story. That means no random encounters, no spikey-haired emo kids, no forced time sinks, and no tedious, repetitive battles.The battle system builds off of tower defense, with individual characters taking the place of towers. Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy. The overall game structure is similar to ""tactical"" RPG's, but with a real-time battle system. Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.It also features an engaging, character-driven story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced, snappy, and always relevant to gameplay. Events and dialogue explain things as they become relevant to the player, minimizing exposition. Finally, it's got options and accessibility settings out the wazoo, so that you can have the best possible experience!			"

												The game has me hooked, but it has severe design flaws. The game plays in a small window. Being able to tell your units what type of enemy to target is nice, but the interface looks like a Windows 3.1 era spreadsheet program. It's too easy to spend money on the wrong upgrades and then not be sure if you're playing a level wrong or you just need to grind. (I got crushed on Karsk repeatedly until I figured out that I needed to go back to the last town and buy my main ranger a bow). The interface is so sloppy that you don't even get an error message when you try to spend a skill point on something you don't have the requirements for, it just makes the normal sound but does nothing. Each character you recruit is a different class, but you can recruit additional mute copies of the class who you level up separately which is... messy. Is there any other game where ""boosts"" don't have a time limit?The two Soulcaster games did the whole ""Tower Defence where your 'towers' are people"" with better art, music, and gameplay.			"

												7/10 DQ is a tower defense game. Don't gimme that look: this one's actually unique with its own personality. DQ mixes RPG into the blend as well with character trees, equipment, and classes. Your ""party members"" serve as your towers. The story is pretty good; a lot better than most games of this genre. The writing is awesome and there's a lot to do/see.  Combat is fun, but there's no depth to it. Once you get gear and the basics, you snowball from half way onward, plowing through everything near-effortlessly. The game also suffers bizarre frame drops. Seeing that this game's graphics are 16+ bit, it's inexcusable to have to compensate for input lag on such an undemanding game.  The price is also a bit high. If you can find it on sale, definately pick up DQ!			"

												Defender's Quest is a case study in covering your weaknesses and emphasizing your strengths. Shoddy writing? A beautiful ""skip"" button in every cutscene and dialogue can be turned off. Difficulty? If you hit a brick wall in story mode you can go back and do slightly harder versions of prior maps to level up. Tower diversity? Unique equipment means your second Berserker probably won't be as good as your first, so it's harder to spam one tower. The slog of New Game+ not going fast enough? Triple experience is an option in the menus. All this lets you focus on the core tower defense game, which is best played at 4X speed.Plenty of weaknesses can't be worked around, though. Workshop mods are few in number, and the first one I tried locked up the game in the first level. Character level is too huge a factor in whether you pass a level or not, meaning few maps feel appropriately scaled to your level at any given time. The game has a fixed resolution, even in fullscreen, and in fullscreen Steam notifications will leave artifacts on the screen. It's a little too easy to fall into a ""two of each"" mentality, setting up two identical sets of towers on the two major paths of most maps, with the only major variance between maps being what towers you level up first. The tower ""skill trees"" don't contribute much especially for those towers that only have variants of ""melee attack"" or ""shoot arrows"". For all the weaknesses I've pointed out, there are few high points in the game. The boss fights are excellent, requiring you to balance ""kill the boss faster"" against ""kill the creeps faster"". Otherwise it's the usual tower-defense game of setting up your towers and watching them slaughter thousands of zombies. The game demands enough of your attention in boosting your towers etcetera that it's not a good ""put something on in the background while you play"" game, but isn't demanding enough to be a thoughtful or engaging experience.All in all, it's hard to recommend Defender's Quest unless you're just dying for a tower defense game where you make a bunch of bars go up a la Progress Quest.

												Weak recommend. It's a flash game. A very basic tower defense game. Casual, spend a few hours at most. There's role playing elements, but it's not a central theme to the game. It's very GRINDy, where there's so many incentives to just repeat levels to level up instead of rethinking strategy. Maybe that's the crux. Tower defense games shouldn't have XP points. If the game costs more than $3, I wouldn't recommend.			"

												Looks, plays, and feels like a flash game. Nostalgia strikes again?Art, Character Design, Story, and UI is mediocre at best, gameplay boils down to having enough high level units to kill enemy hordes, placement doesn't matter, there's no real strategy.I didn't find any of the promised depth in the game, just grinding for meager level ups to clear higher difficulties.It'd be okay to pick up on a sale, but overall I'd recommend Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows to people looking for a good TD experience instead.

												AFTER installing the game I got to read the EULA in which Level Up Labs reserves itself the right to collect ANY data from you (personally identifiable or not), change the privacy policy at ANY time (they just have to announce it on 'their' website without even mentioning a specific URL). There are even some terms, that are illegal in my contry, therefore the EULA is VOID here (but probably not in the US). But that won't prevent Level Up Labs from scanning your computer for any data they might be interested in, if the choose to do so.I don't know if Level Up Labs has ill intent or are just way to inexperienced to write an EULA. But as of now this is their (more or less) legal binding EULA. Therefore I refused the EULA and didn't get to play the game.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME and only buy/install it, if you DON'T care about things like like this. "

												First of all, I can’t recommend this game.After the overwhelming reviews, I was really happy to finally see another good tower defense game. What did I get, a bland, mediocre and basic game…….What are my reasons for my harsh criticism??Here are Two:1. Characters and Story, are just badly written. For instance the Berserker: he likes shoes and fighting, that’s the whole character, no real backstory, no real emotions, no nothing.......Ok no character has a real backstory in this game or any real emotional turmoil.2. The game mechanics are so basic, you have 6!!! Different types of Towers…….Equipment is uninteresting because every item is just a stat boost in the same attributes, +1 Sword, +2 Sword, for example.The skill System is ok, but it doesn’t have a big impact in fights. Sure it changes your tactics a little but it’s not a big difference. Granted DD games aren’t known for their good writing and often mechanics in these games are basic. But to give a game like this overwhelmingly good Reviews ??????? WHY ?????Its ok, its decent, on a 1-10 I would give it 5 or 6. But for God damn 14 bucks I can’t recommend buying this game!!!!! (Maybe for 2.99). "

												Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is not a game for everyone and it is certainly not a game for me. There's a whole load of Tower Defense games out there in flash and they are free. Played several of them and they are certainly better than any games than this one. There are free games that are much better. If you had paid full price of 15$ and you felt ripped-off for buying this game then I don't blame you. When I started playing, I was not happy with the art or how it looks; just a matter of preference at this point. Just by looking at the price, the visuals and the gameplay, I would put this game to a place near Towns on my list of games to steer clear. Not to the point of Bad Rats though, because that one is so bad it is funny.Bought this in 2012 for 5$ and I felt cheated. That's why I should have seen the demo or screenshots back then. I certainly understand why this review would be disliked by many. I still regret buying this game and wish there is a way to remove it from my steam list along with Towns			"

As advertised, it's tower defense + rpg electric boogaloo--but I found myself enjoying it in a similar vein to tactical rpgs.  You follow the general progression of getting 'hero' characters of each class, but can then also fill out your ranks with others of their ilk as you go; completing challenges or higher difficulties of battles can often end up netting you new gear to kit out your characters with and overall I found that a lot of fun.

												As a puzzle game, I think its better than the likes of Puzzle Quest, because you're essentially managing a party of heroes, and placing them in dungeon sets and hoping that your customisations and placements pay off. It doesn't hinge on playing a very abstract match 3 game. Its a hybrid of an adventuring party management game, and a battle based puzzler. The fact that it sort of follows Tower Defense rules, in that you have waves of enemies, and they follow known paths, is all by the by. Goblin hordes usually follow dungeon tunnels anyway as they charge the brave adventurers!  I've played my fair share of Tower Defense games and hundreds of them bore me to tears, but this one seems to get the balance between RPG party management and planning, and the try it and then refine it mechanic. It's not overly complex, each class (and there are about six in total, I think) have skill trees that are only two branches. You need to earn money (loot and scrap) to purchase more adventurers to sign up. Then you have to train them up from level 1, and customise their skillsets to complement the team you already have.There are beserkers who lend the chopping/slashing muscle - for corner killzones - and your archers can thin out the horde on the way, as well as try and catch the speedy monsters early. You also have (so far) Ice mages, for slowing effects and mages for healing or area of effect spells. You can specialise zerkers as damage soakers or fast dps dealers. You can specialise archers as heavy critical hitter, or speedy bleeders. Plus you've got the inventory to manage with different armours and weapons etc. Some of the harder levels later on in the story, require a little bit of farming to get enough money and people to do them. It just hit a sweet spot for me, in terms of low maintenance RPG adventuring, with just enough tweaking, twiddling and puzzling to keep me going back to it over and over again. Repeating the same levels with harder foes doesn't seem to get old, you have to adjust your tactics for a longer harder game. All the while you're crafting up a team whose skills work intimately with each other, making the sum of the parts greater than the individual.			"

The game itself is inherently simple: place unit, beat back undead horde, dont get your face eaten off in the ensuing panic when one of your units dies and the mob overruns you.

I was pretty turned off by the art style from the get go, but the tower defense gameplay is solid (with options to make it more or less difficult with xp/gold bonuses that you can adjust) and the RPG elements are enough to allow customization across classes that are otherwise the same in most other TD games, but not a big enough focus to detract from the core TD gameplay. I've yet to beat it, but based off the forums/achievements, there's quite a bit of content to go around once you're done, too.			"

It's a very simple game but you know, I really enjoy simple and very fun games. The only thing that would have made it better would have been to have given voices to the characters. Aside from that, amazing game!			"

												It's like a... ""Tower Defense Final Fantasy""?Or at least, that's what I felt during the gameplay. Some good, nostalic, jrpg feeling.- Lovable, crazy characters. - A detailed fantasy world.- Nice fixel and cartoon-like artstyle. Since the upgraded version it's even more beutiful.- Levelig and earning new equipment is fun.- Some stages are challenging / sometimes hard. Well... the whole game is fun and addicting. I can only recommend it. Expecialy if you loved old Final Fantasy games.			"

												This game is AWESOME!  Not only is it an amazing Tower Defense game, but the story is hilarious as well.  Upon finishing the game, there is a Game+ mode that basically restarts the game, will all acheived abilities/skills/towers/etc... but with MUCH tougher monsters.The abililty to have several of the same tower, each with its own skill tree that you can customize, or standardize, is such a fun and flexible touch.This is another EASILY 10/10 game that I recommend.Have fun,~Polo			"

												I got this game as part of a humble bundle and immediatly saw that it is a tower defence game, which deterred me a little, however, as it is a small game to download, I figured I'd give it a try.Thus far I have enjoyed the game for a number of reasons;The first being that the characters all have interesting personalities.The next being that the cutscenes are humorous, with jokes that are reminiscent of Dragonfable, but still fresh.Finally, you have a fairly large number of strategic choices with how you set your units, and which ones you power up.I would recommend this game, especially if you are looking for a tower defence game which can be run on low-end computers, or if you simply enjoy the tower defence genre.

												This was and is a great tower defence game. It compares to Crystal Defenders, with the addition of leveling up charectars up. For thoes not farmiliar with Crystal Defenders, you have to defend set path befors the bad guys get to the goal. You defend it with units, Archers, warriors, magicians, etc, by placing them on route so that they attack the enemy as they make their way to the goal. You can power up each of the units every battle, upon victoy you will be awarded with experiance which will level up your charectars.Highly recomended, this unique style is unique and makes the game more enjoyable.

												I saw this game on sale for a really cheap price so I thought about buying it.  It didn't have a metascore I could see, so I started to read some reviews.  Every review for this game stated it was addictive and fun to play, and I couldn't find a negative review.  Well, I'm adding to the list of positive reviews - this game is great!   I love tower defense games, but this one is different than the others I've played before.  As you progress, you add people to your party that help you defend against the monsters that are attacking, and the characters you add are part of the story.  Also, your party levels up through combat and gain new skills.   I find myself playing this game too late at night, instead of going to bed, because I want to fight just one more battle.  I purchased this game on sale, but it is worth every bit of 14.99.			"

												Let's be honest: you will not be super impressed with the graphics and the game play is not going to astound you with its originality.Now that's out of the way I suggest you play it. Play it for its addictive tower defence game that allows you to select the challenge to suit your play stile and rewards you for trying higher difficulty. Play it for the light hearted dialogue and story engaging enough to keep dragging you to the next level. If you have played tower defence games then you are not going to be surprised by anything here but RPG elements add depth and an attachment to characters that make it a richer experience than some. I purchased this game with the intention of it being a casual gaming experience. The fact that I was playing it until 2am says that, for me at least this was an enjoyable and addictive experience and I am looking forward to seeing what the sequel will bring (probably more late nights).

The added story, humor, and rpg elements really added to the game.Some of the weapons/armor available as rewards seemed weak during the initial play-through of the game, but really mattered during the new game+ playthrough. Levels also mattered less, meaning just grinding out levels in new game+ didn't help for long. The game allows for a reasonable amount of challenge throughout the game, with a somewhat more steep increase at the end. In addition, you can choose the level of rewards as a percentage for winning and losing a level to make failing matter more or less and make grinding more or less necessary.			"

												Clever is the word for this game.  The gameplay is tight, well-balanced, and clever.  Tower defense games are rarely this clever and the RPG system rewards good play.  The downfall of virtually all RPG systems is a sense of grind - you want the best stuff, you're going to have to perform repetitive tasks until you've got the prerequisite numbers.  Grinding reminds me of a job.  Defender's Quest lets you bypass that - anything you'd have to grind for is optional, and if you want the optional content, then you can toggle the exp and gold gain.  This also lets you set the difficulty to as difficult or as easy as you want.The amazing thing is that the gameplay is so good, and the rest of the game is also so good.  The graphics aren't the modern blockbusters, but the character art is charming and clever, and the dialog is well-written and allows you to connect to the characters.  Fun gameplay, thoughtful gameplay, good art, good dialog, fun plot.  The game can even be replayed, and the new game+ has additional insight into the world if you're that hooked.  It also ramps up the difficulty if you like a challenge.  To top it off, the game is inexpensive.  Why have you not already bought it?			"

												Second or Third most enjoyable Tower Defense game I've ever played.  And probably the deepest and most clever.  It actually does successfully combine a RPG with a TD game.  There is a story with some twists that temporarily affect your characters.  You do care about their skill advancement, and with several classes to choose from, you do balance out their skills, and equipment.It inspires you to go back and try to beat older levels, but do better to earn better rewards.  You'll focus on specific classes for specific maps, trying different strategies.  And even has a very large range of creatures stomping across the various landscapes.I got it during a big special, but recommend it full price for anyone who enjoys Tower Defense games, and doesn't just want to finish, but also perfect their strategy!

												Defender's Quest combines the classic tower defense formula with RPG elements in a way that feels both classic and fresh at the same time. Because it works within the established TD formula, it's familiar and accessible. Because it replaces towers with hired heroes who level up, learn new active and passive skills, and equip new gear, it's offbeat and original. The art is both childlike and gritty. The story, the game's weakest point, is still functional and effective, and the simple characters are fun and relatable. It's a little short, but there's replay value both in beating older missions on higher difficulties and in starting a new adventure with new hero builds. Overall, a charming and unique hybrid of the Tower Defense and RPG genres.			"

												Simple, inexpensive indie TD with a nice twist. Each ""tower"" is a character and levels, equips and spends skill points independently. The campaign has a nice length to it. I'm not finished, but I'm over 20 battles. Each battle also has multiple difficulties that give greater rewards, including unlocking bonus missions.The native resolution is tiny, probably 800x600 if not 640x480 and there is no way to increase it in windowed mode that I can see. Also the generic characters you make have the potential to be clones of your main heroes, each class' talent tree provides customization but (at least at low levels) leaves little advantage to stray. It would be nice if each character could learn different active skills from their brethren that share a class.There is a sequel in the works and I look forward to it. It would appear they are addressing my main issues and thensome.Bottom line, I'm enjoying this title and while I'm a sale hound, if I had paid full-price I wouldn't have been disappointed. If you are not a huge TD fan, this may leave little to desire.			"

I played it trough once (~23 hours, but I went for the maximum star level achivements).My biggest problem was, that it freezed 4 times in total. My video settings are full screen and widened, and sometimes at the biggest battles close to victory the screen jumped back into windowed mode and it froze. I had to play those battles again..			"

The gameplay is where this game shines, and deciding where to place your hero's (towers really) is all part of the fun.  You get to level up your hero's, as well as your main character to add a litte more damage or utility depending.  It's pretty fun, would wait for it to go on sale though.  If you like Tower Defense games and old school graphics by all means, get this.			"

												I'm a bit unfamilar with the ""Tower of Defense"" genre as a whole, so I picked this up on a whim for $2.49. Turns out that was a pretty damn sweet deal. Defender's Quest isn't overly complex, innovative, super-artistic or genre-defining. What it is, though, is easy to get into, sort of addicitve, and a lot of fun.Honestly, the core mechanics are pretty simple - you have six character classes, each with slight customizability (basically skill trees and pallete swapping consist of the variations in-class), and each serve their own purpose. The challenges definitely lend themselves to exploiting this variation - you WILL not beat this game using just your archers, for example. The key strategical elements will be where along the paths you place your characters, how you choose to boost them during battle, and how to time the protagonist's abilities (a feature which helps engage a player and prevents one from just sitting back and watching the level unfold). Add in a mild RPG-twist with how you choose to level up skill sets, and you have a very simple concept turned into something that has multiple layers of combat. Good move on their part.The story, while simple, is sufficient enough to make you want to keep going. Characters are all pretty eccentric for the most part, and the humor is just average. I'm okay with that, though, as when I bought a game that looked like it could be run on a flash-based website, I really expected a cliche-ridden excuse plot with bland characters. Kudos to the creators on that front.The real downside of the game comes in the form of some rather noticeable forced level-grinding. The advanced and extreme challenges often change the way you play a level, but the general root of how you play it is still going to be there. Most average players (see: me) will have to repeat a level one or two times before confidently progressing on to the next challenge. This is extremely obvious in the otherwise-enteretaining new game+ as the enemy traits mean you have to work waaaay harder to beat the level.Other than that though, this is a straight-forward game with a lot upside. I certainly wouldn't be disappointed if I'd dropped the regular price on it. Try it out.			"

												I like Tower Defense games, and I found this to be an enjoyable entry in the genre. There's a lot of management options throughout each battle: the ability to cast spells, to recall and replace units for better effect, and upgrade units on the fly. There are time acceleration/deceleration options to reduce the grind if you've got an efficient unit setup and just want to get the battle done, or for if things get intense and you need to suddenly micromange your setup. You can also modify the experience bonuses/penalties for the game so that, if you don't have a lot of time to play, you can compress the game progression to reduce the grind even further. Frankly, it's an elegant and user-friendly setup for even the most casual of gamer.The RPG element to this one is a nice twist, and there is a decent amount of replayability via the New Game+ mode. But if there is anything which truly makes this game shine, it's the writing. This game has made me laugh until my lungs protested, and has resulted in my replaying the game multiple times just for the dialogue.  I highly recommend it even at full price. And if you see it on special, grab it immediately.			"

												Quirky, funny (REALLY funny at times), unique, fantastically well-written, challenging and surprisingly deep, this is the kind of game that only comes from the experiments of a truly creative mind. Combining tower defence with strategy RPG works fantastically well and the plot is truly excellent (Slak is one of the most hilarious characters I've seen in YEARS). About the only flaw I can think of is the handful of balance issues (Rangers are stupid overpowered on the first playthrough, although far better balanced on replay mode) and they aren't nearly enough to affect your enjoyment. Loved it, recommend it, waiting for the sequel with anticipation.			"

												I got the game at offer and I am totally satisfied.The towers are actually fighters which you recuit and level up between fights.I played just 3 hours and I cannot say more yet but these 3 hours were fun :)...17 hours nowDialogs between characters are very funny :)I am trying to optimize my progress in such a way that I use as few ""towers"" as possible....23 hoursI played a map on higer difficulty to get an item and after I aquired the reward, instead of pressing equip button, I pressed continue. The item was not placed into the inventory. Just dissapeared. Luckily it was not an important item. This glitch could be very anoying....Finished the game. I guess the issue above might have been a missunderstanding from my side. The game filters the items - it shows only the ones the currently selected fighter can equip.			"

												Played demo version long time ago I knew that I would fall in love with full version of Defender's Quest. Why is it so good? It have great replayability, which is in my opinion the most important thing in TD games. You can start to play on casuals and reach your way to the hardest settings. Even with few units you need to think how use them, how upgrade them, which one should get better stuff first etc. Maps and monsters are interesting. Same goes for story. While music and graphics are not so flashy, it fits really great for a game from Tower Defense genre. It inspire player to beat levels on hardest settings not only for achievements but also for stuff you can get from doing it. Also, there is one level with really annoying cute monster and it will demand from you a little knowledge on each unit skills and to come with a good strategy to beat it. There are also endless challenges so you can do your best over and over, beating your (and maybe your friends) wave scores. I'm glad I finally decided to play it. There are plenty of Tower Defense games on Steam but this one is greatly fun from start to the end. I will probably play it once again, when HD upgrade will be avaible. Also I won't hesitate to get second game shortly after release, since I enjoyed this one so much I have a really high expectation from next one.			"

												At its core, Defender's Quest is a tower defense game in which your towers aren't just expendable resources that don't change from level to level.  In Defender's Quest, your towers are customizable heroes, with skill trees and a wide variety of abilities.  The story, art style, and music are all rather presentable, and even charming at times, and the core mechanic of leveling up your troops and acquiring new gear has tremendous Pavlovian allure.  It's a fairly expensive game for its relative simplicity, but it nonetheless hugely entertaining.  At full price or on sale, I can't help but recommend Defender's Quest.			"

												Tower Defense games are pretty hard to get right - they have to be unique from their predecessors, have a sense of progression, and be mechanically sound throughout, lest they become a boring slog.  I'm pleased to report that Defender's Quest gets it all right.  The characterization of each ""tower"" lends a lot of investment into the game itself, the RPG elements are fun and interesting without breaking the game in half, and the starred progression system meant that I was always seeking - and finding - a new challenge that was scaled to my level.  It's a good story too - simple and filled with pithy dialogue.  The best TD I have played - ate days upon days of my time and, oh god, there's a new game plus mode. Halp.			"

												This game is an excellent blend of light RPG story, character development and Tower Defense gameplay. You take on the role of Azra, who finds herself gifted with a mysterious power to summon beings into a ""halfway"" world where nothing is truly alive or dead. Tasked with escaping a desolate dungeon called ""The Pit"", Azra meets a variety of companions (heroes of different classes) along the way and unravels the mysteries and secrets surrounding the plague that has swept across the land. Upgrade your heroes with class-based skill trees, equipment and boost them up with Azra's magic! This one is definitely a gem, although could use a bit more polish in the graphics department. I enjoyed it thoroughly and advise buying it on sale or with a coupon.			"

												This is primarily a tower defense game. RPG elements are in there, but it's not an RPG.I liked it enough. The gameplay works. There are only 6 types of towers but the RPG stuff balances out that sort of thing. As a tower defense, it's fine.The story is ""written by an english major"" but that doesn't mean it's good. It's not bad, but it's just so vanilla in a sense and the overall plot feels lacking. The trailer made me think the story was going one way and it ended up just being stereotypical fantasy rpg setting and sometimes tries too hard. Also each plot point HAS to make way for a battle for obvious reasons so that has to get jammed in there. Overall, fun, but I'm not bothering with new game+.			"

												I don't like tower defense games, but this one is pretty neat. Why? Because it incorporates many RPG elements I do like. Take all the normal tower defense aspects and make them level up with skill selections and you have Defender's Quest. The story is vaguely interesting and the art style minimalistic, but nice/different. However, I only recommend the game for those who like tower defense games, as the game resorts to repeating content with higher difficulties as far as extending your skills and leveling your party rather than something random or a large amount of content. There are also several secrets abound and some great humor in the dialogue if you care to read it!			"

												For such a seemingly simple game it has a respectable level of depth. The story is engaging, amusing and adds enough interest to keep you pushing on a little more. The standard levels are of good length and for fans of a tower defense style genre, Defender's Quest will more than satisfy. The pace is fantastic the whole way through with level and gear development coming just as you need. Easy to digest and quick to learn and if you REALLY want to master it, there's room to do that too. A hearty thumbs up from me.			"

While the first few challenges are fairly easy, the difficulty increases at a good pace. There is no significant penalty for failing or restarting a mission, so the game does not punish you while you are learning. This is a very well-executed game and quite enjoyable.			"

												Wow. I did not expect to like this game as much as I did. To me, the game had an original concept, a better than decent story, and a fantastic sountrack. Despite the core of the game being a tower defense, the levels did not really ever feel repetitive, and could be replayed on higher difficulties (which required different strategies) for unique character equipment. EXP and money earned can be adjusted in the settings to make the game as grind-ey or not as you like. The characters were a little two dimensional, but I still connected with them and enjoyed the slightly-simple sense of humor. This is definitely a game I would recommend buying on a steam sale and then spending a day playing.			"

												Truly the most fun I ever had with a Tower Defence game.Honestly my first thought when I saw this game was the same as with all the other Indie TDs that have come out: a game that can be fun for a short while but nothing more.. I'm glad to have been proven wrong.The RPG mechanics like the continuous progression / levelling of your party / ""towers"" and managing equipment makes for a really interesting and enjoyable game with quite some depth to it. Everything else such as the little bits of humor and customization  is just music to my ears. ..and on that note, the soundtrack is captivating <3 It's a game you really need to play yourself to understand it's greatness.Definitely a recommendation for both fans and newcomers to the Genre..!

												Another great game on Steam for virtually nothing.  Good amount of planning has to go into your defense, and plenty of customization for your troops.  The simplistic graphics get the job done, and the story is well written thus far.  Great for a fantasy gamer on a budget. "

												This excellent tower defense RPG hybrid is a great way to pass some time. The overall setting of the story is very original casting the main character in a role of being afflicted by a mysterious plague. The combat system evolves over the course of the story introducing new strategies for dispactching enemies and bosses alike. The colorful dialouge keeps the story somewhat fresh, but the real meat to this game is in the combat and preperation. Each town will have new items or characters to recruit, making the necassary arrangements before a battle are extremely neccasary for your success. The way everyone in your party level-up and the skill trees associated with there classes adds alot of depth to the character progression. Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a great merging of genres and a complete gem to add to your game collection.			"

												I usually don't like the TD genre, and find myself quickly bored by it, but this game made me dive into it and I found myself unable to stop playing it, so I can clearly say this is one of the nicest TD games I played.Most of it comes probably to solid RPG elements. When playing it, I experience that standard warm felling of joy and encuragement for every solved level, every piece of equipment or loot won, every level upped. The story is (so far) intriguing and the writing is simple and witty. Drawn cutscenet at first second look poorly produced, but quickly you start appreciating the web-comic art and clear drawings quickly start to engage you into the story and succeed in that sometimes even better than overpriced in-engine CGI cutscenes of the AAA producted games.So yeah, I recommend it. Go try it. Won't be dissapointed.			"

												Nice surprise ..This game doesn't wow with graphics or story .. but it more than makes up with tactics and strategy. I love how I can jump in and play a level or 2 in 5-10 mins. Each one like a puzzle or mini game, needing a different tactic or approach.If you ever played Advanced Wars on the old gameboy, this feels a lot like that (only with RPG characters instead)It's tower defense + strategy and tactics + rpg all in one game = WINNER!I have loved playing this game, and even going back levels to redo them (to see if I can improve my tactics)Have fun playing this one			"

												I always had a certain fondness for tower defense. In StarCraft, I'd spend more time stacking cannons than playing the ladder, and Team Fortress 2's MvM mode reveals a certain primal fun of killing tons of heartless, unfeeling dudes. To that end, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten presents a well-rounded, core dude-killing experience, but the cracks in the polish are evident.You're given six classes to play, all fairly standard for the genre: heavy damage, light damage, healer, ranged, status effects, and tank. Upgrade trees for each class are fleshed out for the game's length, and most powers are distinct from the moment you first receive them. Leveling up your characters before and during battle using ""Psi"" adds a certain urgency to the fight, and doesn't feel forced.But between battles there exists some friction between the player and the imperfect interface. Between the fast-forward of battle and the clunky number-comparison engine to power up your party, you'll be wishing for a patch to streamline or automate the process. You could do worse but you could do better; not even trendy not-loading-but-loading-messages like 'reticulating splines' or 'powering up the thermal core' are to be seen. You might hope to find some solace in the story, but it's just as hacked-on as the interface and I couldn't be bothered to follow it.My first playthrough entailed of spamming rangers (long-range) with the range upgrade and blew through the game without breaking a sweat, but in Hero Mode, where you limit yourself to one of each class, is where the game's difficulty felt most appropriate. Oftentimes you'll have three or four spawn points to deal with, and you'll need to consider the most optimal placement to cover all your bases, evoking the puzzle modes of yore.All in all I'm giving this a weak recommendation. The game itself is pretty solid - gameplay is mostly balanced, and it can be as hard as you want it to be. The lore isn't engaging and you won't miss much from skipping it; on the other hand, if you're the type for a story maybe tower defense wasn't going to be your cup of tea anyway. If it goes on sale again for 90% off you'll get a fun one-off to pick up and play, not unlike something you'd find on a phone or tablet. Otherwise, you may feel you aren't getting enough bang for your buck.			"

												TL:DR : This game understands you. (8.75/10)The graphics aren't the best, but they're as good as they need to be; the soundtrack and effects are pleasant but not particularly obtrusive or overwhelming. The plot itself is as interesting as it needs to be, with dialogue amusing enough to read- but all of it can be readily skipped past or ignored as one pleases. In terms of gameplay, this is a solid tower defense/tactical RPG. LUL manages to skillfully blend the two, producing a well thought out, fairly original tower defense where one identifies with, develops, and equips one's 'towers' much as one would one's characters in games like FF Tactics or Bahamut's Lagoon. What is particularly striking about this game however, is not the gameplay itself- it's present in the gameplay, to be sure; but what really marks this game as interesting is the attention to detail the studio has given to ALL of the aspects. The graphics aren't the best, but they're every bit as good as they need to be. The plot and dialoge are easily skipped because this is a casual game, where you are not expected to care in the slightest, and yet they are still amusing and substantial enough for if you do happen to care for some reason. If you need solid proof that LUL clearly understands you, the gamer, just look at the attention they pay to the control scheme. You can play this game without a mouse. Easily. The mouse can help now and then, but these people have dialed in the control system of their game to such an extent that a skilled player could possibly even do better without a mouse than with one, and all the keys are fully mappable, in case their super-intuitive control scheme isn't super-intuitive enough. To be fair, I've noticed a glitch or two, but they always seem to get corrected fast enough that you would miss them if you blinked at the right moment.Overall, always good to see this level of attention being given at all levels of development. 8.75/10			"

												Defender's Quest (DQ) is a tower defense meets RPG hybrid. You go around with your ragtag bunch of misfit heroes, trying to save your skin and possibly the world. As you make your way, battle after battle, through hordes of zombies... I mean, Revenants, everyone's skills improve, making them harder, better, faster, stronger at slicing-and-dicing more undead meat.Is that all? No. DQ has a delicious old-school feel, partly thanks to the pixellated sprites, partly because of the great soundtrack which will make you think of the glorious days of SNES JRPGs. It also has some notably well-written dialogue, snappy and fun (though let's face it, the art in those scenes leaves something to be desired...). DQ also has lots of challenges for you. Playing levels at regular difficulty is getting too easy? No problem, you can replay them at Advanced or Extreme to get bonuses and goodies. Finished the game? No problem, there's a New Game+ with more difficulties awaiting for you. The learning curve is extremely well-balanced and I especially enjoyed being able to complete the main story without ever getting really stuck but with a very real sense of increased hardship towards the end (the last two-three battles, especially, I barely managed to power through).It's definitely a very good game, especially if you like tower defense. Get it.EDIT: the developers released a ""DX"" patch for this game adding new content, remaking the engine with HaxeFlixel and redrawing the art to be better - thus the only complaint I could ever muster about this game has now gone. This is nothing short of a masterpiece, and quite possibly the best tower defense game you'll find on Steam. Search no more.			"

												Got this game ages ago, liked it then, just finished playing it again when the fancy graphics came out, and it's even better now. The units and progression are pretty balanced (though I'd recommend playing with the XP and scrap at 300% or it gets grindy). Every unit is unique even within a type which adds an interesting bit of strategy. For instance I always give my best equipment to the story characters and boost them first in battles, so those characters have points in the high boost skills but my secondary fighters and archers have their points only in the low boost skills. There's a decent story with some funny dialog. Core story takes 10 to 15 hours to get through (with xp turned up), and there's quite a bit of replayability with the higher difficulties. I'm about to go start the new game+ myself. Oh, and there's a demo, so I'm not sure why you're reading reviews.			"

												I want to state this as plainly as possible first: I hate pixel-art games.  I find them to be a lazy way to do art and a cheap grab for indie devs.With that said, this game is great, and it taught me that pixel-art is okay if the game mechanics make up for it, which this one does extremely well.The blend of RPG and TD is done extremely well.  The story is mediocre, but it does help the progression of the game along.There are enough RPG mechanics in this game and uniqueness among the ""towers"" and enemies that you will enjoy going back and doing the levels over again at higher difficulties for the loot and to level your party.If you like tower defense and you like RPGs somewhat reminiscent of classic Final Fantasy, pick this up and enjoy.

												A really nice and fun tower defense for once. It does get a bit repetetive after a while, and to beat every single achievement, but just a single playthrough might well justify the low price of it.A fun and lovely written story allows it to shine among other tower defense games out there, and I for one does not have anything to complain about the graphics. Design is good as well, and I never felt like any of my ""towers"" didn't have their place on a given level. In that sense I feel the game design is well thought through, and with of the difficulty depending on your skills and sense of strategy rather than random luck.The one thing that makes it an 8 or 9 out 10, rather than 10/10, would be affermentioned repetiveness. If you do decide to go for all achievements and clearing all of the levels, then prepare for quite some grinding of maps you've already cleared many times before. As such the replayability isn't all that great either, unless you simply wish to experience the same brilliant story once more.			"

												This is actually a pretty solid game - the troop variety could have been wider, and some of them just never are as good as the others, ultimately (archers are astounding, and dragons are cool but, ultimately, overpriced for what they offer. :( )It's really a tower defense in spirit, but has some neat little RPG elements, with some progression of your wizard/caster person, as well as your troops, who each have a little skill tree and stuff. For the price, and supporting a small studio, well worth it.Graphics are decent - the art is so so at best, the pixel work is much more pleasant than the ""cutscenes"", which no offense intended, are tacky at best. The story is decent, but is sorta held back by some kinda ridiculous one-liner attempts at humor and non-sequitor silliness, but all that said, I would say I enjoyed the game all in all.			"

												10/10I did not knew that DQ will become one of my favorite games of all time. I spotted a game on sale on Steam. Checked the screens, description, some players opinions. Mix of Tower Defense and RPG? That sounded interesting. It turned out that it was a game I was waiting for.Graphics are really good. They're tidy, have charm. Well, ok cut-scenes could look better, but they're not bad. Still visuals are not important here.What is important is gameplay. What can I say, it's brilliant. You're placing heroes, of few classes, on battle field, changing tactic with each new level. Characters varies, have nice skills, synergize well. With each battle they gain experience points which leads to new levels and skill points, making your heroes stronger. It adds a little grind to classic Tower Defense game. You can revisit once done levels, increasing it's difficulty to gain bonuses. And then, after the game is over, there is new game plus, making things even more complicated.You will have Dragon in your team and you will kill sheeps!Story starts suddenly, with our protagonist Azra, just like us, surprised with events that occurs. With time we will learn about plague and revenants, will find out who is the villain. It's nothing ground-breaking but is good excuse to continue the adventure. There is even a moral decision!The key part is the dialogues. They're simply amazing. Heroes are crazy so we ends up with many fun jokes, that will leave you with minutes of laugh. There are few misses, still author's sense of humor turns out to be very good. Good stuff.Defender's Quest is great game. Fantastic example of how well Tower Defense can work with RPG. This game gave me plenty of great time, it offers lots of content, making it one of my better purchases. I recommend it to everyone. You won't be dissapointed.			"

If you're second-guessing this game because ""it looks bad"" or ""it looks like a waste of time and money"", believe me when I say that those are all lies. A compelling, fantasy-like, and whimsical atmosphere, powerful and quirky characters, enemies that give you challenges, and even a second game inside of the game are only a fraction of the reasons why I love this game.Are you bored of your currently-owned games?

This game has great replay value and had me striving for perfection even on the new game+ mode (which has additional levels and upgradable items). Buy confidently knowing that there is a solid amount of content, a simple but engaging storyline, and some of the best 2D tower defence mechanics you'll ever see. I look forward to the sequel/second incarnation currently in production.			"

The art, music, and gameplay are all very good. The story is passable but the characters and the dialogue itself is great and often funny. There was a lot of thought that went into the gameplay. Even though you only get 6 units they are all very specialized and have their own use. Their introduction and upgrades come at an appropriate pace. The difficulty scaling is near perfect.If you like tower defence games then this is a solid buy.			"

												Marrying two uniquely intricate genres of games, RPG and Tower Defense, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten displays a very well-balanced gameplay and an incredibly enticing combat system. Essentially placing stationary combatants that may be bestowed special abilities (your Towers) by investing numerical value of ""Psi"" into them, on a grid-like environment overlay, coming in a variety of different classes, unlocking new classes as you progress the main storyline. Each class a page out of a classic RPG history book, they each carry their own bevy of abilities based on the type (Berzerker, Archer, etc.) that will bolster your defenses either for the better or worse depending on placement and Psi investment. Characters may earn EXP by being used in battle, growing levels as the criteria becomes met and allowing the player to invest skill points into a basic (yet vital) skill tree.The overall feel of this game is very old-school, but executes sleekly by today's standards. The World Map (level select screen) features a beautiful score, quite reminiscent of early RPG soundtracks. Interestingly enough, the site for Defender's Quest 2 claims to have musical talent brought forth from none other than Nobuo Uematsu himself. One of the millions (billions?) of Final Fantasy players and avid enjoyers of their dynamic, emotionally-captivating soundtracks, this notion that an industry veteran so well known is working with an indie developer brings me hope for the future generations of gaming. Imagine the experience this renowned professional can impart upon this team, and how this team may in turn inspire Nobou Uematsu, thusly conceiving the music that highlights some of gaming's most touching and well-loved moments. Relationships like these in the game industry are vital for its continuation as the younger generations may offer fresh ideas while in turn being nurtured by the experience and wisdom of seasoned developers having been in the industry since its near-conception (decades, folks!). I sincerely hope that veteran talent continues to  reach out to budding indie developers like Level Up Labs who clearly have a passion for delivering a lasting entertainment experience that is indeed inspiring to all. I thoroughly enjoy every moment I spend playing this game, and there is a very high probability that you will, too.*Reading Rainbow Transition*			"

												This game, is awesome. It's a very refreshing aproach to the classic visualized RPG genre. It combines the best aspects of ""Tower Defense"" games and what's usually considered rpg-elements (even though I disagree on the common definition of what these are). The game itself doesn't give you much freedom of movement in general, you just kind of advance to one point of the story to the next, but that didn't actually bother me, surprisingly. One of the nicest aspects of the game is the option of giving every single one of the characters your group gets a name of your choice. There's always some dialog, main char asking ""What's your name?"" and you get a prompt asking you for a name, which is then used throughout the rest of the game (and can be changed if desired).The game puts you in the shoes of ""The Librarian"" (her name will be asked for first) who has the unique ability to summon her allies (regular fighters, archers mages and the like) into a ""spirit realm"" where the undead, which make up the bulk of the enemies encountered in the game, can be actually made re-dead for good.Therefore she's the one who needs to be tower-defended. The army of defenders consists of six different classes of units which can become six of each type (additional characters can just be recruited in towns for ingame scrap). They all level up and have skill that can be improved by the player with each levelup.The dialogues and the general story is actually quite good and really really funny, all the characters are quite sympathetic and just lovely insane.Also, the game has a neat turn when it comes to playing it a second time (new game+) because the second playthrough mode actually adds several new sidequest, an upgrade option for the unique weapons found during the first playthrough and a simply hilarious journal, which recieves entries every now and then as the journey progresses... extremely funny =D.Even though the game seems to be a finished release, I gather there's still people working on it, so it might even get additional content updates.Definitely recommended.

Your towers are the various characters you recruit/hire. They gain xp, level up, need equipment, learn new skills, just like RPG characters. It's beautifully simple yet intrinsically addictive.

Levels never out-stayed their welcome while also providing a fair amount of replayability. Having the right setup and clearing your way through at 4x was satisfying.I've never been one to spend a lot of time on side-stuff after completing the main story though so I don't think I'll put any time into 100%'ing the game or new game+			"

												A competent and enjoyable, if somewhat limited, tower-defense gameMost of the challenge comes from the mixture of enemies in each wave and the limited ability to create the prototypical ""kill zones"". Enemy times have specific vulnerabilities, and some of the player's defense units are direct counters for these vulnerabilities. Usually, a mixture of units in each lane, with an emphasis on archers, will suffice for most challenges.It's not a super-difficult or revolutionary game by any means. Its production values are very limited, and that will bother some. But it has a lot of humor, a competent save-the-world storyline, and some interesting units (dragons, for instance, are hard to use well).I'd recommend this game for someone looking for a little dash of charm with their casual, traditional tower-defense experience.

												I am not a fan of ""twitch"" games, especially as I get older and my reflexes get even poorer.   Nevertheless, I found Defender's Quest to be, although rather small in scope, to be engaging and enjoyable.    Lots of interesting planning at each new level, some role-playing aspects, and graphics that are good enough for the purpose intended.   This is not the game of the decade or anything like it, but it will deliver some real fun, and was a nice change of pace for me.7.5/10;  much better than it looked at the outset. "

												This game, to be honest, is one that I have not played for a few months, but it's not because of anything to do with this game. It's because of OTHER new games that I'd like to try out.This game is an example of a game which looks bad, but is addictive and as fun as all hell and is worth playing. If you're second-guessing this game because ""it looks bad"" or ""it looks like a waste of time and money"", believe me when I say that those are all lies. A compelling, fantasy-like, and whimsical atmosphere, powerful and quirky characters, enemies that give you challenges, and even a second game inside of the game are only a fraction of the reasons why I love this game.Are you bored of your currently-owned games? This game is the fun little challenge that will keep you asking for more.			"

												This game is a really fun tower defense game, with a pseudo comic-strip narrative with serious consequences.

												A fun mashup of a Tower Defense and RPG. Your towers are the members of your party who you level up and equip with purchased items, or ones earned by completing levels and taking no damage. The plot is a little dry in my opinion, but still good enough to warrent paying attention to it. I'm just starting on the new game+ mode, which offers better weapons and side quests that aren't available in the first play through. It's fairly short but has some good replay value if you like to 100% things.			"

												A Tower Defense game with the serial numbers filed off, but filed off in such a way that it doesn't feel like a Tower Defense game. Your ""Towers"" are characters, and these characters are memorable and quirky, and interact with each other during cutscenes between maps. Each character has a persistent level and skill tree, giving the game as much of an RPG feel as it has a TD feel.The main quest will take you 5 hours tops if you're good at TD stuff, but there's a New Game+, challenge modes, gear to collect, characters to level, side quests... Not bad for the price.			"

												A simple to learn tower defense game with a great sense of humor, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten has an enjoyable campaign.  Each level can be played multiple times with different difficulty settings and greater rewards for completion.  Finishing the campaign lets you play again in a harder mode that adds a few extra cut scenes to the story.  Easy to jump into and play a quick level, but hard to put down after you get started.  Highly recommended.			"

Also has a place where you could enter in certain codes to get some upgrades, but to get the codes you needed to look at certain levels and how the enemies appeared. It was a very fun and interesting search which you can read somewhere on the forums. Overall though, very good game & if you can get it on sale it would be a sin not to buy it.			"

												Definately not another tower defense game, Defender's Quest is a hybrid RPG/Tower defense, where each character acts as a ""tower"" against all sorts of evil fantasy creatures. Characters level up and can have equipment, making them feel like an investment and creating a whole metagame about building up characters as you progress through levels. Also has a cheesy storyline...however thats not its main draw. The graphics are sorta too simply to the point where there there doesn't to have an unique artistic style, however it serves its purpose. Overall, highly recommended.			"

												Great lil game after you get it out of windowed mode.  I got it on sale or in a bundle or someting and tried it finally yesterday and wasted the whole afternoon on it.  I would say it could easily be beaten in 10 hours if you just wanted to finish it  If you want to go back and replay missions on a harder difficulty, you get additional rewards, (gear, etc) so its replayability is ok.  I don't expect to put more than 20 hours into this game but its been fun.  Its puzzle elements do suffer a lil from the ability to grind your power up and it doesn't take much grinding at all to be overpowered for a normal run.  The rapid progression/rpg elements were worth the sacrafice and with the harder difficulties avail and such means you'll be able to find some sort of challenge as long as your likely to be playing this game.

												I absolutely love Defender's Quest Valley of the Forgotten. When I read tower defence rpg I was a little lost. I have never heard of the two being combined and wondered how it could be done. The rpg side of this game is based around the story of Azra; Azra is a royal librarian who found herself in the forgotten zone - a plague ridden part of the kingdom and things went crazy. Along the way Azra met people to aid her in her journy to find out what is going on. People like Slak and khetti (names can be changed I kept them default though). the players met along your journy become your towers and placed in a standard tower defence way, slak for example is a berserker who slashes and slaughters light hp targets, and khetti is an archer. The characters are leveld up over time so the player can equip them with gear and put points into skills such as slaks flurry to hit 5 targets at once. Now back to Azra; since the game revolves around her what role does this librarian play. Well in combat you are summoned to the spirit world to kill the plague ridden posessed citizens. Azra levels up with your characters so she can cast damage spells, buffs, and heals to your people during combat. The heal is very advantagous because your people will die. . . HOWEVER they can be resummoned. To prevent deaths one of the options is to equip them with armor which can be purchased and unlocked at certain points in the game along with other mercenaries.overall I rate this game 5/5  due to the 5 dollar sale price during steam weekly sale and the unique story and combat. The game also supports the steam workshop so that you can continue the game with player made levels which I have not tried yet.For the cons of this game I have not found any but some players might be turned off by the non applicable voice acting, all of the narrating is texted out.

												I'm a bit unfamilar with the ""Tower of Defense"" genre as a whole, so I picked this up on a whim for $2.49. Turns out that was a pretty damn sweet deal. Defender's Quest isn't overly complex, innovative, super-artistic or genre-defining. What it is, though, is easy to get into, sort of addicitve, and a lot of fun.Honestly, the core mechanics are pretty simple - you have six character classes, each with slight customizability (basically skill trees and pallete swapping consist of the variations in-class), and each serve their own purpose. The challenges definitely lend themselves to exploiting this variation - you WILL not beat this game using just your archers, for example. The key strategical elements will be where along the paths you place your characters, how you choose to boost them during battle, and how to time the protagonist's abilities (a feature which helps engage a player and prevents one from just sitting back and watching the level unfold). Add in a mild RPG-twist with how you choose to level up skill sets, and you have a very simple concept turned into something that has multiple layers of combat. Good move on their part.The story, while simple, is sufficient enough to make you want to keep going. Characters are all pretty eccentric for the most part, and the humor is just average. I'm okay with that, though, as when I bought a game that looked like it could be run on a flash-based website, I really expected a cliche-ridden excuse plot with bland characters. Kudos to the creators on that front.The real downside of the game comes in the form of some rather noticeable forced level-grinding. The advanced and extreme challenges often change the way you play a level, but the general root of how you play it is still going to be there. Most average players (see: me) will have to repeat a level one or two times before confidently progressing on to the next challenge. This is extremely obvious in the otherwise-enteretaining new game+ as the enemy traits mean you have to work waaaay harder to beat the level.Other than that though, this is a straight-forward game with a lot upside. I certainly wouldn't be disappointed if I'd dropped the regular price on it. Try it out.			"

												I like Tower Defense games, and I found this to be an enjoyable entry in the genre. There's a lot of management options throughout each battle: the ability to cast spells, to recall and replace units for better effect, and upgrade units on the fly. There are time acceleration/deceleration options to reduce the grind if you've got an efficient unit setup and just want to get the battle done, or for if things get intense and you need to suddenly micromange your setup. You can also modify the experience bonuses/penalties for the game so that, if you don't have a lot of time to play, you can compress the game progression to reduce the grind even further. Frankly, it's an elegant and user-friendly setup for even the most casual of gamer.The RPG element to this one is a nice twist, and there is a decent amount of replayability via the New Game+ mode. But if there is anything which truly makes this game shine, it's the writing. This game has made me laugh until my lungs protested, and has resulted in my replaying the game multiple times just for the dialogue.  I highly recommend it even at full price. And if you see it on special, grab it immediately.			"

												This game, is awesome. It's a very refreshing aproach to the classic visualized RPG genre. It combines the best aspects of ""Tower Defense"" games and what's usually considered rpg-elements (even though I disagree on the common definition of what these are). The game itself doesn't give you much freedom of movement in general, you just kind of advance to one point of the story to the next, but that didn't actually bother me, surprisingly. One of the nicest aspects of the game is the option of giving every single one of the characters your group gets a name of your choice. There's always some dialog, main char asking ""What's your name?"" and you get a prompt asking you for a name, which is then used throughout the rest of the game (and can be changed if desired).The game puts you in the shoes of ""The Librarian"" (her name will be asked for first) who has the unique ability to summon her allies (regular fighters, archers mages and the like) into a ""spirit realm"" where the undead, which make up the bulk of the enemies encountered in the game, can be actually made re-dead for good.Therefore she's the one who needs to be tower-defended. The army of defenders consists of six different classes of units which can become six of each type (additional characters can just be recruited in towns for ingame scrap). They all level up and have skill that can be improved by the player with each levelup.The dialogues and the general story is actually quite good and really really funny, all the characters are quite sympathetic and just lovely insane.Also, the game has a neat turn when it comes to playing it a second time (new game+) because the second playthrough mode actually adds several new sidequest, an upgrade option for the unique weapons found during the first playthrough and a simply hilarious journal, which recieves entries every now and then as the journey progresses... extremely funny =D.Even though the game seems to be a finished release, I gather there's still people working on it, so it might even get additional content updates.Definitely recommended.

												This game is the most fun you can have for $15. It is quite funny without being annoying, challenging without feeling unfair, and is unquestionably innovative.  Game like this are pretty much the reason I avoid AAA titles. Hopefully the team adds more classes, enemies, and levels.  I'll gladly buy more DLC to support great games like this. If you like 90s-style RPG art, and like tower defense, don't hesitate, buy this gem.			"

												Holy ♥♥♥♥! I've only played a few minutes and I can easily say this is the BEST tower-defence game I've ever played. I love the fact that you can revisit the previous dungeons so you can loot some more scraps for that awesome bow in the town. When you play this game there is no pressure at all. You can take your time and progress through the world without the thought of dying all of a sudden just because it was too hard. Each dungeon has a difficulty level. The higher level the greater rewards. But then again you must level your characters up in order to succeed. You can level your characters up in the first dungeon ever but then it would just be too easy.This game is a simple masterpiece. May not look like it but damn when you play it... it's so fun and the replay value is really damn high.hands down 10/10 !!!			"

Has a lot of replay value and players of all skill levels can enjoy it due to the multiple difficulty settings. There's also settings to increase XP and gold for gamers who just don't have much time to play as well as accessibility options!

												Clever is the word for this game.  The gameplay is tight, well-balanced, and clever.  Tower defense games are rarely this clever and the RPG system rewards good play.  The downfall of virtually all RPG systems is a sense of grind - you want the best stuff, you're going to have to perform repetitive tasks until you've got the prerequisite numbers.  Grinding reminds me of a job.  Defender's Quest lets you bypass that - anything you'd have to grind for is optional, and if you want the optional content, then you can toggle the exp and gold gain.  This also lets you set the difficulty to as difficult or as easy as you want.The amazing thing is that the gameplay is so good, and the rest of the game is also so good.  The graphics aren't the modern blockbusters, but the character art is charming and clever, and the dialog is well-written and allows you to connect to the characters.  Fun gameplay, thoughtful gameplay, good art, good dialog, fun plot.  The game can even be replayed, and the new game+ has additional insight into the world if you're that hooked.  It also ramps up the difficulty if you like a challenge.  To top it off, the game is inexpensive.  Why have you not already bought it?			"

												One of the best tower defense games I've played so far.Rather than a typical tower defense game that you can find around steam, they insert a few interesting RPG element into the mix, and it works suprisingly well. Each tower is actually a character and each character has levels, skill trees and equipments. Each character helps progress in the main stroryline, and the storyline is pretty interesting and funny at times. Most importantly, the game runs great and destroying the waves of enemies with your smart strategic placement of towers/characters is satisfying. It has a lot of levels, multiple difficulties for each level, has bonus levels like endless mode, new game + and has Steam Workshop to add new stuff!If you're a fan of RPG and tower defense, this is definitely a game you cannot miss.8/10, great game.

												10/10I did not knew that DQ will become one of my favorite games of all time. I spotted a game on sale on Steam. Checked the screens, description, some players opinions. Mix of Tower Defense and RPG? That sounded interesting. It turned out that it was a game I was waiting for.Graphics are really good. They're tidy, have charm. Well, ok cut-scenes could look better, but they're not bad. Still visuals are not important here.What is important is gameplay. What can I say, it's brilliant. You're placing heroes, of few classes, on battle field, changing tactic with each new level. Characters varies, have nice skills, synergize well. With each battle they gain experience points which leads to new levels and skill points, making your heroes stronger. It adds a little grind to classic Tower Defense game. You can revisit once done levels, increasing it's difficulty to gain bonuses. And then, after the game is over, there is new game plus, making things even more complicated.You will have Dragon in your team and you will kill sheeps!Story starts suddenly, with our protagonist Azra, just like us, surprised with events that occurs. With time we will learn about plague and revenants, will find out who is the villain. It's nothing ground-breaking but is good excuse to continue the adventure. There is even a moral decision!The key part is the dialogues. They're simply amazing. Heroes are crazy so we ends up with many fun jokes, that will leave you with minutes of laugh. There are few misses, still author's sense of humor turns out to be very good. Good stuff.Defender's Quest is great game. Fantastic example of how well Tower Defense can work with RPG. This game gave me plenty of great time, it offers lots of content, making it one of my better purchases. I recommend it to everyone. You won't be dissapointed.			"

												Holy ♥♥♥♥! I've only played a few minutes and I can easily say this is the BEST tower-defence game I've ever played. I love the fact that you can revisit the previous dungeons so you can loot some more scraps for that awesome bow in the town. When you play this game there is no pressure at all. You can take your time and progress through the world without the thought of dying all of a sudden just because it was too hard. Each dungeon has a difficulty level. The higher level the greater rewards. But then again you must level your characters up in order to succeed. You can level your characters up in the first dungeon ever but then it would just be too easy.This game is a simple masterpiece. May not look like it but damn when you play it... it's so fun and the replay value is really damn high.hands down 10/10 !!!			"

Recruiting new members, leveling them up [with a skill tree per class], gearing them up and taking them into a hard stage is just win. There's a LOT of replayability here with it having a ""New Game+"" mode to it that adds even more features to it. Oh and did I mention is actually has a story? And cut scenes?

Each one like a puzzle or mini game, needing a different tactic or approach.If you ever played Advanced Wars on the old gameboy, this feels a lot like that (only with RPG characters instead)It's tower defense + strategy and tactics + rpg all in one game = WINNER!I have loved playing this game, and even going back levels to redo them (to see if I can improve my tactics)Have fun playing this one			"

												This game is an excellent blend of light RPG story, character development and Tower Defense gameplay. You take on the role of Azra, who finds herself gifted with a mysterious power to summon beings into a ""halfway"" world where nothing is truly alive or dead. Tasked with escaping a desolate dungeon called ""The Pit"", Azra meets a variety of companions (heroes of different classes) along the way and unravels the mysteries and secrets surrounding the plague that has swept across the land. Upgrade your heroes with class-based skill trees, equipment and boost them up with Azra's magic! This one is definitely a gem, although could use a bit more polish in the graphics department. I enjoyed it thoroughly and advise buying it on sale or with a coupon.			"

												This is primarily a tower defense game. RPG elements are in there, but it's not an RPG.I liked it enough. The gameplay works. There are only 6 types of towers but the RPG stuff balances out that sort of thing. As a tower defense, it's fine.The story is ""written by an english major"" but that doesn't mean it's good. It's not bad, but it's just so vanilla in a sense and the overall plot feels lacking. The trailer made me think the story was going one way and it ended up just being stereotypical fantasy rpg setting and sometimes tries too hard. Also each plot point HAS to make way for a battle for obvious reasons so that has to get jammed in there. Overall, fun, but I'm not bothering with new game+.			"

												I got this game as part of a humble bundle and immediatly saw that it is a tower defence game, which deterred me a little, however, as it is a small game to download, I figured I'd give it a try.Thus far I have enjoyed the game for a number of reasons;The first being that the characters all have interesting personalities.The next being that the cutscenes are humorous, with jokes that are reminiscent of Dragonfable, but still fresh.Finally, you have a fairly large number of strategic choices with how you set your units, and which ones you power up.I would recommend this game, especially if you are looking for a tower defence game which can be run on low-end computers, or if you simply enjoy the tower defence genre.

												Short: [9/10] Awesome and challenging Tower Defense x RPG mix with 30+ hours of gameplay. Only a few gripes make this game short of perfect.Long: ""Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten"" is a Tower Defense game in which you fight hordes of enemies by using different classes and spells. The classes (of which there are 6) all differ in playstyle and give the game its RPG elements via XP gains, talent trees and weapon/armor aquisition. Even though the game looks simple, it offers a very deep combat and leveling system which will have to be adjusted multiple times in order to beat certain levels. Examples include making your archers target fastest enemies first, putting the stun sword in the hands of your knight, or making sure your ice skills don't get cancelled by your burn ones.  The story itself is amusing as well and gave me a few chuckles along the way. New Game+, 3 star rating per level, and challenges such as endless mode only extend the life of this game and make you want to play more. There are however, a few issues. Some, like the ""Undo"" button, which removes ALL the points you just put into your character's skill tree instead of just the last one, should be renamed ""Restart"" because that's what it actually does. This gets very annoying when respeccing a character with 60 points in New Game+. However, the ""Undo"" button is not game breaking so it doesn't change my rating of the game. What does, however, is the terrible frame drop encountered during big fights. Even though I have a very powerful rig, it has caused the game to crash several times (once while on 95th wave of endless when attempting 100 wave achievement!). Another is the poor visual of the cursor, which when coupled with the fact the frame rates drop, makes it impossible to see. This has caused me to lose a few games or constantly pause to execute commands.But the few imperfections get dwarfed by the fact this is a great game, and had me coming back for that ""JUST ONE MORE ROUND"" feel. The devs are actually pretty cool/active as well and respond quite frequently in the forums. Don't miss this game, it is very much worth it!   [9/10]			"

												A tower-defense game with an RPG-like leveling system that adds an interesting twist to the genre. Story and characters are very basic but are likable and serve their purpose well enough. The biggest plus point for me, a person who cannot yet make the time to spend hours locked up in my room playing ""hard core"" RPGs, is how easy it is to get back into the game after not touching it for quite a long time. In addition to pandering to my perfectionist tendencies, I can ease myself back into the game by going back to earlier levels set on harder difficulties.Leveling up the characters can get cumbersome though once you start accumulating them, but it's a minor issue. Automating the process would remove the element of customization, which I like, but I wish there could be a way to bulk-assign level-up points, or of the sort.			"

												A game worth playing. Its quirky characters and dialgue bring a smile to your face inbetween slightly difficult battle scenes, your ultimate victory on each level will have you relieved and pumped. Although the story is not as gripping as some other RPGs, you will be willing to go through dialgue for the small silly gems. The game gives you a lot of leeway in the game, even playing advanced isn't always difficult but as soon as you go extreme, it is a whole diffirent ballgame. The game asks you to replay it, replay each level on extreme to gain more advantages for future levels. Over all a Great game and a great buy. I hope the sequel is as good.			"

I am not a thrift/indie shopper for games either, so this game catching my attention probably means its all that much more amazing.  usually I am just playing the mainstream sorta-hardcore online gamer type stuff.  10/10, 2 thumbs up,  YOU MUST TRY THIS GAME.  whether you are a casual gamer, or you are a hardcore gamer, I think this has mass appeal.

												This is a very simple, but fairly expansive Tower Defense (TD) game. you can gear out and upgrade your units how you want, and they all even have little tech trees for their abilities, though honestly I didn't really feel like the points I allocated did much to make any of the skills much better, but it's always fun to have that stuff I guess.The levels are different formations and the monsters spawn from different points at different times depending on the level and difficulty. You can't do any forced pathing or anything like in defense grid but you still want to place your units so that they are getting in as many hits as possible. You can also set units to specific targeting types, whether it's whatever enemy is closest to the end of the trail, the one with highest HP, lowest HP, etc...All in all this is a good little TD, I wouldn't recommend buying it unless it's on sale for like 5-8 bucks though.

It is simple to learn yet hard to master - a good and proven formula for a great game.There is nothing really bad about this game, except that it runs on Adobe AIR, and even with a decent machine it often gets sluggish when having lots of enemies and units on the screen (which is the regular case from mid-game onwards). Also, IMO 4x speed-up is mandatory, otherwise it is too slow. You basically only need pause and 4x. But that is just nitpicking.Bottom line: great game!			"

It's challanging enough to have you work at it but not so OH GEBUS where it stops being fun. Plenty of achievements that make you work for it and alot going on in the background with side plot. With New Game+ and ++ you will have more than enough hours of gameplay especially if your like me and attempt to do it all with only main characters....

												Defender's Quest Vallie of the Forgotten is my (new) favourite of this genre.Through an intricate story and and choice in game mechanics, it manages to combine Tower Defense with a human element, something I didn't even know I missed in the genre, and a distinct RPG feel.Besides the rich story (which is, you know, rare for these kind of games) this game has a very nice and original art style, clear game mechanics and overview, extensive and incredibly intuitive controls, and an awarding difficulty.It's weak points are probably the low resolution, which unfortunately doesn't upscale very well (as of writing),  but I've found this to be a minor point at best.With the original content, and a New Game+ mode, this game is definitely worth buying, especially for this price.

												So I won this game in a giveaway where I got to choose which game I wanted out of a list, major shout out to toph--Such a nice person! Honestly this was my third choice, and it appealed to me because im a sucker for pixel art in games like this, and the old final fantasies, and man did i fall in love with this game. It's rich in story content, a great tower defense game where you can grind for currency and leveling up, and complete stages at harder difficulties to gain bonus loot, has a great soundtrack, and i swear that they sampled a battle theme from Final Fantasy 8 i swear i hear it exactly in the background of each stage with minor changes to it, which I absolutely love, I love the music in this game, the fact that you can customize the classes that you recruit, their talent tree, the fact that you can give them gear and make them stronger. This is like no other tower defense game, its got personality, as do the characters, this is no crystal defenders clone, its got its own label, in fact i think its much more elaborate and more fun than crystal defenders which I am a big fan of. All the gear customization reminds me of Fantasy Defense on Android which I was a big fan of as well. This game is defintely a gem that people should look into buying. I am so stoked for Defender's Quest 2			"

												A well thought-out Tower Defense game with simple RPG mechanics, simple graphics, very enjoyable soundtrack, a negligible story and a great sense of humor. 8.5/10 would definitely play again			"

												I have been really impressed by this game. When i first started it i wasnt expecting it to be so fun. Retro graphics arent my thing, but the gameplay really is all that matters here. For a very small sum you get a fun game with quite a long playtime, what are you waiting for? Grab it asap!			"

												Surprisingly, this game was really addictive and entertaining.  I was looking to just kill a couple hours one night a year or two ago and I expected this to be really simplistic, but it turned out to be really interesting, strategic, well designed, enjoyable, .. yeah.  I am not a thrift/indie shopper for games either, so this game catching my attention probably means its all that much more amazing.  usually I am just playing the mainstream sorta-hardcore online gamer type stuff.  10/10, 2 thumbs up,  YOU MUST TRY THIS GAME.  whether you are a casual gamer, or you are a hardcore gamer, I think this has mass appeal.  Play it for an hour, and then watch that turn into 20-30 hours and be astonished that you got addicted to a tower defense game with graphics that could be from 2000.			"

												This is a retro tower defense game. It is small in file size, but big in play! I like that I can easily run it in the background while I do other things on the computer.The story progresses nicely. The characters are engaging, and I was never bored with the plot. You can complete the entire plot in a day even if you take your time. The graphics are in pixel style for the gameplay. The cut-scenes were artwork with text underneath. The art would move in response to the text moving, like reading an illustrated book. This game has nice replay value. Every site on the map has 3 levels, easy, normal, and advanced. To unlock everything, you must beat all three. There are a lot of achievements in this game, and some of them are quite difficult to get. A single level can be solved in many different ways. And, the whole game can be played in newgame+ mode, which makes beating it a second time a new challenge.Once I finished the plot, I found that I don't like to play for hours on end. The game is relaxing for me. I take my time with the higher level achievements. It's a fun, simple game and I recommend it.			"

I started playing it for a few minutes at a time, just as a casual game that I could put down easily and pick up again later without confusion. A week later and I was playing for hours at a time, and it became increasingly difficult to walk away from. If you like TD games with an interesting narrative, buy Defender's Quest right now.			"

												Very neat tower defense game. Interesting and frsh approach at the characters, especially the leveling system that lets you keep your and your towers' (characters) exps and gear, somewhat deepening the relationship with individual characters, which is not common for this kind of game. Pretty good experience with a surprising story, and probably worth the money, although I bought it when on sale (considering my little-to-no college student's income).			"

												Next to the Gemcraft series, this is the best tower defence I've played in a while. And, next to Kingdom Hearts, it's the best RPG I've played in a while. It's original in its design and concept, this cross of a more niche genre with a very large one, whilest still being familiar enough in its portrayal to be easily understood.To put it more bluntly, the only thing that's new and original about this game is the cross between tower defence and RPG, and ONLY tower defence and RPG. It doesn't throw in unseen mechanics, or third person action gameplay, or any of that. It's just tower defence and RPG.And it's wonderful because of it.It's the first game I'll be 100% completing on Steam. I recommend this game wholeheartedly. It does a damned good job on just about all fronts.			"

												A tower-defense game with an RPG-like leveling system that adds an interesting twist to the genre. Story and characters are very basic but are likable and serve their purpose well enough. The biggest plus point for me, a person who cannot yet make the time to spend hours locked up in my room playing ""hard core"" RPGs, is how easy it is to get back into the game after not touching it for quite a long time. In addition to pandering to my perfectionist tendencies, I can ease myself back into the game by going back to earlier levels set on harder difficulties.Leveling up the characters can get cumbersome though once you start accumulating them, but it's a minor issue. Automating the process would remove the element of customization, which I like, but I wish there could be a way to bulk-assign level-up points, or of the sort.			"

												A game worth playing. Its quirky characters and dialgue bring a smile to your face inbetween slightly difficult battle scenes, your ultimate victory on each level will have you relieved and pumped. Although the story is not as gripping as some other RPGs, you will be willing to go through dialgue for the small silly gems. The game gives you a lot of leeway in the game, even playing advanced isn't always difficult but as soon as you go extreme, it is a whole diffirent ballgame. The game asks you to replay it, replay each level on extreme to gain more advantages for future levels. Over all a Great game and a great buy. I hope the sequel is as good.			"

												Short: [9/10] Awesome and challenging Tower Defense x RPG mix with 30+ hours of gameplay. Only a few gripes make this game short of perfect.Long: ""Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten"" is a Tower Defense game in which you fight hordes of enemies by using different classes and spells. The classes (of which there are 6) all differ in playstyle and give the game its RPG elements via XP gains, talent trees and weapon/armor aquisition. Even though the game looks simple, it offers a very deep combat and leveling system which will have to be adjusted multiple times in order to beat certain levels. Examples include making your archers target fastest enemies first, putting the stun sword in the hands of your knight, or making sure your ice skills don't get cancelled by your burn ones.  The story itself is amusing as well and gave me a few chuckles along the way. New Game+, 3 star rating per level, and challenges such as endless mode only extend the life of this game and make you want to play more. There are however, a few issues. Some, like the ""Undo"" button, which removes ALL the points you just put into your character's skill tree instead of just the last one, should be renamed ""Restart"" because that's what it actually does. This gets very annoying when respeccing a character with 60 points in New Game+. However, the ""Undo"" button is not game breaking so it doesn't change my rating of the game. What does, however, is the terrible frame drop encountered during big fights. Even though I have a very powerful rig, it has caused the game to crash several times (once while on 95th wave of endless when attempting 100 wave achievement!). Another is the poor visual of the cursor, which when coupled with the fact the frame rates drop, makes it impossible to see. This has caused me to lose a few games or constantly pause to execute commands.But the few imperfections get dwarfed by the fact this is a great game, and had me coming back for that ""JUST ONE MORE ROUND"" feel. The devs are actually pretty cool/active as well and respond quite frequently in the forums. Don't miss this game, it is very much worth it!   [9/10]			"

												Wow. This game really is good.I'm a bit more than halfway through as of writing this and I'm having a blast. The writing and humour is really quite good, and gameplay is nice. I find the characters really quite endearing indeed!So about the gameplay:If you've read the description, you'd know it's a tower-defense game with rpg elements; i.e. your ""towers"" are actually characters which level up permanently (though you still ""upgrade""  them in battle). It's pretty brilliant; you can choose to grind to level them up to tackle harder levels, or you can try a no-grind approach to see if you can tough out the main missions.The gameplay is really quite smooth and although the mechanics are not anything different from other tower defense games, work really quite well.I grabbed it while it had 67% off and I feel it's well worth it, even at full price. Very well made, and I feel the creators really put their soul into this game.			"

												Defender's Quest is a tower defense style game with RPG-based elements added in.  I liked it; overall, it's a quaint little game.  The characters are likable and the story (although not too original) is well paced and engaging enough.  There were a few times where the gameplay felt a little grindy to me (make sure you level up more than one priest, for example - I didn't and had to grind one up before I could proceed) but you can redo levels on harder difficulties for more experience and money or on easier difficulties to move the game along.Eventually, I just started playing on easy to advance the story along, then I just quit playing altogether.  Although I didn't finish it I still liked the game and would recommend it to fans of TDs, especially if the added RPG elements interest you.  I also liked how it asked you to like the author on Facebook or something to get a free item at the beginning.  I always give games that ask me to do this a resounding, ""Hell No!"" and when I did with Defender's Quest it gave me the items anyway, so I thought that was nice.Nothing to write home about, but it wasn't a bad attempt.  You'll probably enjoy your time with this game.			"

A few drawbacks: Difficulty rating discrepancy-playing on normal can be a bit difficult until you level up (as it should be) but going backwards a level is insanely easy (you won't even have to try to beat it) and the advance from normal to intermediate isn't really much of a boost (meaning it's not really incrementally harder). Once you level up about 75% of the way through the game, all the difficulty levels become far too easy to beat-you can beat everything on 'extreme'. Again, didn't kill the game for me, but it would be nice if they reworked the difficulty settings.			"

												A solid Tower Defense game, with decent storyline, characters, and mechanics.  Instead of just upgrading your 'towers' which in this case are members of your party, you can also level them up, putting points into different abilities, both active and passive.  Although the story is a bit cliche, it is still good, with endearing and interesting characters that I found I grew to like.  The downsides to this game are as follows:  There is a bit of a difficulty spike towards the end of the game, rather than the difficulty continuing its basic climb, and after a while you will have to grind.  You will have to grind a lot.  That nearly had me giving this game a negative review, as the most deadly sin a game can commit is being boring, but the fun of the gameplay balances it out.			"

												Solid Tower Defense game. The story has a great balance of serious and funny, and I found it to enhance the experience. The gameplay itself is a wonderful balance between simplicity and complexity. Elements are added at a sensible pace so that you always feel like you have a good enough handle on the situation to succeed. Also in the late game there is a high enough skill ceiling to keep it engaging for a good long time. Easily my favorite Tower Defense game.			"

												A nice blend of RPG mechanics and tower defense gampelay. Storyline is very cliche but is not actively bad. Tower defense mechanics are fairly simple but resource management is important and strategic placement is very important on the path to victory.			"

												Defender's Quest is an excellent tower defense game that, while not perfect, is one of the better offerings in the genre.The pros (+) and cons (-) are as follows:+ Solid tower defense gameplay. It follows a typical X unit is good against X enemy type formula, and for the most part this works well.+ The story in this game is much better than you'd ever expect from a game of this type. You can more-or-less ignore it if you don't care, but if you take the time to read the journal entries, you'll find that the world and characters are very fleshed out. A lot of the characters and situations are very tongue-in-cheek, which relieves some of the tension a game like this can inspire. :)+ Level design constantly pushes  you out of your comfort zone. You often find that you can't quite use units in the way that you'd want to because of the limitations on the terrain. Things don't get as monotonous as a result of this.+ For a tower defense game, it's pretty long. If you're a veteran of the genre and can breeze through tough fights with effortless tactical accumen, you'll find that getting maximum stars on each level takes about 10-15+ hours.+ New Game Plus (NG+) adds sidequests that aren't available in the normal game, which includes new story and cutscenes. The behind-the-scenes journal entries are also really interesting.+ Hero Mode makes for an even more challenging game (you can only use the 6 story characters).+ Lots of customization for loadouts, units, etc. Branching skill trees make the customization feel a little more fleshed out, although some options are clearly better than others.+ The DX version of the game vastly improves the graphics. The biggest mark against the original game was that it was in SD and the art looked very amateur. With this update, the game supports HD/Widescreen resolutions, and all sprites/cutscenes look 1000% better.+ You have the option of increasing the amount of XP and Scrap (money) you get after each battle by up to 300%. Scrap isn't all that useful, but XP is mana from heaven. This is great, because if you left it at 100%, it'd take a metric ♥♥♥♥ton of grinding to get to the end of the game. See cons for reasons why even this feature doesn't save NG+ from grindiness, unfortunately.- In the normal game, Rangers are by far the best unit. You can win almost every fight by just using them, even on Expert. It seems that the developers were very aware of this, which is why --- In NG+, the Ranger (the only real ranged unit in the game) is the subject of immense nerfs. Many enemies that appear in large numbers and have high speed either have 50% resistance to ranged damage, or 60-70% ranged evasion. These are the kinds of enemies you'd want an archer for because they can slip past your melee, but your archers can't hit them. This really hurts the unit's viability in a lot of fights. I feel like the challenge could have been increased without this frustrating change. There are some enemies that the Ranger is still really good at dealing with, but mostly you'll be relying on melee in Expert modes.- Most of the added difficulty in NG+ is artificial. Inflated HP and stats, enemies that phase out so that you can't target them, etc. You're often forced to spam global spells to deal with certain situations because your units simply can't no matter how you have them set up. This mode just isn't very well done in my opinion. It's frustrating and tedious, not fun.- The super sheep levels are tedious and not fun at all. You kill a slow moving sheep (that you can slow even more) that has about a bazillion HP and takes optimal tactics and resource management to kill before it reaches the end of the level. It is a very boring, very long fight even with the game sped up to 16x speed, and you have to do it TWICE in order to get all the achievements. If you're a completionist, you'll be subjected to several grindy annoyances, which brings me to the final gripe:- If you complete the game in Hero Mode (can't recruit units), once you've finished those achievements (after finishing NG+), you'll want to recruit units because there are some levels that are impossible to get 3 gold stars on with only the main 6 heroes. Unfortunately, the recruited units at that point will be so low level that even setting the XP to 300% is an unbearable grind to get them to 60. Battles take a long time to fight, and the XP from a battle -might- give your units half a level. You can imagine how long this would take. This was originally a community challenge that the developers put into the game later (along with associated achievements), but they didn't really balance the post-achievement gameplay for it. I actually gave up with only a few achievements left to get. Not worth it.Overall, if you're interested in a tower defense game that's challenging and satisfying in the base game, and aren't too concerned with unlocking every last achievement, then this game is for you. If you love punishing grinds, NG+ has you covered.			"

												An extremely user-friendly interface, charming graphics, a solid base gameplay (with lots of variations and different levels of challenge) and entertaining, even if not mindblowing, story and dialogue.The base game doesn't last very long, but that also means that it doesn't overstay its welcome and that each level has at least a little something that makes it unique and prevents the player from always using the same strategy. The fact that each level has two optional challenges and that there's a New Game+ mean that there are a lot of potential challenges for the players who want them.Most importantly, the user interface never hides any information. You always know exactly what your characters can do and what the enemies will do if you let them. If you lose in this game it's because you did something wrong or your characters weren't strong enough, not because of some obscure ""gotcha"" mechanic or random chance.My only problem with the game is the fact that interesting and important story content (a personal sidequest for each one of the major characters) is only available in New Game + mode. When you're replaying the game, you're probably fast-forwarding past the story so you're probably going to see these scenes in a vacuum. On the other hand when you're playing the first time, which is the only time you're actually paying attention to the story, the characters will feel underdeveloped because their development is hidden in their personal sidequests. I think the game would be better if all story content were available during your first ""run"", and the New Game+ mode was just about gameplay and challenge.That said, this is an interesting and charming little game that succeeds in fusing RPG progression and tower defense gameplay, and is more than worth the money.

												Wow. This game really is good.I'm a bit more than halfway through as of writing this and I'm having a blast. The writing and humour is really quite good, and gameplay is nice. I find the characters really quite endearing indeed!So about the gameplay:If you've read the description, you'd know it's a tower-defense game with rpg elements; i.e. your ""towers"" are actually characters which level up permanently (though you still ""upgrade""  them in battle). It's pretty brilliant; you can choose to grind to level them up to tackle harder levels, or you can try a no-grind approach to see if you can tough out the main missions.The gameplay is really quite smooth and although the mechanics are not anything different from other tower defense games, work really quite well.I grabbed it while it had 67% off and I feel it's well worth it, even at full price. Very well made, and I feel the creators really put their soul into this game.			"

												So I won this game in a giveaway where I got to choose which game I wanted out of a list, major shout out to toph--Such a nice person! Honestly this was my third choice, and it appealed to me because im a sucker for pixel art in games like this, and the old final fantasies, and man did i fall in love with this game. It's rich in story content, a great tower defense game where you can grind for currency and leveling up, and complete stages at harder difficulties to gain bonus loot, has a great soundtrack, and i swear that they sampled a battle theme from Final Fantasy 8 i swear i hear it exactly in the background of each stage with minor changes to it, which I absolutely love, I love the music in this game, the fact that you can customize the classes that you recruit, their talent tree, the fact that you can give them gear and make them stronger. This is like no other tower defense game, its got personality, as do the characters, this is no crystal defenders clone, its got its own label, in fact i think its much more elaborate and more fun than crystal defenders which I am a big fan of. All the gear customization reminds me of Fantasy Defense on Android which I was a big fan of as well. This game is defintely a gem that people should look into buying. I am so stoked for Defender's Quest 2			"

												Surprisingly, this game was really addictive and entertaining.  I was looking to just kill a couple hours one night a year or two ago and I expected this to be really simplistic, but it turned out to be really interesting, strategic, well designed, enjoyable, .. yeah.  I am not a thrift/indie shopper for games either, so this game catching my attention probably means its all that much more amazing.  usually I am just playing the mainstream sorta-hardcore online gamer type stuff.  10/10, 2 thumbs up,  YOU MUST TRY THIS GAME.  whether you are a casual gamer, or you are a hardcore gamer, I think this has mass appeal.  Play it for an hour, and then watch that turn into 20-30 hours and be astonished that you got addicted to a tower defense game with graphics that could be from 2000.			"

It's challanging enough to have you work at it but not so OH GEBUS where it stops being fun. Plenty of achievements that make you work for it and alot going on in the background with side plot. With New Game+ and ++ you will have more than enough hours of gameplay especially if your like me and attempt to do it all with only main characters....

												One of the best tower defense games I've played so far.Rather than a typical tower defense game that you can find around steam, they insert a few interesting RPG element into the mix, and it works suprisingly well. Each tower is actually a character and each character has levels, skill trees and equipments. Each character helps progress in the main stroryline, and the storyline is pretty interesting and funny at times. Most importantly, the game runs great and destroying the waves of enemies with your smart strategic placement of towers/characters is satisfying. It has a lot of levels, multiple difficulties for each level, has bonus levels like endless mode, new game + and has Steam Workshop to add new stuff!If you're a fan of RPG and tower defense, this is definitely a game you cannot miss.8/10, great game.

												Defender's Quest combines the classic tower defense formula with RPG elements in a way that feels both classic and fresh at the same time. Because it works within the established TD formula, it's familiar and accessible. Because it replaces towers with hired heroes who level up, learn new active and passive skills, and equip new gear, it's offbeat and original. The art is both childlike and gritty. The story, the game's weakest point, is still functional and effective, and the simple characters are fun and relatable. It's a little short, but there's replay value both in beating older missions on higher difficulties and in starting a new adventure with new hero builds. Overall, a charming and unique hybrid of the Tower Defense and RPG genres.			"

												A really interesting and different tower defence game. You build an army of units that gain experience, new skills, can equip items, and then get summoned to the battlefield as towers, a concept I have never seen before. There is enough enemy varriety to make things tactical, the stages are also diverse enough to keep things fresh, the replayability is also really great, revisiting previous stages for more loot and replaying the whole game for bonus levels and bigger challenge, that's enough to get you going for a long time. Everything wrapped up nicely with a nice soundtrack and a story that ties it all together.I'd say this is a game that could be enjoyed not only by people familiar with the genre, and definitely worth buying if you are into Tower Defence.

												 Really great spin on a TD where your towers are your hero party and level up as you go. This means your limited by the size of your party to how many towers you can place in each level. This limitation is good and really hones the sort of strategy this game is about. Each map is well designed and offers a different challenge.    Each party member (tower) has their different effects/weaknesses/skills. They can be equipped with items and weapons for different effects emphasising the RPG elements. Placement and arrangement is super important, just like any other TD.  The game is immensely replayable, and has a superb difficulty settings options to mould the game to exact sort of challenge you want. All the way from absurdly easy to absurdly hard.  The game offers a great challenge for completionists.  The soundtrack is awesome and has a hint of 90's JRPG soundtracks within it. Probably the best blind purchase I've made on steam.

												I'm rating this up even though the lawyer made several smart♥♥♥♥♥remarks in a stupid agreement you have to accept in order to play the damn game.The game itself is decently fun and visually pleasing. The only bad thing I can say about the game is the cut scenes aren't up to par with the games other visuals. I personally skipped them but still enjoyed playing to the last level.			"

												This is one of those rare RPG / tower defense games that are actually really good. The story was pretty good. The gameplay was pretty balanced. It's only as difficult as you want it to be which is perfect. The graphics are... well, look at the screenshots. I completed the story, and I'm not bored with it yet. Which is good because the game unlocked an entirely new game mode which means many more hours of playtime. The game has a bunch of well placed humor which adds a lot to the game / story. The game was definitely worth what I paid for it, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a game like this.For the record, I played in Hero only mode which added some challenge while also making the micro-managing a lot easier. I found out that the default 300% scrap setting is way too high since I never spend any of it... except for the last stretch where the stores give you access to a lot of really expensive gear which pretty much consumed most of my scrap.I especially laughed when the game decided to reward me anyways for my stubborness.

												Edit again: Okay, now I can change my review back to a recommended. While the rerelease had a really shaky start, the devs have been great about talking to people, filing bug reports, and a really quickly released series of patches that have put the game in a good state again. I'm glad that the game is stable again because it remains one of my favorites and most played in my entire Steam library.Edit: Three and a half years later, I'm having to edit my review on the HD rerelease of the game. Do no buy it in its current condition. It is an incredibly buggy mess. The game constantly crashes, graphical and UI glitches abound, certain equipped items will make maps literally unwinnable. How this version of the game was allowed to see the light of day is baffling. Wait until it's been patched a few times, which the devs ARE being very quick and responsive about.If you at all enjoy tower defense games, buy this. Now. It injects cocaine through your mouse and keyboard right into your body. It's so addictive it's ridiculous. The graphics are a bit basic and it doesn't have a huge epic storyline, but it's like one of those really good Flash games polished to a mirror sheen. A mirror you snort crack off of.			"

												With the update, I've should update this review. With the improved looks, which was my main issue, the question is it is worth the full price now? Just about, yes. I would still recommend playing the demo.There are still issues, but I feels like they are personal issues like the the skill system is somewhat off to me. Important part, to me. So overall, a fairly good game for it price.*old review*It a good game. Why is my review not Recommended? It eleven pounds! If it was a fiver, that would be fine, but 11?It look a flash game, it play like a flash game, but you can feel the work and effort put into this game. If you pay the full price, you will feel ripped off playing it.So unless the price has gone down or it in a sale, avoid. If it in a sale putting it near that 5, buy for these guys deservse it and it a game any fan of TDs. If you are not a fan of TDs, go to kongregate, you can play the first act for free and see if you like it.			"

												Update: I am changing my vote to ""recommend this game"".I have accepted Fox's suggestion and set XP+scrap gain to 300%. Now the game is FUN instead of being frustrating. And it is still challenging, the ""extreme"" difficulty requires some skill (and a little grinding). I think that this should have been the default setting for this game.Now I also enjoy the side quests in the ""new game+"" mode.Bottom line : recommended !Just for the record, this was my previous review:I am somewhat disappointed from this game. I really wanted to like it - it has a genuine idea (combination of tower defense + RPG) , it is not expensive (on sales often) and the developers seem to care about the customers. Also I have to admit that the cut scenes are funny.However, it is simply a grinding game. Some levels are just too difficult, no matter how clever and resourceful you are. You have to go back and play earlier levels, until you grind enough XP and money to buy a better equipment. Then the level becomes easy, and you win it no matter what tactics you use. In other words, the game rewards you not for your talent, but for the time you spend playing it.In addition, the graphics and sound are just like from the 80's. Perhaps this is the designers' intention, but I didn't like it.I would recommend this game only if you are a tower defense fanatic and only when it is on sale.			"

												This is without a doubt, the best tower defense game ever created by humankind. The story is riveting enough to hold your attention from start to finish. The characters are wonderful in their own quirky ways. The gameplay is new and exciting combining the best of two genres. I've played this game since the very first demo was released all those years ago and the new deluxe updates just make me realize how far this has gone and how well it has aged. Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is just incredible and I hope a lot of people will come to recognize it as one of the best games online. The only problem.... Defender's Quest 2 isn't out yet. Just kidding. But seriously, please get Defender's Quest 2 out soon and make it as awesome as the first and keep creating more of this. These is a good game and any other works of yours that are as good as this deserve to be recognized for their creativity.			"

												Ah, here is proof that watching someone else demonstrate and have fun with a title can get people to buy a game. In this case it was Total Biscuit and the Developer of the game (in his Twitch chat.) I once played a little game on Sega Gensis called Warsong and this very game tugged at my nostalgia quotient for it. While the combat between the two games are vastly different there is something that screamed Warsong, but I can't put my finger on it. Regardless, the plot alone can draw you in to this game. Give it a try!			"

												Fun Tower Defense game where your towers are RPG characters that you can equip with gear and upgrade the skills of.The levels in the story line have multiple difficulty levels, which throw increasingly more high level monsters at you. Going back 5-10 levels and redoing levels at a higher difficulty is a nice way to try previous areas with a higher level party (that has more options in terms of hero/tower placement).For the low price during summer sale it is definitely worth it. I've gotten a few hours of good fun out of this. Because the levels don't take too long to finish, it's nice to play if you have 10 minutes to kill while waiting for something else.			"

												Defenders Quest is a well-balanced Tower Defense game that replaces static towers with RPG-element-laden characters. With six classes, skill trees and weapons and armor there's plenty of customization to be had.It is a little repetative, as the game expects you to run certain levels over a few times to gather much needed XP and money, but it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's got a story with characters I cared about, which is a hard thing to do for a TD game, and it ended before things started getting stale. A well-rounded experience! :)I would sing this game's praises in the same breath as Kingdom Rush. A gold standard to the genre.			"

												A really interesting and different tower defence game. You build an army of units that gain experience, new skills, can equip items, and then get summoned to the battlefield as towers, a concept I have never seen before. There is enough enemy varriety to make things tactical, the stages are also diverse enough to keep things fresh, the replayability is also really great, revisiting previous stages for more loot and replaying the whole game for bonus levels and bigger challenge, that's enough to get you going for a long time. Everything wrapped up nicely with a nice soundtrack and a story that ties it all together.I'd say this is a game that could be enjoyed not only by people familiar with the genre, and definitely worth buying if you are into Tower Defence.

												This game is so much fun, a tower defense game with some rpg elements. If you love tower defense, but would want some more story behind it? This is your game! The first playthrough isn't incredibly hard, still poses a challange at times though but if you lvl enough you can manage. But then you unlock New Game +, and yea.. that's a nice challenge! There is a level cap! But the game keeps getting harder! Strategy definetly required. I love it. Also be sure to read the dialogs, especially tak is hilarious and had me laughing out loud on several occasions. I still play it every now and then, have to admit i havent gotten all gold stars on newgame+ yet.. (that d*mn sheep) But i will eventually, still enjoy the challenges!I felt compelled to change this review, because i have beaten the New Game + Sheep ! That's all.			"

												I don't like tower defense games, but this one is pretty neat. Why? Because it incorporates many RPG elements I do like. Take all the normal tower defense aspects and make them level up with skill selections and you have Defender's Quest. The story is vaguely interesting and the art style minimalistic, but nice/different. However, I only recommend the game for those who like tower defense games, as the game resorts to repeating content with higher difficulties as far as extending your skills and leveling your party rather than something random or a large amount of content. There are also several secrets abound and some great humor in the dialogue if you care to read it!			"

Those points are easily swapped to other skills for no fees. There is equipment you can win or buy to upgrade warriors, mages, dragons, and paladins. Lots of different creeps that change your strategy. Units/towers are upgradable during quests for up to 5 levels, increasing access to abilities, range, and damage.			"

												At its core, Defender's Quest is a tower defense game in which your towers aren't just expendable resources that don't change from level to level.  In Defender's Quest, your towers are customizable heroes, with skill trees and a wide variety of abilities.  The story, art style, and music are all rather presentable, and even charming at times, and the core mechanic of leveling up your troops and acquiring new gear has tremendous Pavlovian allure.  It's a fairly expensive game for its relative simplicity, but it nonetheless hugely entertaining.  At full price or on sale, I can't help but recommend Defender's Quest.			"

												A competent and enjoyable, if somewhat limited, tower-defense gameMost of the challenge comes from the mixture of enemies in each wave and the limited ability to create the prototypical ""kill zones"". Enemy times have specific vulnerabilities, and some of the player's defense units are direct counters for these vulnerabilities. Usually, a mixture of units in each lane, with an emphasis on archers, will suffice for most challenges.It's not a super-difficult or revolutionary game by any means. Its production values are very limited, and that will bother some. But it has a lot of humor, a competent save-the-world storyline, and some interesting units (dragons, for instance, are hard to use well).I'd recommend this game for someone looking for a little dash of charm with their casual, traditional tower-defense experience.

												10/10I did not knew that DQ will become one of my favorite games of all time. I spotted a game on sale on Steam. Checked the screens, description, some players opinions. Mix of Tower Defense and RPG? That sounded interesting. It turned out that it was a game I was waiting for.Graphics are really good. They're tidy, have charm. Well, ok cut-scenes could look better, but they're not bad. Still visuals are not important here.What is important is gameplay. What can I say, it's brilliant. You're placing heroes, of few classes, on battle field, changing tactic with each new level. Characters varies, have nice skills, synergize well. With each battle they gain experience points which leads to new levels and skill points, making your heroes stronger. It adds a little grind to classic Tower Defense game. You can revisit once done levels, increasing it's difficulty to gain bonuses. And then, after the game is over, there is new game plus, making things even more complicated.You will have Dragon in your team and you will kill sheeps!Story starts suddenly, with our protagonist Azra, just like us, surprised with events that occurs. With time we will learn about plague and revenants, will find out who is the villain. It's nothing ground-breaking but is good excuse to continue the adventure. There is even a moral decision!The key part is the dialogues. They're simply amazing. Heroes are crazy so we ends up with many fun jokes, that will leave you with minutes of laugh. There are few misses, still author's sense of humor turns out to be very good. Good stuff.Defender's Quest is great game. Fantastic example of how well Tower Defense can work with RPG. This game gave me plenty of great time, it offers lots of content, making it one of my better purchases. I recommend it to everyone. You won't be dissapointed.			"

												This game may not have cutting-edge graphics, but it sure has a lot of heart.  Defender's Quest is a strange combination of the tower defense and RPG genres, and it's one of my very favorite games in either genre.  Through the game's substantial and satisfying campaign, you'll assemble a motley crew of heroes who serve as your ""towers"" in this tower defense game.  Unlike towers, however, your heroes will level up as they gain experience, and you can assign various skills and pieces of equipment to them.  It's fun stuff.The developers for this game are fantastic, and their continued work on Defender's Quest highlights their ""long tail"" philosophy.  Rather than abandoning their game after release, Level Up Labs have diligently improved upon their work, adding content, improving the graphics, and rebuilding the engine.  Defender's Quest is far more refined now than it was upon release, and its developers ought to be proud. Defender's Quest is an excellent game with a committed development team, and I very much look forward to its in-development sequel.			"

												Nice little tower defense ! Difficulty depends rather hard on the settings, but even with 300% xp you're going to have a hard (and delicious) time having all the achievements.Besides, the story and the conversations are rather hilarious, I really liked the style, reminded me of Penny Arcade sometimes.

												The game is fun overall though it has a steep difficulty curve at one point. I spent a lot of time farming the first areas getting perfect on each one so I had a lot of gold for upgrades and such, but when i reached the cave the costs and difficulty sky rocketed it seemed. Overall though, fun game if you enjoy tower defenses and made me laugh more than once.			"

 By far the best tower defence game out there! But the german translation ist terrible!Most item descriptions make no sense and the menus are messed up!Also the performance in ""xubuntu"" is bad . but I look forward to the sequel, that i already pre-ordered there: http://www.defendersquest.com/2/?page=preorder PS:  this game installs ""adobe air"" it doesn´t works without it.

												Wow. This game really is good.I'm a bit more than halfway through as of writing this and I'm having a blast. The writing and humour is really quite good, and gameplay is nice. I find the characters really quite endearing indeed!So about the gameplay:If you've read the description, you'd know it's a tower-defense game with rpg elements; i.e. your ""towers"" are actually characters which level up permanently (though you still ""upgrade""  them in battle). It's pretty brilliant; you can choose to grind to level them up to tackle harder levels, or you can try a no-grind approach to see if you can tough out the main missions.The gameplay is really quite smooth and although the mechanics are not anything different from other tower defense games, work really quite well.I grabbed it while it had 67% off and I feel it's well worth it, even at full price. Very well made, and I feel the creators really put their soul into this game.			"

												Bought this on a whim, wasn't expecting much, to be honest. But I do love tower defense, and it runs on linux, so I went ahead with the purchase. Very impressed, this game is actually very excellent and has an old-school SNES feel with modern tower defense. I've been playing it over more publicly accredited games (it actually has pulled me away from DOTA 2), so decided that a positive review would help out a bit because I feel very strongly about how this hidden gem wasted an entire Sunday for me, and I'm still not done beating it 100%. I rarely care about beating games 100%, I think the last time I did it was for a little-known title called Goldeneye in the 90's.Excellent concept: merges RPG with tower defense. That's all there is to say, really. Units seem to be all useful, but as with ANY old-school RPG combat it can get super easy or impossible depending on whether or not you grind. Regardless on that, there are technically four difficulties (if you count casual) that change each battle's difficulty hugely. Story is alright -- the humor isn't my cup of tea, but then again, I have a picture of the dude from The Human Centipede 2 as my steam picture, so I just gotta say it's a me thing.Looks like they're making a sequel. Good, I'll be sure to buy it.If you're on linux and can't figure out why the game doesn't start without an error message, you need Adobe AIR. Their website is quite good on showing you how to get it running. A minor setback, I'm sure with licensing reasons Steam can't install it as a dependency. However, it almost made me assume the game was poorly ported and bugged (like Dead Island which doesn't boot on linux for some and nobody knows why, LOL). The devs obviously cared a lot about this game: it's not junk meant to be sold to chumps where they buy it on sale, play for 15 minutes, then never open it up again. The writing is good -- not perfect, but meant to be (ugh) all ages. It's not a super deep story, though I feel with more practice they could pull it off if they feel it wouldn't detract from the gameplay in the sequel.I would advise the devs to look at their website and tone down on the humor -- had my bored, cynical♥♥♥♥♥seen it without playing the game I would've assumed this game would be♥♥♥♥♥♥ The art isn't AAA title, but as an indie game, what the ♥♥♥♥ do you expect? The battles are mid 90's SNES quality (though better than Breath of Fire II, worse than FF6) and the cutscenes are adobe flash-esque and very similar to the indie game Sequence (minus the voice acting, plus more character gestures).If the game was a teensy little longer and made for the SNES, with a little more ""professionalism"" mixed in, it would've been a classic everyone would've known about. I came in expecting♥♥♥♥♥♥and found a gem I hadn't heard about before. I'm old, drunk, and cranky, and this stole an entire day from me and perhaps longer. Def buy @ $10, even $15. It's about on par with binding of isaac.			"

												A very fun blend of tower defense and RPG with a boring title. The level of polish that went into this game is impressive for an indie game. The art, music, and gameplay are all very good. The story is passable but the characters and the dialogue itself is great and often funny. There was a lot of thought that went into the gameplay. Even though you only get 6 units they are all very specialized and have their own use. Their introduction and upgrades come at an appropriate pace. The difficulty scaling is near perfect.If you like tower defence games then this is a solid buy.			"

												This game is pretty cool.  It's tower defense where your towers are men and they get experience and level up as they would in a role playing game.  It is a bit grindy but pretty addictive also.It doesn't look super great  but it isn't bad. I play it on ubuntu 14.04 linux plugged into to the living room TV.  That works well.  Although for some reason it never remebers my graphics settings so I have to reset the scale each time.  Also it has borders on the right and left even if I choose a wide screen resolution.  Also it seems to have a memory leak or something because after an hour or two it lags out.  At any rate these are minor annoyances to a pretty solid game.I installed it awhile ago and checked it out a bit and didn't play it for a few months.  It kept calling me back and I have been having fun with it. It's a good game and 15 bucks is a fair price.			"

Those points are easily swapped to other skills for no fees. There is equipment you can win or buy to upgrade warriors, mages, dragons, and paladins. Lots of different creeps that change your strategy. Units/towers are upgradable during quests for up to 5 levels, increasing access to abilities, range, and damage.			"

												With the update, I've should update this review. With the improved looks, which was my main issue, the question is it is worth the full price now? Just about, yes. I would still recommend playing the demo.There are still issues, but I feels like they are personal issues like the the skill system is somewhat off to me. Important part, to me. So overall, a fairly good game for it price.*old review*It a good game. Why is my review not Recommended? It eleven pounds! If it was a fiver, that would be fine, but 11?It look a flash game, it play like a flash game, but you can feel the work and effort put into this game. If you pay the full price, you will feel ripped off playing it.So unless the price has gone down or it in a sale, avoid. If it in a sale putting it near that 5, buy for these guys deservse it and it a game any fan of TDs. If you are not a fan of TDs, go to kongregate, you can play the first act for free and see if you like it.			"

												Solid Tower Defense game. The story has a great balance of serious and funny, and I found it to enhance the experience. The gameplay itself is a wonderful balance between simplicity and complexity. Elements are added at a sensible pace so that you always feel like you have a good enough handle on the situation to succeed. Also in the late game there is a high enough skill ceiling to keep it engaging for a good long time. Easily my favorite Tower Defense game.			"

												At its core, Defender's Quest is a tower defense game in which your towers aren't just expendable resources that don't change from level to level.  In Defender's Quest, your towers are customizable heroes, with skill trees and a wide variety of abilities.  The story, art style, and music are all rather presentable, and even charming at times, and the core mechanic of leveling up your troops and acquiring new gear has tremendous Pavlovian allure.  It's a fairly expensive game for its relative simplicity, but it nonetheless hugely entertaining.  At full price or on sale, I can't help but recommend Defender's Quest.			"

												I do recommend this game if you enjoy games of the tower defense or puzzle genre. I highly recommend you stay away from this game if you have never enjoyed the TD genre. This is a wonderful game. The game has a (what I refer to) pick your own challenge setting which basically consists of setting your own EXP and Scrap(Money) multiplier/%. It can be set up to 300% which is by far easy mode. The second playthrough is more fun than the first and it has great replayability in my opinion. Overall would give the game an 8/10 and I am happily looking forward to the second game.			"

												Played demo version long time ago I knew that I would fall in love with full version of Defender's Quest. Why is it so good? It have great replayability, which is in my opinion the most important thing in TD games. You can start to play on casuals and reach your way to the hardest settings. Even with few units you need to think how use them, how upgrade them, which one should get better stuff first etc. Maps and monsters are interesting. Same goes for story. While music and graphics are not so flashy, it fits really great for a game from Tower Defense genre. It inspire player to beat levels on hardest settings not only for achievements but also for stuff you can get from doing it. Also, there is one level with really annoying cute monster and it will demand from you a little knowledge on each unit skills and to come with a good strategy to beat it. There are also endless challenges so you can do your best over and over, beating your (and maybe your friends) wave scores. I'm glad I finally decided to play it. There are plenty of Tower Defense games on Steam but this one is greatly fun from start to the end. I will probably play it once again, when HD upgrade will be avaible. Also I won't hesitate to get second game shortly after release, since I enjoyed this one so much I have a really high expectation from next one.			"

												I got the game at offer and I am totally satisfied.The towers are actually fighters which you recuit and level up between fights.I played just 3 hours and I cannot say more yet but these 3 hours were fun :)...17 hours nowDialogs between characters are very funny :)I am trying to optimize my progress in such a way that I use as few ""towers"" as possible....23 hoursI played a map on higer difficulty to get an item and after I aquired the reward, instead of pressing equip button, I pressed continue. The item was not placed into the inventory. Just dissapeared. Luckily it was not an important item. This glitch could be very anoying....Finished the game. I guess the issue above might have been a missunderstanding from my side. The game filters the items - it shows only the ones the currently selected fighter can equip.			"

												Defender's Quest is far better than I expected. One thing that sets it apart from many tower defense games is that the story is witty and engaging. While the first few challenges are fairly easy, the difficulty increases at a good pace. There is no significant penalty for failing or restarting a mission, so the game does not punish you while you are learning. This is a very well-executed game and quite enjoyable.			"

												Smartly written, it overshadows most tower defense titles with its emphasis on character growth and world-building. One can grow attached to Slack, for example, much more easily than one can grow attached to a nameless battlement or turret. The game provides a range of challenge suited to players of any skill level, with the new game + feature providing plenty of replay value.

												Got this game ages ago, liked it then, just finished playing it again when the fancy graphics came out, and it's even better now. The units and progression are pretty balanced (though I'd recommend playing with the XP and scrap at 300% or it gets grindy). Every unit is unique even within a type which adds an interesting bit of strategy. For instance I always give my best equipment to the story characters and boost them first in battles, so those characters have points in the high boost skills but my secondary fighters and archers have their points only in the low boost skills. There's a decent story with some funny dialog. Core story takes 10 to 15 hours to get through (with xp turned up), and there's quite a bit of replayability with the higher difficulties. I'm about to go start the new game+ myself. Oh, and there's a demo, so I'm not sure why you're reading reviews.			"

												DONT PLAY THIS GAME! You think you just play a short round - after all its just a small game. Thats what you think. Thousands of hours later you realise that you have been fighting some single sheep for hours, because you want its awesome fleece. And because its in fact a sheep god. Yep, the game sucks you in completely. Even if the character paintings are not so great and the music gets slightly repetitive after all this time played. Nonetheless, the combination of tower Defense and RPG just awesomely combines the addicting aspects of both genres, making this game super-addictive. I warned you. It will ruin your day. But then again, its really a lot of fun to play.			"

												Solid writing, the story was engaging especially for a tower defense game.  Character dialogue was great and got a decent amount of laughs from me.The tower defense wasn't revolutionaiy, but the RPG mechanics added in gave some nice long term benefits to investing in certain ""towers"".  Levels never out-stayed their welcome while also providing a fair amount of replayability. Having the right setup and clearing your way through at 4x was satisfying.I've never been one to spend a lot of time on side-stuff after completing the main story though so I don't think I'll put any time into 100%'ing the game or new game+			"

												Yes, yes, and yes.  This is an excellent tower defense!Defender's quest knows what's important and what's not.Graphics are minimal and sprite-based, and keyboard controls are almost enough to forego the mouse.  The music is catchy and fitting. Gameplay has enough decisions in tower placement, upgrades, and equipment that replaying levels for awards isn't tedious.The story and dialog are humorous and of appropriate lengths while remaining interesting and giving the game purpose.Warning: vets will be challenged by the (selectable) high level of difficulty.  Skipping this game would be a mistake.			"

												Bought this on a whim, wasn't expecting much, to be honest. But I do love tower defense, and it runs on linux, so I went ahead with the purchase. Very impressed, this game is actually very excellent and has an old-school SNES feel with modern tower defense. I've been playing it over more publicly accredited games (it actually has pulled me away from DOTA 2), so decided that a positive review would help out a bit because I feel very strongly about how this hidden gem wasted an entire Sunday for me, and I'm still not done beating it 100%. I rarely care about beating games 100%, I think the last time I did it was for a little-known title called Goldeneye in the 90's.Excellent concept: merges RPG with tower defense. That's all there is to say, really. Units seem to be all useful, but as with ANY old-school RPG combat it can get super easy or impossible depending on whether or not you grind. Regardless on that, there are technically four difficulties (if you count casual) that change each battle's difficulty hugely. Story is alright -- the humor isn't my cup of tea, but then again, I have a picture of the dude from The Human Centipede 2 as my steam picture, so I just gotta say it's a me thing.Looks like they're making a sequel. Good, I'll be sure to buy it.If you're on linux and can't figure out why the game doesn't start without an error message, you need Adobe AIR. Their website is quite good on showing you how to get it running. A minor setback, I'm sure with licensing reasons Steam can't install it as a dependency. However, it almost made me assume the game was poorly ported and bugged (like Dead Island which doesn't boot on linux for some and nobody knows why, LOL). The devs obviously cared a lot about this game: it's not junk meant to be sold to chumps where they buy it on sale, play for 15 minutes, then never open it up again. The writing is good -- not perfect, but meant to be (ugh) all ages. It's not a super deep story, though I feel with more practice they could pull it off if they feel it wouldn't detract from the gameplay in the sequel.I would advise the devs to look at their website and tone down on the humor -- had my bored, cynical♥♥♥♥♥seen it without playing the game I would've assumed this game would be♥♥♥♥♥♥ The art isn't AAA title, but as an indie game, what the ♥♥♥♥ do you expect? The battles are mid 90's SNES quality (though better than Breath of Fire II, worse than FF6) and the cutscenes are adobe flash-esque and very similar to the indie game Sequence (minus the voice acting, plus more character gestures).If the game was a teensy little longer and made for the SNES, with a little more ""professionalism"" mixed in, it would've been a classic everyone would've known about. I came in expecting♥♥♥♥♥♥and found a gem I hadn't heard about before. I'm old, drunk, and cranky, and this stole an entire day from me and perhaps longer. Def buy @ $10, even $15. It's about on par with binding of isaac.			"

												Fun, addictive game. It's mainly a tower defence game, with some leveling up elements and a decent storyline. It plays well for the first few hours, but it starts to lose steam after you finish most of the missions. I still find myself comming back to this game to get some quick fun out of it sometimes. It can be quite challenging to get 3 stars on all missions, so if you are the kind of person who has to get the ""perfect score"", expect to put many hours into this game.			"

												Short: [9/10] Awesome and challenging Tower Defense x RPG mix with 30+ hours of gameplay. Only a few gripes make this game short of perfect.Long: ""Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten"" is a Tower Defense game in which you fight hordes of enemies by using different classes and spells. The classes (of which there are 6) all differ in playstyle and give the game its RPG elements via XP gains, talent trees and weapon/armor aquisition. Even though the game looks simple, it offers a very deep combat and leveling system which will have to be adjusted multiple times in order to beat certain levels. Examples include making your archers target fastest enemies first, putting the stun sword in the hands of your knight, or making sure your ice skills don't get cancelled by your burn ones.  The story itself is amusing as well and gave me a few chuckles along the way. New Game+, 3 star rating per level, and challenges such as endless mode only extend the life of this game and make you want to play more. There are however, a few issues. Some, like the ""Undo"" button, which removes ALL the points you just put into your character's skill tree instead of just the last one, should be renamed ""Restart"" because that's what it actually does. This gets very annoying when respeccing a character with 60 points in New Game+. However, the ""Undo"" button is not game breaking so it doesn't change my rating of the game. What does, however, is the terrible frame drop encountered during big fights. Even though I have a very powerful rig, it has caused the game to crash several times (once while on 95th wave of endless when attempting 100 wave achievement!). Another is the poor visual of the cursor, which when coupled with the fact the frame rates drop, makes it impossible to see. This has caused me to lose a few games or constantly pause to execute commands.But the few imperfections get dwarfed by the fact this is a great game, and had me coming back for that ""JUST ONE MORE ROUND"" feel. The devs are actually pretty cool/active as well and respond quite frequently in the forums. Don't miss this game, it is very much worth it!   [9/10]			"

												One of the best tower defense games I've played so far.Rather than a typical tower defense game that you can find around steam, they insert a few interesting RPG element into the mix, and it works suprisingly well. Each tower is actually a character and each character has levels, skill trees and equipments. Each character helps progress in the main stroryline, and the storyline is pretty interesting and funny at times. Most importantly, the game runs great and destroying the waves of enemies with your smart strategic placement of towers/characters is satisfying. It has a lot of levels, multiple difficulties for each level, has bonus levels like endless mode, new game + and has Steam Workshop to add new stuff!If you're a fan of RPG and tower defense, this is definitely a game you cannot miss.8/10, great game.

												Wow. This game really is good.I'm a bit more than halfway through as of writing this and I'm having a blast. The writing and humour is really quite good, and gameplay is nice. I find the characters really quite endearing indeed!So about the gameplay:If you've read the description, you'd know it's a tower-defense game with rpg elements; i.e. your ""towers"" are actually characters which level up permanently (though you still ""upgrade""  them in battle). It's pretty brilliant; you can choose to grind to level them up to tackle harder levels, or you can try a no-grind approach to see if you can tough out the main missions.The gameplay is really quite smooth and although the mechanics are not anything different from other tower defense games, work really quite well.I grabbed it while it had 67% off and I feel it's well worth it, even at full price. Very well made, and I feel the creators really put their soul into this game.			"

												Gonna be a pretty short review; hopin' that the fact it's the game I've played most on Steam and the fact I'm recommending it is enough to say 'this game is good.'Cause damn me if it isn't. It's an RPG/Tower Defence hybrid, as you can likely read the entry or Google to discover, with an interesting storyline, characters I came to like and in some cases love ('Slak' the Beserker is ridiculously funny in my opinion), and a balance of serious moments and comedy that I've always enjoyed. It never feels entirely like non-sense to me either when it flits between the two ends, so that's always a plus.The game doesn't take anywhere near as long to play through as my time suggests; I've just enjoyed the game so much that, after finding it mysteriously uninstalled from my computer and thus all my progress erased, instead of getting annoyed I got excited to be able to play through it all againSo if you're a fan of Tower Defence and RPG's, I'd say to give it a look. For those of you that know me better, and can say our tastes in games are similar, I don't know why you don't own it already.			"

												A game worth playing. Its quirky characters and dialgue bring a smile to your face inbetween slightly difficult battle scenes, your ultimate victory on each level will have you relieved and pumped. Although the story is not as gripping as some other RPGs, you will be willing to go through dialgue for the small silly gems. The game gives you a lot of leeway in the game, even playing advanced isn't always difficult but as soon as you go extreme, it is a whole diffirent ballgame. The game asks you to replay it, replay each level on extreme to gain more advantages for future levels. Over all a Great game and a great buy. I hope the sequel is as good.			"

This game is...different.First of all, it has a plot.  It has a decent story.  It has humor.  It has rpg elements, collection elements, and it lets you choose how you want to play.  Lots of fighters?  Go for it.  Like ranged attacks?  You are good to go.  A decent blend?  Yup.  There is no one way to win a level...and you can replay the level to try other things.Try this game...you'll enjoy it.			"

												TL:DR : This game understands you. (8.75/10)The graphics aren't the best, but they're as good as they need to be; the soundtrack and effects are pleasant but not particularly obtrusive or overwhelming. The plot itself is as interesting as it needs to be, with dialogue amusing enough to read- but all of it can be readily skipped past or ignored as one pleases. In terms of gameplay, this is a solid tower defense/tactical RPG. LUL manages to skillfully blend the two, producing a well thought out, fairly original tower defense where one identifies with, develops, and equips one's 'towers' much as one would one's characters in games like FF Tactics or Bahamut's Lagoon. What is particularly striking about this game however, is not the gameplay itself- it's present in the gameplay, to be sure; but what really marks this game as interesting is the attention to detail the studio has given to ALL of the aspects. The graphics aren't the best, but they're every bit as good as they need to be. The plot and dialoge are easily skipped because this is a casual game, where you are not expected to care in the slightest, and yet they are still amusing and substantial enough for if you do happen to care for some reason. If you need solid proof that LUL clearly understands you, the gamer, just look at the attention they pay to the control scheme. You can play this game without a mouse. Easily. The mouse can help now and then, but these people have dialed in the control system of their game to such an extent that a skilled player could possibly even do better without a mouse than with one, and all the keys are fully mappable, in case their super-intuitive control scheme isn't super-intuitive enough. To be fair, I've noticed a glitch or two, but they always seem to get corrected fast enough that you would miss them if you blinked at the right moment.Overall, always good to see this level of attention being given at all levels of development. 8.75/10			"

												Defender's Quest (DQ) is a tower defense meets RPG hybrid. You go around with your ragtag bunch of misfit heroes, trying to save your skin and possibly the world. As you make your way, battle after battle, through hordes of zombies... I mean, Revenants, everyone's skills improve, making them harder, better, faster, stronger at slicing-and-dicing more undead meat.Is that all? No. DQ has a delicious old-school feel, partly thanks to the pixellated sprites, partly because of the great soundtrack which will make you think of the glorious days of SNES JRPGs. It also has some notably well-written dialogue, snappy and fun (though let's face it, the art in those scenes leaves something to be desired...). DQ also has lots of challenges for you. Playing levels at regular difficulty is getting too easy? No problem, you can replay them at Advanced or Extreme to get bonuses and goodies. Finished the game? No problem, there's a New Game+ with more difficulties awaiting for you. The learning curve is extremely well-balanced and I especially enjoyed being able to complete the main story without ever getting really stuck but with a very real sense of increased hardship towards the end (the last two-three battles, especially, I barely managed to power through).It's definitely a very good game, especially if you like tower defense. Get it.EDIT: the developers released a ""DX"" patch for this game adding new content, remaking the engine with HaxeFlixel and redrawing the art to be better - thus the only complaint I could ever muster about this game has now gone. This is nothing short of a masterpiece, and quite possibly the best tower defense game you'll find on Steam. Search no more.			"

												I've played the CRAP outta this game, long before it was on Steam.  Tower Defense with RPG Elements.  Its pulled off well.  The story is pretty good for what it is.  Tons of replayability.  Tons of bonus missions.  Tons of character customability.  Has a GREAT demo, and your progress/character data transfers over to the full game.If NOTHING ELSE check out the demo.  But seriously, if Tower Defense/RPG hybrid sounded at all interesting, just get it.Update: The new Deluxe edition update, which was free to everyone who already owned the game, is pretty good.  The game no longer runs in Adobe Air/Flash, which is a nice change.  The updated graphics are nice, if only somewhat incremental (not that that is bad, the game looked fine already).  I think its a great upgrade.			"

												Wow. I did not expect to like this game as much as I did. To me, the game had an original concept, a better than decent story, and a fantastic sountrack. Despite the core of the game being a tower defense, the levels did not really ever feel repetitive, and could be replayed on higher difficulties (which required different strategies) for unique character equipment. EXP and money earned can be adjusted in the settings to make the game as grind-ey or not as you like. The characters were a little two dimensional, but I still connected with them and enjoyed the slightly-simple sense of humor. This is definitely a game I would recommend buying on a steam sale and then spending a day playing.			"

												I do recommend this game if you enjoy games of the tower defense or puzzle genre. I highly recommend you stay away from this game if you have never enjoyed the TD genre. This is a wonderful game. The game has a (what I refer to) pick your own challenge setting which basically consists of setting your own EXP and Scrap(Money) multiplier/%. It can be set up to 300% which is by far easy mode. The second playthrough is more fun than the first and it has great replayability in my opinion. Overall would give the game an 8/10 and I am happily looking forward to the second game.			"

												One of the funniest games I have played in a long time. I renamed all the characters to be based off of Nintendo games, primarily Zelda. So the main character, Zelda, the berserker, Link, then I strayed to general names of Disney and other nostalgia types, and named Keta as Jasmine from Alladin. I was dying of laughter reading the script from those names, and I was shocked at just how well it worked renaming them that way.This has definitely been my favorite time sink for the past 6 months. I would recommend it every time.			"

If you pay the full price, you will feel ripped off playing it.So unless the price has gone down or it in a sale, avoid. If it in a sale putting it near that 5, buy for these guys deservse it and it a game any fan of TDs. If you are not a fan of TDs, go to kongregate, you can play the first act for free and see if you like it.			"

												This is without a doubt, the best tower defense game ever created by humankind. The story is riveting enough to hold your attention from start to finish. The characters are wonderful in their own quirky ways. The gameplay is new and exciting combining the best of two genres. I've played this game since the very first demo was released all those years ago and the new deluxe updates just make me realize how far this has gone and how well it has aged. Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is just incredible and I hope a lot of people will come to recognize it as one of the best games online. The only problem.... Defender's Quest 2 isn't out yet. Just kidding. But seriously, please get Defender's Quest 2 out soon and make it as awesome as the first and keep creating more of this. These is a good game and any other works of yours that are as good as this deserve to be recognized for their creativity.			"

												Update: I am changing my vote to ""recommend this game"".I have accepted Fox's suggestion and set XP+scrap gain to 300%. Now the game is FUN instead of being frustrating. And it is still challenging, the ""extreme"" difficulty requires some skill (and a little grinding). I think that this should have been the default setting for this game.Now I also enjoy the side quests in the ""new game+"" mode.Bottom line : recommended !Just for the record, this was my previous review:I am somewhat disappointed from this game. I really wanted to like it - it has a genuine idea (combination of tower defense + RPG) , it is not expensive (on sales often) and the developers seem to care about the customers. Also I have to admit that the cut scenes are funny.However, it is simply a grinding game. Some levels are just too difficult, no matter how clever and resourceful you are. You have to go back and play earlier levels, until you grind enough XP and money to buy a better equipment. Then the level becomes easy, and you win it no matter what tactics you use. In other words, the game rewards you not for your talent, but for the time you spend playing it.In addition, the graphics and sound are just like from the 80's. Perhaps this is the designers' intention, but I didn't like it.I would recommend this game only if you are a tower defense fanatic and only when it is on sale.			"

												A solid Tower Defense game, with decent storyline, characters, and mechanics.  Instead of just upgrading your 'towers' which in this case are members of your party, you can also level them up, putting points into different abilities, both active and passive.  Although the story is a bit cliche, it is still good, with endearing and interesting characters that I found I grew to like.  The downsides to this game are as follows:  There is a bit of a difficulty spike towards the end of the game, rather than the difficulty continuing its basic climb, and after a while you will have to grind.  You will have to grind a lot.  That nearly had me giving this game a negative review, as the most deadly sin a game can commit is being boring, but the fun of the gameplay balances it out.			"

												This is one of the few TDs that I can stand, mainly due to the cast of characters. In this  TD your towers are characters, that you will place on predefined maze, in order to stop the creeps from getting to Azra (the main character). The characters have persistent level ups (RPG), along side traditional tower level ups (TD), this makes that game a bit easier to manage when it comes to placing them on the battlefield. Characters automatically attack and chose which ability to attack with, unless otherwise told not to use an ability. Azra has several spells that can fight back against the oncoming hordes such as healing all placed characters and raining down fireballs to continuously burn enemies.In the game Azra has been tossed into the pit for contracting the plague, which she quickly overcomes to meet a loopy swordsman. The game manages to walk that fine line between seriousness and humor throughout the campaign. As you make your journey across the over-map you gained more survivors to your band with anywhere from 7-37 characters in your company, however only 7 are story related the rest are just generic copies of Azra 6 followers. You can assign all characters in your party with names other than the default ones, and generic defenders can be assign a color schema. There is a hard level cap of 60 for all characters, therefore you will not be able to max all characters abilities (higher difficulties you will have prioritize the best move set for your characters). This is game is design philosophy has the old school mentality when it comes to unlockables: new game plus that adds sidequests/challenge maps (like fighting waves upon waves of sheep), harder story maps, and journal entries, books to equip Azra, unique weapons and armor/ their upgrades. Game allows you to fine to how easy or hard you want the game to be like granting no exp upon failure, increase the speed of the game. The game is very well supported by the developer, in fact received an HD upgrade without making the user pay for it again. TL:DRhighlights   humorous characters  a TD game with an actual plot  persistent level ups  free HD version and soundtrack  new game plus "

												Plot-based tower defense game. Multiple levels of difficulty (play through just for story, or repeat for perfection!). Pretty decent writing of the characters, interesting plot, some fun mechanics in the fights. Beat it in about six hours, but worth the price. 8/10, would recommend for a short gaming spree.			"

												My favorite Tower Defense game.  Hours of playability, difficulty from mild to extremely tough to 100%.  Every few years I go back and play through it again.  The creator's added some new stuff over the years, but mostly I've been waiting for the sequel which has been in development for an eternity!  Looks like it's finally out of alpha phase though!			"

												An extremely user-friendly interface, charming graphics, a solid base gameplay (with lots of variations and different levels of challenge) and entertaining, even if not mindblowing, story and dialogue.The base game doesn't last very long, but that also means that it doesn't overstay its welcome and that each level has at least a little something that makes it unique and prevents the player from always using the same strategy. The fact that each level has two optional challenges and that there's a New Game+ mean that there are a lot of potential challenges for the players who want them.Most importantly, the user interface never hides any information. You always know exactly what your characters can do and what the enemies will do if you let them. If you lose in this game it's because you did something wrong or your characters weren't strong enough, not because of some obscure ""gotcha"" mechanic or random chance.My only problem with the game is the fact that interesting and important story content (a personal sidequest for each one of the major characters) is only available in New Game + mode. When you're replaying the game, you're probably fast-forwarding past the story so you're probably going to see these scenes in a vacuum. On the other hand when you're playing the first time, which is the only time you're actually paying attention to the story, the characters will feel underdeveloped because their development is hidden in their personal sidequests. I think the game would be better if all story content were available during your first ""run"", and the New Game+ mode was just about gameplay and challenge.That said, this is an interesting and charming little game that succeeds in fusing RPG progression and tower defense gameplay, and is more than worth the money.

												I'll confess that I haven't played the new HD update. Someday if I have time and feel like replaying this, I'll check it out. But the fact that I put so much time into this game BEFORE the snazzy update probably says something.I don't play much tower defense, so I can't really compare and contrast, but this was a thoroughly fun game that you can probably enjoy if you like RTSes or tactical RPGs. It's got a solid story, endearing characters, and fun writing that doesn't take itself especially seriously. The game pretty much always feels balanced and makes good use of the mechanics it's established, at least over the course of the main story.Some of the end-game challenges can be very frustrating. At one point I decided I wanted to try to 100% this game, but I could never get those last few achievements no matter how hard I tried. I was putting so much time into the game that I got tired of the soundtrack and turned off the music to play my own tunes. (My friends always thought some of the sounds from this game sounded like I was repeatedly booting up a PS1.) Don't be afraid to look up guides if you're trying that stuff yourself.Still, all that is just post-game content that is by no means necessary to enjoy the experience. You can power through the main story on the lower difficulties in not too much time. The extra content will keep you busy if you want it, though. This game is a bit of an underdog that I highly recommend. Also, absolutely deserving of the Best Use of a Farm Animal award for the Super Sheep secret boss. Oh, and the main character is a librarian, which I am too!			"

												In my opinion, the finest tower defense game ever made.  It is simply in a separate league from anything else.  The RPG mix really takes the game to another level than just standard TD fare.  It's also got a great story as well, along with a new game + mode.  There's definitely lots of content to last.  I could play this game over and over, and that's something I rarely do with any game, and I've played a lot!			"

												I'm not strongly into tower defense (TD) games, but this game does away with some of the downsides of tower defense games which bother me. Your towers are characters you gain as you progress in the story, or purchase at various points. Your team protects your summoner, and both the characters and summoner, gain XP after each battle (win or lose, although that can be adjusted). If the game becomes too hard, you can replay an earlier level for extra XP / scrap (the game's currency). However, replaying levels is not grindy-feeling, since each level can be played at three different difficulty levels, which is a different than just the same monsters with more HP (for example, sometimes there are additional spawn points and sometimes the monsters have additional bonuses). (And if you really don't like redoing levels for XP and scrap, you can increase the gain of each of them.)Unlike some TD games, there is no pathing manipulation: the squares the characters can be placed on are different than the creeps' travel squares. That doesn't mean that character placement is permanent: it is sometimes useful to remove and re-place characters (especially in boss levels or the bonus levels available during the second playthrough).Speaking of the second playthrough, that isn't just the same monsters, but more HP. Usually the second playthrough monsters have additional abilities, such as attacking your characters as they walk by, or become temporarily immune to non-area damage. The second playthrough also allows purchase or unlock of the best weaponry. Another nice touch is that switching between the first and second playthrough is just a matter of returning to the menu; your entire party and loot remains the same. (I worked a bit on the second playthrough, got stuck, went back to the first playthrough to do some of the harder difficulties of the levels, got stuck, went back to the second playthrough, et cetera.)Besides your party characters, the summoner has a few spells that unlock while progressing through the story and can be increased as the summoner's level increases. These spells can help out during tight spots in earlier levels, and are pretty much required for the hardest levels.Slak says to at least try the demo; pants are optional.			"

												Update: okay, so now with the new HD edition it is possible to play full screen and all the graphics look way nicer now. A great game got even better!This game is to Tower Defense what Puzzle Quest is to Match-3 games. Basically all the ""towers"" you place are actual characters from your ""party"": beserkers, rangers, priests, etc. They level up, they can equip some stuff... it's all pretty basic but in combination with the  Tower Defense mechanics it works nicely. The writing is somewhat dry and pretty funny at times. Graphics are a bit basic, and it is not possible to play at 1920x1080. However, the characters in the cutscenes are nicely drawn. Part 2 is in the making, but until that is released you cannot really go wrong with this one.			"

												This is actually a pretty solid game - the troop variety could have been wider, and some of them just never are as good as the others, ultimately (archers are astounding, and dragons are cool but, ultimately, overpriced for what they offer. :( )It's really a tower defense in spirit, but has some neat little RPG elements, with some progression of your wizard/caster person, as well as your troops, who each have a little skill tree and stuff. For the price, and supporting a small studio, well worth it.Graphics are decent - the art is so so at best, the pixel work is much more pleasant than the ""cutscenes"", which no offense intended, are tacky at best. The story is decent, but is sorta held back by some kinda ridiculous one-liner attempts at humor and non-sequitor silliness, but all that said, I would say I enjoyed the game all in all.			"

												Edit again: Okay, now I can change my review back to a recommended. While the rerelease had a really shaky start, the devs have been great about talking to people, filing bug reports, and a really quickly released series of patches that have put the game in a good state again. I'm glad that the game is stable again because it remains one of my favorites and most played in my entire Steam library.Edit: Three and a half years later, I'm having to edit my review on the HD rerelease of the game. Do no buy it in its current condition. It is an incredibly buggy mess. The game constantly crashes, graphical and UI glitches abound, certain equipped items will make maps literally unwinnable. How this version of the game was allowed to see the light of day is baffling. Wait until it's been patched a few times, which the devs ARE being very quick and responsive about.If you at all enjoy tower defense games, buy this. Now. It injects cocaine through your mouse and keyboard right into your body. It's so addictive it's ridiculous. The graphics are a bit basic and it doesn't have a huge epic storyline, but it's like one of those really good Flash games polished to a mirror sheen. A mirror you snort crack off of.			"

												This is one of those rare RPG / tower defense games that are actually really good. The story was pretty good. The gameplay was pretty balanced. It's only as difficult as you want it to be which is perfect. The graphics are... well, look at the screenshots. I completed the story, and I'm not bored with it yet. Which is good because the game unlocked an entirely new game mode which means many more hours of playtime. The game has a bunch of well placed humor which adds a lot to the game / story. The game was definitely worth what I paid for it, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a game like this.For the record, I played in Hero only mode which added some challenge while also making the micro-managing a lot easier. I found out that the default 300% scrap setting is way too high since I never spend any of it... except for the last stretch where the stores give you access to a lot of really expensive gear which pretty much consumed most of my scrap.I especially laughed when the game decided to reward me anyways for my stubborness.

												If you are a friend of the tower defense style of game play, this is your game! They throw a mixture of RPG style level system, characters, and attacks at you to help defend your towers. The game has endless replay value due to the new game plus feature that it has after defeating it. If you get tired of playing the game, be sure to check out the user created mods that they have in the community and try them out. They even give a shout-out to the hacker collective anonymous in the game, be sure to play it and check it out for yourself.			"

												I've had this game for a long time now and I'm always surprised to see it keeps getting updates which further add to the game. Solid!			"

												Fantastic little TD/RPG hybridUnique concept that adds a little depth to the TD genre. Loads of replayability if you want to try different builds and difficulties. Story is OK, some nice touches of humour. Class balance is a little off, as others have mentioned, the Ranger is a tad OP compared to other classes. Skill trees allow for some experimentation with character builds. Music fits well and sound effects are cool. Graphics are 2d but nicely done.A gem of a game if you want to relax easily into something. Check out the demo to see what to expect, then buy it :)			"

												A really outstanding game. Instead oif mechanical towers your have characters who take up position to defend. Lots of upgrades, a moderately interesting story, clever maps, and decent replayability. I found this low tech looking tower defence game to be a legitimate challenge with a thoughtfully designed flow. Lots of fun, and totally worth it.			"

												This game is a hidden gem. Some people will be fooled by the graphics, but if you can get past that and play the game you will be sure to enjoy. Very strategic, requires intelligence unlike a lot of tower defence games. It also has some great rpg elements. Soldiers are your towers and they have persistent upgrades.Quite simply, this game is unique and offers a great challenge. The story also has depth, quality and some great humour. Games rarely make me laugh. This one made me laugh numerous times.A must have for any fan of tower defence games.Has a new game+ mode for vets. 10/10			"
