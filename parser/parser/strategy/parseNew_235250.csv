												Don't let the look of this game fool you. If you're a fan of Tower Defense then I guarantee you'll find hours of fun in this. The ability to level up, use player skills, assign talents to amp your towers or even your personal skills depending on the map you're on. This is all alongside creating your own maze by placing blocks just like you do in the original Sanctum games. This is certainly worth the few dollars their asking. You wont be disappointed.			"

												One hell of an addictive TD!It starts off rather simple, though after a few rounds it'll quickly become complex and rather difficult. Chances are you'll have to re-do some of the more complicated maps once or twice, but what's a game without any challenge? Definitely recommend it.			"

												Super Sanctum TD is typical towers defense game, nothing more, nothing less.Yes, this game looks on screenshots like 20 years old game which may be repulsive. I don't even know why I started to play this game, but for sure I didn't have any expectations. And I realised that I have 13 hours playtime. That was good time for sure. This game is well designed, difficulty level grows with every level, so it's not so hard to start but it's getting difficult after some time. But you will want to pass only one level, and next after that, and maybe next... And so on.Generally very well designed, polished and properly balanced piece of a game. It's really hard to find something as good in such a price. Good job.VERDICT:If you're a fan of tower defence games, this is good one. Try it, you won't regret.If you have only few bucks and want to play for long hours, this is it!Like this review?

												First off, I do actually like the game. I really do. It is quite pleasing aesthetically, and has a great system in place that lets you play the game how you want.Problem is, how you want to play the game might not be very successful.It is of this gamer's opinion that a tower defense game should not be a puzzle game. There should not be a narrow band of builds that will actually grant victory among an immense number of combinations that could be played. With 15 different towers and 17 skills, picking just four of each can be difficult, yes, but it affords the player the ability to define how they want to go about defending their cores, and that's not even counting the perk points, which add another layer of depth and customization. This system by itself is fantastic, but the execution that makes use of it is rather poor.There is progression; not everything is available from the start. This progression, however, cuts off quite fast. Everything is unlocked at the point of hitting level 12, but the levels keep going, rather pointlessly. Perk points are gained differently, at a rate of 1 per completed map, and when you feel like you're not powerful enough to get past a particular map, there's a problem.Now, I can understand a TD needing some strategy; if one doesn't make you think about what you're doing, then it's probably not very good. SSTD, though, feels like it asks too much of strategy, putting the player on a very fine line between perfection and failure. I was doing fine with this game through the first few levels. I made a blunder here and there, and learned from what were clear mistakes (setting all Violators to attack the highest HP targets was a bad idea, for the record). There were some tougher levels that took me a couple attempts to figure out, but it felt okay. The challenge was fair. Then along came Works.Works is the map that I feel enforces an unfair level of difficulty and shows that the game really wants you to use a very specific setup to get through it. I have taken numerous attempts at it with different builds and have yet to even see the boss wave. I have beat my head against it long enough that I don't really care to continue. Maybe it's a fluke, maybe the rest aren't so bad after it, but I'm not going to put myself through the torture of trying to figure out the exact combination of towers and skills it takes to get through this map that seems to have too much of everything.Sure, I could just use the magic of Youtube and look for a setup that gets through it so I could continue, but that's not how I play; I would get no sense of accomplishment and may as well have used Cheat Engine to bypass the level in terms of enjoyment. When a game completely shuts down a player's ability to progress, without giving them an opportunity to either adequately learn what they're doing wrong or power up to overcome the challenge, then there is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.The game doesn't need to be easy; it just needs to cater to more than an elite 1% of builds. Don't tell the gamers how to play their game.			"

												Pretty nice tower defense game. I like it.Super Sanctum is a maze TD. You should place blocks on the battlefield to make path of the monsters longer. Such subgenre of td game contains deep tactics and strategy.Devs have done a good job. Game is simple at the start and becomes harder with every mission.

A Screenshot of Super Sanctum TD
By: Rurik




There is a wide choice of towers. Every tower has unique specifications and abilities. Every tower can be upgraded three times. I can definitely say that's more than enough to feel as a real commander. I found only one minus, that is you can take only 4 towers during a mission.There are a lot of different skills: bombs, lightning, black holes, etc. You must use them wisely to achieve victory on hard.You gain experience by completing levels. You can spend skill points on different upgrades.Graphics is nothing special. But I like this retro style.

												Super Sanctum TD is a suprisingly well-balanced, challenging tower defense game.  The 8-bit throw-back graphics conceal an exceedingly tightly crafted game that is both enjoyable and, unlike most tower defense games, it has tense moments of agonizing decisions since it has bevy of immediate effect super-powers that you can deploy occassionally. I admire this game for it's design and I am here not as much to write a review, but to thank the authors for their fine work.  Thank you!			"

												Bland, rudimentary tower defense that looks and feels like a Flash game.Annoying controls that were designed for a touchscreen.Dull music and annoying sound effects. Thankfully you can switch the default ""retro"" music for an alternate soundtrack consisting of some tracks from Sanctum and Sanctum 2, and it's significantly better.The game isn't very well balanced. Some perks and special abilities barely do anything, and others are horribly overpowered. For instance, you have to unlock a perk that will let you place blocks at no cost, and the game pretty much expects you to use it from then on out or you won't have enough cash to place towers. Some perks will simply never be used because the others are so vital.The game also isn't very thrilling; you can only use a selection of 4 towers on any given map, and beating a wave only gives you enough cash to purchase maybe 1-3 new towers or to upgrade one. Upgrades are way too expensive, and if you consider that purchasing a second tower essentially doubles the effectiveness of the tower, then upgrading is almost never cost-effective unless you're playing endless mode and you ran out of room to place new towers. Plus, there isn't anything you can actually do to earn more cash than the level is scripted to give you aside from using some perks and making sure you kill all the enemies. The level ends after 10 rounds unless you're playing the endless mode, so you never really get the satisfaction of feeling like you've built a maze to maximum efficiency. Another problem with the game is with the abilities. Along with your 4 towers, you also get to bring 4 skills with you to every map (once you've ulocked them). Unfortunately they play too big of a part, and you'll find that winning a level relies mostly on babysitting the mobs with your mouse cursor and firing off your abilities as soon as they cool down every 10 seconds or so, and sometimes it feels as though the towers are barely doing anything to help. One of my most effective strategies involved using two mine-laying abilities and a cooldown-reducing perk, and stacking hundreds of mines all over the level. Not exactly the kind of gameplay I was expecting from a tower defense game.The game is glitchy as all hell and crashes a lot, especially after beating a level. Thankfully there are auto-saves and you can resume from the wave before the crash, but if this happens, you lose all the EXP you would have earned playing the level, so it's still annoying (at least early in the game when you still need EXP to unlock stuff).One thing I will give the game credit for is that it gives you the ability to individually customize what each tower shoots at within its range: the first or last enemy in line, or the enemy with highest or lowest HP. This makes a huge difference in your maze's performance and makes possible some very deep strategy. Another thing I thought was awesome is how the game gives you the option, upon beating a campaign level, to jump right into endless mode using your current build. These are some features I wish more TD games had.The levels themselves aren't too hard if you have everything unlocked and know how to adjust your strategies, but getting 100% can take anywhere from 5 hours to 30 hours depending on how fast you can get a stupid random event to happen.I give it a 4.5 / 10. It's just alright; you could do much worse. If you get this on sale for $0.99 or less, it's probably worth the purchase if you're into Tower Defense. Otherwise I wouldn't really recommend seeking it out.			"

												I love tower defence games but Super Sanctum TD failed to keep my interest. Before the update that happened sometime this December, I was having decent fun with the game in the earlier levels - even though I thought they were a little too difficult for players who just started the game. All enemies had a little too much health but it was still managable, given that the player was able to use the right combination/positioning of towers and mazes. I found myself patiently restarting levels over and over again just to finish them perfectly before moving on to the next. I played this casually to let off some steam from schoolwork and studying. Despite the slight problems in balancing, I was actually enjoying myself.Fast forward to Dec 23 when I decided to play it again after exams.I opened up the game and was surprised to see all the changes: the UI had an all new look, the pricing of towers/blocks increased, monsters had even more health now and numerous other things changed as well. I already thought the game was hard enough as it is, but for some reason the developers thought it would be a good idea to make the game even more unforgiving. I am now unable to go past a really early level in the game because of this.Super Sanctum TD has a great concept, with a variety of towers and powers you can utilize. I also liked being able to set up a maze for the monsters. Unfortunately, the balancing is currently out of whack so players will be struggling and wasting time trying to get past even the easiest of levels. If you think you have the patience, feel free to try it out but I doubt you'll go very far with the current version.			"

 “Winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.” Super Sanctum TD (SSTD) is a 2-D retro-styled tower defense (td) game developed and published by the company Coffee Stain Studios, who are also responsible for ‘Sanctum’ and ‘Sanctum 2’.  Pro & contra: + Broad spectrum of abilities, skills and towers allow for various loadouts.  + 14 maps with increasing level of difficulty will put your strategical abilities to the test.     o Repetitive musical background with limited sound support.  Summary: SSTD makes sure to keep the player involved from the beginning to the end, and I was positively surprised by the level of complexity the game has to offer. It profits from the experience of a veteran td publisher like Coffee Stain Studios, which can be seen as a quality label.  Recommended for achievement hunters and hardcore td freaks.  Achievements: Estimated time for 100% completion: +20 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 27Multiplayer achievements: none			"

												Well, it IS tower defense. As the name implies, actually.And it looks like a flash game. But as one of the screenshots state, It's actually GOOD.And considering that it's almost free, it's actually one of the better TD games I've seen.Not all levels require careful planning, some are pretty easy even on hard difficulty, other will make you sweat... until you change a turret or an active skill, that is.All in all, it's got a very good return on your investment (counting fun and time played vs price)PS. Strangely enough, the game does not seem to reflect full time I've spent on it.			"

												Super Sanctum TD is a decent little Tower Defense Game. There are a lot of towers and spells to unlock as you advance. You can use different strategies and mazes to beat the levels - and it's a lot of fun.I especially like about this game that it has: cute graphics a challenging hard mode good balancing (the game will punish you if you don't play smart)The only thing that bothered me is that unlocking 100% of the achievements involved some grinding after finishing all the levels on every mode.9/10 A must-have for every Sanctum-Fan.

												Super Sanctum TD looks like it was made 20 years ago in some kid's basement. Sound effects, UI & graphics are basic, but behind the mediocre fascade is a challenging & balanced tower defense game. Strategy is important along with your selection of towers & skills you choose to arm yourself with.Small tactical mistakes can be unforgiving often resulting in restarting the level with a new defense plan. Hard mode is HARD! There is also a reasonable number of levels - they are not too complex or big for that matter, but they do generally allow for some mazing.I would have liked to see some better high resolution support though; but it runs & looks ok in fullscreen windowed mode. There is probably around 10hrs of gameplay to complete everything & an infinite wave survival mode to add some replayability.This was a surprisingly fun & addictive casual TD game.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												Note: I picked it up for $0.59, but I now believe it is worth the full price.This is a tower defense game. As such, the gameplay closely resembles that of every tower defense game ever created. However, it still brings hours of fun. It's easy to lose track of time while hunting for achievements or trying to level up. The game is linear (levels slowly become more difficult with minimal exploration), yet I often find myself going back to previous levels to gain experience points or restarting levels with different gear to try and gain an advantage. This is an amazing, low-cost game with great art and lots of potential. Give it a try!			"

												Sanctum 2 is a perfect example of how to keep a tower defense game interesting in 2013. Even though Super Sanctum TD has a top-down view and does not include a protagonist, you still feel like you are playing something else than a simple flash game.The fact that you decide where you place foundations is most likely the biggest difference compared to other tower defense games. Some people are saying that the update in December 2013 changed the game, but that didn't stop me from buying the game. After a few hours I have to say I don't know what they are talking about. This game is not super-easy, it's challenging, but it should be.			"

												Cool game. You can do each wave quite quickly but they do get a bit tricky.  You have to place your guns on the grid to shoot the bad guys before they attack your core. Same style as Super Sanctum 2 but on a tiny scale and you are God and not running around with big guns.			"

												Super Sanctum TD is a refreshing call-back to the TDs of the Starcraft / Warcraft 3 era. It's a TD stripped down to its most basic. You get a handful of towers and a handful of active skills. You kill waves of mobs for money and you build and upgrade towers. That's it. SSTD is long enough that you'll get your money's worth and short enough that you won't get bored. The difficulty curve is forgiving (perhaps too much) and, unlike most TDs these days, SSTD lets you maze (within limits). It's a fun TD.Note for completionists: the achievements are both attainable and generally enjoyable.			"

												Super Sanctum TD was a game I picked up for the combination of ridiculous sale price ($0.79) with trading cards. When I saw a game that looked to be similar to the original Sanctum games with the fast-paced FPS action taken out, I expected it to be a sloggy, boring grindfest - my standard opinion when it comes to the majority of tower defense games.Much to my surprise, Super Sanctum TD manages to dodge the most common gripes I have about the TD genre. Most levels have an open-ended ""create-your-own-maze"" approach, allowing for a lot of freedom and creativity in level solutions. SSTD also does away with long streaks of easy early-game snore-inducing levels - strong planning, resource management, and intelligent skill usage are all needed as soon as you complete the two training levels. The difficulty remains fairly consistent throughout, giving what seems like a paltry 14 stages a pretty beefy amount of playtime, as you'll likely need a few tries to figure out a suitable plan for much of the levels. On the other hand, if you find yourself breezing through the game, there's plenty of replay value in the form of an optional Hard difficulty, as well as infinite survival modes for every stage.SSTD isn't without its flaws, however - most glaringly is the game's fondness for crashing. Thankfully, the game does a fairly good job of autosaving, letting you continue right at the start of the wave you were left hanging on. The high difficulty I praised earlier can also be a bit of a double-edged sword - with a completely linear level structure, getting stuck on a stage will bring any semblance of progression to a screeching halt. An optional easy difficulty setting may have been a good idea for this reason.Super Sanctum TD may not be the most innovative game in the world, but what it does, it does very well. If you're a big fan of tower defense games, then this game is an absolute steal.			"

												I had never played a Sanctum game before this game. I was not expecting much but this has been one of the most solid TD experiences so far. There are a lot of towers and tactics you can use, I try using different towers all the time cause it mixes up the gameplay. You get upgrades depending on what difficulty and ""mission/map"" you have completed. It can be a little overwhelming at first if you don't try every tower out to find your own playstyle... I had trouble with a TD map early in the game before trying some other towers that made that TD map waaay easier, so just experiment to your hearts content (^_^) You also have abilities which is a neat feature. I would give this TD a solid 75 out of 100. It's quite enjoyable.			"

												Plain and boring Tower Defense :( But still its a nice game for TD fans, but for me, Element TD, a Warcraft III map is the best TD ever, thats why Super Sanctum doesnt satisfies me as it should. What made the final hit is that towers are unlocked as u progress and u are tied to 4 towers and spells, but imho spells arent that important in TD, but towers... Towers are the thing that makes every TD successful and here, well, we dont have many interesting mechanics to shine out even if its retro-styled TD ;) Besides of all this complains I've made I still recommend this ;) 6/10			"

												Super Sanctum TD.Normally i don't play these,even less when they cost money.but it costed only 4€ so i wanted to give it a try.But,What is Super Sanctum TD?Well,assuming you already played TD,or Towerdefence is you want it spelt out,games,this is also one...suprise suprise....So to some basic stuff.when you start you have the tutorial stage and when you enter you see you don't have all the Towers.Oh NOES! But no worries,the only thing you have to do is Level up. With an higher Level comes next to new Towers also Abilitys,from Black Holes which take for an short period of time an group of Enemys out,to mass damaging-thunders to damage increasing Buffs(of your towers for sure).There are also Towers which only can hit not flying Enemys,and 1 Tower which only deals damage to flying enemys(theres an ability that sends enemys flying,so they will be attackable for that Tower for an short period of time.)And they deal alot of damage,that doesn't mean use only them,you will need other Towers in the game later on,atleast to the point i managed to reach in the game.End Part(long♥♥♥♥♥end part)So when you are awful at these kinda games you maybe shouldnt play that,but looking at the price, and the playtime you can have by playing it, (+ it has badges but i don't think,that it is top priority for everyone)you can easily say its worth it.atleast more worth it then some 60€ games i saw so far.Sure it can be boring,so i would only recommend it to some people which are,let's say half way good at td games or better. Because it will become alot more frustating lateron in the game.But overall,i would recommend itIt was fun,even when im not an huge fan of TD games,and i can gladly recommend it to everyone,since it doesn't costs this much "

												Super Sanctum TD is an easy to understand, but hard to master tower defense game. The first few levels are easy and simple, but once you get to the fourth level the difficulty instantly ramps up. By killing waves you'll earn XP that will level up your profile, unlocking more secondary abilities and giving you the power to upgrade other variables, like increasing the gun damage of your turrets. The 2D design is charming and fits the game perfectly. It's all shown from an isometric view so you're not thrown into the action like the first or second Sanctum games. It still works very well, and for a game that came free with the second game it's an excellent addition to your collection. Even if you didn't get it for free it's worth the few [insert currency] they're asking for it.[Rating: 75/100]			"

If you love TD games, want to have some hours of relaxing, but sometimes intense fun, pick this one up, it's worth every penny!			"

												Eh, just not as interesting as other basic tower defense games. Sanctum really sold to me as a FPS-Tower Defense hybrid. Taking out the FPS half really doesn't leave as much to be interested in. Still solid, if you're into this sort of play. I'm just really not. The new balance patch has made it even more boring, if possible. 3/5			"

												VERY, VERY fun. Incredibly addicting. One of my favorite parts is with the abilities, half of the defense is the actually player. Without the use of abilities, almost every level is unbeatable, which is good, allowing for control over the game. One dislike, though, is the fact that it doesn't seem finished. The fullscreen won't work, and if you actually wanna go fullscreen, you need to know a special key combination (alt+enter).

												Super Sanctum TD is a straight up tower defense game, its simple, its 2D, its everything you might expect from a flash game but more! It is Sanctum at its core but with a more ""old school"" and standard approach to the tower defence genre, It has no fps elements so dont expect the game to play like a ""normal"" Sanctum. Treat this game as more of a Sanctum spin off and I am sure you will have a ton of fun, that is if you like tower defense games.			"

												This is the game that put the taste for ""tower defense"" in my mouth, leading me to purchase several other titles in the genre, including all of the sanctum franchize (which I also recommend). The game is stylish and highly addicting. My only wish is that it was longer: a good thing to wish of a game, I think. I got SSTD at 90% off--- a deal which seems to happen often for this game--- an incredible value. I would wait for a sale, even 30% off would be agreeable, but I'm a penny-pincher. Regardless of price, it is a great little game and entry into this franchise and tower defense in general.			"

												Super Sanctum TD is a tower defense game that's fun and addictive while it lasts, but considering the large amount of unused space on the world map, seems unfinished - or maybe it was supposed to have DLC that never got made.Anyway, each level has a Normal and Hard difficulty setting, but ""Hard"" is rather hit or miss as far as challenge goes. The problem is that once you've played enough on Normal, you'll unlock a plethora of skills to make the Hard difficulty that in name only. However, some of the stages near the end, especially the one with the boss that replicates itself, will take a lot of planning and strategy if you're going for the 3-star achievements.It often goes on sale for less than a dollar. If you like tower defense games and getting Steam achievements, it's an easy recommendation for that.Rating: 3/5			"

												[This is for version 1.1.1 of the game (I gather there's been some severe balancing changes and other things done since the earlier versions).]Competent little tower defense game. Classic TD with various abilities you can fire off to affect the enemies directly, and some skills which you can raise to improve certain types of towers and such.If you've played a few TD games there's nothing much here you haven't seen before, but what there is works well and it's also pleasant with this kind of pure gameplay from time to time.The only issues I've had is that the difficulty is a bit uneven (the very last mission is far easier than the next-to-last, for example), and I don't much like the way the Survival mode (endless waves) is done; enemy types just get more health as you progress and it's not very evenly done, so an enemy that was easy to kill in one wave can be next to impossible the next.I've also had some crashes which I suspect are due to a memory leak. At least, if I restart the game after playing a number of missions (~10), there are no problems.More campaign missions would have been nice too, but considering the price I paid (less than one Euro in a sale), that's not really a fair criticism.

It's pretty awesome before you start because you can choose what different types of towers to use, but if you choose the wrong tower or path in the skill tree it could be fatal. You have blocks which you can put down to form a maze & loads and loads of different types of enemies. The bosses can be a real challenge also and if they reach the core its pretty much game over.So, if your a fan of Tower Defense games & like games that make you use your mind then this is the game for you!

												Quick Summary: Unlike the previous Sanctum games, Super Sanctum TD is pure tower defense, so you’re not running around shooting the enemies, only your towers can attack. It’s also a much smaller game in terms of graphics and gameplay. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone told me Super Sanctum TD was built as a browser game.Also unlike the previous games, Super Sanctum TD has basically no storyline. The game is broken up into individual levels where you’re just trying to prevent the aliens from reaching the portal at the end of the level. The base layout of each level changes with each level and in most cases, you not only place towers, you also place the blocks upon which the towers are built. The aliens cannot pass your blocks so you can use them to create little mazes that give your towers more chances to blast the aliens. Since you’re not actually a player on the map you don’t need to worry about being attacked and the aliens do not attack your towers. Also unlike the previous Sanctum games, you have special skills/spells that you can activate during each map. The skills are generally area attack bombs or ways to slow down the alien advance, giving your towers more time to destroy them. These spells, along with the decent variety of towers available to you are the only way to block the aliens. It’s all strategy and planning with no real “skill” involved except for aiming the spells.Every time you beat a level, you earn a skill point that you can use on perks such as increased tower damage, increased area effect for spells, or decreased costs for blocks. You also gain experience as you play and unlock different spells. The skill points and levels are independent, so you can be level 30 and only have beaten 1 level but have all the skills unlocked. You can and must replay levels over and over for experience.Pros:+Uncomplicated game with a fast download since it’s so small.+You can be unskilled and still win if you look up strategies online since it’s your towers doing most of the work.Cons:-The game becomes super hard very quickly. I think I was only on the 3rd or 4th level before I got stuck and had to look online for help.-I said you could look up strategies online, but there actually isn’t much to be found except watching Youtube videos. This is probably due to how low profile the game is. Nobody wants to write a guide for a 100 megabyte game.Overall, the game is ok if you just want something to occupy your time for an hour or two at a time but it gets extremely frustrating if you’re trying to actually beat the game.

												Super Sanctum TD is the first tower defense game I've played all the way through. I've always enjoyed the genre, but I guess its never been able to keep my interest. However, Super Sanctum TD has opened a door for me, and beyond it is a genre I want to fully experience. The difficult thing about reviewing Super Sanctum TD is that I have no other experience to compare it to. That being said, I really, really enjoyed it. As a beginner to the genre I found the pacing to be on point, as the waves steadily grew in difficulty. I'll admit that I became stuck on a level for a few hours--trying and trying again to survive the onslaught. My mistake was thinking that it was your level (and in turn what items and weapons you've unlocked) that mattered when in reality it was a matter of strategy. Strategy plays a huge part in this genre, and when I realized that it wasn't my level but how I had set up my paths that was the problem, I beat the level with a perfect rating. Super Sanctum TD was teaching me that brains beats brawn in its playground. You have access to a wealth of different towers and perks to unlock as you progressively beat levels of the game. There are countless combinations to try out, and I have no doubt to each item's viability. There's also a lot of variety here, that lets you figure out your own playstyle. I for one leaned towards slowing enemies down while they got pummeled by towers that used AOE attacks. You also have access to a skill tree that grants bonuses to your towers and other areas. I haven't played much more after beating the campaign, so I haven't fully explored the tree. I did like the ability to regain all your points for redistribution whenever I wanted. It was helpful when I realized I had no idea what I was doing. In the end, all I can really say that I found Super Santcum TD an awesome experience. It certainly makes me want to play more of the genre. I definitely recommend this one for those times when you just want to sit down and play something for a few minutes without having to go too indepth.			"

												I didn't expect much when I got this game, but I was pleasently suprised with its outcome.  It is a bare bones Tower Defence, great for beginners that want to learn a simple version of the gameplay.  Allthough it is basic, it is not without great upgrades, tech trees and special moves.  The game on hard provides a healthy amount of challenge without overwhelming you with techniques, your strategy is still extremely valuable.  I have played the sequel to this game and it is completely different and strays from the game type.  I enjoy both games #1 7/10 and #2 6/10.   The multiplayer element of the sequel adds alot to the game and could provide tons of good competition and strategy.  I can dig it!  GET Sanctum 2 ON SALE PRICE IS HIGH			"

It gets a bit challenging later on as more advanced units are thrown at you but if you can figure out a decent strategy it's quite rewarding to crush your enemies, see them driven before your towers and hear the lamentation of their slowly charring fleshpods. Or something like that.Pick it up in a sale and it's a real steal, but I'd say it's probably worth the asking price. Not a bad addition to your tower defense collection.			"

												As a fan of tower defence games, i'll start by saying I loved Super Sanctum TD.It has all the usual things you'd expect in a good TD (a level-up system with unlockable towers, special abilities, an endless mode, etc...) and then some. It has a good variety of enemies, and as you progress these enemies start having stronger versions of themselves (and bosses). Plus, the achievements are interesting.Great litte casual game to kill some time on, 8/10.			"

												Actually a surprisingly good, albeit by-the-books, tower defense game based on the Sanctum franchise. The game plays much like an isometric take on Sanctum, which makes laying out your defenses a lot less of a hassle than it was from Sanctum's first person view. The addition of a skill-tree adds some variety and customization. Perfecting a level is not required for progression. Alternatively, you can replay previous levels to gain more perk unlocks if you're having difficulty. Has a fast-forward feature, which is must appreciated in a TD game. Charming, clean-looking, and well-executed pixelart design.Only downside is that the game seems a bit unstable and crash-prone at the moment, but the developers seem to be fairly active in the Steam forum...

												Super Sanctum TD it's an awesome, fun and challenging demake from it's big brothers, Sanctum 1 & 2.Not super lengthy but not too short for a Tower Defense, it's just right and with tons of replayability thanks to the hard and survival modes. It's worth it's low price if you like chiptuney music and pixel graphics mixed with your Tower Defense.I do have to point out things I didn't quite enjoy, first, the bosses, they are just tinted and enlarged versions of the regular sprites and look horrible, second, the unnecessary use of memes and other pop culture references for the achievements, it's super cheesy and cringy.Other than those two things that doens't really affect the gameplay that much, Super Sanctum TD it's a fun game and I would definitely recommend it.

												9/10: Strongly recommend.Super Sanctum TD is probably one of the better uses for £3 that I can think of. Doubly so if you are a fan of the tower defense genre. If you, like me, are rather fond of retro style games then there is really no reason not to try this one out. The mechanics are fairly simple, but conspire to produce a game with a pleasing level of strategic depth. Sanctum fans will be right at home, and players new to the setting will discover the best turrets for the job in short order. I was initially dubious regarding the lack of 'hands-on' management of enemies a la Sanctum 1 & 2, but the special powers available for you to direct and deploy make up for the inability to go down there and fight quite satisfactorily. Campaign length seems fine, though may well prove to be my only real area of concern. That said, difficulty settings, survival mode and achievement hunting should ensure that you leave the game feeling satisfied.An excellent game to pick up for a break, or to play for longer periods, especially when set to survival mode.

												Sorry, but I am one of those players that do not want the game to be so hard to play tht it is not worth playing. This is one of those games. It is so tight with resources that you either do everything right or fail every time. No room at all for anything else. And this is on normal game difficultilty mode, I dred to think what hard mode would be like! Add to this the fact that each mission has 10 waves of enemies and if you discover in later waves that you did not do something that was vital, then you will have to redo all of the previous waves for this map again. just to correct you mistake, to win the mission. For example, one of the early missions starts air enemies on around wave 4, if you do not plan for this and build anti air prior to this, you will have to do the early waves again, including building anti air in preparation of what is to come. If you are a fan of patheticly hard games, enjoy, if you don't mind redoing maps while you advance your abilities, enjoy!!! Another dislike is if just one boss gets through then it is game over.What is with the bug that decides that none of your weapons will do any damage to anything.I doubt I will play this game much!

												Super Sanctum TD is a low budget Sanctum series spin-off that lets you play a “retro” style 2D tower defense game instead of the usual Sanctum mix of tactical tower defense and engaging first-person shooting. If you’ve played either of the full-fledged Sanctum titles, you’ll immediately be familiar with the towers, the enemies, setting and soundtrack. However, Coffee Stain Studios may have pushed the “retro” thing too far. While the graphics and the soundtrack are pleasing, there’s no widescreen support and the sound effects are not only atrocious, but after a while they get pretty irritating. There’s really no reason for this game to be this low budget.The game plays like a typical 2D tower defense game with a few twists. There’s a decent number of towers although less than in the main series. The usual staples are here: gatling gun, laser towers, etc. You even get the slow and amp fields from the original Sanctum which for some reason didn’t appear in last year’s sequel. The aliens are back as well and there’s less of them as well. They range from big brutes, fast chargers, annoying flying ones and big bosses. The objective is to build mazes and place your towers in a way that’s most efficient in destroying as much aliens as quickly as possible before they get to the core.Keeping in line with the hands on approach from the main series, you also have a number of skills at your disposal which you can use during the alien onslaught. For example, you can set up mines, freeze a group of aliens, make them hover in the air for a limited amount of time, strike them with lightning, send them backwards for a bit and so on. All of these skills have varying cooldowns so you need to use them at the most opportune time.There’s not much content here. The single-player campaign spans 15 missions that you’ll be able to finish in under 10 hours on the normal setting. After that you can play each level on hard or in survival, but as far as game modes go, that’s about it. This is a low budget spin-off that never pretends to be anything else which is reflected in its price as well. The full price is only 3,99 euros, but it’s not unusual to see it slashed by 90%. And if you sell the trading cards, it’s likely that you’ll break even.In the end, Super Sanctum TD is a solid tower defense game that’s worth playing as it manages to deliver that tactical and addictive experience that such games aspire to offer. And even though it’s too low budget and extremely light on content, at that price you really can’t go wrong with this one.6 OUT OF 10 (ALRIGHT)			"

												TL;DR: This is a very simple, casual version of Sanctum without coop mode and without the 3D visuals.  The level of dificulty will scare some away almost immediately, but tower defense veterans may enjoy some of the subtle gameplay mechanics which allow for deep strategic thought.  The problem is this is not like other Sanctum games.Rest of the review:Sanctum was great, and I loved Sanctum 2.  I didn't get the Super Sanctum spin-off game until the 2014 winter sale, because I wasn't really fond enough of the 2D graphical style to part with much money for the game.  Well, the game finally dropped to an absurdly low price, so I took the bait and began playing.The first thing I noticed was that the combat was almost entirely about the towers and wall placement.  This is not Sanctum-like.  I was expecting a player character, but I got instead a god-like view with generic tower defense fare.  I was disappointed but did not let that sway me from giving the game a fair try.The tower options were very bare to begin with, but after a few completed levels, I unlocked a lot of towers.  You start with the gatling gun tower and eventually unlock more towers as you beat levels.  You can go back and replay levels using your new towers and new abilities in survival mode.The abilities are the closest thing you can get to player interaction with the game world, but I found that the best abilities were the ones you didn't actually get to use manually.  For example, you could have abilities which add to tower strength for a limited time when used, but you're better off unlocking the abilities which enhance towers indefinitely.  None of the upgrades are ever permanent, so there's little reason to replay the game from the beginning, but achievement hunters will enjoy the grind, I guess.The story is non-existent.Overall, I liked the game in a casual time-wasting way, but I cannot recommend it unless you're looking for something extremely simple, something intended for the most casual of gamers.  Considering the game's intended audience was Sanctum players, I doubt many will be satisfied with this game's more generic approach to tower defense.			"

												Things that i noticed, besides what other well put negative reviews already said:Individual negative points are not that bad, but they are multiplicative for me.-The game feels and looks like a poorly made mobile-to-pc port.-Althrough it is better than most generic tower defenses.-The difficulty spike is insane, every map requires a very specific way to play.-I sense what i call ""The Flappy Bird Effect"".-Sanctum franchise but plays like an active tower defense flash game.EDIT 1:-They didn't playtested enough.-Some maps have overlapping/obstructing GraphicalUserInterface. (example from the last map i played: Snakes, on the leftmost i can't see enemy health because the GUI showing towers obstruct vision. And on the bottom i cannot see how many enemies are coming because the bottom-left GUI is in front of the ""next wave"" GUI.)-I pressed ALT+ENTER to go to fullscreen and see if i can scale the game and solve it, NOPE, the GUI scaled with the game, AND THE WAVE STARTED, pressing alt+enter to toggle fullscreen starts the next wave.-ANTI AIR HAS VIOLATOR SOUND, AND IT SPAMS WHEN ATTACKING. (had to mute the game in order to play, causing my next negative point)-The game i dead silent between map and menu, victory music is considered a sound effect and it is muted if sound option is set to 0.-Not really that many options available on the options menu.Oh thank you for 1 thumbs down and 1 ""found this funny"". /sarcasmOnly an idiot would notice this and defend as a good game design.

												By far, without a semblance of a competition, the worst TD game I have ever played. I don't even know where to start.The graphics are bad. I usually don't care about low-quality-graphics, as long as they are charming or nice. These, however, are just terrible and boring.Gameplay is incredibly boring. I have played dozens of free Flash TDs that had more of every imaginable feature. More diverse skills, more diverse towers, more diverse enemies, diversity in map design (wich is another thing this game lacks completely).Targetting is awful. I haven't figured it out yet, but the towers attack neither the enemy closest to the core nor the one with the most or least health. Perhaps it's fully random.On top of all, not even the slightest attempt at trying to tell a story.Also, sound is nothing to brag about either.Ah, and it crashed 4 times in the hour or so I played.All in all, with somewhat of a stretch, it might be a 3/10. If I had found this game on ArcadeGames or something, I would not have been this disappointed, but as a payed game, on Steam? It is disrespectful to players and fans really.			"

												This is one of the best TD games out there, boasting an expansive campaign which turns into an even harder slogfest once you've pushed through it once. (Each map has 10 campaign rounds, and up to 100 survival rounds)The game maintains a great sense of progress, as you unlock additional towers and abilities as you play through. Failed attempts still see you progress towards new unlocks, and at no point does the game feel like you're walking without traction.For the small asking price it's incredibly worth it.			"

												I got this for cheap because I saw the sale. I think it would have been worth the full price though. It's a simple but fun tower defense with old style graphics. They kind of remind me of old rts games like Command and Conquer.I have no complaints its fun and challanging. The only thing I would say is annoying is that the game is fullscreen and you can't change that. Kind makes it feel like an old ported game that they didn't update. Otherwise if you're a TD fanatic don't miss this one.			"

												A tower defense game is all about control. Knowing and guiding what's going on. Using your analytical skills to overcome chaos. Outthinking a superior enemy and defeating it in spite of its superior numbers.And what's the #1 thing you need in order to analyze? INFORMATION.Where are the tooltips? I got a new tower, but when I started the next fight, I didn't remember exactly how it worked. I just had to plant it and see what happened. That is the opposite of fun.It begs me to open the encyclopedia so I can see info on the enemies, but the special attributes are not explained. ""Squishy"", eh? What is that? I guess it makes them die more quickly, but if you're not going to tell me how to take advantage of their squishiness, why not just give them fewer hit points? Thanks for wasting my time.After I finished a level, a picture of something and a name came on the screen. What is that- an achievement I unlocked? A skill? Where do I find out about it?And on and on. There's a difference between challenging and frustrating. This one was the latter. Maybe if I'd played it more, it would have gotten better...but why? I can go play better TD games on Kongregate for free, and most of them are fun and informative right from the first level. I think I only paid like a dollar for this game, but I still want my money back.			"

												A tower defense game where you are allowed to set your own path for the enemies to walk as you set your own traps and defenses along the way. I will let you know right now that you should not play this game if you're not trying to play an intensely hardcore difficult tower defense game. You will try set after set of possible configurations of pathways and towers just to beat a simple level on normal difficulty once you make it halfway through the game. They will send far too many enemies and some of the strongest enemies in the game right at the start of the level with very limited resources in a way that borders on unfair. Also, don't expect much help from the community as there is few to no guides to help you if you get stuck. I'm all for difficult games but this is a tower defense game that seems built specifically for the player to fail, so I cannot recommend unless you enjoy torturing yourself.6/10With all the tower defense games out there I cannot recommend this one unless you get it on the cheap.

												My feelings are very split on Super Sanctum TD. This is a true 100% turret defense game unlike its bigger TD/FPS hybrid siblings, which is mostly why I found myself addicted to it. However, it bears a number of the annoying signature characteristics found in the Sanctum series. And by that I mean the player is tasked with building the foundations for the turrets, and using these same foundations to shape a maze like path for enemies to corral. That on its own is fine, but the problem lies with being able to build an entire maze before the game starts and only having enough cash for 2 or 3 turrets that can't manage the first wave. This is the only turret defense game I've ever played where its not mostly passive building strategy, the player has to be very active between targeting and zapping enemies with manual weapons and sometimes even tear down and rebuild turrets further down range as the wave is still running. The other really annoying Sanctum characteristic in this game are the turrets themselves. Some of the turrets are junk. Their purpose is to be abondoned and never used again as soon as something better become available. The turrets are also unbalanced in that a number of them aren't worth leveling up since its not cost efficient nor as effective vs building more weak towers. I'm not quite sure they did things this wayAlso typical of the Sanctum series, SSTD is severely limiting. Out of the dozen or so turrets you can build, you're restricted to the 4 you choose on any map. I assume Coffee Stain Studios feels this adds to the game's strategy, but it doesn't. You can't exactly plan ahead for what you're going to need, so picking and choosing turrets tends to become trial and error. And speaking of bad strategy, the later levels force the player to pick specific perks. Of course I'm talking about the perk that has a chance of turning dead enemies into cash. Its not completely vital a perk to have, but oh boy does it sure help.In spite of everything I've said so far, Super Sanctum TD is an OK turret defense. Its no Defense Grid, nor is it meant to be. And for what it is, it's pretty damn fun. The other reason I'm giving it a positive review is the cheap price. On sale, you can buy it for spare change.			"

												This is one of the worst TD game I have ever played! But thankfully I didn't pay much for it! It's the same enemies from the Sanctum series (ofc, they couldn't create anything new).Anyway, I stopped the game at level 3. When you have to use your support powers all the time to survive, because your towers sucks, then Its a bad TD!  I tried several soulutions (and I even leveled a lot), but level 3 was just.. Defeated.. Boring! Im not gonna use my time on a game where I have to try level 3/50? at least 6 times or more to complete it, and this is just the beginning. The gameplay is too hard, they could at least add easier difficulty.This could have been a much better game! I played a lot of TDs in my past and these had their difficulties too, but they also had something we call ""balancing"". SanctumTD is not balanced! Therefor not fun to play.			"

												Super Sanctum TD is a competently-designed, retro-flavored tower defense game that takes few risks and offers an appropriate degree of Fun. An endless horde of horrible space monstroids is pouring out of a weird invasion portal cabbage and it's up to you to place a variety of defensive turrets in the way to stop 'em! Along with your chain guns and flamethrowers and gauss rifles, you also have access to a variety of special abilities you can activate to blast those determined jerkfaces who manage to scrape their way past your gauntlet. As you play, you earn experience, unlocking new turrets and abilities. Level layout and wave composition are well-balanced, keeping up the challenge and often requiring multiple level attempts to achieve any sort of victory. And when all is said and done, you can go back for further challenges by attempting earlier levels on Hard Mode or Survival Mode.Unfortunately, this game comes from the same people who made Sanctum, which was a delightfully innovative tower defense / FPS hybrid. Dropping all the innovative aspects of the game just makes this seems like an attempt at cashing in on the franchise's name, which, y'know, isn't terribly exciting to the fans; the lore was never terribly compelling to begin with, and this entry contributes nothing new on that front. If you're an avid tower defense enthusiast, sure, the game isn't bad, but you'd be better off playing the other games in the series or trying out a more polished, well-developed tower defense game like Sol Survivor.

												A good ol' Tower Defense. Plenty of fun for little money (got it for free alongside Sanctum 2 :P)As the difficulty slowly rises, you're forced to change your defense tactics because you will eventually fail a level once or twice before you get it right.The game is no longer supported and crashed on me during very long Survival runs. Campaign worked perfectly well, however.			"

												+ classic, basic tower defense game+ based on Sanctum-mitology, same enemies- very linear, no grinding possible- lacks any FPS style from the other Sanctum games, you only have towers and some recharging powers- there is no detailed description about enemies and guns, hard to predict damage, outcome of levels- a bit clumsy interface, without an option to rebind keysIn overall: it is a very simple tower defense game, without anything outstanding, for me, it is only good for a few hours of entertainment.

												Basically identical to various TD flash games you can find on the web. Except it crashes a lot and the cursor freezes (but the game doesn't). Released in an even worse state apparently.Stupid unlockables system that makes you replay levels until you grind enough cumulative XP to beat them. So it's yet another game where they decided to put in a levelling system in lieu of the player having to increase their personal abilities.No idea how they can screw up a simple 2D game like this.

												I've been playing Tower Defence games for a long time. Be it through web browser, old SC/WC3 or SC2 now, steam, and phone/tablet applications, I always seem to gravitate back to TDs. That being said, this is one of the first that failed to hold my interest. There are no major issues that stand out, just little things that go against normal TD practices (not in a good way), and hiccups that were solved over 10 years ago in WC3 customs. The aiming priority seems strange, the health scaling isn't linear, and there isn't enough of a heads up for upcoming levels if they'll be specifically air, ground or a mixture (requiring you to play a level multiple times just to know what's coming). Yes it was only .39, so in my eyes it was just an investment for the trading cards.			"

There's not much to say about it, you can see the graphics in the pictures and the gameplay is pretty much just a basic TD game, if you like TD games you'll like this one. My only real complaint is that when you try to select things at the edges of the screen the view moves, it'd be nice if you could change it so that you have to right click and move the mouse to move the view or maybe a button on the keyboard.

												I'll admit the only reason I have this is because I got it for free in a giveaway... but this really is bottom of the barrel as far as TDs go. I'm not going to waste more time with this review than the developers did on the game... but I've played sh!t in flash on websites(5+ years ago) for free that was comparable to this, if not more entertaining(Canyon Defense comes to mind). I'm starting to miss the days when flash games like this were free. Now they're sold on Steam for actual money, and for some reason, people are willing to pay for them. Granted I did get this for free, but most people will have to pay for theirs.If you want a TD, do yourself a favor and go get Plants vs Zombies or Defense Grid instead. If you're going to spend money on a TD, get one that's actually good. Could have gotten Plants vs Zombies for 5$ off a sale or in a humble bundle. I think I paid <10$ for Defense Grid with all DLC. Don't waste your time with this crap.			"

Upgrade towers too much, not enough cash for more towers, buy too many towers, no cash for upgrading towers to make them more powerful.

												On first glance, Super Sanctum TD seems like a very nice addition to the genre, but beware as the game is unbelievably hard even at normal difficulty forcing you to grind the same levels over and over until you get enough points to unlock new abilities/equipment. I'm not new to the TD genre but this game simply doesn't have mercy on its players; you have to optimize your maze layout to perfection and be very careful of selecting which towers to employ or there's no way you'll progress far beyond the training area. The 16-bit graphics look nice and serve their purpose, but the sound design is weak and rudimentary.Generally speaking, the game is way too hard and demands a far bigger commitment than I'm willing to make for what is basically a 2D flash TD game. Could've been much better if the devs weren't so hard-core. But I guess even the TD genre has to have its masochistic version of IWBTG.Score: 3/5			"

												This game is terrible by knows means is this anything like sanctum 2.... Or 1 This is the premise of the game you put down blocks  you have unlimited blocks but only this time you have to putthem in select places only unlike sanctum 1 or 2 in those as long the space isnt being taken by and object and doesnt stop them from making to the end of the level its ok...The movement of enemies is extremely slow slower than in any other sanctum there is a fast forward button but even sped upthere extremely slow... There is no interaction you place the blocks and weapons on the blocks and watch for 3 or 4 minutesas the enemies slowly come...  You know you will win you just have to wait every round until you get to the finally round..39 cents is not cheap enough for this game  this game should be 1 cent or deleted from the steam market..

												A terrible ""tower defense"" game. Towers are EXTREMELY weak, incredibly expensive and incredibly expensive to upgrade. This is a classic style 2D tower defense game. Towers should NEVER be expensive to buy and upgrade. It's the whole POINT of the game. Being limited to 4 towers at once is terrible and makes for bad strategy and tower set up. Oh, map has flyers? (Which it doesn't tell you!) You're stuck with THREE towers now because flyers come sparsely. Due to the expensive, underpowered towers it is actually INCREDIBLY difficult to successfully defend your core from being attacked.The powers are a terrible addition. They're weak and underpowered, even worse is you need a small ""minigame"" to get the correct amount of power out of them AND the little cursor doesn't accurately TELL you the actual range of the power.Over-all an incredibly bad TD game that was released between Sanctum 1 and Sanctum 2 to tie the games together.Save your money and buy something like Sol Survivor or Defense Grid: Awakening.

												I've always been a fan of the Sanctum series (Playing through both games and then some) but TBH, this game is a waste of your time. I realize that it is just a side game/spinnoff/parody, but really, $3..99 for basically a flash game. The game play is decent and not bad by any means, but you could be playing better TD games (*the actual sanctum series*) then playing this. Sadly, this gets a 4/10			"

												The kind of tower defence that challenges you to be diverse in tower building while allowing you a huge degree of gameplay freedom. Numerous times I had failed but I was happy to come back the next day and attempt to accomplish what I thought to be impossible. With each failure comes a gift that enabled me to try out a new combination within my defensive strategies. There were even some levels where I had to completely exchange everything I chose. Each level had its own unique challenge that forced me to be more creative. Super Sanctum TD is like finely cut gem that shines without falter.			"

												I'm like 50 50 on whether or not I should recommend this game...It's relatively cheap, especially if you visit this review while the game's on sale, and it's well worth that price!  A simple game to play while you wait for a train, your next class, lunch break(?), in a five minute to 30 minute gap of doing nothing, etc.HOWEVER, it's not as fun as you advance in the waves.  Whenever you complete one mission/area, you have the option of continuing into survival mode. In these cases, you'll either instantly die or find a point where you've maxed everything out, but the enemy will ultimately obliterate your defenses without effort.  If you always want to win, tough luck, this game will make sure that you're destined to lose at one point or another.  Also, there will be times when you're forced to place certain structures up, in order to win, taking away your freedom of choice and flexibility in the gameplay.  Still... I guess this game isn't for people who want to try hard to the max, but more of a time waster for periods of waiting and thinking.  Might as well get it if you can't be asked/fked to find a book to read instead.Note: This game does come with steam trading cards, which will help pay off the final price of this game.  Also it's literally a five second download.			"

												This is a classical tower-defence game available for reasonal price. It's not some random ""kill the runnning bugs"" stuff you can find on free gamesites thousands of thousands times. This lets YOU to build the concretes which turrets are built on. It changes routes of monsters to make the level your kind, to suit your tastes. Also, it's not some easy ""i'll just put this and slap that"" thoughtless building. The game is actually enough challenging to make the player think their choices. Also, the turret types, abilities and money are limited. New turret types, abilities, slots and stages are unlocked as you level up. Graphics won't need to be the usual 3D HQ for modern games you can fing behind every corner. It's old school gameplay and idea are the only things that matter and makes this therefore better than many other games you might pay over 10 euros for. If arcade games are even a little bit your thing, I'll warmly recommend this. Low price makes it easy to buy and test out. And how about myself? I ended up spending hours on this, and what's the best, Super Sanctum TD takes more than just few hours to play through completely.			"

Since I bought it for around 50 cents, you could say I went to the arcade and brought back one of those retro arcade games with me. That being said, it does offer a variety and abundance of gameplay you would expect from modern games and other Sanctum games. Do get it if you enjoy a challenge.			"

												Quite a short and very basic game, you get 4 towers and 4 spells then you place them on certain slots once you have designed your path and then you can upgrade them 3 times if you want, and you can double the speed of the units your are fighting, the downside to this game is that there are only 10 maps, 2 difficultys and enemies are pretty boring and the gameplay just gets repettive but still fun for a while, game roughly takes 3-4 hours to complete, more if you want all the achievements. otherwise each stage takes 5-20mins depending on the speed you play at. Also why doesnt this game go to 1920 x 1080 resoultion playing windowed on such a tiny screen is annyoing and the game crashs quite a bit. Possibly meant for Ipad not PC?			"

												I haven't put much time into defense grid the awakening yet to see if i start liking it more but this is the best tower defense by far i've played. I saw one person not recommending this because of not being able to beat a level. Maybe its one of the levels i'm stuck at on hard but didn't have too much trouble on normal. That's what you want from hard mode. The survival mode alone is worth the price. Havent messed around with defense grid enough to see if it has survival but i like the controller support. Where's Super sanctum TD 2 with some next gen 2d graphics is what i want to know. I didn't think much of the fps sanctums. Orcs must die has that crown. I'll probably grab OMD some time if it has a survival ranked global leader board like this does and most games should have. Super sanctum TD is a well pollished tower defense that every tower defense fan should own. It has that one more go feel i dont really get from others tower defense games. Maybe DGTA will give me it if i put more time in.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine When a good company like Coffee Stain Studios, creates a first person tower defense game called Sanctum then the sequel Sanctum 2, now we get a 2D top down tower defense game called Super Sanctum TD, an adorable little indie game that puts you back to the days of 2D tower defense games. This is truly a work of art! Well done Coffee Stain Studios, and it costs just a little as buying a cheeseburger from McDonalds! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Well, I purchased this game earlier this week for 30p and honestly, I can say its one of the best 30p purchase's I've ever made, the only others being game purchase's from second hand stores where they didn't know what they where selling.  The game is a retrovised version of the game 'Sanctum' that plays much like an older tower defence game, keeping a fixed top down view through out. You are given a selection of boards to play on for the various missions and unlock new towers and powers as you go, between each wave you're given build time which also acts as time where you're able to plot out the pathway on the boards, though the earlier levels are very linear.  The game has a good selection of towers and powers that can catter to varying play styles, though using the shock tower pretty much gaurantee's a win on levels which only use ground targets, making the later game somewhat dissapointingly easy compared to how it should feel.  Once the game is completed, you can tackle the levels on hard if you hadn't already done so, or try survival and see how long you can last for against wave after wave on enemies.  The soundtrack and audio is quite simple and enjoyable, nothing majorly memorable but pleasent non the less.  For a 30p purchase, I would say to buy this game even if you're not that much of a tower defence game fan, its only 30p after all, you wont even notice the change is gone and I've managed to sink about 9 hours into it thus far. At full price, I would say to only buy if you enjoy retro tower defence games, though it may feel a bit short at full price.			"

												This is a mad old-school Tower Defense game. There is a little bit in the way of player persistence and progression with upgrades, towers, and abilities to unlock over time, but the core gameplay is about as traditional as a TD game can get. Very little depth, but it's executed fairly well and makes for a decent little piece of entertainment for a few hours.There are some minor audio and graphics oddities here and there, but at $0.60, it's hard to really complain about this game.

I like that a lot better than other TD games that are too easy and you pretty much just set it up and watch the waves of enemies. This game has a nice balance of ""Holy s*** I am always about to lose!"" It keeps you on your toes. I like that the upgrade system extends far into the gameplay so that you have a lot to keep you motivated for future levels.For anyone complaining that it is too hard, they just need to level up by playing survival mode on the easier levels.

Given that the spec requirements for this game are so low I guess it's a problem in the programming and not my computer. Aside from these performance issues it is a great game.			"

												Supper Sanctum TD is a game made by Infinity Ward, and published by EA. Both companies agree in taking their time into the game, which is good. You run a resturant in uptown Bethesda, and you have to keep you customers happy. However, there are cows that are don't want to be eaten, and they escape. So your goal is to chase those cows. First thing I want to get off my chest, is that this game is very unrealistic. You can call airstrikes on these cows, and they will survive. Also, a tower uses electric sticks, and the electricity can go to the cow about 10 feet away. The most an electric bolt can go is 6 feet. Also, the cows have utters on the back, and not on the bottom. As a result, it looks like they have jelly mohawks. Finally, you kill the cows, they disappear. If they disappear, what's the point? You don't get the meat! Finally, the graphics are TURRIBLE. The games graphics are JUST PIXELS. It looks like an Atari 2600 game. All of this result in an unrealistic experience.If you can look over the unrealism, then this is one of the best tower defence games out there. You have a creative variety of 3 towers, Telsa, Electric Beam, and Bases. Bases are extremely important, as you need one in order to put the towers on. There are also skills, like the cardboard cut-out storm. Overall, the mechanics are excellent.The DLC is also cool. For $1.99, you can get the cow pack, which turns the enemy into cows. You can also get the ending pack for $4.99, which unlocks a 2-minute cutscene showing the ending.If you can look over the unrealism, this is just cocaine. However, I just can't play this game right. It just doesn't feel like cocaine because of it's unrealism. It feels more like cheap weed.Overall, this gets a 3/11*To be serious for a second, this is actually a good game. I personally enjoyed it, and this is a steal for .60. Get it.			"

												Super Sanctum TD is a short and sweet, simple flash-TD equivalent. I got this on sale for under $1, and it delivered everything that it promised.Tower balance is reasonable, though obviously positioning them properly is always crucial. The in-game skills/unlocks present several different ways to tackle most levels, be it ability-heavy or tower-heavy. I rather liked the 100% sell value unlock, as then I could move max upgraded towers around to kite slow moving bosses, or explore strategies like powering up one lightning tower until it 1-shots everything. The game has just enough cheese in its strategies to keep you amused, as you plow through all 14 levels.The achievements have good diversity - you'll unlock most of them just by playing. 1 or 2 are puzzle achievements, that require you to think about how to structure your maze and how to use tower synergies to unlock them. If you go for them, they force you to understand the game mechanics a little bit more, making you a better player.The normal and hardmode achievements are well thought out (play every level on hard and win; play every level on normal and don't lose health) - easy for any TD veteran to accomplish.There is one grindy achievement - kill 10,000 walkers - I groaned when I finished the game with only ~2700 of them defeated, as I thought it was going to take forever to get. It's actually not that bad... one playthrough of lvl 3 on survival with chargers and splash towers (like ACPs; take your pick) will get you most of the way there.Overall it was quite fun. I didn't notice any severe engine glitches that didn't work in my favour, but there were a few minor ones. Comboing time-rewind and teleport abilities has some odd/ineffective effects... Saving/loading is bugged, messing up tower stats and sell values, so be careful resuming a previous match. The game is also very likely to crash if you spam hundreds of mines at the end of your maze. I did have two crashes early on that were unrelated to cheese, but they happened on the first levels, which take only minutes to get through.Overall this TD feels like a 7/10 or 7.5/10. Priced right, with just enough polish and cheese. I enjoyed it.-BikeHelmet			"

Not sure if the other reviews are pre-2014 patch or something, what I do know is that the gameplay is terrible.  *spoiler* The majority of the levels are simply spam level 1 lighting towers with the odd anti-air tower.  Many levels that's the only strategy that works. */spoiler*  The spells are interesting but I found I used the same 4 over and over again simply due to their low timer/high damage output.

												Fun and Entertaining. 59cents well spent. Although, EVERY time I play survival it crashes on me, wether on round 25 or 50, it will eventually happen. I've never completed a survival match without crashing. Pretty Lame. Now I've come to a level, where I'm pretty sure it's impossible to beat, and you HAVE to rearrange every tile each round in order to survive, very time consuming, very annoying. That aside. It's a fun game that will keep you entertained for a couple of hours, so why not spend 59 cents and have some fun like the good old arcade days.			"

												Super Sanctum TD is a short and sweet, simple flash-TD equivalent. I got this on sale for under $1, and it delivered everything that it promised.Tower balance is reasonable, though obviously positioning them properly is always crucial. The in-game skills/unlocks present several different ways to tackle most levels, be it ability-heavy or tower-heavy. I rather liked the 100% sell value unlock, as then I could move max upgraded towers around to kite slow moving bosses, or explore strategies like powering up one lightning tower until it 1-shots everything. The game has just enough cheese in its strategies to keep you amused, as you plow through all 14 levels.The achievements have good diversity - you'll unlock most of them just by playing. 1 or 2 are puzzle achievements, that require you to think about how to structure your maze and how to use tower synergies to unlock them. If you go for them, they force you to understand the game mechanics a little bit more, making you a better player.The normal and hardmode achievements are well thought out (play every level on hard and win; play every level on normal and don't lose health) - easy for any TD veteran to accomplish.There is one grindy achievement - kill 10,000 walkers - I groaned when I finished the game with only ~2700 of them defeated, as I thought it was going to take forever to get. It's actually not that bad... one playthrough of lvl 3 on survival with chargers and splash towers (like ACPs; take your pick) will get you most of the way there.Overall it was quite fun. I didn't notice any severe engine glitches that didn't work in my favour, but there were a few minor ones. Comboing time-rewind and teleport abilities has some odd/ineffective effects... Saving/loading is bugged, messing up tower stats and sell values, so be careful resuming a previous match. The game is also very likely to crash if you spam hundreds of mines at the end of your maze. I did have two crashes early on that were unrelated to cheese, but they happened on the first levels, which take only minutes to get through.Overall this TD feels like a 7/10 or 7.5/10. Priced right, with just enough polish and cheese. I enjoyed it.-BikeHelmet			"

												A classic Tower Defense ambiented in the Sanctum universe. You got almost the same kind of towers, but you got no hero in the middle of the map, though, you have some superpowers with cooldown (bombs, power-ups etc). You have a profile with level and new habilities to unlock.Very fine game, hard at the beginning but when you learn to combo the towers you can get almost stars on every map.Some nice users posted guides on Steam Community to help us get through the final levels and get all achievements. Only one achievement can be boring to get (The Golden Walker), because it depends on a random chance. "

 Forget it, developers don't give a ♥♥♥♥. Reading the forum and the bad reviews, people complain about ""crashing"" since last year... By the way, if developers fix the crash problem, this will be the review:It's a great casual game to have a enjoyable time. Why? Fight on your terms: build structures trying to make a longer way and create good tactical point to put your weapons (it will depend of the weapon range). Basic Tower Defense system: Upgrade system (weapons and level up), unlockable weapon system and assist weapons. Competitive system: How many waves can you support until die?. [*ChallengeAccepted*] Casual system: it's ok if you give a ♥♥♥♥ about competitive. [:YaoMingFace:] Music: retro, Sanctum 1 and 2 music. If you don't like, you can play your awful music. Graphics: the trailer is not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. 8-bits confirmed. Cheap: 0.46 dollars in Mexico (check steamdb.info for the real place on your country) with 3 steam cards (0.15-0.25 dollars). "

I've never completed a survival match without crashing. Pretty Lame. Now I've come to a level, where I'm pretty sure it's impossible to beat, and you HAVE to rearrange every tile each round in order to survive, very time consuming, very annoying. That aside. It's a fun game that will keep you entertained for a couple of hours, so why not spend 59 cents and have some fun like the good old arcade days.			"

												The design and idea of the game is great, and if memory serves, the price is low too. On top of that, the game isn't poorly designed, it'll challenge you, and make the meager 14 levels stretch out and turn more into a series of puzzles, than a short game. Despite all this, I just didn't enjoy it. There's too many positives not to recommend it to other people, but personally it turned into a chore to finish due to the difficulty.			"

 Review  Let's Play Ratings-Overall: 6Gameplay: 6Addictiveness: 7Play Time: 6Graphics: 4Audio: 4Music: 7Super Sanctum TD is just like any other tower defense. The only distinguishable feature is the art and how they handle the upgrades and activated skills. As far as upgrading and customization goes, Super Sanctum has it in the bag. A talent tree that changes gameplay, and custom setup of the towers and activated abilities you are taking with you combine for a really unique and almost rpg experience. Definitely recommend, but I would wait for a sale.			"

												This game is addicting.  It's nothing especially fancy but it's loads of fun!  8.5/10Pros:Great TD format with a very open ended setup for lots of strategic options.Variety of enemies to account for and lots of calculations to make for how to dispatch everything at once.Survival mode that keeps you coming back for more.Cons:You can only select an arsenal of 4 different tower types per stage.Your level caps at 30 for some reason.  I was really hoping to see it go higher.Most towers I could find very little use for.  (HINT:  your flamers pretty much beat everything)It may have been patched by now, but I found some towers, in large numbers, would make the game crash.			"

												A classic Tower Defense ambiented in the Sanctum universe. You got almost the same kind of towers, but you got no hero in the middle of the map, though, you have some superpowers with cooldown (bombs, power-ups etc). You have a profile with level and new habilities to unlock.Very fine game, hard at the beginning but when you learn to combo the towers you can get almost stars on every map.Some nice users posted guides on Steam Community to help us get through the final levels and get all achievements. Only one achievement can be boring to get (The Golden Walker), because it depends on a random chance. "

												An excellent little tower defense game that would serve as a good introduction to the genre to those unfamiliar with it.What it does exceptionally well is mazing- adding a feature where you place foundations for the towers before the towers themselves, thus allowing you to build a maze without committing towers.  Also predicts the path(s) that the creeps will travel along (although not always correctly).Another positive: powers.  There are many of them and (when fully leveled) you get to pick 4 of them.Enjoyable retro soundtrack and lovely pixel art.One small technical note: there does not need to be a toggle for survival mode as one can simply enter it after playing through identical campaign levels.  I once accidentally played through 9 levels of survival while trying to up my star rating on a level.  This was annoying and unnecessary.No plot except what you bring to it.  Sort of a Catcher in The Rye kind of thing; the monsters exist so that you can stop them instead of the cliff existing so that you can save the lives of small baseball players.Finally, since no review of a tower defense game would be complete without a comparison to Defense Grid: this game is unlikely to make you realize that sometimes the portion of our lives that we are not simply an intelligence ported into a computer for tactical reasons and that we must take time every day to enjoy whatever berries may be in season.In my opinion: worth about $2.99.

												Fun game for not much money, especially when it's on sale. Very simple graphics, but they are servicable.The only negative (and it may be because I don't understand the interface), is that there appears to no way to get back to the beginning of a level, after the point where you have laid out your starting maze layout. When starting a level, you place platforms, that serve to redirect the waves of enemies. Then you build towers on these platforms. If I mess up a level (which for me happens fairly often), I get tired of always having put the platforms down again, as there can be a lot of them. Otherwise it's a fun game.			"

												A very decent and at times very challenging Tower Defense game. If you're a fan of the Sanctum series and want something that is a little more single-player focussed, this is an interesting take.However, I have played flash games on Newgrounds with more content than this. Only buy if it's on sale.			"

												Fun game. Nice pixel art. Enjoyed the retro soundtrack. The gameplay is similar to that of tower defense flash games. In this game, you build your own maze. Some levels can be challenging but not impossible. Personally, I enjoyed this game more than I did Sanctum 2.Note: Some acheivements are buggy.			"

												Firstly, this is prone to crashing.That aside, it's so full of charm I can forgive it that. I actually think this is one of the best tower defense games I've ever played, not that I've played that many, but I share like this one. The music is very catchy, the graphics are pixel based, which is a plus for me as I love that style.I actually prefer this over something like Defense Grid Gold, especially being able to have the game on pause before you design your set-up, then release hell!A wonderful little gem of a game.

												Fun game for not much money, especially when it's on sale. Very simple graphics, but they are servicable.The only negative (and it may be because I don't understand the interface), is that there appears to no way to get back to the beginning of a level, after the point where you have laid out your starting maze layout. When starting a level, you place platforms, that serve to redirect the waves of enemies. Then you build towers on these platforms. If I mess up a level (which for me happens fairly often), I get tired of always having put the platforms down again, as there can be a lot of them. Otherwise it's a fun game.			"

												Super Sanctum TD is a tower defense game, and it is quite possibly one of the best FPSTD-to-TD conversions of this generation.  It is a masterpiece; it feels like you are playing a flash tower defense game, but good, and not in flash. It is far better than an extra gun skin for Sanctum 2. It is an experience you will come out of saying ""Wow!"", and suddenly you lost an hour, but it was worth it. It is so good, even if it were more expensive, that I wanted to share it, so I debated buying four copies until I realised I didn't have that many friends. All-in-all, it is an experience that will draw you back constantly, even to just play for 15 minutes at a time.			"

 Review  Let's Play Ratings-Overall: 6Gameplay: 6Addictiveness: 7Play Time: 6Graphics: 4Audio: 4Music: 7Super Sanctum TD is just like any other tower defense. The only distinguishable feature is the art and how they handle the upgrades and activated skills. As far as upgrading and customization goes, Super Sanctum has it in the bag. A talent tree that changes gameplay, and custom setup of the towers and activated abilities you are taking with you combine for a really unique and almost rpg experience. Definitely recommend, but I would wait for a sale.			"

So I would suggest this for Sanctum fans and tower defense fans! Though you get what you pay for, it isn't a huge game, and has around 15-20 missions.			"

												""Super Sanctum TD"" is a simplistic, top-down tower defense game that stays true to the Sanctum universe.  It's very easy to pick up and play, though the ""fullscreen"" toggle (ALT+ENTER) does not stretch to fit widescreen monitors.  Still, I picked up the game for 59 cents and don't regret it.  If you're bothered by retro-style graphics then this may not be the game for you, otherwise it's an easy recommend for fans of the genre.

												Although the 'big' brothers, Sanctum 1 and 2 are respectable and fine games I must admit that this retro-ish isometric alien-popper is my fav among them. It has a really nice concept as it is addictive as hell and captures the essence of Sanctum without going too deep into features. It feels like as it was great classic computer game from the good old times that was put into a time machine and sent forward here. If you have an eye for '80s and '90s game style that gives you a lot with minimalistic approach, give it a try.			"

												The kind of tower defence that challenges you to be diverse in tower building while allowing you a huge degree of gameplay freedom. Numerous times I had failed but I was happy to come back the next day and attempt to accomplish what I thought to be impossible. With each failure comes a gift that enabled me to try out a new combination within my defensive strategies. There were even some levels where I had to completely exchange everything I chose. Each level had its own unique challenge that forced me to be more creative. Super Sanctum TD is like finely cut gem that shines without falter.			"

												About halfway through with the story mode, and am definitely loving this game. As a huge fan of Sanctum 1, it's awesome to see the maps brought back in a 2D retro setting. What's nice is I already somewhat know how to play most of the maps, but given the different gameplay / towers / abilities, it's a fresh experience. This game is even more challenging than Sanctum 1 was (given in Sanctum 1, the weapons were pretty OP so you didn't need towers as much). Would certainly recommend this game to any Tower Defense and Sanctum fan, even at full price.			"

												Super Sanctum TD (SS TD in short) developed by Coffee Stain Studios, the makers of Sanctum & Sanctum2. Released on the PC platform on  May 9 2013. It has an average user score of 7.3 on MetaCritic (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/super-sanctum-td). This came as a surprise but SS TD was released before Sanctum 2! If the dates are correct on MetaCritic, SS TD was released a week before Sanctum 2 went live on the PC. Who's up for a 2D solo, Tower Defense game set in a sci-fi theme battling hordes of aliens? Did I say that it was also ""cute"" ? No one? T.TSS TD inherits the entire Sanctum lore/concept. It is a solo game however - unlike Sanctum (or Sanctum 2) minus the FPS & heroes. This is just pure Tower Defense..with a little spell@skill casting moment. Any Sanctum player will recognize the art style of the towers/settings/aliens immediately. The most glaring difference is that, its a 2D miniature version of Sanctum. For me, that just looks super cute. That is, until they reach your core and you want to smash them to bits..*ahem* So let's get down to business. Controls: Controls are straight forward. Easy. You can't turn the map. So your focus will be on placement on towers, mazing & casting of skills. The game seems to be designed in a small screen fashion. I guess there's nothing else to see so they've restricted your view. Changing resolution doesn't really help enhance the visuals or Field of View of the game..unless you want to see even tinier aliens. The view was restrictive for me but it didn't hamper the game play experience. Yes, I've build towers and I've lost count which is level 1 or level 2 towers. Especially if you are going for endless wave OR if you are planning to build hordes of slow towers, you are going to face this issue. I wished the devs could have made a more visible indicator on the tower levels. I had to keep check on my towers - so thats micro management for you.Visuals:Like I mentioned earlier, everything looks like Sanctum. The aliens are tiny cute creatures running amok to your core but just because they look cute, it doesn't mean they are harmless. Things can get pretty nasty if you dont plan properly. eg: 70+ over tiny runners heading to your core.Game play:There is no story whatsoever in SS TD. You are straight thrown into the game to learn to build/maze/get to know your towers/aliens immediately. The objective of the game is simple. Protect your core from the aliens. You lose the game once your core has been damaged enough by the aliens. The end.If you defend the core without taking any damage(0 leak) - a perfect defense, then you will be rewarded with 3 stars. What does the star do? For achievement purpose. You are only given a max of 4 tower slot and 4 skill slot. So you have to choose from your collection of tower/skills and learn to build a combo@tactic around them. Planning is always crucial as each Map layout is different and so is the spawn of mobs. As you progress into the game, you gain experience points and you start unlocking higher tier towers/skills. And Yes, there will be bosses. Speed Runners, Flyers and the ones that eats up your towers. They are here. so are the mutators. >:-DMy Personnel Experience:In the early of the game, it seems pretty acceptable and fun to play. Until a certain level where you know you hit the limit and there's just isn't much you can do unless you start investing into other forms of tower/skills. By Mid game you would have realize that all you needed was the lighting tower family. So you ponder was the choice of tower selection a mere illusion? In some way yes. If you wanted an easier time, you'd pick certain towers over the others because it gets the job done better.By end game You've probably figured out which enemy was ""weak"" to which tower and what sort of tactic to deploy. You are probably aiming to get the 10k alien kills now.I am not into leaderboard but I am into achievements. I had a memorable time studying/exploring ways to complete certain maps/achievement. SS TD was fun and challenging however i'd say it lack certain aspect of the game.  The first is that it lack a drive. There is no story or motivation for players to complete the game. At some point, players them self can also lose motivation if they keep failing in at certain maps. getting stucked at some map without any form of aid is a painful experience. The second one is related to engagement. Aside from TD, there is nothing else to do. No mini games, no other game mechanics to keep you occupied when you are tired seeing the aliens. I was hoping that because this is 2d, solo offline TD game, the devs would try to introduce something new - something thats not FPS or co-op which has already been done in sanctum 1 & 2. If I may reference other games; For an example, Final Fantasy 7 on chocobos, Plant vs Zombie: plenty of mini games and zen garden. PvZ offers way more ""gaming experience"" and ""value"". The tower and alien description were very vague. You had to observe the battle to understand which unit takes more damage from X tower at X level or X tower seem to be better against X unit. Other than this, I'd say the game was fun & solid. Once I've beaten the game and obtained my 100% achievement, it is unlikely I will revisit SS TD again but for the highly competitive gamers, they will no doubt invest their time into perfecting their art of defense to get their name up in the legendary board of fame.My Summary:Super Sanctum TD as a whole, is a good solo, offline TD game. It would've been much better if it had an option for skirmish mode/co-op mode to retain its playerbase. A different game mechanic apart from the TD would be a welcome - It's a risky move for a simple 2D game but I seriously hope the devs will incorporate something new in their next solo TD product. So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Super Sanctum TD is a 6/10.			"

												Its a flash TD game on steroids. Not worth more than 50 cents, but its an okay game I guess. It plays based off of an XP system to unlock new towers and abilities, and the levels are purposely made to be pretty much impossible to get a 3/3 star rating on the first time you play, so I guess that adds ""replayability"" if you want to call it that.TL;DR: 3/5 rating, buy it on sale for 50 cents or don't buy at all			"

												Super Sanctum Tower Defense is one of the best 'Tower Defense' games out there in my opinion and competes for the title of best TD even when next to it's first person counter parts sanctum 1 and 2. While the amount of time you get out of it may not be as long as other Tower Defense games, it's price is well worth the investment of your spare change.			"

												I haven't put much time into defense grid the awakening yet to see if i start liking it more but this is the best tower defense by far i've played. I saw one person not recommending this because of not being able to beat a level. Maybe its one of the levels i'm stuck at on hard but didn't have too much trouble on normal. That's what you want from hard mode. The survival mode alone is worth the price. Havent messed around with defense grid enough to see if it has survival but i like the controller support. Where's Super sanctum TD 2 with some next gen 2d graphics is what i want to know. I didn't think much of the fps sanctums. Orcs must die has that crown. I'll probably grab OMD some time if it has a survival ranked global leader board like this does and most games should have. Super sanctum TD is a well pollished tower defense that every tower defense fan should own. It has that one more go feel i dont really get from others tower defense games. Maybe DGTA will give me it if i put more time in.			"

That is, until they reach your core and you want to smash them to bits..*ahem* So let's get down to business. Controls: Controls are straight forward. Easy. You can't turn the map. So your focus will be on placement on towers, mazing & casting of skills. The game seems to be designed in a small screen fashion. I guess there's nothing else to see so they've restricted your view. Changing resolution doesn't really help enhance the visuals or Field of View of the game..unless you want to see even tinier aliens. The view was restrictive for me but it didn't hamper the game play experience. Yes, I've build towers and I've lost count which is level 1 or level 2 towers. Especially if you are going for endless wave OR if you are planning to build hordes of slow towers, you are going to face this issue. I wished the devs could have made a more visible indicator on the tower levels. I had to keep check on my towers - so thats micro management for you.Visuals:Like I mentioned earlier, everything looks like Sanctum. The aliens are tiny cute creatures running amok to your core but just because they look cute, it doesn't mean they are harmless. Things can get pretty nasty if you dont plan properly. eg: 70+ over tiny runners heading to your core.Game play:There is no story whatsoever in SS TD. You are straight thrown into the game to learn to build/maze/get to know your towers/aliens immediately. The objective of the game is simple. Protect your core from the aliens. You lose the game once your core has been damaged enough by the aliens. The end.If you defend the core without taking any damage(0 leak) - a perfect defense, then you will be rewarded with 3 stars. What does the star do? For achievement purpose. You are only given a max of 4 tower slot and 4 skill slot. So you have to choose from your collection of tower/skills and learn to build a combo@tactic around them. Planning is always crucial as each Map layout is different and so is the spawn of mobs. As you progress into the game, you gain experience points and you start unlocking higher tier towers/skills. And Yes, there will be bosses. Speed Runners, Flyers and the ones that eats up your towers. They are here. so are the mutators. >:-DMy Personnel Experience:In the early of the game, it seems pretty acceptable and fun to play. Until a certain level where you know you hit the limit and there's just isn't much you can do unless you start investing into other forms of tower/skills. By Mid game you would have realize that all you needed was the lighting tower family. So you ponder was the choice of tower selection a mere illusion? In some way yes. If you wanted an easier time, you'd pick certain towers over the others because it gets the job done better.By end game You've probably figured out which enemy was ""weak"" to which tower and what sort of tactic to deploy. You are probably aiming to get the 10k alien kills now.I am not into leaderboard but I am into achievements. I had a memorable time studying/exploring ways to complete certain maps/achievement. SS TD was fun and challenging however i'd say it lack certain aspect of the game.  The first is that it lack a drive. There is no story or motivation for players to complete the game. At some point, players them self can also lose motivation if they keep failing in at certain maps. getting stucked at some map without any form of aid is a painful experience. The second one is related to engagement. Aside from TD, there is nothing else to do. No mini games, no other game mechanics to keep you occupied when you are tired seeing the aliens. I was hoping that because this is 2d, solo offline TD game, the devs would try to introduce something new - something thats not FPS or co-op which has already been done in sanctum 1 & 2. If I may reference other games; For an example, Final Fantasy 7 on chocobos, Plant vs Zombie: plenty of mini games and zen garden. PvZ offers way more ""gaming experience"" and ""value"". The tower and alien description were very vague. You had to observe the battle to understand which unit takes more damage from X tower at X level or X tower seem to be better against X unit. Other than this, I'd say the game was fun & solid. Once I've beaten the game and obtained my 100% achievement, it is unlikely I will revisit SS TD again but for the highly competitive gamers, they will no doubt invest their time into perfecting their art of defense to get their name up in the legendary board of fame.My Summary:Super Sanctum TD as a whole, is a good solo, offline TD game. It would've been much better if it had an option for skirmish mode/co-op mode to retain its playerbase. A different game mechanic apart from the TD would be a welcome - It's a risky move for a simple 2D game but I seriously hope the devs will incorporate something new in their next solo TD product. So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Super Sanctum TD is a 6/10.			"

												For the price of a coffee (was on special) it's more than just worth it. Great tower defence that still captures the magic of the full actual sanctum game.			"

												About halfway through with the story mode, and am definitely loving this game. As a huge fan of Sanctum 1, it's awesome to see the maps brought back in a 2D retro setting. What's nice is I already somewhat know how to play most of the maps, but given the different gameplay / towers / abilities, it's a fresh experience. This game is even more challenging than Sanctum 1 was (given in Sanctum 1, the weapons were pretty OP so you didn't need towers as much). Would certainly recommend this game to any Tower Defense and Sanctum fan, even at full price.			"

												Super Sanctum Tower Defense is one of the best 'Tower Defense' games out there in my opinion and competes for the title of best TD even when next to it's first person counter parts sanctum 1 and 2. While the amount of time you get out of it may not be as long as other Tower Defense games, it's price is well worth the investment of your spare change.			"

												Its a flash TD game on steroids. Not worth more than 50 cents, but its an okay game I guess. It plays based off of an XP system to unlock new towers and abilities, and the levels are purposely made to be pretty much impossible to get a 3/3 star rating on the first time you play, so I guess that adds ""replayability"" if you want to call it that.TL;DR: 3/5 rating, buy it on sale for 50 cents or don't buy at all			"

												Very fun tower/core defense game. I got it for 99 cents but I would say it's worth it's regular full price as well. If you like tower defense games that require quite a bit of strategy then you'll surely enjoy this game.			"

												Bought for .59 cents. Got all achievements in ~20h.Solid game for the price. Fairly basic TD with upgrades and two main themes of towers (projectile and energy)Follows theme of the Sanctum series. Most towers are bad. (Mass Violator or Energy or bust) Most maps are good.Overall solid game for the price.			"

												Super Sanctum TD - Raymond KTIf you want a TD, do yourself a favor and go get Plants vs Zombies or Defense Grid instead. If you're going to spend money on a TD, get one that's actually good. Could have gotten Plants vs Zombies for 5$ off a sale or in a humble bundle. I think I paid less than 10$ for Defense Grid with all DLC. Don't waste your time with this crap.			"

												Possibly the best 'tower defense' games ever.This game has only one word to express it: awesome. For a moment think about spending your money on this game instead of one of those 'balloons' games. This game costs way less and in my opinion is just better.			"
