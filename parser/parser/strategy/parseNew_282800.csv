												Before I say anything, 10/10. If you have ever played and liked Mario Party, Fortune Street, Dokapon Kingdom, or any real or digital board game, this game should be given great consideration.100% Orange Juice goes into the long tradition of combining characters from different series by making them all into a single card game most recently done on Steam with Card City Nights or a board game most similarly done like Fortune Street. This game decided to do both. What I really enjoy about this game is that it is basically the first of its kind on Steam. It combines many core elements from Dokapon Kingdom like combat and different stats, Fortune Street for “promotions” and board control, and Mario Party for stars and the 3 item max system (no minigames unfortunately). The main objective of this game is to get 5 normas. Normas are objectives that you need to achieve by either collecting stars or killing enemies. Once the objective is met, you need to land on an enemy orange or pass your own that you can automatically stop at even if you overroll. Each Norma will give you an additional level up star, from a start of 1, and caps at 5 for the 5th norma is victory. Higher stars mean you can use more powerful cards to help secure victory.A dice is rolled at the start of each turn. Like other games of its kind, you can also use applicable items at this time, which this game implements as cards. Each card, as mentioned earlier, does have a minimum level requirement, so overly strong cards will not come out till late game. Across the board are many spaces. Green draws a card, red fights an enemy, yellow gains stars based on roll after landing, blue drops stars based on roll after landing, purple warps to another purple, and the orange marker is each corresponding color’s base that can automatically stopped at to get a norma if it is your own or landed on for the same purpose if not your own and can be used to heal. There is also a grey space that does nothing :(. The combat in this system is really reminiscent of Dokapon Kingdom. In this game you can choose to fight whenever you pass an enemy or have to fight when another player fights you or you land on a red space. Each player only gets to do one attack and one defend each encounter. You can use applicable cards before combat if you have any that apply. During combat, the main decider of things is how high you roll for an attack and what defensive stance you take. When defending you can either defend, which will reduce the attack into their roll minus your roll with a minimum of one, or you can evade, which will completely avoid the attack only if you roll higher than the opposing roll. There are also boss battles that sometimes occur on red spaces that drop a lot of stars. If you reach 0 hitpoints, you will have to roll a dice to revive. It requries a roll of 5 or higher and then goes does by one each turn you fail. You also lose half your stars upon death and these go to the oppoment if defeated by that person.This game is a lot of fun and you should strongly consider it. The only complaint one may have is this game contains a lot of pulp. Hours upon hours of ""pulp"".			"

												100% Orange Juice is an interesting board game that relies heavily on luck, which can complement or negate a player’s skill. The game has a vast array of characters, all drawn from games made by the publisher, Fruitbat Factory, and the developer, Orange_Juice. GameplayBefore you play the game, you must choose out cards which have a unique effect on the gameplay. Each player puts in 10 cards into a community deck, meaning that any cards put in have a chance of being used by any player (aside from the character’s special ability cards). Each character is balanced in some way so that it is not too powerful, having either raised or lowered stats, as well as a higher or lower hp based on their stats to help even the playing field. I always thought of this game as an anime Mario Party, except without the mini-games after each turn. At the end of the turns, there is a chance of a boss monster appearing, or a board effect (which are chosen before the game starts, or already stuck into effect in campaign), which can damage players, regenerate health, and various other things as well. Each tile has it’s own effect, which makes the game far more interesting, especially for players figuring the game out for the first time.Visuals and AudioThe game is very pleasing to the eye, where everything is so lively and colorful. The darker levels have a unique charm that contrast quite nicely with bright colored characters and tiles. The soundtrack is different for each level and compliments that level nicely, making each level have its own unique touch.MultiplayerMultiplayer is still alive and well even two years after release. From the games I joined, the community is relatively friendly and is still welcoming to new players that try to pick up the game. Some games within multiplayer can be shorter than others, but can range from around 45 minutes to well over an hour. This is where most people play, as it can be more enjoyable to chat and play with real players while you play than bots. The randomness makes it a big addiction for players, as you never know what will happen that round, nor how good your luck will be.Verdict: 8/10This game will show you your friend’s true nature, and will test not only your luck, but also your ability to think ahead as well as your patience. Thankfully this game doesn’t have an in-game voice chat, or everyone would hear you scream when you keep getting low numbers.If you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator here.

												A board game that relies completely upon one's ability to simply admit defeat from the get-go. You will go into this game expecting a fairly innocuous and casual romp best enjoyed with friends, and leave it screaming like an animal, cursing your very existence along with anyone who has wronged you while playing. Expect nothing and remember that when you're in the lead, your demise is right around the corner. After hours of playing this game online, I've adopted an almost zen stoicism; if I'm two tiles away from completing an objective, I know I'll roll a one and get warped to the other edge of the map. I'm a changed man. 100% Orange Juice has lead me to renounce all expectation and desire, and to assume the worst from every situation.A fun, lighthearted board game for enjoyment with friends, 10/10.

												100 PURASENTO ORANJU JUSO! is a cute and fun virtual board game.Gameplay is fun, and cute graphics definitely adds to enjoyment. Randomness plays a big role in who wins, but with proper character and card selection, you can generally tip the odds in your favor against AI (at least on normal difficulty, and except for the maps that are meant to be hard). 100% OJ also has online multiplayer with easy matchmaking, so if you don’t like playing against AI getting into a game with real people is quick and easy.Fully recommend it if you like board games or just looking for a fun casual game to play!

												One day, you might find yourself browsing the Steam store. On this day, you may stumble apon a weird game called 100% Orange Juice. When presented with this title, the first thought through your mind will probably be : ""Wat.""Do not be alarmed, this is a normal reaction. It was my reaction, and the reaction of many others who would soon take the journey through Orange Juice together. A game that you buy as a joke, because it looks silly. A game that you continue playing after one match, because it looks interesting. A game that absorbs you, takes control of your gaming habits, and gives you the most fun boardgame experience of your life.This is the story of 100% Orange Juice. A game about chibi-anime videogame characters that murder each other in cold blood to get stars and be the first to reach level 6. A game so heavily reliant on RNG that you will go from praising the lord RNGeezus to cursing all that is holy within a matter of seconds.The game is repetitive, without a doubt. Each match has the same objective - collect stars or beat enemies, and land on a home space to level up. First person to do this five times wins the match. So what makes it so replayable, so enjoyable, so...citrus-y? The online mode, somehow. Playing with friends and strangers alike over the internet, with weird characters and a constantly changing goal in mind (thanks to the disgustingly RNG-reliant system for EVERYTHING) really makes this game one that you can play over and over without ever really getting tired of the concept. The game doesn't have many, if any bugs. The developers clearly care and add new content at a lively pace. The community is friendly, and the experience unique.A great experience that most videogame-enthusiasts should give a shot - especially for the low price of $6.9.5/10			"

Do not be fooled by its cute art style and seemingly casual gameplay.This isn't a game.This is a future therapy session.I'd still recommend it. 10/10			"

												This game is surprisingly deep.  The ""cards"" are integrated into the gameplay in such a way that they benefit other players the same way they benefit you, so the trick to ""deck building"" is figuring out which cards are disproportionately favourable to your character.  As for the actual gameplay, there's a high amount of randomness involved but you have to learn how to play the odds.  This is far from just RNG, the game actually has a pretty high skill ceiling.It's also really fun because no matter how good you are at it, there is enough randomness that everyone still has a pretty fair shot at taking you down.  Losing is rarely frustrating and usually hilarious, which is part of the charm of 4-player games.I can't recommend this game enough, it's much more than just a Mario Party clone.  Shoot me a message if you want someone to play with.			"

												100% OJ is one of the few legit board games (that have functioning multiplayer) on Steam. I have spent most of my time trying to beat the campaign (mostly getting roflstomped by CPU) and I am impressed by the assortment of cards and characters that the game provides. All the units have their unique qualities even though they are not all born equal. At times, I was extremely frustrated due to the RNG nature of any game that involves rolling the dice. I also experienced even more frustration at how overpowered the final boss of the game is.Despite this, I genuinely had a good time collecting all the cards and completing specific challenges offered by the game's given achievements. Some of them were quite hard, some were tedious, and some were gained just from pure luck. This is a game that you should try to enjoy with good friends (especially if you want some of the harder achievements).5/5 I would gladly buy a 4-pack on top of copy I already own when this game goes on sale.Edit 1: The DLC is quite affordable and brings a good amount of content to boot!

												100% Orange Juice is a goal focused board game, played with charters from other popular anime games which have been released recently.  The game has been on Steam since mid 2013 and has an estimated 150k owners. The rules of the game to begin with seem very overwhelming, dice are being rolled, characters are moving and you have no idea what is going on. I played/read the tutorial and this does help a bit to teach you the rules; but you will get more benefit out of just playing a game and learning as you go.  Each board/stage has various different squares, monster squares, pick up a card from the deck, teleport, coins, drops, and home. You roll a single D6 to move around the board. You have to complete 5 goals to win the game. The first goal that everyone starts each game with, is collect 10 coins.After you have completed this goal you then get to choose your following goals, you can continue hunting for coins, or you can switch to try kill a certain amount of monsters or players. My personal preference was to go for killing players as also drop goal too, meaning I could swap between the two goals to keep them as easy to accomplish as possible. The graphics are generic anime style; although I watch a grand zero amount of anime, the art style does appeal to me. The cute sprites and levels are really colourful and are pleasing on the eye. I did struggle for the first few stages of the game with the difficulty; but this was probably because I was still learning the rules, but once you pass the second level you should be plain sailing, I would recommend you play the game on the highest speed setting as some stages can go on for upwards of 40+ turns. I finished the single player campaign with one character in just under four hours. Most of the gameplay and content for this game is to be found in the multiplayer mode; sadly I didn't see the option for a local multiplayer but you can certainly connect with friends online to play a round.I can happily recommend 100% Orange Juice; it will have a home in some people's libraries if they are a fan of board games, it is not a fast paced game so some people may not like it; but if you want an evening of sitting back in your chair rolling dice over a cute little board game, 100% Orange Juice will easily quench your thirst (I'm sorry for that horrible pun!)If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Luck is a huge factorThis game is designed to play a lot like a tabletop game. Its feels a lot like a Mario Party game without the mini-games. Every turn you roll a dice and proceed to move that many spaces. Some spaces add/subtract stars needed for leveling up while others let you fight various monsters or reward you with cards. There is even the option to fight other players as you pass them on the board. You can choose to level up your character by setting goals for reaching so many stars or by winning a set number of battles. First to go up to level six wins the game. Simple as that... Very addictive!*RECOMMENDED*			"

 A Mario Party Monopoly Love Child, With RNG Mixed In To Make A Beautifully Evil Baby  tl;dr: If you are a fan of Orange_Juice, a very casual and mellow player, a fan of anime and/or cutesy graphics, ok with RNG games or are a masochist, this game is for you. If not, you may not want to buy it... Maybe. Try it if you can. 100% Orange Juice is the 5 year anniversary game of Japanese Indie game developer Orange_Juice, starring some of their hit characters from Suguri, Sora, QP Shooting, and Flying Red Barrel - Diary of a Little Aviator. Now, you might be asking ""WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE GAMES!?"" and to that I answer that they're Indie and Japanese, and you need to know nothing about the characters to enjoy this game. If anything, this game is the gateway game to try out the rest of Orage_Juice's catalogue here on Steam! General Overview Before each game, you can choose a character and what cards you want in the deck each game. At the start of each game, everyone starts at their own home, with a single star and card. You play by completing Norma, which are objectives. Each game starts with every player needing to collect 10 stars, but you can choose to change it after you get 10 stars. You can choose to collect stars or battle for wins to achieve the set Norma. Once you collect the number of stars or wins, you must land on a home, which you can stop at whenever you pass it, or land on someone else's home in order to achieve the Norma. The first player to complete 5 Norma wins. In addition, the cards you choose can be randomly drawn out the deck at certain times, such as landing on a green space. There are many different types of cards, though for the sake of time, I'll say that you need a certain level to use each, and some cost a certain amount of stars, and the types are Trap, Boost, Event, Combat, Gift and Hyper, Hyper being the card exclusive to the character you are currently playing as. Though it sounds like there is a huge learning curve, it's quick and easy to learn it all. Pros - A very pleasing artstyle- Great music, ranging from soft, windy music to techno dance beats- A very alive and well multiplayer community in which almost everyone is a nice person- A board, card, and turn based combat hybrid game that somehow blends perfectly- Never the same gameplay. There will be constants, but the RNG makes it so that anything can happen at any moment.- A singleplayer campaign that's pretty fun- Tons of unlockables and achievements for those who love to chase that 100% completion.- Difficulty rivaling that of Dark Souls, Touhou, and Super Meat Boy- Gameplay customization with what cards appear in every game- Continually being updated with balances and bug fixes- Tons of characters in vanilla, and even more being added with DLC- You can make your own (temporary) server and customize it to play with friends or strangers- There's a demo available, though I have no idea if it accurately reflects the full game- There is no broken card or broken character (though if the RNG is 100% on your side, you can invoke that)- An in-game chat system Cons - Most of the game is RNG based, which means that you can add strategy, but it's mostly up to luck.- The difficulty is more the cause of RNG than actually skill- Some DLC characters are locked behind purchasing other games- Getting new cards is also dictated by RNG, meaning that you'll most likely get every common card before you can get some of the rarer cards- Most achievements are only gotten by luck, and some unlockables need considerable online point grinding- The servers can range from stable to broken- There are no official servers, so you'll have to rely on someone joining your game or you finding a public game Nitpicks (That May Detract From Your Overall Enjoyment) - The music can get repetitive, and some songs suffer from this badly, especially in a long game- Some games last a long time and others are way too short- The AI in campaign mode can be extra cheap sometimes, especially Poppo- Nonexistant controller support unless you use a Steam Controller, and even then it kinda sucks Conclusion It's like a Mario Party and Monopoly hybrid, except 100% more luck based. The RNG might sit bad in some mouths, but it's an enjoyable game overall and definetly worth taking a look at. Just make sure to take yoga classes so that you don't smash a monitor when player 3 plays Poppo and somehow manages to never get hit or touch a trap because of RNG. I also recommend getting some buddies to suffer with you, but make sure they're the type of people who'd stay your friend even if you began taking a rusty spoon and used it to stab their back repeatedly. Also, the community artwork is 100% memes and good art, and it is beautiful.			"

												I'm revamping this review, as my last one which I had made months ago was meant as a in-joke, which probably isn't the ideal approach. So, where do I begin?100% Orange Juice is a board game featuring characters across multiple games from the Japanese indie group daidai (who are better known as OrangeJuice among the populace). The game premise is to move around the board obtaining stars and/or wins from successful battles, which allow you to increase your Norma level, which in turn allows access to cards. Cards play a vast role in 100% Orange Juice by changing the scenarios in and outside of battle. Some common examples are having access to two dice for movement, healing yourself after a battle, and setting traps which can slow down other players. Due to the versatility of cards, you will find yourself always trying out different deck creations.The largest component is the multiplayer, which many regular players would suggest as an additional place to learn as many people will provide suggestions or solutions to what may not be visibly clear even after playing for a while. In addition, as you progress through multiplayer, you will be able to purchase new items from an in-game shop. These include card packs, additional attire colors, boards, among other goodies. Stars, the currency within are obtained upon each completed game, and you earn bonuses for fulfilling certain goals.Now, rather than just state what has already been stated in reviews regarding how the game works... I feel that I need to put my own thoughts out. Not as a way to intice you, the reader, to buying this game. That is entirely up to your discretion. However, until 100% Orange Juice became a common occurance for myself, and many other regular players who I've met up to this point, I don't think there was a single game I could really be satisfied with, outside of those ""in-the-moment"" games such as Mass Effect, Fallout: New Vegas, and Persona 3 to name a few examples. They're all great games, but after you hit the 'end' point, that was it. I had no real desire to go back to any of them.100% Orange Juice... doesn't stand in that same line, for me, personally. It's one of those games I honestly cannot explain to anyone unfamilar with it in why I still enjoy playing it. I've seen so much progress and change from when I had first started up to its current iteration, that it just feels like a new game, yet also entirely familiar. Fruitbat Factory, who has brought us this game from what was once a small project that daidai had moved on from beforehand, is now incredibly fleshed out. I'm not going to lie to you. If this game was sold as it was originally contrasted as; a board game with fun characters but also fairly limited in selection alongside a sparse choice of playing options, I would have suggested to move on.This isn't the case. 100% Orange Juice, without a doubt, has enough content through free updates to make ""GOTY"" rereleases look absolutely fruitless in comparison. The support and care that Fruitbat Factory alongside daidai's commitment to providing a bridge for the dedicated playerbase through additional content and supplemental changes over time is commendable.Without making this seem like a love letter from someone who absolutely adores this game, I would like to just clear some things up on a neutral level. First of all, the DLC availiable for purchase. If you are starting out with 100% Orange Juice, due to picking it up in a sale or as a gift, then I highly urge you to play the base game first and hold off on the DLC to give yourself some room to breath. The mechanics with additional characters alongside their ambigious nature would leave a tightrope in your way, if you were to go from characters who are fairly simple in nature to ease you in, to characters made with card synergy and an outside-of-the-box approach in mind. The second part is approach. Where do you begin first? If you're looking for general gameplay tips, the Community Guides are fairly in-depth and will make what looks like a game with concise rules build a foundation where strategy plays a larger role.Where you go from there is entirely up to you. Hopefully you'll enjoy the journey and have fun alongside others, alongside the traditional displeasure of our lord RNGesus making you fall to a boss.As for me? I have some excess plushies that need to be picked up by my friends. Hopefully they don't mind~Krilaisbestgirl "

			professionalmspaintthumbnails.jpg I'm back with another video and with the 3rd episode of my ""Should You Play?"" series. This time we're taking a look at 100% Orange Juice by Fruitbat Factory, an...		

Short review. Too lazy to write a long one.Pros:+Short, simple & ""easy to wrap your head around"" campaign story+Addicting gameplay, albeit a bit slow paced+Great soundtrack+Appealing visuals+Great characters+Insanely friendly & fun community+Well done multiplayer leveling systemCons:-Completely dependant on RNG-Campaign Mode is infuriatingly hard due to cheating AI (even on the easiest difficulties)-Characters are unlocked by playing the infuriating campaign-Misleading unlocks (sometimes the game will make it seem like you unlocked a new character, when you actually unlocked a new color for that character, not the character itself)-DLC achievementsOverallVery well worth the purchase. I bought this for full price, mind you & I'm not regretting any penny that I spent on this game. Yes, the campaign is super infuriating and got me to rage multiple times because I had literally lost to the AI 22 times in a row on ""Casual"" diff, but then I have way too much fun in multiplayer to really care. One thing that bugs me though is the fact that this game has exclusive achievements for DLC characters. Guess I'm never gonna get all 80+ achievements on this game...100% Orange Juice gets a score of:7.2/10.0""With an infuriating campaign & confusing unlock system, I would've called this game trash. But with the above mentioned pros, I really don't get bothered by the cons anymore.""			"

												A very fun virtual board game that has a good mix of skill and chance.  A distinctive feature is that you choose your set of cards, but the cards are all added to the same common deck -- which means your choice of cards (many of which have effects that aren't even specific to the user) ought to be ones that can benefit yourself even if other people use them.Additionally, this is the first doujin (i.e. Japanese indie) game that I've seen where the localizers have not just vastly improved the game's functionality before release (such as changing the original password-based multiplayer to a Steam lobby based multiplayer), but are continuing to work on major new features, and even rebalancing the game based on player feedback.  The active community also helps provide feedback and suggestions.Come join us!(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Indie Royale Back to School 2 Bundle.)			"

												I'm not sure about this game.Actually I've played this game plenty and I have plenty of thoughts, I'm not exactly sure what to say about the game.There are plenty of reviews that go over basic mechanics and there are many more reviews that are just poking fun at the inevitable random number generator and the luck that goes into such a game. Or something about pudding/Poppo and trying to be funny.So I guess I'll be giving my thoughts on the ingame community and some of the things about this game that some players tend to overlook. If you have any other concerns about the game before purchasing it, you can message myself or other players in the forums if you can't find an answer.I have never opened or participated in a private lobby in this game, lobbies can hold four players and up to four spectators. I mention this because there have been some concerns and complaints about too many private lobbies. It's true, this game from the outside, you can't imagine that this game being very popular or populated after a couple of weeks or so. 100% Orange Juice has players on everyday, whether they be some of the more dedicated players or a bunch of newer players. At certain times there can be a lack of players for a game, as you wait, or it might seem that there are only private lobbies. That's just the nature of having such a playerbase, there are players on at different time zones and it can be difficult to get a game started. However in a public game, you can join midgame if there is a spot open and the host is willing to let you join in. After I bought this game I would've been concerned about the game's population, but now I think the game holds a very niche playerbase that keeps itself alive. Also evidenced by the numerous updates the game gets and DLC, players start to flock back to the game if they go on an extended break. I would not be concerned about the lack of games, unlike Orange_Juice's other game on Steam 200% Mixed Juice, this game has plenty of replayablity and players. If you don't see that many games you may be playing at a bad time, like at 3AM somewhere.This is only about my in-game experience, as I have barely ventured into the Steam forums for this game, but from a distance I can tell there are discussions about balance, changes, and answering questions. The players I have met through 100% Orange Juice have almost always been nice. I've played many online games, off and on Steam, but 100% Orange Juice has one of the nicest community of players. From players being playing around like complete idiots, some serious ones, quiet types. You guys have put a smile on my face and I can never get stressed out playing Orange Juice when I play with such players. I can count on one hand the number of players I have disliked, and I'm hoping it was just a bad day for them. Players are really helpful, I try to answer any question as a player/spectator, when someone asks a question. That's not to say there won't be games where no one types a sentence to anybody except for the endgame, ""gg"", I am guilty of this myself. Sometimes I can't find anything to talk about or I'm really tired. All in all, it's the players that makes me play this game over and over. You can play with your friends in a private lobby, if you purchase the 4 pack, and that's fine too.That being said, I can see the stress test for some players. Being completely serious, not poking fun like some of the other reviews, this game can and will pull off some of the incrediously odds in situations even after playing the game so often, I still have to take a deep breath. If you are someone who might be turned off because you like strategy and don't like luck playing too much of a factor, just hold on. For some players this seems like luck plays such a big factor, I can't argue that. Over a couple of frustrating months, I've learned to cope with the bad luck. I'm pretty observant of the luck that goes against anybody, but I won't go off on anybody for taking me down. This game has literally taught me to accept misfortune and be stronger for it, to do better inspite of your bad luck. I usually poke fun at my own demise, if I have anything to say about an unfortunate luck.In multiplayer, no matter how much strategy you think you have, luck will come into effect. Some players might have more experience/levels but anybody can beat anybody and that's a good thing. You are no better than any other player if you decide to win with a mob character or otherwise. If you are strictly looking for a strategy boardgame I would look elsewhere. That isn't to say there is no strategy in the game. There is plenty of strategy, that often gets overlooked amid the complaints of rolling the only number that would've gotten you knocked out. Choosing the right moment to play a card, to keep opponents guessing about cards, choosing paths, building a deck and many more.But if you aren't put off by that, there might be a few more concerns. The pacing of the game comes in 4 speeds, (1,2,3,4). When I first played this game, I purchased this for 3 other friends and I created a room at 2/3 speed with just 1 other friend. I kept the room public, and someone joined the match (it's been a very long time I don't remember who you are), and they joined us. They mentioned not many players play at such a speed and wondered why, I told the person that we were new and had almost little to no experience with any of the cards and effects. We were helped along, and after a few hours I played strictly on speed 4. To newer players this may seem very intimidating, especially if a lobby goes along smoothly, playing cards quickly and paying attention to the game (and not occupying their 60 seconds with something else). After my first hundred hours I sometimes wonder if the game could be just  a little faster. I enjoy how quickly games can go though, the longest game I've ever played was an hour+ with the worst field events on a map that punished every player for coming close to a base. On average games can last around 20-30 minutes, though I have had stretches where games end in 10 minutes or so.If you are just getting started, you may want to familiarize yourself with the game through single player. 100% Orange Juice has been updated to give another difficulty option which I haven't bothered to touch, but the single player experience as evidenced by many other reviewers, can be very unforgiving. It's unfortunate that you need to play through single player just to unlock the rest of the characters, outside of the mobs/boss characters. Though I guess it's a way to get players to know the characters and some cards. The story is throwaway for the most part, it's cute, but don't look for intense character building, deep story etc. Over time, you start developing a better understanding of the mechanics of the game. There are a lot of different interactions that can happen, and other players can help you along the way if you're new. Just ask, it's press enter for the text box, if you didn't know in lobbies. Field events keep every game different and chaos can happen very quickly.A lot of players like the music and themes the characters are given, Personally I like the themes, but after my 200th hour, I muted the game, to put my own music on. I do on occasion like to put the music back on at times, which can be accessed through options. Would I recommend this game? Yes, I want to play with so many other players. Every time I login to Orange Juice, I play with 1 new face at least. I'd avoid this game if you are, again, strictly looking for a hardcore strategy boardgame or a RPG type boardgame. I've always wished there was another boardgame like Dokapon Kingdom, but this is a great casual game  that I've enjoyed for the past 2 years. Even if you are just getting into the Orange Juice series of games, this would be one of the better ones to start with, as there's plenty of replayability.			"

												This game is fun, really really fun and I want to recommend it!But most people who read this review will probably play in single player and that is why I can't recommend the game.It is a party game at heart and while it does entertain online play, if you play in single player the AI has loaded dice.This makes singleplayer unfairly fustrating.Originally posted by ""Venus Love-Me Chain"":""THAT AI DUDE THAT SON OF A ♥♥♥♥♥ I WILL CUT HIM""Multiplayer is a hoot and if you are the kind of person who has friends to play this with then you will have a lot of fun.If you prefer the single player experience then this game can be fun but know in advance that the AI is cheating its dice rolls.'Update 1.7 *Casual difficulty gives all CPU characters regular rolls, considerably lowering the difficulty.

												I've been addicted to this game and have been playing it nonstop over the past few weeks. With that in mind, I was compelled to write a review for it.100% Orange Juice is a board game with characters from a number of Orange_Juice's other games like Suguri, QP Shooting, and Flying Red Barrel. It's a luck-based dice-rolling mayhem that's as entertaining as it is frustrating. Pros:+ The art style is cute and makes for nice visuals, and there are some catchy tunes to go with it.+ The characters have different attributes and hyper cards that make the game fun and unique.+ The DLC/bonus characters have their own little niche yet do not make the game pay to win.+ Playing online is quick and easy and doesn't have very many problems. Disconnects happen, but they're rare.Cons:- It's heavily RNG based. Everything runs on dice rolls - from collecting stars to attacking opponents - which means that very little skill is involved. This will be a turnoff for some, but it also makes for very entertaining matches.- Some rolls are rigged. This only applies to Tomomo's rolls in the last part of the campaign (where she is more likely to get 5's and 6's), but it is still a pain. Getting through the last chapters of the campaign (and Tomomo Hell) takes a long time as it is hard to defend against Tomomo's attacks or stop her from winning.- The game is hard to pick up. You'll probably want to read the guide first before actually playing as you're thrown into the game without being told what happens. This is a rather big flaw, but, if you're able to look past it, you can enjoy the game.TL;DR 100% Orange Juice has some flaws, but it's still worth getting if you've been wanting to play a fun board game with friends. If you don't like RNG-based games, then... this game is not for you.			"

100% Orange JuiceShort Review VersionWhat is 100% Orange Juice? 100%  Orange juice is a board game, despite the name. Yes its weird but considering what else this company have been pumping out the name does not come out as a surprise. Anyways back to the review.100% Orange Juice is a boardgame that decided dice are not being used enough and that RNG is fun therefor it has decided to combine those two in an unholy union. What this means is in the game you can go from no.1 with only 10 more stars needed and 1 block away from home only to have your game character get teleported to somewhere else to the map most likely right in front of your opponent eager to destroy you. Or that you activated the booster card so you can roll 2 dice at once only for the dice to be 1 1 respectively. Since this is a boardgame lets go with the gameplay first.Gameplay~If there is a word for this game it is fun. On the chaotic scale. Here is the breakdown:Choose Map>Choose Character>Choose Card>Play>Win/Lose>Get Stars/Level Up>Buy Stuff>RepeatYou can choose from a lot of map each with different pattern and different booster locations, once you choose your map you can then play it without modifier for a vanilla but boring experience or turn on a maximum of 3 modifier each with their own unique effect such as teleport, random damage, and even landmine the map.Now onto the choose character screen. Now one thing I must mention is that there are a lot of character each with different stats but you start the game off with only a few with the rest requiring you to clear their story mode. Its not hard but does take some time. Once you choose your character you pick 10 different cards with different effects that will be shuffled into a deck along with all other player card choices then you are thrown into the map for gameplay with turn order being randomly decided.As for the play itself it is rather simple. You collect a required amount of star or beat up a require number of people then roll dice to get back home to level up. Repeat 5 time with increasing number of star/defeated foe and you win the game but it is not that simple since other player also wants to win the game and the RNG cannot be appease.Which is to say that you will most likely land on a trap card, get defeated by your opponent who have buffed themselves only 1 tile away from your home, landed on a suddenly appearing boss tile that will most definitely defeat you, or the classic old case of you losing to a chicken opponent after having landed on a encounter tile.When you stumble on a opponent you can choose to end your turn and fight them along with whatever tile they are currently standing on. The way battles are decided is that if any player have buff/debuff card you play that first then the attacker proceed to get first turn at attack by rolling a dice. The defender can then choose to reduce the damage by rolling defence or try to completely negate the damage by evading but failure will make them suffer the full damage without reduction. The character stats modifies the final roll. Once a player is KO or both player have attack the battle is dismiss. If you KO the enemy plus you get half of their total coin amount and if you get KO you must diceroll a number that either matches or exceed the one display or screen with failure to revive cause you to lose a turn but the required diceroll for revive will be reduce by 1. Do note battle can be use tactically such as battling the opponent at their home base so you will stop and level up there but if you happen to challenge them while they are on a boss tile the good luck my friend.This continues with player using cards, hyper cards that are unique to each character with profound effects, laying traps, and beating/collecting star until you reach star level 6 which will make you the winner of the match. Once the match is over the total points are calculated and exp/star are given to every player with exp unlocking stuff at the shop and star used to purchase stuff [cards, character, hair colour] at the shops. Then you can either repeat again or find another lobby to play in.Overall the experience is very enjoyable with the match being rather fast paced and minimum interaction needed but if you play with friends like what I did you can have an even more enjoyable time trash talking each other and generally doing stuff friends would do. The randomness of every match means that the game gets bored rather slowly but with more boards and character DLC that were release it does shake up the overall game a little bit more.Also despite being a multiplayer focus game it does have bots so you don't have to worry about empty lobbies since you can just invite 1 friend and start immediately. They can be a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though.Option Menu & ControlsOrange Juice custome engine support a rather bare bone option menu.It has the bare essential of resolution support, sound control, fullscreen option and a few other minor things.No disability option here sadly. And yes it runs at 60 fps in case you ever needed this info.The game plays entirely using the mouse with the keyboard only use if you ever want to chat. So its 1 handed friendly and with the sound cue that plays when its your turn you can minimize the game and do a little work while you wait your turn. Not recommended though.SoundEach character has their own theme song that plays whenever you level up and they are pretty good while the overall sound direction itself has neither pro nor con. You can always mute it and play your own song if you want.GraphicsIts 2D animate sprite that bounces with a bare minimal animated background. What you see is what you get.ConclusionA fun little boardgame that does well with its focus on RNG being the factor on everything. Good game length and fun with friends plus it really has a solid gameplay means you can pick and play it with friends at your leisure. In fact I actually manage to clock 23 hours into this game without realizing it and that is value enough for me.Scoring Methology:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: A-Rank - A very good boardgame.Credit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!No drama, Just Reviews "

												Orange juice, as you can probably guess, is the juice squeezed from the popular and delicious citrus fruit, oranges. It is widely considered one of the healthiest beverages because of its wide range of health benefits, which include its ability to boost immune system function, reduce signs of aging, protect against cancer, boost cellular repair and metabolism, detoxify the body, improve circulation, improves blood pressure, reduces inflammation, and lowers cholesterol levels.Oranges have been a staple of eating healthy for thousands of years, and the fruit probably originated somewhere in Southeast Asia. Historical records of oranges date back as far as China, more than 4,500 years ago. It is one of the most popular citrus fruits, and its scientific name is Citrus sinensis. There are a number of different orange varieties, but this is the sweet orange, the most popular and commonly eaten variety. This provides some of the most delicious types of orange juice, although there are some people who prefer the juice from blood oranges, mandarin oranges, or even bitter oranges. The orange juice can be just as beneficial as eating the fruit whole, provided it is 100% natural, and is not loaded with preservatives, additives, and sugar. The closest thing to eating an orange would be drinking a glass of unpasteurized, freshly squeezed orange juice. The skin and pulp in oranges do have considerable health benefits, but you can get most of the most unusual nutrients and beneficial components out of orange juice in this way.Avoid frozen orange juice, canned orange juice, or concentrate, because with all of the processing, you lose a considerable amount of the natural goodness, and producers often turn to adding chemicals to the juice to replenish some of the lost nutritive value. Go natural and make sure you are getting all of the benefits of this miraculous and delicious fruit juice! All of the impressive health benefits of orange juice can be attributed to its nutritive content, as well as vitamins and minerals including vitamin C, vitamin A, thiamin, folate, potassium, fiber, proteins, copper, magnesium, flavonoids, hesperidin, and a variety of other trace vitamins and minerals that make it one of the most valuable and nutrient-packed fruit available. In terms of calories, orange juice has 47 calories in a serving of 100ml. Let’s explore the health benefits of this fruit juice in more detail below.Immune System: Oranges and orange juice have long been known as a powerhouse of healing properties, and one of the richest sources of vitamin-C that you can add to a diet. A single service of orange juice has more than 200% of the vitamin C requirement of the body. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, functions as a primary antioxidant in the body, and it destroys or neutralizes free radicals before they can do damage to the body’s systems. Our bodies need vitamin C to stimulate other aspects of our immune system as well. Furthermore, ascorbic acid is one of the fundamental components of collagen, which is necessary to repair cells and for the growth of new tissues in the body.Cancer Prevention: As mentioned, vitamin C works as an antioxidant, and one of the most important functions of antioxidants is to prevent cancer. Antioxidants keep the DNA of healthy cells from mutating into cancerous cells, so antioxidants like vitamin C are the first line of defense for cancer and other serious diseases. Along with vitamin C, orange juice also contains the antioxidant hesperidin, which has been connected to reducing tumor growth and even stimulating apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cancerous cells. Although research is ongoing, it has positively been linked to colon cancer prevention, but it is likely that hesperidin is effective in terms of many types of cancer.Detoxifying Properties: Along with vitamin C, orange juice is also very high in vitamin A, which acts as a moderate antioxidant. Beyond that, it detoxifies the body by increasing the function of the kidneys. Vitamin A has long been connected to eye health, and adding enough vitamin A to your diet can also boost your ability to see at night, as well as macular degeneration. A single cup serving of orange juice has nearly 50% of the daily required intake of that precious vitamin.Blood Circulation and Creation: There is another very powerful aspect of oranges and orange juice, its folate content. Folate is a member of the B complex, technically it is vitamin B9. This important vitamin is essential in the creation of DNA and the growth of new cells. Folate also keeps cells safe from mutation, which is one of the ways that free radicals damage the body. Furthermore, folate plays a role in building new red blood cells, as well as stimulating the flow of blood to the extremities. This means that the organ systems are well-oxygenated and are working at full capacity. This supports the overall metabolism of the body and the functioning of all the systems, making them more efficient. Inflammation: Citrus fruits are commonly considered anti-inflammatory agents, and orange juice is no exception. High sugar and high fat meals can lead to inflammation of various body parts, and this, in turn, can lead to the development of increased insulin resistance. This is one of the major underlying causes of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. Studies have shown that orange juice can inhibit this insulin resistance by reducing inflammation, thereby protecting the heart and guaranteeing overall cardiovascular protection. Also, being able to reduce the chances of developing diabetes is a major bonus of this property of orange juice.Blood Pressure: As mentioned earlier, hesperidin is an antioxidant, which means that it protects the body against disease and cancer, but this water-soluble plant compound also impacts the activity and functioning of small blood vessels. This can have a major impact on blood pressure as a whole, and research has connected this powerful antioxidant to a reduction in overall blood pressure and a decreased chance of cardiovascular diseases.Cholesterol Balance: High cholesterol is one of the most dangerous causes of cardiovascular disease, so any way to reduce the cholesterol in your body is worth trying. Orange juice has been shown to reduce the presence and effects of “bad” cholesterol, why increasing the amount of “good” cholesterol in the body. This is a relatively recent advance in the study of citrus fruits, so while the exact mechanism behind this advantageous property is unknown, a great deal of research is being done to figure it out! This property means that the chances of atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and strokes were reduced.A Few Words of Warning: It may seem like a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice is the best thing you can add to your diet, and in most cases, that is true. However, having too much of a good thing can be dangerous. Orange juice, like the juice of most citrus fruits, is quite acidic, so too much acidic liquid in the body can upset the stomach. Furthermore, since oranges do have a relatively high glycemic load, drinking a lot at once can cause massive fluctuations in your blood sugar levels, which can lead to varying energy levels throughout the day, and can lead to complications for diabetic or pre-diabetic patients. Finally, if you want the complete benefit of oranges, avoid orange juice and eat the orange itself. That is the only way to get a good amount of fiber to boost your digestion; orange juice has almost no fiber.Besides those few warnings, drink to your heart’s content; orange juice is the perfect way to feel refreshed and get your body on track to perfect health!

												Ever wanted to slowly lose your life as you spiral away into the depths of hell only to be faced with the personification of death?Then I have the game for you.Watch as you lose your friends, family, and life to this highly-addictive strategy game that's also anywhere between 10% to 100% luck at any given turn. It'll all be worth it though, because you can unlock and buy a whole cast of sweet anime babes (Looking at you Robo-ball) to distract you from your misery.The community is great for the most part, I've never found an online lobby I haven't hated, and your friends list will quickly fill up with people you meet from the game.This is one of my favourite game and becuase of how fast paced and varied the multiplayer is, this game is infinitely replayable in my opinion.

												Some people love this game because of it's RNG. Some people hate it for the same reason. However, I can tell you that 100% Orange Juice is true to its name, and is only 100% Orange Juice, no pulp or RNG added. 100% OJ is run by a Millitary-Grade Artificial Intelligence that feeds off of hate and sadism, and this is how. When a new player starts out, they usually have the worst luck imaginable, rolling the lowest numbers they can and losing games left and right. They get a very clear picture on how losing feels like. And after the Losing Period, they enter a Winning Period. During this, they will roll high and win games consistently. The people that you play with, be it randoms or friends, feel anguish. You know how that anguish feels, since you went through that yourself. The two cycles go back and forth, both periods of losing and winning, and the only reason you stay is that so you can feel victory and watch as your fellow players sit in their Losing Period, only to experience a ""winning streak"" and stick around for a little while longer. And that is how an AI has roped us all in to play a game about cute girls and citrus. Unless, of course, you're just here for the girls.EDIT 11/24/16I have nominated this game for the “Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!” Award.			"

												100% RNGjuice is a great game, a load of fun, and its not 100% RNGjuice because there is about 30% player choice involved too. Still fun to play with friends or meet new friends. to explain what this game is further, its a battle board game with rolls being everything, each character has 4 stats; Health Attack Defense and Dodge, and all of these have their own place and nobody (except a ban-able character) feels over powered. Game is a solid card gathering, friend battling, board game.So now the standard game rating:Story: 10/10 (Each player has a story, and for a mash-up game like this is I'm quite surprised that they managed to make this happen. All the characters are enjoyable.)Gameplay: 10/10 (you can't beat the RNG gods in this but its still a hell of a lot of fun.)Presentation: 10/10 (2D Anime > 3D Anime Forever, all the other aesthetics are fitting as well as adorable.)Soundtrack: 8/10 (Gotta admit I turned off the soundtrack after a while and just played my own. the music changes after each person gains a level so it keeps itself semi- not annoying. but still after hearing them for about 10 hours its not enjoyable to listen to anymore.)Replayability: 10/10 (Play it with friends, beat the stories of all players, unlock everything, there is a load of things to do in this game.)

Excellent multiplayer dice and card game. It allows for 4 player to dish it out with very single dice throws and movement.This is one of the few games lucks = 90% of your success... No need to think much when you play but u do need to count numbers...Perfect party game and even better game to relief stress after a long day of work.. typical game takes about 15-20 minutes...Grab a 4 packs.. send to your friends and get the dice rolling already!8.5/10 would be my rating.

												WARNING: I do NOT recommend this game to people who rage easily. If you are overly competitive, have a short fuse or have really bad luck, you should not play this game. To put simply, this game is basically Monopoly, with alot more RNG involved. This game can make you swear and curse and hate others for their good luck. However, I have enjoyed this game quite abit for it has never failed to amaze me with all the different characters and randomness involved. Most of this game is enjoyable (Of course, not the bad rolls) and I really recommend this game for anyone looking for a board game to play around with during your free time.

												This is a great party game that is fast paced, simple to learn, while still being modestly split between RNG dice rolls and strategy. The game's assets are not triple A material by any means, but is well polished and works great. The characters, cards, maps, bgm, sound effects, etc are all endearing and very enjoyable.I had so much fun playing this game. So so so much fun. But now all my friends are dead, or have left me in disgust. This game does terrible things to people. At first, the malice that takes root in your heart is nothing but the result of a natural competitive drive. It grows within you, and as the finish line approaches, it whispers at you words of betrayal, sabotage, and subversion. We've all felt it before, using ghosts to steal stars in a certain party game, or using blood drenched shells to topple your friends in a kart racing game... but it is nothing compared to the devilish desire for victory that 100% Orange Juice instills upon your fragile mind.You would see your former comrades burn and wither away, just for the sake of attain glorious norma. They will cry in agony, beg and pray, to cease your ascension to the 6th level of corruption BUT NAY, YOU HEED NO WORDS OF THE PLEBEIANS WHO DARED CHALLENGE YOU AT 100% ORANGE JUICE, THEIR LAST ATTEMPTS AT APPEALING TO YOUR SENSE OF PITY LANDS NAUGHT ON YOU NOR THE RNG GODS, FOR YOU ARE A WINNER, BAKSING IN THOSE RAINBOW LETTERS, YOU CELEBRATE UPON THE CORPSES YOU'VE TRAMPLED UPON. But only once the euphoric high wears off and your adrenaline clears... only then do you realize your mistakes. The carnage left behind. This game. It will leave your friends list empty. I have to start over from scratch now, as if I were a trasnfer student at an oriental high school. And never, will I ever recommend playing 100% Orange Juice with them.			"

												Under the guise of a cute girls murder simulator ruled by RNG, 100% Orange Juice is actually a surprisingly deep piece of educational software that everyone should play. In fact, all you mums and dads out there should encourage your kids to do the same. At gunpoint if necessary.Some people will tell you anything's possible if you just try hard enough, chase your dreams and never give up. More often than not, these are rich dipsh*ts who were born to wealthy parents and never knew a day's work in their life and have their heads so far up their arses whenever they break wind the gas gets stuck in their esophagus instead.100% OJ proves them wrong. Oh so wrong. Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, no matter how much of your very being you put into something, no matter how much you pray to your deity of choice, you will roll a 1 when 2 or better would suffice. 100% teaches you about failure and how everyone around you is out to get you. You will suffer. You will cry. You will curse this world and everything in it. You will wish harm upon your fellow man. You will become a horrible person. But you will also learn to handle everything life will throw at your miserable existence. And maybe, just maybe, one day one of those rich muppets will cut you off in traffic in their expensive cars... and you will have a x16 Big Rocket in your hand.Best 7€ I've ever spent.PS: Don't buy this if you own a gun.

												This game already has tons of positive reviews and hardly needs mine to be shown as a success. But I've sunk over 400 hours into it and I'm sure many, many more will come in the future. As such, I feel obligated to give another thumbs up here. Plus, I just want to talk about how much I enjoy it.100% Orange Juice is a mash-up of several Orange Juice game characters in a board game setting, along with a couple of made-for-this-game ones. Before playing this, I only knew of Sora, and only because I had heard the soundtrack from her game. So this is coming from someone who was totally exposed to Orange Juice games because of this one.You can get this for single player use. Campaign modes exist, five in all, and if I were to get the game just to play those, I would consider it a worthwhile purchase. That being said, campaign mode severely suffers for one major reason: the AI cheats. I don't mean that in an ""I get so unlucky that it feels like they're always doing well"" way. The game's code has shown that difficulty levels going up causes it to be more likely that the AI will get the rolls they need. This is artificial difficulty at its finest, and if that was not a part of this game, I would have nothing else to complain about.However, multiplayer is where 100% Orange Juice shines. There the luck is truly random (no matter how you might feel otherwise), both for players and any AI you have filling in the slots. Lag is almost nonexistant from my experiences, and it is very easy to link up with friends to play. There is a lot of hilarity to be had, and I have gotten so many hours put into this game simply because it is so much fun with other players.There are a variety of boards, almost all of which are fun for different reasons (I loathe Farm, but that's the only exception for me). The cards used in the game are of a good variety, and since each player contributes ten cards, it makes for a good mix. Most impressive is the character balance. Yes, there are tier debates, and yes, some characters are simply better in some ways than others. But overall, it is a game where you can win with any character, with all of them having their own strengths, weaknesses, and powers.DLCs usually give more characters, with one giving more cards. DLCs tend to be a pain in the rear end for most games. Here, I like them. They are not expensive at all, the characters given are great, and it shows how the developers are still helping the game evolve. They are released at wonderful intervals, waiting just long enough so players can go, ""Okay, I've had a lot of fun with these characters. Are there any more coming? I'm ready to try someone else."" Falling back on old favorites is enjoyable too. I personally use Saki, Krila, and Alte as my top three, and while I love playing with new characters, it feels great to go back to them as well.Speaking of the developers, they are constantly working to improve this game. When balance issues are brought up, they work to make small changes that keep the characters closer in varying strengths to one another. They release new maps as free content. They give out holiday specials that you can earn simply through playing. Their other games have bonus characters that are not necessary for here, but really nice for those who support said games. And perhaps most importantly, the developers are constantly asking how to improve 100% Orange Juice, and watching the discussions to weigh in when needed. This type of devotion is something a lot more games could use, and it really shines here.As this is a Steam game, I feel obligated to remark on achievements and trading cards. The achievements are, for the most part, reasonable and fun to collect. The ones that were frustrating have been toned down by the developers, which I think is a wise move. The trading cards are quite cute. I cashed them in for a badge and have enjoyed the wallpaper and emoticon I got as a result.To wrap up, here are some various comments. The art is adorable and the sprites are great. The music is fantastic (for the most part; I still am a bit meh on three or so character themes, but out of the vast number of characters, that is a very small amount). The methods of winning make for a fun mix. The learning curve is very nice; I played one game and then knew enough to go through the rest of the game. I have never experienced any glitches with it. The price is ridiculously cheap for how good it is, and getting it on sale makes it an absolute steal. It does come in bundles, but I wouldn't bother waiting for those if you want it, unless you are particularly stingy or uncertain if it is your type of game.So yes. I highly recommend 100% Orange Juice. If anyone wants to have a game, I'll be around and ready to play!			"

├Professors Review┤Overall Score85/100Game Pros• Play with up to 3 other friends• Every character has unique combat attributes• Over 50+ card to collect•  4 Campaigns each with 5 stages and boss battles• Overwhelming feel of achomplisment when you finally win• Can become very strategic on how and when you play your cards• Decent visuals• Very entertaining and keeps your attention (For people who are into these types of games)• Various enimies/bosses• Great soundtrack• Ability to choose between set goals (Gathering stars or killing enimies) that further your progression towards winning  Game Cons• Non-existent tutorial in-game• Dice rolls are random. So you play upon luck• The Campaign makes you wanna smash your screen. It feels like the AI is using hacks even on the lowest difficulty. It's even worse when you get destroyed by a seagull• To unlock advanced abilities and characters you have to grind foreverRelateable Games • N/A Conclusion100% Orange is a fun...board-game? Featuring cards that can really change the out come of the game depending on how you play them. Fight your friends, Bosses, Monsters, and Seagulls. Cause havoc with game changing cards, and use your winning to buy more card packs. If you have the money, i'd honestly give this game a chance. At least go check out some game-play. It can be very relazing, and highly frusterating at the same time.  (If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) "

												100% Orange Juice is a board game developed by Japanese indie developer, Orange Juice, and published by Fruitbat Factory. this game may looks cute, but don't be fooled, guys. This game can be really evil and frustrating, (Because of RNG stuff) but that doesn't change the fact that this game is fun. The objective in this game is to, fulfill your norma, either by killing your enemies, or by gathering stars (which can be collected through star panel, effect, etc). There's also a deck building system that can help you a lot ! So on to the review !(+) Pros :- You could get a lot of playtime for a cheap price.- There's a lot of character to choose from. Each with different playstyles and quite balanced !- Your action matters, while this game rely heavily on RNG, your decision still matters and could bring you to victory.- Multiplayer, Up to 4 players online ! Gather up your friends, mate.- The online lobby is usually packed with players. Also, most people i met here is really fun and kind !- Catchy music to accompany you playing.- And the most important thing is, Fruitbat Factory is really dedicated to this game, that's what keeping this game fresh and alive after such a long time. Thanks Fruitbat !-  Also Poppo. Poppo is love, Poppo is life.(-) Cons :- RNG, while that's also one of the fun aspect of this game. sometimes, that RNG itself could leave you in frustration. Also, some people don't like luck-based game.- The artstyle of this game is anime-ish, and that might not be suited for some people.- Lack of in-game tutorial, This game is pretty much easy to learn, but.. it's kinda important to give the players insight about the game.""So, is this game worth it ?""Yes, totally, my friend. It's pretty much a steal for it's price. Get it~			"

Though I wouldn't recommend someone who just likes to play this game for occassional fun to try and get all the collectables, since it is extremely time consuming.  Overall, this is one of the most fun games I've played and I'm glad my friend bought it for me!  Community is very interesting and fun to talk with as well.

												(This game's review is brought to you by Zaraki Snakenoman.  Always got aces up your sleeve, man.  I love it!)Wow, it's a shame I haven't reviewed this game yet.  Well, let's change that!100% Orange Juice?  What is it?  It looks like Mario Party with a weird name...well, if that's your assumption, then you guessed both right AND wrong.  Fans have given this notorious title numerous different aliases.  100% Poppo Juice, 100% (censored title here) Juice, 100% Karma Juice, etc.  The list goes on.  For those that call this ""100% Karma Juice"", they'll be the most accurate. It's a game that is HALF skill and HALF luck.  (As people taught me when I was new)100% Orange Juice is an videogame board game similar to Mario Party in looks and play-style, but instead of annoying minigames after every round, you're awarded stars (coins) regardless of your performance.  You wanted to attack someone you were passing?  Now you have that option, to clobber other players...not just with physical punches from on top of your couch...Just keep in mind that just as easily as you beat your opponent, you may lose everything by losing to a bird (No joke...The nightmares).You score not by getting the highest score after a set turn amount (like Mario Party does), but by simply meeting goals you define (wins or stars) as you land on either an enemy base or your own base.  There is a ""Card game"" aspect to it as well as you can use cards you pick up as traps, battle boosters, or events to screw up someone who's about to win (100% Karma Juice).  Also, every character in the game is unique for their combinations of hypers (character-specific abilities) and statistics.Now, it's a really great game once you get into it and there are always people playing it, so it's not going away anytime soon, which is a plus if you just purchased it or have recently started thinking about getting into it.  The game is STILL being updated too with new content such as maps and DLC characters, too.Story modes are also both charming and hillarious as they are difficult.  The dialogues are well-written and have gotten an honest laugh out of me many times.  Know what you're doing and you still MIGHT win these difficult campaign challenges to continue the great and comedic stories.My complaint, however, is that there are some characters from Orange Juice's (the developer) games that have not made it into the game just yet (BRING NATH TO 100% OJ ALREADY!!!!!!).  More story modes would also be awesome, perhaps a story for every single character within this game, stock and DLC.If you're an achievement hunter, you may find it rather rough.  If you're a casual or a hardcore gamer, you'll find this game to be a pleasant breath of fresh air.  Just remember to be careful with your choices as you play, it may just come back to bite you right before you win... (100% GODDAMMIT Juice)9.5/10  N--Oops.  GG...but Poppo still won the game.~  (WHY IS THIS NOT AN ANIME?!)			"

												A very fun game, specially for multiplayer, with a very friendly community.It takes a Mario Party-esque formula and replaces the minigames with a card and a combat system. Players will be laying trap cards, using combat cards and changing the flow of the game in order to grab stars or defeat other players and monsters,Each characters has his own unique attributes (HP, attack, defense and evade) and a unique Hyper! card, favoring some specific playstyle. Players will build their decks that will get mixed, meaning a player can get a card from any other player's deck.Campaign mode features a very silly story with charismatic and cute characters.However, it is a very luck based game, and, at least on campaign mode, the AI will cheat on the dice rolls. Be prepared to lose from advantageous situations due to sheer bad luck and AI cheapness.Still, this doesn't stop 100% Orange Juice from being a very fun game to play!			"

Tons of dlc and cute characters available for you to play. You can also customize your character like hair color, unit color, accesories; from drops or the shop.It has the Nicest community. Everyone just greets you with a warm welcome when you join in. Sometimes when the lobby is full, some people would take turns in spectating, giving chances to others to play. No matter how small the community is, the players are mostly kind.Recommended			"

												Describtion: A RNG (random number generator) game, where dice rolls and card builds may be the difference between win or loose. This game is basically like a animated ludo game where you have four different characters with different stats and abilities representing each base or home. There's a campaign featured  for each standard character in this game as well that has various funny moments due to it's close bonding and dialouge to the different characters. (Not DLC chatacters) The goal of the game is  either by wins aka taking out other players and stepping or red panels which triggers enemy encounters or by collecting stars.Pros:+ Extremly fun to play with friends+ Community is alright+ Updates and DLC is released frequently+ Events (Holidays and exp + stars drop rate )+ Alot of different playstyles between the characters.+ Battle system is fun and family friendly.+ Exp system unlocks skins and props for the characters.Neutral:* The game is a RNG based game, which means it rely on chance more then most other elements of the game, this may be frustrating to some people.* The seagul will  ""gul"" you, joke aside. You will understand once you play. Cons:- DLC's have stacked up increasing the price for players who want to enjoy the game fully.- Some characters are unlockable only by purchasing other game titles, which may lead to an uneeded purchase.Summarize: This game is a great way to spend time with your pals if you'd ever find yourself with nothing to do, It is not really that time consuming and overall it is a great game that you will (admit it or not) find moments of tremendous joy when you just keep rolling those 6's or fall in despair when you only roll 1's.

												Ah, Hyaku Paasento Orenji Juusu... Played this game for 5 minutes, the battle system confused me completely, stopped playing it.However, a few days ago, I'm like ""Why not."" So I played it for about half an hour. Got to understand the battle system. Now I go to bed, wake up, play this game. Go to work, come back, play this game. I'm addicted. I just can't stop playing it.There's events in this game for Valentine's Day, Poppo Season (August-ish?), Halloween, and Christmas, where you get special items just for the season. This is something rare to any game, and for it to be a board game is shocking. Props to the devs for this.Secondly, the character lineup is very likable. The chicken is by far my favorite character, as it just lets you joke around and have fun. There are unlocks for every character, and very numerous ones at that. The replayability for unlocks is really frequent, so this game will last you a while if you're a completionist.Thirdly, the campaign. This is kind of what people say makes the game fall flat, but I tend to disagree. Its story is very fluffy, and it teaches you how to play the game. Plus, if you beat all campaigns on normal, you get a red crown accessory, and a purple crown for beating theme all on extreme difficulty. (Which requires amazing luck and strategy.) You can use any accessories, outfits or characters you unlock in place of the main scenario character if you think that gives you an edge. (Which it probably could.)Finally, the multiplayer. This is where the game truly shines. The community is incredibly outgoing, and the game doesn't really lag regardless of where in the world the players may reside. It's a lot of fun. You use all of the accessories, outfits, and characters you unlock via the in-game store that you buy with stars that you earn in multiplayer and campaign and can show them off to your friends and random people in multiplayer. You will get oranges to unlock other stuff by playing multiplayer (though only in matches that aren't CPU-only.) You also have a chance to unlock stuff randomly by finishing multiplayer games.Anyway, it sounds complicated, but it really isn't. It's a lot of fun, and for a game under $7, I think it's a great worthwhile purchase with a ton of replayability. Go for all the unlocks, and remember to play as much as you can in event times. There's actually an event going on right now for Valentine's Day where you get free chocolate dice in order to kill 10 people with those dice to unlock the heart dice which you use to gather 1000 stars from bonus panels to unlock... something which I don't know yet.Anyway, great game, and you should get it. Rated 9/10 overall, and 11/10 for a game that's under $25.			"

												Essentially, 100% Orange Juice is a turn-based board game with RPG elements and a Kawaii feel to it. You go around a board, roll dice, collect cards, and beat up monsters or other players/AI. The AI cheats a good bit and there is a reasonable sized campaign mode because of that and the time it can take to potentially beat just one campaign. Over-all, the game is good, but the bots are ridiculously unbalanced sometimes & it can kind of ruin the game. Lots of card decks you can build around your particular play-style making for a unique game-play each time especially online. It's a great novelty game and well worth the cost even not on sale. I wish there was a bit more unique strages, but for the $0.50 I ended up paying for it, i'm not complaining. Enjoyed every minute of it and plan on playing for many more hours to come. Be warned online when joining with too high of a level people, they tend to use some pretty OP cards so make sure your deck can handle a wide variety of strategies! Turbo mode is included for the campaign modes making games go by quickly and it's a great casual game you can leave open and do other stuff in while waiting for your next turn when it comes to online play.TLDR:Asian Mario Party, complete with turbo mode & cards dealing various status elements. It was mathematically a good investment as I got pretty much all my money back on cards for what I paid for it. I R mean no offense, but it was the easiest way for me to explain this game. It's a lot of fun! It's intense, and has weird voices that are fitting of these types of games :P			"

												Possibly one of my most enjoyed games on Steam. The RNG can be quite frustrating early on (especially if you try going for the campaign), but I assure you, if you can get past that, this game is hours of fun to be had online, especially with friends. Quite a few unlockable characters, cards, and boards to collect, plus tons of achievements for those into hunting them. Very highly recommended!(P.S. If you get it, drop by the group chat sometime - there are usually a number of us willing to play a few matches, and we don't bite!)			"

												100% Orange Juice is a board game developed by Orange Juice, starring the characters from their games (such as Sora, Suguri or QP Shooting) in one big crossover battle, with four players fighting against each other (or... avoiding confrontation to just accomplish the objective in peace while everyone else is out for blood) to complete ""normas"" and gain levels until someone achieves level five and wins the game.The players take turns to use cards, roll dice, move around the board, and either attack other players, or interact with the tile they landed on. The main goal is to complete ""normas"" to level up (which gives you more stars per turn, as well as the ability to use stronger cards) via either stars or combat wins, decided whenever you level up. The main goal is to achieve norma level 5 before the other players do.Since this is a board game, RNG has a lot of impact here, deciding everything from moving to fights. Those who aren't blessed by the Random Number God should be aware about the kind of sadistic pain this game might inflict upon you. I personally suggest not taking it too seriously - it's a party game, after all. Because of that, it's best played with friends, both for laughs and the fact that single player campaign, while having rather hilarious dialogues, feels as if the CPU players were cheating (and the final boss does actually cheat). Unfortunately you have to beat your starter's campaign to be able to gain access to majority of the other playable characters as well as other starters and their campaigns. And that's nothing in comparison to Tomomo Hell and unlocking the playable version of the final boss.The game also has, surprisingly, a ton of replayability. Every match with your friends is gonna look different. There are sixteen different boards to play on, and almost twenty different characters to play as (not counting the DLC characters that come out every now and then to keep the game fresh), each one possessing their own stats, strengths, weaknesses, gimmicks, and (the humanoid ones at least) their own unique Hyper card. Outside of those, there is also another forty or so different cards to use (with around ten more as DLC). While the final outcome is inevitably mostly thanks to RNG, you can vary your playstyle anywhere between passive and aggressive, as well as using character gimmicks to your advantage. Also, you gain experience and stars (currency for the in-game shop) to unlock and buy cosmetics, new characters, new cards, and other things.In aesthetical department, all characters look different, most of them obviously swinging towards the ""cute"" side. The little sprite animations they make in different situations (winning, getting KO'd etc.) are also pretty hilarious to watch.Meanwhile, the music seems to be mostly borrowed from other doujin games (I personally have recognized one piece), but it's a rather varied selection overall, with some rather catchy tunes.Overall, the game is fun, even if frustrating at times, and is very addictive when playing together with friends or complete strangers. I can recommend it to anyone who has a thing for board games, or just having a good time with people you know.			"

												I have played this game for over 100 hours, I have bought over 12 copies to give to friends, and I'm gonna be honest: it was all worth it. This game is addicting as heck, and equally challenging, while at the same time easy enough to play in the background while you watch anime XD. Additionally, the community is amazing, and friendly to the noobs among us (we were all there at one point).  Long story short; buy this game (^w^)dEdit: They just keep releasing updates and DLC, bringing me back for more time and time again.  proving that even smaller game developers can provide better support for fans than most larger companies.

												Don't be fooled by the cute visuals. This board game is brutal, extremely addictive and a lot of fun! It mixes gameplay elements from Ludo, Monopoly and Risk into an unique game that is perfect to play with friends and even against the AI. You can play on casual difficulty, normal difficulty or hard difficulty (on the later, the dice is loaded). A lot of reviews says that 100% Orange Juice is a game of luck only. I beg to differ. While the RNG is crucial here, you have great chances to win by skill, always choosing the best path on the board, the best moment to use a card and playing with a character that fits your style (aggressive or not).100% OJ also has different types of board, campaigns and unlockables. The replay value is very high. Also, it's a very nice game to play with friends!If you love board games, you can't miss this one. Totally worth your money and time!			"

												50% Skill-based Card Game, 50% Chance-based Board Game, 100% Orange Juice.Think of Mario Party, you're using a dice to run around a board, collecting stars, while trying to battle each other away from any chance of winning.Replace the mini-games with short battles, somewhat reminiscent of the Pokémon TCG, each with your own Hit Points, Attack and Defence, even throw in some cards to help you / manipulate your chance of coming away with a more favourable outcome.Almost every tile has an action. Sometimes this is positive like collecting cards or additional stars, negative such as losing stars, or varied by switching up your positions on the board.Each player can place trap cards on any square they are stood on, with the next unfortunate soul to land on it either benefiting the trap-placer, or giving them a disadvantage.The whole package is a charming, animé-style board game that can keep you amused for hours.It's not the most complex or taxing of games, so it's good fun to relax and take your mind off things when you need some time to wind down.That said, this game is no pushover either, and despite it's simple appearance, does know how to frustrate you with some seemingly impossible stages and achievements that will keep you playing it for hours just to get it to 100%.When all said and done, it is an adorable game with cutesy characters, and there are a hell of a lot more expensive games that would get less engagement and hours than this has done.So with it's price-tag, I'm just saying, there's a lot worse you can spend your fiver on.Give it a chance, you won't regret it!

												This game is very addictive, cute, frustrating and fun all at the same time. A game where your luck comes from the roll of the dice with a little stratergy thrown in. You play as one of a few characters (which are based on level/experience) and inbetween each round you get a little story before the main event. You begin by clicking the left mouse button which rolls an ai dice and you can move as many paces, occasionaly picking which way to turn and continue your run. The goal? One of two choices, either collect stars or defeat monsters and other characters. The fighting is decided by the same click of the mouse and can be boosted by cards (if you have any) that have been picked up around the level.Each goal must be handed in at a spawning point but with members using trap cards, monsters including bosses, transporting squares and those that make you drop stars you can be assured that this game is not as easy as it sounds. You can also buy items to help your game play (such as booster cards) and the more you advance in level you are the more you can buy. When I say buy I mean via stars you have collected, not with real currency like some other games do. For such a cheap price this is a great game and it offers great entertainment value. I know I will be suggesting it next time my brothers in law come to town. :)			"

												100% OJ ought to be my all-time favourite board game!The goal is to be the first person to turn-in 5 missions.By default, the first mission is to collect 10 stars. Head 'home' to collect the next mission; where you can choose between more stars or kills! Kills do not include only monsters encountered on the board, but other players as well Muwhhahah!The more stars/wins you get in a game, the more ""star points"" you'll get afterwards.You can spend those in the shop to buy new cards, characters, dice, character colour packs, unlock discounts, new maps and much more!GameplayYou can play the game by yourself through the campaign. Completing it gives you ""star points"" and helps you unlock certain items in the shop (i.e: Tomomo character)But you can also play with your friends and strangers! If you go to ""free play"" you can create/join lobbies and play with others :) Also win ""star points"" and ""oranges""! During free play, the lobby leader can choose which map to play on and select good/bad boosts for the match -- Some boosts includes star tiles x2, movement dice x2, add random trap to the board, walk backwards, insert bomb...DLCLike most games, 100% OJ has DLC.In the steam shop, you can purchase extra characters (they come in bundles of 2 characters!)There are also ""boosters."" Here's the thing, while you might think you're buying a pack of booster cards, on the contrary, purchasing this actually unlocks a booster slot in the in-game shop!For example, when you begin to play, you will notice 2 booster slots in the shop (first two items). Purchasing one from the steam-shop will add a 3rd and 4th one! With brand new cards for you to collect! :DFinal WordsI bought this game as a ""friendly bundle"" and all 3 of my friends loved it!Currently grinding candies for the Halloween costumes and I can't wait to collect them all!! :D (Woohoo! I officially collected them all :D)Like any other game, it's more fun with friends, but 100% OJ is very playable by yourself too~There is also frequent updates and new content. Every now and then there will be EXP bonuses for multiplayer games. The little things that shows they still care and polish the game :)			"

												This is a board game. Don't go in expecting anything else. Consquently, the game is mostly centered around luck (with a small amount of skill involved) and the single-player is, at its best, an overly long tutorial on why you should hate Poppo. Before you purchase, make sure you understand all of this.With that disclaimer out of the way, I would like to say that this is one of the best-designed games released in the last couple years.  If you can find a few friends to play with, or look into the (reasonably active!) community, you'll find quite a bit to love in this game. The mechanics are everything that they need to be, the soundtrack is top-notch where it matters (unless you main Marc or Poppo), and if you're trying to experience everything the game has to offer, you'll actually be here for quite a while.The gameplay, while leaving you constantly at the mercy of the RNG, is just as likely to screw over anyone else. In single-player, that can get tiresome, but once you've started playing multiplayer, that's all part of the fun. Life is short and so are individual games. You might lose one round to a crappy defend role, and you might win the next because of a lucky six. With the overall speed at which a game can be completed, it's all part of the fun. You're rewarded almost equally regardless of whether you win or lose, so don't get too caught up with all of that - just relax and let the dice craft wonderful webs of agony while you and your friends suffer in succession. All in all, it's one of the few multiplayer games I can consistently say that I have fun playing. And since this is a game, that's the important thing, isn't it?That might not sell the game to you. It should, but it might not. And if it doesn't, then I'd like you to take a look at the update history for a moment. For this obscure $7 board game with a cast that's virtually unknown in the west, Fruitbat Factory has done the most stellar job of supporting a game post-release that I've ever seen. Not only have they added characters and maps to a small-name game released in 2009, but they actively look at user feedback and have introduced countless new features by popular demand, such as in-game chat and online avatars. In an era where publishers are eager to throw crap out the door at the first opportunity, I'm simply astounded at the work they've put into perfecting this little boardgame - for over a year and counting, now.I have to wonder how Orange Juice feels. Perhaps they're amused at how their shooting-game characters are possibly best-known in the west as characters from a board game? Maybe so. They should be very pleased with themselves, though - they, along with the publisher that they've partnered with, have become one of the most brilliant examples of what the game industry could be in an ideal world. Rather than looking for new ways to milk their audience, they've been constantly at work improving this game from a simple tribute project to what is probably my favorite game that I played last year, and it's only getting better from here as they find more and more ways to add to the game.Well, that's my two cents. Do you want an interesting and entertaining (but largely stress-free) multiplayer experience? Do you want to watch anime girls, shirtless men, and seagulls beat the daylights out of each other? Do you want to be a part of one of the best developer-user communities I've seen in a long time? If you answered yes to any of those questions, why not make like Yuki and make a gamble? We're always looking for new people to play!			"

												100% Orange Juice is, at its essence, a simple board game. While it may take a game or two to fully grasp everything, it’s fairly simple, but also fairly brutal. Four players are placed on a board and must roll a die or dice to move forward either playing passively, trying to quietly and quickly obtain as many stars as you can, or aggressively, out for blood and attacking enemy spaces and opponents around every corner. The way the game challenges you to choose and alternate these styles of gameplay is what makes 100% Orange Juice an excellent game, as the player must be apprehensive in the face of the unfortunate circumstance where your strategy, and the world itself, has seemingly failed you.Different play styles offer a nice variety to how you approach your imminent destruction. I say imminent destruction because this game is hard as all hell. One big drawback is the intensity the computer AI is set to by default. With some other settings, the average player can ease into the game much more easily. As a result of its default difficulty, 100% Orange Juice can be soul-crushing.Gameplay aside though, 100% Orange Juice has a very nice and clean presentation. Considering all the lunacy going about, its effects are fairly minimal, and it’s probably better that way. 100% Orange Juice is far from perfect, but it’s still an exceptional virtual board game that really pushes your buttons. With some tweaks to the formula, specifically changeable difficulties, more consistent stage design, and some tweaks to the general presentation to help make the on-screen madness a bit more legible, 100% Orange Juice could really pick up speed with a phenomenal little series of board game titles. All the elements are there: charm, strategy, and madness.			"

												I mean, the game as a whole is pretty alright. It's a fairly straightforward, mostly luck-based board game. You have very little sway in how the game plays out...it's just...I really really like getting Bonusu. I go to sleep at night, thinking about Bonusu. I wake up every morning, excited for the Bonusus of the coming day. I can't even get sexually excited anymore without picturing that sweet, tender Bonusu, adding stars to my collection with every graceful roll of the dice. Sometimes, when I'm home by myself, I arrange a board game made of foam mats out on my floor....except all of the tiles are yellow. Every step I take. Every time my toes meet that soft, sun-kissed tile. Pure bliss. Pure Bonusu.  "

												I hate this game with my gutsEverytime I play I get completely screwed over by RNG8.9/10 would recommendEdit: Okay, it's been like two years and I continue shilling this game to people, so I guess I should give a proper review of this game.The game, in general, I think is great. It's a bit confusing at first and the artstyle of the starter characters might turn you off at first like it did to me, but after a while of playing it kinda just grows on you.If you really want to get into this game, you should play the single player campaign for a bit. At least for one or two levels. If the game is too slow for you, go to the options and select the game speed. I would really keep it at speed 2 for your first time thru. Maaaybe speed 3, but definitely not Speed 4. Speed 4 on your first time tends to make the game run too fast for new players.Single Player is mostly for unlocking characters. If you hate grinding in a game like this, hold both Control and Shift. These hotkeys double the speed of the game, making games go as fast as 15 minutes.Multiplayer is the real meat of the game and where it really shines. Especially with friends on voice chat.If you're turned off by anime-styled games I would STILL recommend this game. But you may want to head to the options and turn the announcer off (I did the same thing, I wouldn't judge).			"

												A quick, casual board/card/dice game that is mostly luck based, full of player on player trolling, and suprisingly fun. Whether or not you like the goofy anime theme, it is colorful and the game underneath is quality. Games clock in at around 20-30 minutes, so its not a big time commitment. It's especially fun with friends so you can open up a group or voice chat and trash talk. The game is a blast, buy it, play it.			"

												Now that I've played this a little- well a /lot/ more, my opinions have definitely changed a bit. Mostly for good, though.This is a board game mostly compared to Mario Party without the minigames, you go around the board collecting either stars from panels or enemies, or getting the wins from those enemies in order to complete a goal. To cash in your goals, you must land on a space with a lolipop on it, any one of them. If it's one of your own color, you have the choice to stop there or not if you happen to overshoot it. You may also challenge another player on a home space and use it, assuming you live to see the next chapter. That rule also applies to any other space your enemy may be standing on. This game features at least 15+ characters to play from, and roughly 10+ game boards to choose with random effects, such as a regen to HP every so often turns or turning a bunch of spaces to battle spaces, to shake things up. It also features a card system explained a bit own below.Obviously, the main attraction of this game is the Multi-Player function, which now still works just as great as the last time I've reviewed this. Even with the most barebones unlocks, you can still have a great time playing and spending hours on MP just testing your luck or chatting away with randoms you've met. The community is very pleasant, as there's hardly a time where I've encountered trash talkers or just ragequitters. Even if that happens, it's usually just one odd chicken out of the 4 of your party. Also, in case you're worried, afaik CPU does not have rigged rolls here, and their AI is relatively the same. For even more replayability, there is a avatar color customization in which playing a lot of MP games gives you more colors for your character, so they can look absolutely snazzy when you enter that board.The main gimmick that keeps this from being a total test of RNG is a card system. It's like the item system from Mario Party as well, which you can hold up to 3 on most of the characters. The cards ranges from boost cards to help you in certain situations, cards which adds specific battle effects when you're in one, and the classic trap card for those unlucky to land on. While a lot of cards are designed to be equally neutral to anyone who may use it, it does add a ton of strategic depth to the game. Do you want to use cards to back yourself up when you happen to roll low, or maybe you want to go all out - go big or go home right? It's all up to you on how you want to change the game to your favor. For the most part anyways!The one thing I feel that's holding the game back a bit, is the fact of going through Single Player to get most of the crucial unlocks. Want ""better"" cards and characters? You'll have to sludge your way through this mode. It isn't as bad as I (back then), or many others have made it out to be, but it really is the least fun you'd have in this game for sure. Assuming you don't use Casual mode (Which has everyone use a normal roll set) and super speed (Setting game speed to 4/super fast along with holding Crtl+Shift) your experience will greatly vary, but all in common even if you use the mentioned options you'll most likely get stuck at one point in the story for a good while. That can really turn off a lot of people from this mode, or even the game in general. The AI does have less then stellar decision making (Misuse of many of their hypers, missing a character on a home space just to land on that drop panel?) on any difficultly, but the fact of the matter is this: RNG doesn't like you? You may as restart that game to get a better start. Also, if Poppo stole the precious thing, why is it that someone who won that had their things stolen that's not you win, but still counts as a loss to you? Overall, if you don't mind the Single Player- in which you can sluge through it to make a better experience in MP (Or completely fine with ignoring it outright) this will definitely hold water for a long time, especially if you get friends to play this with. Playing with randoms is also usually fun as well!			"

												I highly recommend this game.  I am not versed in anime-style games, nor am I versed in RPG/boardgame style card games.  I jumped right in, a total newcomer to this type of game, and was delighted.  I'm used to zombie shooter games, the occasional puzzle game, or even driving games.  The music is fun and poppy, the AI are interesting and the enemies are pretty fun.  The strategy of the game is rather simple, but that doesn't mean it's boring. Some games keep it simple and this is one of those games.  Being the type of gamer who does not enjoy having to spend time actually learning a game to enjoy it or master it, I found this very friendly and easy to pickup.  I find myself frequently playing in multiplayer lobbies, and always having a chilled-out, all-smiles experience. 100% Orange Juice is worth giving a chance to.  It's very inexpensive, offers fun and exciting weekend events for the community (""all maps unlocked,"" ""all characters are playable,"" etc.,) and will always, always, always have your Steam Friend's List asking what you are playing.   Two enthusiastic thumbs up for this little charmer of a game!      -Erik Cameron			"

												I like it. Anything I could praise about this game has already been mentioned.It's a solid board game, and the new inclusion of ""Casual"" difficulty makes unlocking more characters for free play slightly less frustrating.Also, Fernet best Orange.			"

												What can I say about this game?Well... it's a fun board game that combines aspects from games like Mario Party, Fortune Steeet and Dokapon Kingdom, and mixes it with characters from the Orange_Juice games, plus some original characters created for this game.In Single Player, when trying to unlock every character through the campaign (the ones that come with the game by default, not the DLC ones), you're going to be at the mercy of the RNG over and over and over that sometimes you'll curse yourself, but still... Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. It's the way of the RNG after all. Believe me, trying to unlock a certain character is a living pain. PROTIP: Don't choose QP as your first character.In Multiplayer, that's when the fun really starts. You will have lots of fun playing with others. You will laugh at the situations that occur during the game, you'll feel pain because the RNG didn't like you, you'll cry because maybe you have lost so many games, and who knows? Maybe it will cause some discussions between players regarding your decisions, but that's where the magic of the game really is: The interactions between the players and how everything folds during your games.About the other regards, the graphics are simplistic, but it accomplishes what it's intended. The character's designs are really cute. Special mention to Marie Poppo, the cutest of them all IMHO. The music? It's good for what it is. Catchy music all around, but if you don't like it, you can always mute the music and put other songs on your music player. Really, the gameplay is where the game really shines.And also, buy the DLCs, it adds more content to the game, more characters to the mix and more variety in your strategies with more cards.Do I recommend it? Of course, but keep in mind that if you don't like the anime-ish designs and don't like the RNG nature of this game, maybe you should stay back from this, regardless, give the demo a check and if you like it, buy it.

												I highly recommend this game.  I am not versed in anime-style games, nor am I versed in RPG/boardgame style card games.  I jumped right in, a total newcomer to this type of game, and was delighted.  I'm used to zombie shooter games, the occasional puzzle game, or even driving games.  The music is fun and poppy, the AI are interesting and the enemies are pretty fun.  The strategy of the game is rather simple, but that doesn't mean it's boring. Some games keep it simple and this is one of those games.  Being the type of gamer who does not enjoy having to spend time actually learning a game to enjoy it or master it, I found this very friendly and easy to pickup.  I find myself frequently playing in multiplayer lobbies, and always having a chilled-out, all-smiles experience. 100% Orange Juice is worth giving a chance to.  It's very inexpensive, offers fun and exciting weekend events for the community (""all maps unlocked,"" ""all characters are playable,"" etc.,) and will always, always, always have your Steam Friend's List asking what you are playing.   Two enthusiastic thumbs up for this little charmer of a game!      -Erik Cameron			"

												Great game to play with enemies I mean friendsChris rolled a 2With two diceSolid gameplay. Great art/music/aesthetics. The multiplayer was designed really well: The best experiences I have had definitely involved socializing, but that's true for me and a lot of games. I mean it though! I've met fun people on here when it comes to random public lobbies. Nice people. Interesting people. One time the chat turned into Bee Movie fanfiction. Barry x Adam spam. They're bees. How does that even work? Kill me harder Barry - I digress.The variety of characters, collectibles, and the system of how you get new gameplay elements are all great. They make the game flawlessly replayable. Verdict: 100% OJ is fully recommended to anyone who seems interested in a RNG RPG Mario Party hybrid with cute aesthetics, great single player unlockables, and a wonderful multiplayer experience that tops it all.

All of this was laid bare before the Eldritch might of 100% Orange Juice. Now, all of my friends have abandoned me. None of them will play anymore.

												Actually a great game. Reviews convinced me 100% OJ was worth the buck or so I paid in the last sale. Usually when I buy random games, I don't read up on them too much, just to be surprised, so I was indeed surprised to find it was a cutesy board game with more RNG than *insert Hearthstone bash here*. It reminds me of the old Mario Party games - you can be winning by a mile all game, but someone might still steal all your stars at the last moment and you'll take last place. If you play with friends, it's nonstop laughter at each other's expense. My experiences with the online community have been fantastic as well, very friendly banter and responses all game long. There is a story mode, and it's about a little girl's quest for her lost pudding, so that right there tells you OJ doesn't take itself seriously. One of my favorite experiences on Steam :)			"

												100% Orange Juice is a great game to just kick back and have some fun with friends.  The game can be a bit confusing at first, and while there are guides you can read, I highly recommend just jumping into a game and talking to people.  The community is awesome, so don't be afraid to ask questions!  When I first started playing, I had no idea what was going on, but then I met some amazing people that really helped me out big time, explaining some strategies and how different cards work.  There are a couple bad apples here and there, but by and large, the community in 100% Orange Juice is very friendly, likes to joke around, have fun, and commiserate when we roll a 1 at the worst possible time or teleport away from home right when we thought we were going to win the game.Basically, the goal is to accumulate as many stars or wins as you can during the game.  Each time you step on a home with enough stars or wins, you will gain another ""norma,"" which lets you use more powerful cards.  There is definitely some strategy involved depending on the character you choose.  Try to pick cards that suit your character's strengths and avoid cards that don't.  A little basic knowledge of probability helps but isn't required.  Also,  pray to the Orange Juice gods and goddesses.  Luck is a huge element of this game, so you will want divine intervention on your side!Campaign mode can be a little frustrating if you don't know what you're doing, which is why I recommend getting some tips from other players first, but it's also required to unlock most of the non-DLC characters.  This is one of my only real complaints about the game.  It can be kind of unclear how to unlock the characters you want.  When I was starting out, it felt like it took forever to get my favorite characters that I saw my friends using in multiplayer.  If you stick with it through campaign mode, they'll all eventually become available in the store though.  That said, the nice thing about campaign mode is that the story is *incredibly adorable.*  The dialogue in all of the campaigns puts a smile on my face every time, and the characters have very expressive animations.  Personally, I recommend Marc and QP's campaigns for maximum cuteness, but all 4 have nice stories.  Red Barrel all the way!Most importantly, don't sweat the small stuff.  For every bad roll you get, eventually you'll get an amazing roll to put the smile back on your face.  Meet new people, relax, and have fun.			"

												I got this game from a good friend who thought, since it is full of anime cuteness, that it would be my cup of tea---or orange juice, LOL SO FUNNY!!!!twelveSeriously, the game is very very VERY cute! The characters and sounds and the colors are all sugary sweet and adorable. The gameplay, on the other hand, will take a bite out of you! It's hard! Not hard in a bad way, just hard in that the computer characters will do everything they can to beat the living tar out of you AND everything is pretty much based on a roll of the dice. You can use cards to help you out, and buy upgrades from an in-game shop with the stars you earn while playing Campaign mode or Free mode.And then, there is the Lobby online mode thing!! I have never had such fun conversing with all sorts of people--many of them new friends!! I'm so glad they added the Chat option to the online games, it makes watching dice flying around, beating up small birds and getting your butt kicked by a demon spawn or a bunny ♥♥♥♥♥ (Poppo and Tomomo) FUN!!Okay, it makes it MORE fun! Give it a try, and who knows, we might end up playing a game together :D!			"

												Well, well...what to say about ""100% Orange Juice""...well for starters, it's my favorite drink and it's extremely nutritious.THAT WAS A JOKE, THANKS FOR COMING!!!Now time to be series about this review.100% Orange Juice is a really fun game, especially if you can get 3 friends for a full-game. It's like Mario Party (a dice board game) but without the mini-games, and instead added the element of Cards (like items but with multiple uses) and the element of constant battles. The battles are simple and a double-edged sword. When you pass someone you get to choose whether to just pass by them and continue along, or fight them and regardless of win or lose, you stay on the space they were on. In a battle, the attacker/approacher rolls 1st to determine his bonus attack added to his base attack. The person being attack is put in defense mode and chooses either to roll for bonus DEFENCE or bonus EVADE points. Defense just reduces the damage based on the roll but always guarantee you take one damage. Evade is a hit-or-miss. If you have MORE points than the attacker, you dodge all the damage. If you have less, you receive ALL the damage.Now here's the double-edged part.If they failed to kill you (or even damage you), it becomes YOUR turn to ATTACK. You have the possibility to damage them or even KO them for attacking you. If you win/lose a battle, you gain a lot of the opponents stars (I think you take half) which are used for leveling up (reaching Lv.6 is the objective for winning the game) and are also used for the cost of playing cards.To level up and reach Lv.6 to win the game, you must reach the ""Norma"" (better known as ""The Objective"".)There are 2 ways:The 1st level up is the same for everyone, gain 10 stars. After that you have the option of doing ""Collect X star"" OR ""Defeat X enemies."" Once you achieved the ""Norma"", you must LAND on a ""Check Panel."" If you reached the Norma, you will level up and then get to decide which Norma objective you would like to do next to level up (Collect Stars or Defeat Enemies). Everyone has a ""Home Check Panel"" on the board. YOUR home check panel gives you the option of stopping on it regardless of your dice roll. It heals you 1 HP if you decide to stay on it.Overall, this game gets 9/10 for me.Really fun game, amazing with friends, and games can be short or long depending on whether or not the dice decides to be an asshat or not.

												If you heard anything about this game, you probably have heard about how much RNG is involved in this game. That is 100% true (with pulp). What makes this game enjoyable is the rare moments when everything falls in your favour, and the casual friendly crowd that plays this game. And maybe some kawaii anime characters, idk.			"

												I have already been playing this game for quite long. The only thing I have understood so far is that the balance in the game is so unfair that the 100% OJ should be given as an example for the term “unjust” in the dictionary! Achievements are another headache. I wish you good luck if you ever try to collect them all. Still, even though I sometimes really want to uninstall this game and forget about it for the eternity, for some reason I cannot do it. It is challenging, sometimes entertaining enough to make me stay awake for 2-3 more hours after midnight, the characters are cute and have quite different abilities (and this definitely enhances the gameplay). There are lots of various maps to play on, dozens of skill cards to use (and CPUs will use the worst ones on you for sure). However, your luck is just so random here! You will lose one step away from victory all the time, your stars will be stolen by devious Poppo, Tomomo will KO you every single battle, and it is just impossible to describe how evil the bosses are – they can kill you with just one hit no matter what your stats are.The gameplay is a bit difficult to describe due to insane randomness of all events. You are just trying to survive, collect enough stars or kill enough enemies and then run to your home base without dying every single turn. Being able to play with friends is the best part for sure because then you can at least predict some of their movements. All in all, there are a lot of things to experience in this game. Is it worth it? If you have steel nerves, then yes, absolutely! If you are as weak and competitive as I am, then no, avoid this game like a fire! It will take your soul away.To sum up, this is a good game that has its issues. And it is dangerous for unstable people. At the same time, it is really nice to KO your friends from time to time. I recommend to buy this game as a 4-pack and play together with your besties (who are, hopefully, stress-resistant). I also nominate this game as “5 more minutes, please”, while sometimes it can become really addicting. My hunt for the most difficult achievements has already taken about 30 hours, but this way I have experienced lots of different aspects of the gameplay. 100% OJ developers are really cruel people to create such challenges, but at least it makes people really dive into the game and try out all possible cards and moves.

												Let me just preface this review by saying that 100% Orange Juice is a game that was made to celebrate the 5th anniversary of a doujin group. Last year, the group's 10th anniversary game hit Steam. 100% Orange Juice is a six year old game, from a studio a lot of people have never heard of, that just so happened to get picked up by distributer/localiser Fruitbat Factory.Two days ago, it recieved a major content patch that fans had been asking for, and contributed fanart for a contest for.In other words, there is a community around this game that loves it. By and large, they're nice people. I still hate them when I lose to them, but they're nice people. The devs see this, and they respond -- with new characters, new hypers, new cards, bugfixes, and optimisation tweaks. A lot of games get abandoned by the devs after they hit steam, but this one? Not so.There are a few jokes that get tossed around about this game: RNGjuice, Anime Grill Mario Party, Salt Simulator. They have a nugget of truth to them, but there's more layers under the surface than that. The more you play, the more you realise that the way you think and the limited choices you make determine much more than you thought. Like a roguelike, being good isn't a set of skills, it's a way of thinking.Ultimately, this isn't a game for everybody. But give it a shot. Have a game, chat with some friends, laugh and cry when the guy who's been in last all game makes a one turn revive roll and then ganks one square from your home base to steal the game from under your nose. It's worth absolutely worth the asking price.			"

												100% Orange Juice (OJ) is rather well-done and holds a high position in replayability. It features characters from the Orange Juice universe, and even some original characters of its own. 100% OJ has cards that are used during gameplay, as well as an RNG-based movement and combat system determined by the roll of a die. Hono's character illustrations display the playable characters well, in all of their poses. Truly a game environment where you can make friends and I would recommend this game to anyone interested!

												Simply put, this is one of the greatest multiplayer games every made. And I am not saying that as a fan boy or anything, I mean it. There's something just awesome about this game that keeps the competitive negativity low while still allowing the player some control over the game so it's not just ""autoplayed"" like how shoots and ladders is. That bit of extra strategy combined with the random factor just keeps the rage moments to a vast minimum, as you can no longer get frustrated for the same reasons as most other multiplayer games. It's not about the competition, just the fun. And it's ironic that a game like this with it's random nature could lead to some pretty awesome rememberable moments from time to time, and the characters are just well enough designed with their personalities some how coming through despite the extremely limited resources to do so. As for trying to edge your win, while everyone can use the cards you set in your deck by the luck of the draw, you have to keep in mind it's all about putting the odds in your favor and also when to use them. It's far more in depth than it might appear on the surface. Although, some characters benefit more from clever deck creation than others.And unlike the developer's(Orange_Juice) RPG, this is definitely meant for everyone, not just fans. So, pick it up, play it to relax, keep yourself busy while you handle things here and there.PS: Being Alte is suffering.			"

												This game is insane, rage inducing, and full of RNG that will get the best of you. But you'll also make lots of friends if you play online and you'll laugh a ton! It's like mario party without mini games and with extra ruining everyone elses' lives and any existing friendships you may have.There's so much luck in this but there is some strategy to be had as well! I'm honestly not sure how I broke 120 hours. But considering how cheap this game was and how supported it is by the devs, it was totally worth it. The devs are constantly updating it with new features, fixes, and events. The community is overall friendly and makes playing online with strangers a pleasure!It's totally playable as a base game only player but you might want to pick up a few character dlcs if you get into playing it online.Give it a shot, it's quick to delve into and will hook you dangerously fast.

It's fun, it's adorable and it can be really intense at times. I recommend it especially to the ones who are looking for a game to play with a group. You need the luck to be on your side but that's not enough. You should play strategically too. Just use your smarts and pray to RNG gods. This will win you games.  I played this game more than 10 hours in 2 days after I bought it and I'll continue to play for a long time probably. Just remeber if you ever face me in the battlefield, I'll drink my orange juice from your skull!			"

												Well 100% Orange Juice has a board game style gameplay to it that is enjoyable to play. Also i would say that i've made some really enjoyable memories while playing with friends. The overall gameplay of the game keeps you engaged to the point where your friends can become your enemies or vise versa. Then again if you only like playing alone the story is just as interesting although it does have ups and downs... to me it feels like the cpu has an unfair advantage in single player... took me an average of 60 hours to complete it. Overall i would give the game a rating of 9/10.Pros and cons of the game.Pros: - Really enjoyable with friends. - Many charcters/boards to try and play (Even while starting off). - The story is well done.Cons: - The cpu in single player seems broken. - Although enjoyable the story can feel repetitive sometimes (Due to unfair cpu). - It can cause frustration.. you've been warned. :P			"

												Do you like strategy? Do you like watching your strategy absolutely dissolve in the face of a RNG that exists only to screw you over?This is the game for you. It's basically Mario Party without the minigames and with even more frustration.With a campaign mode and a free-play mode, there are plenty of ways to increase your blood pressure tenfold. The campaign loosely follows little stories of each of the characters who are all pretty endearing. The difficulty increases a bit each time with the people you face, culminating in a boss that leaves you crying on the floor and screaming into a pillow. There are numerous characters you can play as, each with different stats and their own advantages and disadvantages. These stats help a bit to make the RNG more in your favor when it comes to battles by increasing or decreasing your rolls. The stats can be augmented before battle with cards as well, adding some strategy to it all.All in all, this game is definitely worth it. You will probably get angry and lose friends if you play with them, but that's just a part of life. You'll get over it, eventually.			"

												I highly recommend it!It's multilayer board game with an interesting mechanic using colored panels with different effects depending on panel color, as well as dices, cards and characters which make the game very random. The characters are very unique and the same goes for the cards. The game also has a campaign mode which is nothing more than a story mode where you'll play against NPCs to complete the story of each of the 4 main characters plus the extra scenario. To unlock all characters you'll need to complete all 4 campaigns plus the extra scenarios which you have one for each complete campaign.I'm really glad I decided to accept my friend's recommendation to buy this game. It was worth every cent due it's high replay value and is very fun to pass the time. Just don't take it too seriously since this game is full of randomness, play it with your friends or on public lobs and enjoy it.			"

												50% Collectable Card Game + 50% Board Game = 100% Orange JuiceJust completed my first free play (3rd place :\) and felt compelled enough to write a review already. Already liked War of the Human Tanks (pubilshed? also by Fruitbat Factory), so maybe just a bit biased there.Gameplay: Feels like Mario Party with cards mixed in; I like it.Music: From the main menu screen to the idle music while reading instructions on how to play, to the actual gameplay, music is great :DJust watch out for that RNG: you get the card-drawing RNG combined with the dice-rolling RNG, and that can be a killer.

												great way to pass some time. although that's all it is really there's no deeper meaning to it other than if your bored, but the same could be said about every game i guess, i'd say pick it up. the art is nice and all the characters in my opinion are well designed, the same could be said about the cards in the game i don't think the cards get enough praise but their balanced and that's not really easy to do from a design perspective.

												Okay, I'll star tthis review with this: if you thought Mario Party was rage-inducing, you've never had victory stolen from you by Marie Poppo hyper just as you're about to get to your home base.*ahem* now that I have that formality out of the way, on to the review.  This game is brilliant.  It combines dice rolling and battles in a neat little package that delivers hours of fun for you and friends or random strangers playing this game.  pros- Marie Poppo- nice cast of characters to choose from- worth the money for DLC content and great pricing (it also goes on sale from time to time)- Poppopopopopopopopo!- currency system to buy in-game cards and other character custom colors, bosses and regular NPC enemies as playable characters (so release the inner chicken in you and fight the others!)- unique character attributes and specials- Did I mention Marie Poppo?- story mode available to get used to the game and unlock other characters- map variety- build a deck of 10 cards to throw into the mix of other player's cards- cards from the mixed pack DLC can be used by people who don't own the DLC as long as the cards are put in by a person who owns the DLC- Seriously, Marie Poppo!cons- not all characters are given to you out the box- the only way to earn levels is to play online games- maps also must be purchased and unlocked based on level- character colors also need to be purchased or earned while playing the game (not entirely bad though)- you MUST buy card packs to get new cards- some of the items can get expensive- playing AGAINST Marie Poppo- DLC for new characters and a new card pack set (however, the price per DLC is pretty inexpensive, so this is a minor con)Gameplay is pretty straight forward and easy to understand.  The graphics are colorful, especially for a board game, and do their job.The music is extrodinary, as every character has a set theme song associated with themselves.  Each player who completes a norma (objective) gets their music played for everyone to hear.As I said before, the replay value is pretty high, as you can play against people online and every game is different with the differnt customizable decks you can make and use.  I will say this: the single-player storymode might seem a little unfair with the AI and RNG, but nonetheless, it's beatable.  Sometimes, the RNG can be extremely evil (rolling nothing but 1s or using a certain card that has an effect that ends on a KO and rolling nothing but low numbers (or in the case of one of my games I've played online, 3s). In conclusion, those of you who love a good multiplayer game without being too serious should definitely check this one out.  It's fun for just about everyone, and the hilarity of screwing over your opponents with just the right card is most satisfying.overall rating: 9.5/10 would Poppo all day			"

												The embodiment of what we call an ""emotional rollercoaster"". This simple looking game would lure you in with its cute characters and gameplay that seems to be fairly interesting. However, prepare to have your expectations completely upturned. This is not a game for the feeble-minded, the weak-willed, nor the easily agitated. This game will take your emotions to the limit, and utterly demolish your mental fortitude. This game will tear you apart, rendering you insane, causing you to fall into depravity. And yet, what makes this satanic game, where everything is decided by one single dice, so fun? Just as there are times where you will be completely destroyed when fighting one single seagull, and just as there are times where you will be one step away from victory and yet it is taken right away from you--this game can, and will grace you with the blessings of the heavens just when you need it. You're in last place with no hopes of winning? No worries, let RNGeezus guide you to victory with the power of the die. This game promotes equality of all players, where anyone can win the game without regards for how much experience you have. There are no unfair advantages--everything is, and always will be, decided by a single dice. What are you still standing there for? Go buy it, and experience the best orange juice you have ever tasted in your life.			"

												My friends wanted me to get salty, so they gifted me thisI'm not even mad.This game is fun, it plays with your luck and RNG and will make you rage, but for me, it's very damm fun with friends for sure. The music is good, the characters are hella cute and the gameplay is very easy to understand without even reading the rules or guide.I haven't experienced any downside to this other than being salty, but that's actually an up, you get free salt!Anyways, I recommend you all to buy this for funs and stuff and if you want to have a casual/relaxing time if you don't give a crap about if you win or not and just want to have fun, if you can, buy the 4-Pack and gift it to your friends so they can hop in the salt train as well!Overall, this game is fun, i'm sure you'll love it and hate it.

You would not believe how many times I thought I was going to win the game, yet I land on a monster space, land the lowest defence, and the chicken hits the highest attack (seriously, that chicken is my worst nightmare).Lets just clarify multiplayer in two words for a title.

												A boardgame that is based on previous OJ game characters with a solid multiplayer, free play, and story. The game offers 18 unlockable characters and 6 dlc characters along with quite a few playable bosses. Each character has different stats and plays differently, so mastering each character or only a few will last the player a long while in singleplayer or multiplayer. The story missions are quite hard, but the fast forward feature makes it faster and easier than is expected. The player can unlock characters, skins, and cards to play in the shop. There are many cards to unlock as well, so building a deck and choosing cards is a big part of winning games. My only complaint is that all characters must be unlocked via story mode, making the multiplayer less playable until the story is completed. One of my favorite indie games and I plan to play it for a long while.			"

Even though in some board games this may be a negative, it works in this one.- Easy to learn. I got the hang of this after only playing once.- Cute? I guess this game is cute. All the characters are cutesy.- Fun to play single player or multiplayerCons:- The computer players get a loaded die I swear! Even on the easiest setting they can be hard to beat.- I wish unlocking characters was a little easier. You need to get past the evil CPU players!Buy this game if you enjoy a pleasant quick to pick up board game.There are no jump scares.			"

												Imagine Mario Party on PC. Now imagine if you didn't need Dolphin to run it. Now make everything anime. Replace Minigames with bloody battles. That's what 100% Orance Juice is about.Basically, a board game where you have to meet a certain criteria to level up 5 times and reach Home again to win, either by fighting NPCs, players of Bosses (very beefy and strong NPCs) or playing passively and collecting stars.. or you could just kill the other players to get THEIR stars. You have a lot of characters with different stats and passives, different HPs, different Attack, Defense and Evade values and other stuff (for example, there's this character that can only win through Wins, but she's really strong stat-wise)Battles are done with dice, with the enemy that starts the battle attacking, and the defender can choose to Defend (roll another dice and substract Attack-Defense for damage, always 1 HP damage minimum) or Evade (roll higher than attack to not take any damage, if less or equal, you'll take full damage from it). Defeating an enemy gives half of their stars to you.Cards are a game mechanic, that allow you to pay a number of stars for certain effect, add more attack, give you stars, give you more cards, handicap the enemy or even your Hyper. Your Hyper is a very powerful card that only your character can have, and that used well can be deadly for anyone around... even you.Overall, a very enjoyable and RNG experience, easy to learn, very fun and frustrating at the same time with friends.Watch out for the seagull, though.

												A boardgame that is based on previous OJ game characters with a solid multiplayer, free play, and story. The game offers 18 unlockable characters and 6 dlc characters along with quite a few playable bosses. Each character has different stats and plays differently, so mastering each character or only a few will last the player a long while in singleplayer or multiplayer. The story missions are quite hard, but the fast forward feature makes it faster and easier than is expected. The player can unlock characters, skins, and cards to play in the shop. There are many cards to unlock as well, so building a deck and choosing cards is a big part of winning games. My only complaint is that all characters must be unlocked via story mode, making the multiplayer less playable until the story is completed. One of my favorite indie games and I plan to play it for a long while.			"

												This a game that has a cute storyline, adorable characters, and the ""Yes! It's cheap enough for me to buy a four pack for my friends!"" type of game. If I were to give a quick clarification of the game, it's a combination of anime, Mario Party and ""RNGesus why?!"" You would not believe how many times I thought I was going to win the game, yet I land on a monster space, land the lowest defence, and the chicken hits the highest attack (seriously, that chicken is my worst nightmare).Lets just clarify multiplayer in two words for a title. Forget Star Breaker. Forget Sugar Breaker.This game is a ""Friendship Breaker.""			"

												3 Things you will learn in this game:1. Cringey Engrish2. Only play the campaigns with ctrl+shift3. Random Number Generator is not so nice...Other than that, I find the game really enjoyable, it can be addictive and there is a decent community. It's great to play with friends through lobbies, you can unlock things by doing so. With different characters to unlock, with their costumes to unlock during events, it keeps you busy. There are many other things than just characters and costumes to unlock too, there is much more e.g. cards, backgrounds for boards etc. The collecting of in-game cards is fun, with a card binder that shows your progress of collecting all the cards in the game, as well as categorizing your cards for you.Wait wait wait! I am not done yet! I forgot to tell you that you can make your own AVATAR that is a character from the game, which you can customize with costumes and accesories that you have unlocked during the game.All in all, you should consider this a tad bit different to your ordinary boardgame.and right I 'totally' didn't get it for the cute characters...10/10 would suffer from bad Random Number Generator again. Beware, 7gull watches us all D:			"

												This game is evil... evil to the core. The RNG is so strong with this game that it scares me. The Cpu can litterally screw you over at almost any moment due to the randomness of the dice rolls and card effects. If you like board games and dont mind the gods of RNG screwing you over almost every moment you play this game you will enjoy it. Also if you are a mascochist you will probably enjoy this game as well.			"

												I may be late to the party in reviewing this game... it's a terrible thing, wondrous and terrible. It is truly the only video game that can cause deep strife and demented changes of personality. If there was a quick way to find the psychopathy in someone or to draw out the inner serial killer it is this very title. Some eldritch being devised this accursed craft, like a Lemarchand puzzle box crossed with Jumanji except none of it is real and no demons are summoned--- but it feels so damned real, because the demons were you and inside you and in the buzzing in the back of your comrade's head (to be excised with a very hard rock of pudding), just waiting for a weak little duck to make a snide little smirk and roll a 6. You never knew this demon had walked with you, right alongside your guardian angels of fortune with a shotgun full of randomization to royally butcher their face. At a certain point, you asked, ""How the ♥♥♥♥ did he roll that?!"" but now you ask, ""How will I win? Blood or stars?"" It's not Jumanji wild, It's Fargo wild. It's Steve Buscemi in a woodchipper. You look at these cute anime characters and wonder, ""Why are you so angry?"" It's not the ominous game's effect on you, but rather the battlefield you made for yourself in your own mind. The truest expression of horror is not direct: these Cenobites are just little girls and boys, wide-eyed and bushy-tailed. They are nonetheless the bane of men possessed of greed- for stars and blood- shackled to the cards and the squares, always fighting over what..? We do not know, but we have long forgotten our names and our friendship instead for this ""kawaii"" battlefield. If you're really good at it, use really bad cards every time with no concern for strategy. I guess. Or just do it because you hate everyone who ever played this game and yourself for feeling so good at winning because of RNG. Remember to always pretend you were playing stupid as a trick to lull them into feeling secure in victory. Then strike. Act like RNG is skill and that you were planning that accident.			"

												So much fun to play with friends. I like that all your cards get put into one deck, so everyone is on an even playing field! That was a great design decision and oh my gosh the art and voice acting is so adorable, do i even have to say that?I also like the defend/evade mechanicoverall, a really great party game that will make you laugh from the RNG, just don't take it too seriously, of course there's a lot of luck			"

												Now I recommend this game, and this review recommends the game, but after I'm done recommending this game comes the point where I cannot recommend this game anymore because the truth is I hate orange juice, and I also hate playing this game that's called 100% Orange Juice.Gameplay is simple (just play you don't even need to know the rules), the story is awesome, the characters are cute, nothing to complain about there, regarding the actual game. But this game is horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE, again, not because its a bad game in itself.It's fun and full of cuteness!! Invite your friends to play it - there is no better friendship building game. You can make a lot of friends. But once you have a lot of friends, good friends; really good friends - You don't want to play this game anymore. Take your friends, bank them, and move on. Do not play this game anymore. Take up some other game like Borderlands or L4D2. You think it's still sunshine and rainbows but watch your back because this gets worse than Monopoly on mondays. Don't play this. If I refuse to play orange juice with you it's because you're my best friend and I love you. You're clearly too good for this game. I don't recommend this game, even though I'm recommending it.This is the worst game ever.			"

												The game will hate you, the bots will hate you and they will do everything to kill you. The amount of RNG in this game is incredible; you can play an extremely powerful character but still end up killed by a SEAGULL because you've rolled a 1 against a 6. I shouldn't be playing this game but I am because I want to win and show the game who's boss, but it's not letting me. Also, like other games like Mario Party, in multiplayer this game is a great relationship-killer.Overall I recommend this game because it is quite addictive but also sadistic. You will have to play a lot, and pray hard to win. Everyone and everything wants your death in this game.			"

												One of my favorite games as a filthy casual that is also known by its pairs to be lucky.This game is a board game, where you can play as one of several characters to a total of 4 players, which all have their own stats and special abilities, which gives you different playstyles to adapt for.While the game seems very cute in appearance, it can be a frustrating mess depending on how Lady Luck feels about you this time. Will you try your hardest and have your strategies stomped to the ground? Will you mess around and decide not to try only to become the victor of the game? Only time will tell.This game shines when you play with other people, more so if you are in call with them to hear each other's reactions to what happens, but there are also a few campaigns that you can play on your own. Progressing in those campaigns will allow you to unlock different characters to buy in the in-game shop, using stars you gain by playing games.The main problem I have with this game is how complicated it is to understand at first, because 100% Orange Juice throws you in its complicated rules with no tutorial or guides whatsoever. ""I completed a norma? What's a norma? How do I even play this game? What, you can fight other players? What do Defend and Evade even do? Which one should I use? Am I dead for good? Why can't I use this card? Okay, I completed another norma I guess, this is long, how do you even win the game? Well, I guess I lost?""... This could be many of the questions you will ask by starting to play this game, this initial barrier is what makes this game hard to pick up. A lot of players would drop this game already due to the confusion of how the game plays, but if you can manage to grasp the rules and understand the game, only then you understand the fun of it. From that point on, you will love playing it and will want to play some more, even if you end up being frustrated from your bad luck from times to times.If I had any request for making this game better and more accessible to the public, it would be for a tutorial to be added to the game, so the new players can actually understand it and get a chance to enjoy it before they drop it. Otherwise, it is easily one of my favorite games on Steam.P.S.: Most of my friends that played this game and chose QP as their starting character had a really hard time enjoying the game, feeling like they were stuck with a terrible character. If you'll start playing this game, do yourself a favor and choose one of the other characters. My personal favorite is Suguri.			"

												Probably my favorite game around. You have a huge selection of characters each with their own abilities, unique stats and hypers which make everyone character quite different and offering unique play styles. The games objective is to reach your ""Norma"" or home (the starting point which your number), each time you complete the task of either attaining a number of stars or wins (kills) you level up, first to complete level 5 wins. Sounds simple? It is a lot harder than you think, during your journey around the board the field with have events (lots of different ones) which can vary from moving your home points around, inflicting damage or giving free cards (and more), of course, during this your fellow players are all trying to do the same, get kills or stars, and the easiest way to get stars is to kill.The game is a fun strategy board game with lots of elements to it, i recommend giving online a spin as some aren't fussed on campaign (though i like it), campaign does offer a lot of extra game play though. There is also a shop mode where you can buy colours and maps, characters and sometimes event items. The best thing for this game is the community, most players are friendly and love to chat whilst playing (not them horrible awkward silences or raging rooms like in other games), everyone likes a laugh which is easy as they just laugh at what is happening (this is varied from themselves to others around the board) or just make fun talk about characters playing.The game sounds simple but can be tough but it is very fun and quite addictive, once you get into online and understand the basics of the game you will grow to love it, i do reccomend giving it a chance if your start is slow as when i first played i was confused and got nothing, but i tried for a day or two and now it's my most played gamed!100% best game of the world, 121/10.PS - even dlc is worth having, it is generally inexpensive and costs nothing more a bar of chocolate from the shops but adds new characters (and in one case, campaign), new cards which both enhance the gameplay massively!

												Poppo stole my heart, my time, and my pudding.100% Orange Juice is a lighthearted game of dice, in which you play as one of a large selection of unique characters.  It offers a large variety of fun and interesting playstyles, all of which will inevitably still be at the mercy of the cruel, unfeeling wrath of the RNG.Pros:+Lots of characters with ongoing support from Fruitbat Factory to maintain game balance+They finally added a random filter to allow you to turn certain maps, characters, and field events off while still maintaining an exciting sense of unpredictability+DLC done right--not required to enjoy the game, but provides interesting elements to gameplay+Game doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither does its community.+The AI will inevitably do something so ridiculous that you can't help but roll your eyes and laugh+Excellent game to play with friends+Manageable Achievements--While there are a couple you'll need to boost for, none are at the level of being tediousCons:-Fernet, QP, and Softened Tomomo-Singleplayer campaign required to unlock all characters, but will make you want to pull your hair out-Associated difficulties for initial character choice are misleading, causing many newbies to pick QP when Marc is a much more newbie-friendly choice.

Soon after, you'll be selling off all of your possessions (including your body) just to roll anything above a 3. After you lose everything you'll be attempting to find leprecauns and unicorns just to suck their luck taps for that sweet sweet luck nectar. ~Written from a stolen computer because I already sold mine.The DLC has two new characters which I'm pretty sure are rigged to roll a one, or two if you're lucky.

												100% Orange Juice is a neat little digital board game that has great overall gameplay and a hilarious set of intertwining storylines and characters. The music and sound effects, as well as the squeaky voice that speaks out what tiles you land on make it a very intense (And annoying for the people around you) game to play, especially if it's set to super fast mode once you get used to basic gameplay.As with any board game, it might seem hard to pick up at first, especially the end goal of the game that you work towards (it took me a long time to figure that one out)- reading a guide before diving in head first is probably recommended. But once you grasp what the basic tiles do it's all a case of learning your strategies with the  various trap and stock cards the game has.i have played for over 10 hours so far and have completed 2 of the 4 storylines that are available to me as well as an extra scenario, working towards getting all the achievements definitely means you get your moneys worth for playing time.

												100% Orange Juice is a boardgame kinda thing made with the characters of orange_juice's previous game. orange_juice is a doujin maker, For those who dont know. The goal in each game is to get 200 stars or 14 kills, Or both if RNG-sama loves you. The first to do so and land on their home wins, Pretty strait forward and simple. But lets be honest here, Nobody actually plays for some hardcore epic mlg gameplay. Everybody who plays this game really just play it for the good comunity. The orange_juice comunity is one of the more friendly and good comunitys out there, But when it comes to this game some people can get salty if RNG is a ♥♥♥♥♥. This is more of a nice pass time to spend with your friends with a nice game in the backround than a grab your icecream, ditch your family and wast your life away kinda game. This game is one of my favorite games due to many of the reasons i just listed. You will meet many good friends in this game too, I mean look at my 40+ friends that came from just this game. Of course you get bad people to (AHEM *cough* sci) that infect everybody and its a war to stay alive near them. But that isnt as frequent as making friends with this game. Now but this game, And tread carefully my friend, For you may find a poppo, Or worse... A summoner....			"

												The best board game for masochistic weeaboos that find their lives empty and meaningless. When I got this game, I was so bored with my life. I couldn't find enjoyment in the real world or on the internet. I spent my days doing nothing but rotting in front of my monitor, desperately searching for something that could reignite the spark of my life. Then I found 100% Orange Juice.Now instead of my life being empty and meaningless by my own hand, my life is empty and meaningless by the cruel hand of fate (and mother♥♥♥♥ing marie popo). Gone are the days where I sat emptily looking for happiness. I now know that happiness does not exist. There is only the continuous traversal of the game board. There is suffering in the form of dice-based battles. This game is merciless. It helps you understand just how futile your attempts at discovering meaning in your life are.10/10 would convert to nihilism again.			"

												I was reluctant to get this game at first thinking I wouldn't like it, but boy was I wrong. Now I find myself addicted to this game. The characters are cute and each have their own special quirk. Learning the game can take a little getting used to, but once you do you can start strategizing easily. There are a few boards that I dislike in this game, but it doesn't take away from the game at all. This game can turn upside down or backwards, so you can never really guess who wins since it's just really luck based.If I had to compare it to a game, I would say it's sort of like the classic Mario Party games, but with no minigames, and lots more fighting amongst each other. (especially if you're playing with your friends)			"

												This game gave me a 100% reasons more to hate seagulls even 100% more than the time that one s**t on my head some years ago in summertime..Seriously, it's a 100% awesome game, both in single and online multiplayer, and you cannot entirely progress 100% in the game and enjoy it 100% if you don't play both sides. It is 100% easy to play and understand, but 100% hard to manage and win. If you 100% love online gaming, this is 100% definitely your kind of stuff! Said by me, that I 100% don't like and 100% don't do online multiplayer session with any of my games, is an 100% extra super plus! But make 100% sure that you don't give it for Christmas to your 100% best friends, if you wanna 100% keep them and don't want to be hated 100% more than I hate seagulls. Mark: 100% / 10			"

												100% OJ is an interesting take on screwing your friends(or enemies) over in a traditional board game format brought to pc. Players each have a home tile and roll dice to move which can have several different outcomes such as fight a monster, earn free stars, lose stars, draw a card, teleport, and nothing. Once your goals are met you need to stop on your home tile or land on someone elses, and once you complete five ""norma"" (which are your self proclaimed missiosn such as get 100 stars or beat 9 enemies) you win. Conflict is solved by the attacker rolling a die, and the defender rolling a die after picking defend and evade with certain cards offering powerups.All in all this is a good game to play with friends to end your friendship, or to play with random people in the many different online servers to create new enemies.

												100% Orange Juice is a boardgame kinda thing made with the characters of orange_juice's previous game. orange_juice is a doujin maker, For those who dont know. The goal in each game is to get 200 stars or 14 kills, Or both if RNG-sama loves you. The first to do so and land on their home wins, Pretty strait forward and simple. But lets be honest here, Nobody actually plays for some hardcore epic mlg gameplay. Everybody who plays this game really just play it for the good comunity. The orange_juice comunity is one of the more friendly and good comunitys out there, But when it comes to this game some people can get salty if RNG is a ♥♥♥♥♥. This is more of a nice pass time to spend with your friends with a nice game in the backround than a grab your icecream, ditch your family and wast your life away kinda game. This game is one of my favorite games due to many of the reasons i just listed. You will meet many good friends in this game too, I mean look at my 40+ friends that came from just this game. Of course you get bad people to (AHEM *cough* sci) that infect everybody and its a war to stay alive near them. But that isnt as frequent as making friends with this game. Now but this game, And tread carefully my friend, For you may find a poppo, Or worse... A summoner....			"

												While some might criticize the choice strictly for the themes involved, 100% OJ is actually a very well-structured and fairly balanced game. Easy to learn but tough to master, it's nice to pass the time with and has plenty of replayability in terms of multiplayer and the near infinite combinations of decks, characters, and maps. There's also plenty to unlock in terms of cosmetics, and it's especially refreshing to see a game completely free of micro-transactions and the pay-to-win mentality, as none of the unlockables give any advantage, just spruce up characters to taste. Not to mention the game is still being supported years after release with content updates, DLCs, new achievements, and seasonal events.One bit of advice though: Stay off the boards. While at times friendly, the community is surprisingly elitist when it comes down to it, perhaps because the Fruitbat devs monitor their forums closely enough to equate feedback into rebalancing, and this has spoiled the recipients somewhat. That or they were just ****s to begin with. Decide for yourself.			"

It doesn't matter how well you plan your deck, how carefully you plan moves, how cautious you are about battles - if the Random Number Goddess isn't smiling down upon you, you will fail, and you will fail hard. And let's not even talk about the campaign mode. *shudders*....Okay, maybe I exaggerated a little. It's a fun board game with a lot of RNG, so don't take it too seriously. The music is good, there are plenty of unique characters to choose from, and the community is mostly nice and fun to play with. DLC releases and updates/bug fixes seem rather regular as well, so this game shouldn't be going away any time soon. All in all, if you like games like Mario Party or Dokapon Kingdom, you should really give this game a try - I guarantee you won't regret it!....I'm not joking about the campaign mode, though. I still have nightmares about Extreme difficulty... O_O'			"

												An amazing game. It follows a board game mechanic and is heavy on the RNG (so if you don't like RNG keep that in mind) but the player still has a lot of decisions to make on their own. I really like how the battle play out, and how you can chose to win the game through kills or collected stars. The characters all have different stats and theme music (not to mention they are absolutely adorable). The game is fun with friends, or just connecting with random people online. Good for relaxing, or you can go all out with strategy. Overall 11/10, great game <3 c:			"

												100% Orange Juice makes you love/hate your friends and RNGeesus who decides to troll your friends/you with the most insane of dice roll comparisons at the best/worst times. There's no outcome set in stone in orange juice, other than that madness and hilarity ensue in a cute package.One of the best party games I've played:It's very simple to get into and play.You can run this game on almost any kind of toaster.Core game has a lot of content and it's possible to use non-dlc cards and sometimes characters without owning them yourself.Each character has their own unique in-game theme and they're well composed.The style and rng make it impossible to take seriously. x)Orange juice also has a decent singleplayer mode through which you can unlock all the non-dlc characters. Just don't play on extreme mode unless you like to exprience the A.I. rolling with ""These dices have only fives and sixes on them!"".			"

												Remember that Mario Party game where the CPU would use Boo to steal your stars at the end, and steal the win in front of your face?Or maybe that Mario Kart race where you stayed in 1st place all along and in the last few seconds, you step on a banana and finish last?Well, you might as well expect that from this game too.It gets pretty addictive once you get in the game and get to know the abilities of each characters and the card effects.When you'll first get into a game, you will most likely go 'WTF is going on', but you'll catch up fast. You might get 90% of the basic gameplay strategy within the first 1-2 hours of gameplay.Best played with friends (or online with strangers). These CPU... Rigged dice...			"

												At the surface Orange Juice appears to be a anime Mario Party. That's also how I would describe to those who aren't familiar with 100% OJ. But Oj is actually a fun game that really captures the spirit of party boardgames, screwing each other over, collecting, multiple ways to win, but the main appeal for me is the amount of tactical depth in the game because of the prior elements. There are quite a few characters, with the DLC it's 20+ and each is different. This game can just be approached at so many different angles. Most people I've played with play it on the surface just as a boardgame but it is definitely possible to take the game way too seriously. Also for a boardgame there really isnt too much RNG.			"

												Somebody help. I can't stop.Pros - Best darn party game west of the mississippi. - Anime flavored mario party, but with honestly better mechanics and a rage inducing tendency to roll 1 on every die.- An actually friendly community means that all you loners out there don't have to worry that its a party game. If you say hi in chat, somebody will banter with you 9/10 times. That is a huge plus.- Characters actually feel different. Tactics game to game will be similar, but the characters give life and uniqueness to every match, be it the almighty seagull, or getting poppo'd when you least expect it.- The four button Single Player Speed Combo. Holding ctrl or shift speeds the game up. Holding ctrl+shift causes the game to run at dizzying speeds, making the single player slog that much easier.Cons - Do not under any circumstances expect the story to be forgiving. The game is RNG based in multiplayer, but in single player, cpu's roll higher based on difficulty, and the inherent randomness of the game just makes it more difficult. It's not impossible by any means, It just feels like inflated difficulty. Multiplayer is where this game is at.- Unlocking a large quantity of the characters requires playing said story mode.			"

												Hot Japanese ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Lives!  But in the best way possible.If you've ever had the baffling thrill of grabbing a random, Japanese tabletop style video game from an import shop or online (particularly in the heyday of the Dreamcast), then 100% Orange Juice is like a visit from a long lost friend.The rules are, without the instructions, indecipherable for the first 5 minutes. Then slowly you start to understand... and then realize you didn't understand, but you're winning... you think... and then the computer does something nuts and they win.And it seems like the game is aware of it! Play the demo. You'll take the role of a character who has had his wallet stolen by a girl who only says 'Popopo'. Amidst this nonsense, your character is able to deduce she stole your wallet and you have to challenge her to a battle. After winning the game, your character actually asks ""What happened? Who won?"".Visually the game has a nice, colorful style. Not a ton of animation, nor overly impressive effects, but totally acceptable. 100% Orange Juice has a crazy, MIDI sax and bass soundtrack that was very commonplace in most early 2000's import games. The far-east-space-jazz is punctuated with high pitched anime screams, and seiyu voice overs, exactly like you need it to be.The publisher is a genius for localizing this game, and not bothering with localized audio.For the gameplay, most of the reviews I've seen I agree with; It's unfair, capricous, rage inducing, awesome, and so much fun to play. It's like a guy who plays too much Chutes and Ladders, met a guy who is obsessed with Risk. They went to CoCo Ichiban in Akihabara, ate experimental curry, and decided to make a video game combining their passions.And instead of the light-RPG elements that you might expect, there are instead light-CCG elements, and it's fun to unlock booster packs!Stay wierd, Japan. The world needs you more than ever.			"

												100% Salty.I've played mario party with hardcore ultra-competitive types. The kind of people who practice the mini-games and expect no less of you. I have seen saltyness that would make looking back at sodom seem low sodium heart friendly. This game puts all that to shame. Every character has a unique way to be annoying as ♥♥♥♥. Every map has a way of ♥♥♥♥ing you over. You can choose to prioritize coins or combat to complete normas (akin of getting stars in mario party) but you'll always complete the one you didn't select first. In short 10/10 perfect party game.

Pros:- A wide cast of characters to fit any play style you may want to have.- Amazing soundtracks for each character.- Simple to get into (I won the first three games I played without ever playing the game before).- Extremely fun and addicting gameplay that hooks  you in for hours on end (you only need to glance at my play time to see this.- A decent single player mode for when nobody is playing (which is rare but usually early morning especially in Europe).- A very small community so you will often know who you are playing with.- If you don't want to talk to people you can just not... but socialising makes the game much more enjoyable.- You actually get to choose what room you go into, so if you run into some really obnoxious people... you can just leave and go somewhere else.Cons:- A huge portion of the soundtrack was meant not to loop, so when it does it feels unnatural... at least to me.- The story is basically the same whichever path you choose, with minor changes.Basically, if you enjoy the format of board games but have nobody to play with, get 100% OJ. If not... get 100% OJ, unless you hate enjoyable games, in which case don't.			"

												This is a fun little board game to play with friends. It's fast paced and action packed. Before play you construct a deck from available cards, this deck is then shuffled into a central deck with all the cards from the other players.You travel around the board collecting stars or battling for victory points.  Once enough stars or battles have been fought your character can level up. Providing access to stronger cards. The first player to reach level ""6"" wins the game.Each character has its own stats and unique hyper ability, which adds some flavour the the characters.The game has some issues though. The ai's dice is loaded (which can get annoying, especially in the campaign), and lack of card variety causes the gameplay to become stale after awhile. 7/10			"

												At the surface Orange Juice appears to be a anime Mario Party. That's also how I would describe to those who aren't familiar with 100% OJ. But Oj is actually a fun game that really captures the spirit of party boardgames, screwing each other over, collecting, multiple ways to win, but the main appeal for me is the amount of tactical depth in the game because of the prior elements. There are quite a few characters, with the DLC it's 20+ and each is different. This game can just be approached at so many different angles. Most people I've played with play it on the surface just as a boardgame but it is definitely possible to take the game way too seriously. Also for a boardgame there really isnt too much RNG.			"

												An anime-based strategy board game that combines combat and card playing in competition to achieve a chosen goal and earn the highest level. And I use the term strategy loosely, you will depend on luck... ALOT. Seriously, I mean, ALOT. You could be right about to win and just constantly keep getting the worst rolls until someone else catches up and wins ahead of you. You could get stunned for turns on end because every 'Random KO' card that keeps getting played lands right on you for no particular reason. It wouldn't be such a big deal if games didn't take forever to complete, around 20-60 minutes a game. I mean, the RNG is a problem in almost any board game but this game appears to be atleast 70-80% luck, 15% strategy, and the rest just relying on the other players not having a vendetta against you.Even through it's flaws though I still can't stop playing it. The characters are all engaging and you can sort of build your strategy by placing your own cards in the global deck. You can choose to focus on turn-locking players, design your cards for pure combat, or design your cards to gain more stars. All excellent ways to win as you can level up either by having stars or having combat wins.This game truly shines in it's PvP area, which really seems like the only truly enjoyable part about this game. Playing in PvE is one of the most annoying things as it seems like everything is set up just to make the player lose and the AI win, even on normal. In PvP you'll still see players that seem to win every single roll, I've been beaten by players 15 times in a row even when I've had +5 stats and they had no buffs. Almost any game I've played I'll be right about to win and the entire cosmos will seem to turn against me to make sure there is no hope for me to win.  Just somehow it seems much more enjoyable when you atleast have other players having just as bad luck as you are.3/5I'm about to win and the boss comes over and one-shots me. As soon as I revive a random player uses a KO card, then when I revive I get hit by two damage cards and the boss comes back and finishes me off then proceeds to win the game. You either love or hate the random number generator...			"

												I can't fully remember how I got hold of this game. I think one of my friends was like 'OMG LETS PLAY 100% ORANGE JUICE!' and I bought a four pack and then we played it and it was pretty hilarious.I dunno if 'someone' buying the game 'alone' will have quite as much enjoyment though. It feels like a board game you stream while drunk and asking everyone if they think you can juggle your alchohol bottles or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ At the same time it's really cutesy and the friends I played with really enjoyed the art style. I think it's cute too and really fun. I'm not really a 'PG' type person but this game is great in the regards that you can be an adult and still have a crap load of fun.As far as the game goes it's a mix of mario and...something where you draw cards with special abilities. Then you use the cards to mess with your friends or make yourself better. If you land on combat squares or another player you can 'fight' them which is a little quick battle where you both roll. Combat is super simple, but effective. If you defend, the offenders attack is reduced by your defense down to a min of 1. If you evade, you only take damage if they roll equal or more. Simple and pretty well thought out though.You win by getting I think 5 stars first and you get to choose if you have to win X battles or get X points and then you get a star.I have to say this is one of the few games that I have never heard anything bad about and I can see why, though EF the freakin AI in the singleplayer. I keep Effing losing what the hell. RNG love me only when I am kicking my friends butts and even then Aellwine somehow pulls some♥♥♥♥♥♥out of his♥♥♥♥♥and gets max stars first you cheating piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Board games are fun, but whenever I played Monopoly with my friends, we’d always give up playing midway through. The reason for that is quite simple – after some time, most of the board games get repetitive, and if they take too long to end, you’ll get bored and you’re likely to lose your will to keep playing. Despite it all, I've heard so many people saying good things about 100% OJ and the game itself seemed so interesting that I decided to put aside my uncertainties and give the game a shot. The moment I pressed the play button, my fate was sealed.100% OJ got me hooked because each play will never be the same and it never gets boring, no matter how much or how long you play it. It’s a game played on an ever-changing environment where you can either battle your way through victory or try to grasp it while aiming for the stars – the choice is yours! You won’t even notice it doesn’t have a story to go along with it because it’s not necessary – that’s not why we’re here anyways! Besides, the best part is playing against your friends or other players online.11/10			"

												A fun little board game, seems to be a twist on Sugoroku, with an interesting story mode added on. It can get infuriating when RNG decides to go completely against you, but nothing can be done there. Achievements all rely on luck (which is fair for a board game, and some require bad luck as well).If you're into board games, I'd suggest looking into this one, low price (even when at full price), low requirements, and cheap DLC are all positives as well.

												100% Orange Juice is a board game developed by the Japanese indie developer Orange_Juice, and features the cast from all their previous games. I personally put of buying the game because I thought I'd need to know the characters, but after playing the game I realized that knowledge wasn't necessary. As for the game itself, it is described by many as really hard, mainly because of how much it uses RNG to determine outcomes. I do however think that this builds into one of the game's main strengths. Because while luck is important, just as important is your ability to manipulate that luck using the cards that you're given. And that leads me to another very interesting mechanic of the game. Because the game is also a deckbuilding game. Every player creates a deck of 10 cards, and then all the decks created are shuffled together, and it's this pile of cards the players draw from. This creates strategic choices where you have choose the cards that are good for your character, but not good for the other characters.All in all, I think 100% OJ is a great game that anyone who's interested in board games should try out.

I have the exp. Now the only fun part of this is playing with your friends and the worst part is doing the story mode because you want to unlock your waifu but with each failure you really need to sit down and ask ""Is she worth it?""

												Perfect for those moments when you want to gather some friends, get in a voice chat and scream at each other.Joking aside, I like the variety this game has to offer. Once you've gathered some stars and begin browsing the shop, you can mix and match characters and cards to create any play style you like.The singleplayer campaign's main purpose is to help unlock new characters. Beware the later episodes.The DLC is entirely optional, and only expands further on the game's variety.			"

TL;DRI like the game, good price, RNG hates you, fun with friends every now and then if you like the board game style ProsAdjustable speed settingsMusicBrutalConsSounds Gameplay I like the game, honestly. It's fun to play and quite brutal in the fact a match is a mix of different playstles and objectives, mixed with luck/RNG. The way to win a game is to complete objectives, or Norma. The objectives are either to collect stars, and you can choose to play passively like this, or to defeat enemies/monsters on the board, so a more aggressive play-style. Stars is a safer style but you run the risk of losing half your stars on being knocked unconscious, and playing aggressive is riskier but more fast paced if you spend the game hunting things down and killing them. (And make everyone else annoyed with you and consequently revenge hunt.) You can defend attacks and take a set amount of damage, or evade to take no damage, or tank the full amount if you fail to dodge.Luck is not going to always be on your side, especially with the traps and events set around the board. But ah well.It's simple mechanics that can be massively sped up if you want a faster paced game, and I like that, especially as I can get bored fast if I have to spend too much time on the turns or waiting for my turn. Graphics are chibi anime style, nothing special but cute enough.Deceivingly cute when that adorable dog girl is beating you unconscious.I like the game but I wouldn't want to play it for too long. The sounds are ok, but if you hear them happening throughout the duration of a game it gets fast annoying, so I would honestly prefer to play without sound. However the music you can leave on in my opinion. Want moar? Click here to join my steam group and Click here to follow my curator page! "

100% Orange Juice ReviewWhat kind of game is this? How do you play? What do you do?100% orange juice is a bored game with trading card elements. You move around the board trying to complete one of two task, killing others or gathering stars. You gather/lose stars by landing on spaces and rolling a die. You kill people by rolling a die to attack, and defend. You collect a portion of their stars if you kill them. Cards play a role by allowing you to build decks. You will draw a card from yor deck every time you land on a specific space. Cards can deal damage, give stat buffs, of be hidden traps on spaces.Controls This game is controlled entirely by the mouse; it works just fine. 10/10SoundThe game sounds fine and the voice acting is pretty good, with options to change the voice, or turn it off. 10/10 Graphics The game is not graphically intensive, and will run fine on almost any machine. The game has no 3D sprites, but looks great anyway. 10/10Difficulty The difficulty is not regulated too well. It has options, but when it comes down to it, it’s an RNG determining your fate half the time. 6/10Story The story doesn’t matter at all. The game has several story lines for each character. None of them are fantastic, but they don’t need to be. 7/10Multiplayer The game works well in online multiplayer, it is the ideal way to play. 10/10Overall this game is a great multiplayer experience, but you can play single player to grind for new cards and got some practice. (Learning how to play cards and where you should go next in your play style.) This game gets an 8/10. Strongly Recommended, especially with friends.			"

												I thought that this game might be fun for me and my friends. This game is pretty hard. Luckily, me and my friends aren't bad losers. We play this game together and laugh at every sudden turn of events. This boardgame is a lot luck-based but pretty strategic as well. But because this game is luck-based, all my friends win once and a while keeping it fun. I bought the four-pack for 5 euro's, thinking I would get an hour of 3-5 in the game with friends. Time goes by extremely fast playing this game. And that's good. It's means I'm having fun. It makes me think of strategies, try new characters en have fun with my friends. If you're into games that are pretty much luck-based and just want to have fun. Buy this game, on sale is best.Bonus: Have a look at the community hub for art. Lots of jokes about the hated playable character: Mariepoppo. You'll understand within an hour why.			"

												I'll admit this game can be challenging, but regardless I'm hooked.100% Orange Juice is a fun little game, especially against friends, the AI can be annoying, but I've still found it easy to turn the game against them.While playing this you need to keep on your toes, any mistake can pretty much end with you losing, play wisely and you will succeed.It's overall a challenge, but still fun to play, definitely worth the small amount of money it costs.

												If you're into the whole 'Kawaii-Ness' of japanese chibi characters, then this game is already worth it.Despite having gotten it during the summer 2014 steam sale, I would of easily bought this at its' full price, due to the fun and interest in the game.The game itself is basically a form of board game where you have to complete tasks (normas) either by getting 'stars' (granted by either the end of a 'chapter' by defeating a CPU, Player, or Flash Enemy, or by landing on a bonus tile), or by getting wins (granted by defeating a CPU, Player, or Flash Enemy).You're allowed to start of as four different characters (Sugure, QP, Kai, and Marc) and progress through their campaigns, which allows you to amass star points, which can then be used to unlock other characters which are unlocked for buying through the campaigns. Each character has a different specialty in terms of skills (Attack, Defense, and Evasion) and each have different hypers (Unique skills that attune to a specific character, an example being Marc's 16x Big Cannon, which damages a specific character in attunement with how many 'star levels' that Marc has.)Overall, the game is filled with kawaii, board games, a little bit of friendly murderous rivalry, and a lot of fun.

I have met (mostly) really kind people that I had a blast playing with. Some other reviews say this game is similar to Mario Party, but only really in the board game-ish aspect. This game is fairly simple, and the art is very lovely and infinitely cute.  It is wonderful and I would definitely say 10/10 would recommend, and play again and again until I pass out.			"

The Chibi Art style works really well.Brings characters from other Orange Juice developer titles such as Suguri, QP Shooting Dangerous, and Flying Red Barrel.Dice rolls can either bring sweet victory or salty defeat. Different cards can change entire situations around.Would recommend playing with friends.			"

												Welcome to Orange Juice's Board game where you and your friends (or imaginary friends if you dont have them) can have a fun time playing a game of diceBefore i say anything... This is actually a crossover game between their already existing games like ""flying red barrel"", ""Suguri"" , ""QP shooting"" and some others i probably dont remember but now onto the review100% orange juice is like i said a board game made by orange juice and localised by Fruit Bat FactorySo the first time you look at it you are probably thinking ""hey this look like fortune street and or mario party"" but this game uses a stars and card system much like mario party's items and coins but rather than trying to collect as many stars you can you have to ""level up"" your norma level... how would you do that you ask? you can level up the first time by gaining 10 stars and further down a line pick between battling and collecting more stars but im sorry if you are reading this since i have a hard time not explaining everythingthis game allows you to create a deck of a few cards that do various things as well as use character that all have various stats and plenty of campaigns to go through. as i havent beaten my first campaign yet there are 4 characters you can pick from to start with each of them having some sort of penalty and buff to themselves as well as their own hyper card which are mixed into the deck (hyper cards can only be drawn by their specific character but if you draw a hyper card the other players will have a lower chance of drawing one themselves) you can obtain said cards by earning stars by winning or losing a game and buying packs of cards much like a trading card game and before you ask... there is no such thing as trading but... you can trade the cards you earn on steam... that counts right?so you heard me mention about statsin this game rather than mini games you get battles as i mentioned before being one of the requirements you can pick to level upso in battles you have 3 base stats atk, def and evasion and you each get to roll your dice once (unless a card says so otherwise) the player who starts the battle goes first and has roll for atk if you roll a 6 you have a 6 hit atk simple as that but the second player defending is able to defend or evade if you defend the same thing as atk applies if you roll a 6 you take only 1 damage but if you choose to evade you can negate the damage completely by rolling higher than the amount of atk but if you roll lower than the atk you take the full damage ofcourse the stats on your characters are applies to these actions if you have +1 atk you get you dice result +1 as the same thing counts for defence and evasionbut enough talking about how the game plays out because im pretty sure i confused you all enough and explained too much about the gamethe game in general can be pretty pretty hard depending on your dice rolls and the a.i is going to try and take you down and each character follows a specific pattern or behaviour and tends to try and prevent you from winning as much as you canthanks to the localization team the online of this game is improved by alot compared to its original releasebecause in the english version you have lobbies that are supported by steam and makes it alot easier to set something up with your friends and maybe even strangers and online you get to level up and earn exp which was never implemented in the original gamein general i really think you should get this game if you like board gamesits a fun game and it doesnt take itself seriouslyif i ruined the game for you i take all responsibility but dont hate me for it... hey maybe if your lucky you will bump into me online			"

												I realy like this game because it´s a nice mix of board game, strategy game, dice fighting game, card game and lolicon with a splash of orange juice.The soundtrack is a good japanese standard and the board and background are a little bit minimalistic.You really need a little control to not pursue your monitor, because luck is an important part of your strategy.If you are a bad loser this game is seriously not for you.And here are tipps for beginner:1. Before you buy this game you can play the demo to be sure you realy want to play it or not.2. Before you start playing move the gamespeed in the options on slow because ""normal"" is realy fast for beginner and you maybe don´t understand what´s going on.I wish a lot of fun alone or with friends.

												Honestly, I thought this was gonna be one of those games that says ""generic game"" But this...is one crazy game that I cannot put down. There is no definite way of winning and the odds of winning are random. Victory could be in your hands till you roll an unlucky number and lose it all. For games that drives me crazy like that, I am glad I have the experience of playing this game.

												++My Way Of Thinking When I Play Games++""Now that we have countless games to try, we do not experience the same feeling of having a game for ourselves, and nothing else than that, that is why we find the negative aspects quicker than when we were young, games were fun, even the now called ''Bad Games''. If you give this game a try, do not be afraid and play it like you did when you were young.""++Quick Intro Containing Information Of How Much This Game Means To Me++Before I give my opinion of this game, I really have to go back to when I was a child, you would ask, why?. . . Well It is quite obvious that as you can see, one first look at this game it could remind you of Mario Party.I only played Mario Party 1, 2 and 3 when I was a kid, but that doesn't really matter here, or does it?. In fact, it kind of does, because when I first saw this game I felt like it was Mario Party, but with Weird anime girl and probably some P. . .Things that could scare anyone who's not into this or not even into anime. But, I once saw this game discounted 75% OFF, I said to myself ""Okay I'll try it and then if I dislike it I will instantly refund it"". . . Oh how wrong was I the whole time. . .This game became part of my life as on how easy it is to connect with people, spectate, join as the match is currently being played, and the community, funny as hell, and well, this game got me so happy that I bought it 8 TIMES, now why did I buy it 8 times you ask?. . . I bought it so my friends could play with me. 7 out of 8 loved it and we still play it these days. Now, again what did I do or say that got me into this game?.++Important Words That Got Me Into Playing This Game++I cleared my mind and said to myself ""let's try something new"", now why I was able to do this?, mostly because of the new steam Refunds that you can now refund any game quickly without losing anything, which is a great feature I am really glad they added it!.++The Review++//Positive Aspects\\ Have you ever heard of Jonathan The Seagull? - You will after you play this game ""7""[+] The gameplay of this game is quite great, each character has their Pros and Cons, as in my opinion everything is quite balanced, you are not forced to play a certain character or pick a certain card as everything is usually RANDOM, so it's not a game that you have to always win or you will be thinking of winning. That is why these are the 10 Pros I could find in this game~.1[+] As  I said earlier, 100% Orange Juice has a great Multiplayer, that you can easily join anyone's match while playing, specate, straight up join as a random character that is currenlty playing and well as a cards game, you will not have lag. It's  in my opinion the perfect casual game you can try on Steam.2[+] If you are into Anime you'll find some of these characters funny or cute as they all have their wacky stories in story mode, plus some of them come from different games from the Developer Orange_Juice, if you want more detailed story, you can play the other games where those Wacky Characters appear.3[+] In order to unlock some Characters you will need to finish the story mode, which is. . . not the main appeal of the game, don't worry, I will add this to the Cons, but why do I place this here?. Well it is because there's a fast forward button that let's you just click and hope for the best to be able to complete it as soon as possible [Ctrl + Shift], even they knew that the Story Mode was going to suck so they added that.4[+] Everyone has their own way of playing, you can either choose Stars or Battles:A: Each Character has Stars, which are won by stopping by Yellow Panels to earn some depending on the Dice you throw, you Throw 6 , you get 6 Stars. Which help you to level up if you are aiming for StarsB: If you dislike playing like this, you can test your luck in Battles, and earn ""Battle Points"", each time you step on a Red Panel you will have to fight a Minion, they are quite tough, so you need a proper character to face them sometimes, or you can aim for the other Characters instead, and if you win you Earn 2 Wins instead of 1.5[+] There's so many ways to play this game, and I will try not to spoiler you the ones I use because they are kind of tricky.6[+]Each Character has their own Unique Stats like:A: They all have their Attack - Defense and Evasive stats, that makes your Dice change depending on how much you have on those, suppose if you are attacking, if you throw the dice and it shows that you got a 6. And you have +2 of Attack, your dice will do 8 of AttackB: They all have their own ""Ultimate Cards"", that difference each other from the rest, one throws a card that Upgrades your Character so you can throw 2 Dices for a Round, the other one steals Stars from your enemies, and so onC: And who could forget the ones that have like 7 HP. . .7[+] Some of the Skins that you could but, that dress your Character differently are purchased in the game with Money that you receive in online matches or in the story mode.8[+] The game is so quick that you won't care if you lose, as long as you have a blast and make some friends!~.9[+] The soundtrack is AWESOME for some characters10[+] THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE: The community helped me understand how the game works, as there isn't any tutorial that explains you everything, it is a great feeling when you are part of that community, and you can teach anyone you see that is having a hard time.//Negative Aspects\\ YOU RUINED MY SONG I WILL KILL YOU![-] Now I don't think this game is for everyone, as you could only play games to win, or seriously, I would recommend you to skip this one, if you are someone in that side. You will get frustated at these things:1[-] Sometimes you are winning and having a streak in your game , but suddenly you step on a card that demolishes your HP to 1. . .someone kills you and then you lose all your stars and they win. And you are like ""It's fine"". . .2[-] Some characters have to be purchased as DLC, they aren't strong but they add mix to the game, honestly this game feels like It is worth $15 so I am not really angry to see that there are these many DLCs, plus they  are $1 each when they are Discounted. . . well some of them3[-] You will dislike it at first as the game pretty much doesn't explain you anything, at all, the community in this game HAS TO4[-] Sometimes you are listening to some character's soundtrack when they level up and then boom. . .that music is gone because someone else leveled up5[-] Some people play in Normal Speed, as you will find it quite slooow compared to the Really Fast one, if you are the one playing all the time in that oneOverall: I am honestly running out of ideas of what else could be wrong at this game, becase everything that I said I think it wasn't that bad at all, you can easily ignore all the bad things I said and jump into a match, as I can honestly tell that you are going to have a blast in one match, as you won't be able to stop playing. It really is a great game that I have found, and I'm so happy that I had to dedicate it a Serious Review, it really feels unique and fun. If you are a fan of Casual Games, then consider giving a try to this game!~.			"

												This game is basically RNG incarnate, but, it still has major strategical choices such as which paths to take which battles to avoid and when to save and use your cards which alter the outcome of the game, HOWEVER, the entirety of the game is based on your movement and ability with the dice therefore it is entirely possible you are beaten by a chicken even though you're the strongest character in the game *cough*Tomomo/Sherry*cough*.The game has a strategic element of deckbuilding <however your cards are mixed with ALL the other players cards in the center deck for all to draw! so each character's deck should be the most advantageous to you while being disadvantageous to others if possible.>, to add to that each character <aside from enemy characters> have a unique hyper ability which is what the characters are generally built around, For example, the hyper ability of Alte is such that it is able to be deployed in battle, if you lose that battle(Alte), you self destruct, you permantnely gain +1 atk for the remainder of the match up to a maximum of 3, which is an incredibly high attack value and if achieved the highest of any playable character to consistently have... In addition some characters play more uniquely, such as Mixed Poppo who is able to gain abilities based on her level and landing on a warp panel... overall all the characters feel and play uniquely and none feel too gimmicky, other than the playable enemy characters[non boss, like chicken, roboball and seagull who just have baseline weak stats and no real special abilities to speak of.]I wholly recommend this game and all of its dlc, you'll have a blast, even if you just play with public groups, the community in this game is great, plus communication isn't necessarily key, so  you can have fun even when the game room is quiet, the soundtrack is also great, each character has their own unique soundtrack and there really isn't one thing I can think of that is a fault for this game, it's truly the best original board game on steam, don't pass it up just because of the anime graphics... there's a deep game underneath the cute exterior that has hundreds of hours of replayability with all the dlc and possibilities.

												My new favorite board game. Also, a lackluster TCG and fast-paced RPG.Do not be fooled by the cutesy graphics. This is a very well-developed game.Starting with the trading card game elements, there aren't very many cards and there's no trading. Still, this game uses a rather clever solution for balance: each player picks a handful of cards from their own collection and those get put into a communal deck to be used by any player. When selecting cards, you have to weigh the value of how much it can help you if you get it against the impact of it being used by another player. Card types include ""boost,"" ""trap,"" ""battle,"" and ""unit"" cards.On the RPG side of things, there are a few selectable characters who each have their own short, comedic story, but these stories aren't really focused on enough to be factored into the decision to purchase the game. Each character has different stats; one has +0 to all stats while another has +2 attack and -1 defense and evasion while yet another has +1 to all while having reduced HP. These stats can only be changed temporarily by using cards; there are no stat level ups, which helps keep things from getting too imbalanced. Having low values for all these stats helps make combat go faster. The stats are added to the value of die rolls to determine damage, and when you only have ~5 max HP, every point matters. Each character also has their own unique ""hyper"" ability that is activated by cards in the communal deck.During combat, the attacker rolls first. The defender then chooses whether to defend or attempt to evade. After the aggressor's attack, the victim then counterattacks with the same mechanics if they were not slain.While the characters do not gain experience, stats, or abilities, you (the player) do. Each match played online gives experience based on how well you ended up doing and level ups unlock more stuff to purchase in the shop including more characters.The boardgame mixes strategy with luck. There's enough luck involved that a player who is down is not truly out until the game's finished, and a player with a large lead is not safe until landing on the finish. I've seen many examples of come-from-behind victories and large leads falling to pieces, and these ups and downs help keep the game fun and interesting when playing with other players. As far as strategy goes, you can pick routes when the path branches (altering the distance to home), you pick when to play cards, and when passing another player you can choose to stop on their square and battle them with victory awarding you half their stars and +2 win points. The goal of the game is to meet an ever increasing goal of either stars or combat wins (player's choice) and reach a home point to turn in that goal (and thus reach the next goal tier, with 5 being the final tier, earning victory when cleared). Wins always go up but can be difficult to get while stars are easier to earn yet just as easy to lose. There are also plenty of boards with very different layouts which helps the game stay fun after multiple play sessions.The game is mostly suited for online play (though it does have a single player campaign and free mode), and it has a few things of note in that area. The game uses Steam servers to form lobbies and you can have a match with random players. During a normal turn, you get 60 seconds before the AI takes over for you, so it's not too much of a problem if players leave their keyboard for a bit. When attacked, you are given 40 seconds to decide what to do, but the other player's clock freezes after they make a choice, so you can't outwait them for the sake of taking advantage of enemy AI. When doing a revival roll, you are given less time.Addtionally, Fruitbat Factory has been quite active in the community as well as busy adding content and rebalancing things.Verdict:The game looks quirky enough that I wouldn't normally recommend it, but it makes for one heck of a cheap party game. If you and up to 3 friends are looking for a casual game to play online in which all players remain on equal ground and can get this cheap, it comes highly recommended. If you do not have 3 friends, bots or random players will fill in the missing spots.			"

												A cute board game crossed with a TCG, 100% Orange Juice is a fun little time-waster, albeit wasting anywhere from 30-60 minutes a shot.

												100% guaranteed to turn you into a masochist.You will play.You will rage.You will make bad rolls.You will not find the RNG God is with you.You will lose all your friends.You will become addicted and find out, to your horror, that you cannot stop....And you will LIKE IT!10/10 will need rehab.----------------Seriously, though, this game is amazing.  While some audiences might be put off by certain aspects of this game's ""cover"", the game itself is actually very fun with replay value through the roof!  The game is balanced, well-developed, and surprisingly deep.  While RNG elements are very prevalent in this game, there is a certain amount of skill introduced with the cards, battle system, and choosing your path on the board (ie. where to go, who to fight, and whether or not to stop at home).  The battle system is simple, yet not any more or less so than necessary.  The characters are all balanced and the varying stats between them is a welcome difference as compared to Mario Party.  The multiplayer is only lacking because there aren't enough people playing this game yet (which needs to change).  But the people there so far are amazing.  I hop into the middle of a game as a spectator and made a new friends before even becoming a player (and it wasn't a random FR, for the record).Everything balances out in terms of randomness and difficulty.  You'll find yourself having days where you can't win anything, and then you'll bne like me where you win 3 MP games in a row as Yuki, then come in second to Yuki on Tomomo's board, only to win against Tomomo the following round and feel like a lumberjacking boss.  Anyone can win/lose to anyone else.  No two games ever wind up the same, and even the DLC is balanced.More constant fun than many games give you for significantly less than any AAA title on the market.Seriously, 10/10.  Would rage buy agian.  (Probably will; it'd make a Nice Present for my friends.)But Tomomo is stll a trucking pain in the donkey. "

												Here's a bit of what you can expect from the game:Good multiplayer chance game, with strategic elements (especially the cards: you can put a quarter of the 40 cards in the deck). Pretty fun, pretty anger inducing, mostly for single-player where the game is rigged to make it more challenging (bad method, in my opinion). With the latest 1.7 update, things are looking pretty good, with some character customization (visual), difficulty levels, more drop-ables in multiplayer, saving decks per character, and other fixes. Game could definitely use some pop-up help info on some things, but you'll get it as you go anyhow. Those who are less-skilled definitely have a chance at winning, which is good news for some, and according to one self-proclaimed such person, chance makes it less anger-inducing when they lose, so your mileage will vary on that. At least 11 characters not counting enemy/boss playable characters (Final boss is bannable) make for some decent variety, each with dice-roll-altering stats, and a special ""Hyper"" card that individualizes to them on draw (though if hands get randomized, shenanigans can happen). Seems fairly balanced, though I'm still relatively new (I've beat 2/4 campaigns and 1/4 ""extra"" stages at this point, multiplayer level 11).  Play at a higher game speed for mplay, as the timer currently runs out while your character is moving around and such, and the timer is unaffected by the speed. Get the 4-pack, as it's great to have people you know involved.[Compatibility: One issue with this latest patch is that the user.dat file format has increased in size over 10x, probably making it no longer compatible with non-steam versions (I have both) via transferring to the old non-steam version. I was previously bringing that file with my profile in it over to the old version to play with someone who apparently has difficulties with the steam mplay user interface.]			"

												This game is enjoyable to play alone or with others online, although if you do play online, it adds so much more fun to it. When you end up spending most of your time thinking of what actions to take.Roll a 4, Land on a Bonus Tile, Attack the other player, or not. Use the cards wisely, but it is all for fun. End up wanting to play one game, then before you know it, you have played 5 hours worth in one afternoon. I highly recommend this game for those who want to just spend it having fun. c:			"

												This game.I bought this game as a joke to play with my friends, but it turned out to be a great buy for it's small price.Along with it's cute design and amazing soundtrack, it is actually very addictive. This game that is best experienced being played along with your friends. It has all the evil of Mario Party BUT without the anger. Single player is also amazing. You start with 4 story lines and the more you progress, the more characters and stories you unlock. So, even if you are playing by yourself, you will still have fun. I love it.10/10			"

												I originally received 100% Orange from a friend who wanted to try out the multiplayer system, and wanted to take advantage of the system to troll me. I obliged, and lost horribly the first game I played because I didn't read the instructions. This is not to say I have gotten much better, but the game has definetly grown on me, even if in the process I have been killed by seagulls, chickens, every single boss, my friend, bombs, and (possibly worst of all) AI Poppo. Praise the almighty randomness. If you could get the achievement for failing to revive in the final roll more than once, I would have gotten it multiple times already.This is a surprisingly fun game to play with other people, and I ended up getting it for a couple other friends (on sale, granted). One thing to keep in mind is that it is probably better not to play it after you had a bad day, as you can either be blessed by the dice or not. And, needless to say, the random nature of the game (and how quickly you can go from the lead to the bottom) will definetly be enjoyed by some, but hated by others. Keep in mind that, ultimately, the same seagull that you cheered on as they defeated your competition, might one day kill you too.  "

												If you want to play this game, and you should, you better be a forgiving person.RNG is going to ♥♥♥♥ you over so many times you'll never want to drink orange juice again due to the PTSD you'll have gotten from this game.Soon all hope of ever achieving anything will evaporate from your life.The game will play cheery music as you roll 2's every time you get KO'ed so you can't get revived.The AI will use boost cards that get them to 10+ attack so you can't really do anything to survive.Somehow they will always roll what they need in order to land on the home tile.And if you do somehow win, just know that every level you progress in a campaign, the more the cute characters want you to fail.This game is 20% skill, 10% luck and 70% RNG bias against you.Rather, we should rename this game ""100% NotWhatYouWantedToRoll""Anyways, it is a whole lot of fun, and muliplayer is good too. If you don't like the RNG bias, then play the campaigns on casual. You'll have a great time, I promise.			"

												This game is hard to explain to people who haven't heard or seen it before. It is a very, very luck based board game, in which you kill your opponents and enemies in order to gain wins and stars. Get enough of either, and you can win. Despite being very luck based, it still has a bit of skill and strategy throughout the game. Using various cards and judgement, you can sway the game in your favor just so slightly. The visuals of the game are very pleasing, nothing looks terrible. The music is amazing, especially some of the DLC characters. It may not be a game for everyone, but it is a game you can love (and hate at times) with friends.And you will die. To seagulls. A lot. (Other enemies/characters, but mostly seagulls. Not even kidding)I suggest if you haven't played this game, at least give the demo a go. A fun game that has lots of replayability, especially with friends. You never know what will happen in any specific game of 100% Orange Juice.			"

												The reason Steam needs an ""ehhhhhh"" option for recommendations is games like this.-Are you a weeaboo? Like, body pillow of Homura Akemi, Naruto headband and box of Pocky level of weeaboo? Then you'll like this game despite everything following this. OMG SO KAWAII DESU NE XDD SUGOI-AI is rigged often and you need to trap card them if you want to win (This is a game where AI difficulty = AI's luck increased, so they will ALWAYS have their best card and will almost ALWAYS roll 5+ if they're not Mariepoppo)-Don't go into this game for BIOWARE KWALETEE STORYTELLING because there is none to be found. Every character could be summed up accurately in a -dere or just one other trope. They appear to be from other games, but I don't think anyone in the West (including myself) understands where they're from. It feels similar to having Opa-Opa in Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing, because essentially no one knows who the hell he is.-Some characters are legitimately just way better than others, stat-wise. For example, there's that chick that the game literally WANTS you to ban if you're making an online game. Speaking of online...-Online is glitchy and incomplete, but believe hard enough and the matches will show up. If you can't host and you're playing with a friend, you might have to make them do it.-Actually, the game is better with other people rather than AI in general.-Art style feels like every anime trope drawn like they're from my 6th grade sketchbook, but not necessarily ugly like A Valley Without Wind. Poorly drawn but not like you can't look at it, reminds me of keychains in a convention's artist alley.-While the text is translated, all the audio is voiced by a KAWAII DESU NE japanese girl in sort-of-english, so if that bugs you, don't go for this game.-PRO TIP: Holding shift speeds up the AI's turns. You will need this so you don't have to watch Mariepoppo get her♥♥♥♥♥kicked by chickens repeatedly.-If you want to buy this game because it has cards, I'm gonna need you to rethink your life choices.Overall, Waifu Party 8 is playable and mildly amusing, but you could just play Monopoly instead. Even if you want a digital board game, Mario Party is more skill-based than this (with most minigames requiring some kind of skill). It's not something you should pick up while it's not on sale, or if you don't like Yu-Gi-Oh with catgirls. Glad I got it as a gift.			"

												First and foremost I want everyone reading this to know that if you don't have friends to play with, or friends that you wouldn't play mario party with (for the sake of friendships not burning into piles of ashes), you probably shouldn't get this game. The single player is fun and all, but usually tipped in the ai's favour, which can be a fun-spoiler sometimes. That said, I've played both campaign and multiplayer, campaign to an extent and multiplayer quite a bit, and overall I'd totally recommend this to people who have others to play it with. Pick up the four-pack while it's on sale. Or while it's not on sale, it's still a pretty good deal. Into the actual game, this one is a board game in a party style. There are a lot of characters with unique 'hyper' (character-specific, usually pretty cool) cards. These characters are from Orange Juice's other games, and it's a very colourful cast with pretty good character design. The art style is cute, and the game is moderately easy to learn, save for some confusion if you don't read at least the basics of the game's guide (which has its own option to pick on the menu screen when you select/create your profile, so you really don't have an excuse to skip out on that unless you just want to yolo it). It's fairly simplistic, but in the best way I can mean it. Too much complexity can ruin a party game like this. It has a lot of maps to unlock and check out, and a large diversity of cards, a long with some interesting strategies to pull once you've got the hang of it. Like any game with a lot of characters like this, not all of them are perfectly balanced, so be aware of that.Overall, I'd give it a 8/10 for what it is, and only really taking off the two points for the cheating AI in campaign and the (kind of) tedious process of unlocking new characters to play (which involves campaign). I really love this game, and I'm glad to have it.			"

												It seems like it's just a regular old boring boardgame with an anime skin to draw in anime fans and be cheap like that, but in actuality this is a very fun game to play with friends. Fun in singleplayer dies out after a bit, but if you play this multiplayer, you'll have fun for hours and hours. It's very good. Basically, if you have friends (online or not), get this and have them get this. You'll enjoy it.			"

												First and foremost I want everyone reading this to know that if you don't have friends to play with, or friends that you wouldn't play mario party with (for the sake of friendships not burning into piles of ashes), you probably shouldn't get this game. The single player is fun and all, but usually tipped in the ai's favour, which can be a fun-spoiler sometimes. That said, I've played both campaign and multiplayer, campaign to an extent and multiplayer quite a bit, and overall I'd totally recommend this to people who have others to play it with. Pick up the four-pack while it's on sale. Or while it's not on sale, it's still a pretty good deal. Into the actual game, this one is a board game in a party style. There are a lot of characters with unique 'hyper' (character-specific, usually pretty cool) cards. These characters are from Orange Juice's other games, and it's a very colourful cast with pretty good character design. The art style is cute, and the game is moderately easy to learn, save for some confusion if you don't read at least the basics of the game's guide (which has its own option to pick on the menu screen when you select/create your profile, so you really don't have an excuse to skip out on that unless you just want to yolo it). It's fairly simplistic, but in the best way I can mean it. Too much complexity can ruin a party game like this. It has a lot of maps to unlock and check out, and a large diversity of cards, a long with some interesting strategies to pull once you've got the hang of it. Like any game with a lot of characters like this, not all of them are perfectly balanced, so be aware of that.Overall, I'd give it a 8/10 for what it is, and only really taking off the two points for the cheating AI in campaign and the (kind of) tedious process of unlocking new characters to play (which involves campaign). I really love this game, and I'm glad to have it.			"

												Fun little game that is based on RNG. Single player is meh, its really fun playing with friends and hearing their reactions when you keep destroying them thanks to your kind prayers to RNGesus.Don't buy this game if you have no friends that also have this game, because if that is the case this will sit in your Steam library unplayed like most of your other games.

												a great fun game to play with friends and strangers alike, the anime style graphics look nice and really add to the feel of the game.-Gameplay-the gameplay is an interesting mix between your average board game, turn based combat and card game aspects, all fitting together nicely for fun and amusing gameplay experience.-Singleplayer-the campain seems to have an fairly interesting story to it if not amusing at least ;p (not finished them)-Multiplayer-i truely think this is the highlight, as playing with toher peoples allows for a more amusing experience, with having the ability to text chat people in the lobby (clicking enter). Setting up a server or a ""lobby"" is simple with the choice of password or not, you can start it without require 4 people as the blanks will be filled in by AI's where people can choose mid game to spectate and even join in if they want to, also we a person leaves they get replaced with AI to help keep the games running smoothly.

												Really, this game should win every award.Test of Time: This is a game that's very random, and due to a lot of various luck-based events, no match will be the same. On top of that, new DLC gets released every couple of months or so, and really help add to the game's content.I'm Not Crying, There's Something In my Eye: Man, when QP FINALLY got her pudding back, I couldn't help but cry. Okay, Marc's ending was also adorable, too.Five More Minutes: I could relist the reasons listed for why it deserves the Test of Time award, but I won't.Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!: Admit it, you didn't expect Tomomo to be the creator of the world and everyone in it.Villain Most In Need Of A Hug: Really, in some of Tomomo's cutscenes, the protagonists are bigger villains than her. She just wants someone to play with her...Game Within A Game: ...Do player-made minigames count?I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award: I thought this game was cool before any of the DLC packs came out, and I still think it's cool to this day.Best Use Of A Farm Animal: Marie Poppo. Need I say more?And of course, I could name a million other awards it could win. ""Best Multiplayer Game"" and ""Cutest Characters Ever"" come to mind...Really, 100% Orange Juice is a wonderful game, and if it wins an award that would be awesome.#100%OrangeJuiceForEveryAwardEver "

												100% guaranteed to turn you into a masochist.You will play.You will rage.You will make bad rolls.You will not find the RNG God is with you.You will lose all your friends.You will become addicted and find out, to your horror, that you cannot stop....And you will LIKE IT!10/10 will need rehab.----------------Seriously, though, this game is amazing.  While some audiences might be put off by certain aspects of this game's ""cover"", the game itself is actually very fun with replay value through the roof!  The game is balanced, well-developed, and surprisingly deep.  While RNG elements are very prevalent in this game, there is a certain amount of skill introduced with the cards, battle system, and choosing your path on the board (ie. where to go, who to fight, and whether or not to stop at home).  The battle system is simple, yet not any more or less so than necessary.  The characters are all balanced and the varying stats between them is a welcome difference as compared to Mario Party.  The multiplayer is only lacking because there aren't enough people playing this game yet (which needs to change).  But the people there so far are amazing.  I hop into the middle of a game as a spectator and made a new friends before even becoming a player (and it wasn't a random FR, for the record).Everything balances out in terms of randomness and difficulty.  You'll find yourself having days where you can't win anything, and then you'll bne like me where you win 3 MP games in a row as Yuki, then come in second to Yuki on Tomomo's board, only to win against Tomomo the following round and feel like a lumberjacking boss.  Anyone can win/lose to anyone else.  No two games ever wind up the same, and even the DLC is balanced.More constant fun than many games give you for significantly less than any AAA title on the market.Seriously, 10/10.  Would rage buy agian.  (Probably will; it'd make a Nice Present for my friends.)But Tomomo is stll a trucking pain in the donkey. "

												100% Orange Juice is a game that when you look at it, seems very similar to Mario Party. In a sense, it is. You collect Stars and cards in order to help you progress through the game. You roll a dice and move around the board and land on a space that has various effects ranging from you to collecting stars or cards, to losing stars and fighting enemies. Now, that's where the similarities end really. 100% OJ is by far more rutheless than Mario Party. Maybe it's just my luck, but even on normal the cpus are brutal and out for blood. If you make one wrong move, or if the game decides it hates you then you can very well go from a blazing lead to being in dead last within the span of a few turns. Now, despite that, the game itself is a lot of fun. Sure, it's a board game with goals that range from collecting a certain amount of stars, knocking out a certain amount of people or a combination of the both. The game has only 3 modes really, campaign, single matches and multiplayer. Now with any board game, playing with friends is what makes it really shine a bit more. You can play with up to three other friends, using whatever characters you unlocked, making a deck of x amount of cards and then you're put into a board, fighting or running for your life (depending on your play style and character as all characters have different stats.) in order to gain first prize. Now, with all three game modes you ear stars (which are this games currency to buy items from the store.) But only in multiplayer can you gain exp to level up and unlock new items to purchase and the sort, which the game has a decent amount of. Honestly, I suggest giving the demo a try to get a feel for the game, then convince some friends to get the game as well or find some people that would want to play. All in all, it's a fun game but can be frustrating.			"

												This game is very, very cute.  It's also surprisingly deep, for what appears to be a simple game on the surface.  The deck-building system and the card packs are an interesting form of advancement that seems to scream microtransaction heaven, but strangely, this game doesn't opt for that route.I'm not entirely sure there's a valid comparison to other video-board-games, because most of the mechanics are simpler and more lean.  It may be fair to call it Dokapon Kingdom X-tra Lite, since it involves collecting a ""currency"" and simplified and protracted combat.  The actual style of the combat reminds me of Sonic Shuffle, and the overall flow of the game feels more traditional than most.I'd buy this for $10, and it's on sale right now for $2.93.  I highly recommend it!			"

												The reason Steam needs an ""ehhhhhh"" option for recommendations is games like this.-Are you a weeaboo? Like, body pillow of Homura Akemi, Naruto headband and box of Pocky level of weeaboo? Then you'll like this game despite everything following this. OMG SO KAWAII DESU NE XDD SUGOI-AI is rigged often and you need to trap card them if you want to win (This is a game where AI difficulty = AI's luck increased, so they will ALWAYS have their best card and will almost ALWAYS roll 5+ if they're not Mariepoppo)-Don't go into this game for BIOWARE KWALETEE STORYTELLING because there is none to be found. Every character could be summed up accurately in a -dere or just one other trope. They appear to be from other games, but I don't think anyone in the West (including myself) understands where they're from. It feels similar to having Opa-Opa in Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing, because essentially no one knows who the hell he is.-Some characters are legitimately just way better than others, stat-wise. For example, there's that chick that the game literally WANTS you to ban if you're making an online game. Speaking of online...-Online is glitchy and incomplete, but believe hard enough and the matches will show up. If you can't host and you're playing with a friend, you might have to make them do it.-Actually, the game is better with other people rather than AI in general.-Art style feels like every anime trope drawn like they're from my 6th grade sketchbook, but not necessarily ugly like A Valley Without Wind. Poorly drawn but not like you can't look at it, reminds me of keychains in a convention's artist alley.-While the text is translated, all the audio is voiced by a KAWAII DESU NE japanese girl in sort-of-english, so if that bugs you, don't go for this game.-PRO TIP: Holding shift speeds up the AI's turns. You will need this so you don't have to watch Mariepoppo get her♥♥♥♥♥kicked by chickens repeatedly.-If you want to buy this game because it has cards, I'm gonna need you to rethink your life choices.Overall, Waifu Party 8 is playable and mildly amusing, but you could just play Monopoly instead. Even if you want a digital board game, Mario Party is more skill-based than this (with most minigames requiring some kind of skill). It's not something you should pick up while it's not on sale, or if you don't like Yu-Gi-Oh with catgirls. Glad I got it as a gift.			"

												Okay this game is a weird one. It is basicly a board game as videogame. Well this game is not really good in singleplayer mode. I don't care what you say but this game is way to random for singleplayer. But with friends it is a lot of fun. Yeah give it to some friends and play it, you will find stratagy and improvie your skills but the randomness prevents the videogame law where skills make everything. This is more like monopoly or ludo which is always a joy with friends of all sorts. So yeah I changed my mind I can recomend this game, because this game does exactly what it aims to do.			"

												Really, this game should win every award.Test of Time: This is a game that's very random, and due to a lot of various luck-based events, no match will be the same. On top of that, new DLC gets released every couple of months or so, and really help add to the game's content.I'm Not Crying, There's Something In my Eye: Man, when QP FINALLY got her pudding back, I couldn't help but cry. Okay, Marc's ending was also adorable, too.Five More Minutes: I could relist the reasons listed for why it deserves the Test of Time award, but I won't.Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!: Admit it, you didn't expect Tomomo to be the creator of the world and everyone in it.Villain Most In Need Of A Hug: Really, in some of Tomomo's cutscenes, the protagonists are bigger villains than her. She just wants someone to play with her...Game Within A Game: ...Do player-made minigames count?I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award: I thought this game was cool before any of the DLC packs came out, and I still think it's cool to this day.Best Use Of A Farm Animal: Marie Poppo. Need I say more?And of course, I could name a million other awards it could win. ""Best Multiplayer Game"" and ""Cutest Characters Ever"" come to mind...Really, 100% Orange Juice is a wonderful game, and if it wins an award that would be awesome.#100%OrangeJuiceForEveryAwardEver "

Now I am addicted to this silly, RNG, cute, rage inducing board game. Not for those who need to plan turns in advance and prefer heavy strategic decision making. There's none of that here. But there is addicting kawaii game play, sure to suck you in.			"

Single player is meh, its really fun playing with friends and hearing their reactions when you keep destroying them thanks to your kind prayers to RNGesus.Don't buy this game if you have no friends that also have this game, because if that is the case this will sit in your Steam library unplayed like most of your other games.

												First and foremost I want everyone reading this to know that if you don't have friends to play with, or friends that you wouldn't play mario party with (for the sake of friendships not burning into piles of ashes), you probably shouldn't get this game. The single player is fun and all, but usually tipped in the ai's favour, which can be a fun-spoiler sometimes. That said, I've played both campaign and multiplayer, campaign to an extent and multiplayer quite a bit, and overall I'd totally recommend this to people who have others to play it with. Pick up the four-pack while it's on sale. Or while it's not on sale, it's still a pretty good deal. Into the actual game, this one is a board game in a party style. There are a lot of characters with unique 'hyper' (character-specific, usually pretty cool) cards. These characters are from Orange Juice's other games, and it's a very colourful cast with pretty good character design. The art style is cute, and the game is moderately easy to learn, save for some confusion if you don't read at least the basics of the game's guide (which has its own option to pick on the menu screen when you select/create your profile, so you really don't have an excuse to skip out on that unless you just want to yolo it). It's fairly simplistic, but in the best way I can mean it. Too much complexity can ruin a party game like this. It has a lot of maps to unlock and check out, and a large diversity of cards, a long with some interesting strategies to pull once you've got the hang of it. Like any game with a lot of characters like this, not all of them are perfectly balanced, so be aware of that.Overall, I'd give it a 8/10 for what it is, and only really taking off the two points for the cheating AI in campaign and the (kind of) tedious process of unlocking new characters to play (which involves campaign). I really love this game, and I'm glad to have it.			"

												So, do you want to play Mario Party but don't have any friends to play with? Or is it because you don't even own Mario Party in the first place? Well you're in luck ladies and gentlemen, because 100% Orange Juice is here to provide you with gameplay that fulfills all of your Mario Party needs from the complete reliance of RNG, now including cards for you to use on the field or during 1v1 duels between other players and other random npcs to fight against, like chickens and seagulls just to name a few, all in the name of enjoying other people's misfortune. If you like the idea of having a casual experience (with extreme amounts of luck and frustration) with strangers online, then 100% Orange Juice is just the game for you, all for the low low price of $6.99.Okay, so what do I think about this game? Well, it's really a game that I do enjoy every once in a while, but I also hate its guts because of its heavy reliance on the dice. There is a dueling minigame in which each player picks a card from their hand in order to make statistical changes in attack, evade, and defense values. Otherwise, it's still pretty much a game of chance. If you really want to just sit back and ""relax"" with something to pass the time, then by all means go pick up 100% Orange Juice. If you are really looking for a more complex board game with actual strategy, then you might want to look elsewhere because this game doesn't really provide much of it. Good luck and enjoy the schadenfreude.			"

												Anybody who is a fan of board games at all, or a fan of ANY games backed by Fruitbat Factory, you are going to love this.First off, you have it's gameplay. This is one of the games that you will want to read the manual for. The objectives are obtuse at best. Basically you have to achieve a ""Norma"", an objective of collect ___ amount of stars, or ___ amount of fight wins. You do this by going around the board and triggering events to get stars, or fighting other players to take their stars or gain wins. There are also ""Enemy"" spaces to help rack up more minute wins. You get cards that you can use at the start of your turn, lay as a trap (though you can trigger your own trap! A small but neat mechanic you want to keep in mind) or change combat a bit (stat changes or battle rules, such as battle goes until a KO). When you battle, the person who started it goes first, and then the other player gets a swing. This leads to a neat tradeoff of ""Do I go for Stars and risk losing them? Or go for wins and risk not getting them in the first place?"" After you achieve a Norma, you level up allowing more cards you draw to be useable, and when you achieve a Norma at level 5, you win.There is reward for playing both Single Player and Multiplayer (more on that later). You different unlocks based on which you play. More characters for Single, more skins and maps for Multiplayer. So no matter which one you do, you get something for it.That said, Single Player campaign, while fun, will leave you feel cheated more often than not. You will feel like the dice is rigged to help the computer win often. It's the same rolls you could get in Multiplayer, but having 3 bots get perfect rolls definitely hurts.Multiplayer is the meat and potatoes of this game. Playing with random people, or playing with a group of friends, everybody will have something to enjoy. It's like playing a good rendition of Mario Party. Are you the person who decides to be a jerk? Or just be a pacifist and watch them get mad after you win by doing seemingly nothing? I have yet to have  a boring game in Multiplayer, and the ability to increase game speed is nice, though it would be a bit nicer if you could stop to see what was rolled in faster speed (All I see half the time is me suddenly do 3 damage.... not sure how).It's also a really balanced game. All characters have strengths and weaknesses. QP is good all around, with a good hyper card. Somebody like Peat has high stats, but low hp and a moderate Hyper Card. Etc. Etc.A simple touch it has is it's music. It plays based on who last achieved a Norma, and sometimes it's worth just trying to play to see who can keep their music playing the longest! The music is also really pleasant to hear, and when you hear your theme come on, it just feels as though you have been embued with some kind of power or hope.Finally, it has what a lot of games these days lack: Charm. These characters are extremely charismatic, and have a lot of personality. It also proceeds to make jokes about itself. ""AHAHA! YOU ARE THE MAIN CHARACTER WITH LITTLE INDIVIDUALITY! ALSO YOU ARE MALE! IT MAKES ME STAND OUT THAT MUCH MORE!"" One of many lines said in Single Player, and it should show how much charm this game has. Even in the aminations, where you have a character trying to act tough then breaks down when they get KO'd, or somebody like Dangerous QP who seems to dream about pudding while knocked down.In Summary, it's a great game, but best played with others. It has a lot of charm, great music, and is worth the price. Although it's hard to recommend it alone, so if you want the most out of it, play with friends!			"

												Defenetly a genre we are lacking on PC, the mario party esc genre was never really brought here and most people probably have to settle with emulators and hamachi if they ever want that kind of experience on PC.Thankfully this game brings the complete friend-hating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG fun to the PC market and I've never had so many of my friends hate me because of it. This game has a random generator system for almost every aspect during the gameplay and it can be both terrifying and completely hilarious depending on what end you're receiveing. I completely recommend this game. There are a few characters that are a bit more powerful that your friend will call you out for (protagonist priveledge) but when you win the game nothing matters but that glorious victory!			"

												Its good....like really good if you wish to forge strong friendships or break them like UNO. Alright, aside from the colourful visuals and catchy music which are both great, the gameplay is fairly simple as in easy to pick up and very very difficult to master (emphasize 'very' here).  Its basicallya board game with a fun winning system (either KO your opponents or gather stars to win or you can KO opponents and gather their stars) and has tons of replayability just to get more cards or to try different characters or ways to win. The story isn't that bad either......well.....it is quite comedic so yeah....it doesn't take itself too seriously. However, do be warned that this game is just better with friends. While playing online is fun, the game is overall better playing in multiplayer with people you know because that way all of you can blame RNG for giving one of you so much luck and the other just couldn't get his or her game face on. A solid 8/10 for this game!			"

												100% Orange is a nice and tidy board-game. The graphics aren't that fancy but the look does fit the game very well and personally i like the anime-ish style. The game isn't hard to learn and you can get the hang of it pretty fast. This game is meant for playing in multiplayer though there is a singleplayer mode but in my opinion it's more like a tutorial than a long-term feature.The developers are pretty active and are regularly adding new features and content though latter does cost a bit. But you're already good to go without the need to buy any dlcs if you just want to have a nice and cozy, sometimes hair-mussing time playing.			"

Sure, RNGesus may be a cheating **** at times, but the feeling of overcoming the odds and winning the rounds is well worth the fight.

												I'll come right out and say it. This game is not for everyone. Before purchasing the game, try the demo. It only has the single player, and the multiplayer is where most of the fun is at, but you can still experience the game before buying it with the demo.100% Orange Juice is a board game featuring characters from games made by the devloper Orange_Juice. Most of the game is played by rolling dice. Moving, battles, gaining stars, dropping stars. Players are allowed to pick cards that are stock piled in the middle as a community pile, so cards you pick can be drawn by other people. Every character has a unique hyper, unique stats, and a unique theme. Cards themselves are either traps, battle, or boosts. Traps are set on the stage and are activated when someone lands on them, battle cards are used in battle, and boosts are used at the start of your turn to give you some kind of power up.The game looks extremely simplistic, however it still looks very nice. Card artwork is well drawn, characters are well animated, and the game boards all look nice. In terms of music, this game features a fantastic soundtrack of 20+ songs, that I actually wish could be bought on steam. There are two DLCs for this game, and both of them feature two new playable characters, who if you just bought the game along with the DLC are playable from the start.The story is delightful. It isn't meant to be serious. A mysterious life form called Marie Poppo steals your stuff, and you chase her to get it back. The humor is spot on, and got a few laughs from me. I do not regret buying the four pack and giving it out to some of my friends. Good Game/Good Game			"

												For a game that's so hinged on the roll of a die, 100% Orange Juice manages to divvy out the salt fairly evenly so that every player gets to feel frustrated and laugh at other people's misfortunes simultaneously. Finally, a board game where the real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is the game itself and not the other players.

												100% Orange Juice is a doujinsoft party game in the vein of Dokapon Kingdom, and the RNG will mess with you juuuuust as much. Make no mistake, though, as this is actually a pretty entertaining game, especially since--unlike Mario Party or Dokapon Kingdom--this game offers online multiplayer where all players benefit from each game via store discounts and early/exclusive purchases.There's a good number of characters to choose from, and their varying stats and special cards mean that each best suits a different playstyle, plus I do love that each time a character levels up, the background music changes to their theme.I do, however, have a few quirks with this game, such as some of the music fading out before starting again (instead of fluidly looping) and some of the graphics showing leftover pixels or being a smidge pixelated.Regardless, if you're into party games or want something to enjoy alongside your friends, this is a good purchase.Final score: B+			"

												It's like Mario Party, only even sillier and more luck-based!... Okay, I'll give an actually detailed review.100% Orange Juice is a cute game in all its aspects. Cute characters, cute music, cute mechanics... okay, that last one probably doesn't make much sense. But it is a really easy game to get into and learn, even without having it explained to you.It's a board game/RPG hybrid, and your goal is to reach Lv6 before anyone else. The way to level up? Well, there's no EXP, so you'll have to achieve your Norma. What's a Norma? A Norma is your goal for that level. Whenever you level up, you can choose one of two Normas; Stars or Wins. You either get enough Stars (essentially the game's currency, you consume them when you use cards, gain them from landing on various spaces or winning fights, and lose them whenever you're defeated) or win enough battles (against either monsters or other players). Simple enough, right?Of course, there are also other ways to get in everyone else's way than just fighting them. Even a pacifist who never directly fights anyone can be a dangerous and cunning foes if they use the right cards. Cards are another big part of the game. They're essentially items, and there's a lot of them. Pretty much anyone can use any card, as long as they're the right level and can pay enough Stars to use them. And there are a lot of different kinds of cards. Cards that heal, cards that buff, cards that de-buff, cards you use in battle, cards you use directly from your hand at the start of your turn, cards you lay down as traps... and cards that only your character can use. Their ""special ability"", unique to them. Their Hyper card. Now it's not quite so simple anymore.Any and all of that can mean the world... or nothing, depending on how the dice roll. It's that kind of game.As easy to learn as this game is, there's a lot to it. It's one of those games that's beginner-friendly, but has a lot of ways to be strategic about it. Or you can just try to punch everything, but that usually doesn't work out so well.The music is really nice. Every character has their own theme that plays when they level up, and keeps playing until someone else levels up. It's good way to remind everyone that you're winning, or that you're catching up to them. There's a lot of variety, too, because every character's theme is a wildly different kind of song. Slow jazz, lounge music, quick-paced techno, frantic rave music, probably some stuff that wouldn't sound out-of-place in a Touhou game. There's a song for everybody, unless you're really, really picky.The online multiplayer is where this game shines. A board game being most fun when you play it with other people? What a surprise!... But seriously, this game is a great experience with others, whether you're playing with randoms or people you know.The game also gets updates every once in a while, adding new cards and characters, keeping it from getting stale.tl;dr: Cute game, nice music, easy to get into, low price, all about multiplayer, potentially infinite replay value. If you have friends who play it, you should play it, too.			"

												A great game with a very friendly community, it keeps gets getting updated on a regular basis with new content despite having been released years ago. It offers easy to grasp strategic gameplay, yet it's not too serious. It's easy to find multiplayer lobbies, and it's possible to join ongoing games.			"

												TL;DRGet prepared to have your butt kicked by a seagull & chicken while listening to some sick trance music (character themes)  that changes based on who touched a lollipop. 10/10Extremely cute, deceptively tactical board game. You get to play as cute anime girls, boys, monsters and creatures whom move around a board collecting stars or earning ""kills"" for taking out your opponent. A Lollipop being your home base which regenerates 1hp as well as brings you to your next phase.   There's an ingame shop that uses game-currency (not pay2win) to unlock characters, colors for your characters, themed outfits (like halloween, christmas) and cards which help you win the game via battle buffs, trap cards, escape, healing, etc. Finally you can unlock more stages using in-game currency at the shop. Quite a light-hearted game, but by no means a walk in the park.I would recommend this to anyone at any age. Seeing as I myself go back to it frequently to play a couple rounds and I find the DLC characters very addicting almost like pokemon where ""I gotta have them all"" The DLC characters in this game add much needed variety though the non-DLC Marie Popo (whom the community refers too as ""popolord"")  her stats seem low but she is to be very feared and respected as she will mug you for all your worth with her hyper (each characters ultimate skill) & use you for her own benefit pretty much using you to end the game for herself.  Some fun dlc characters include a girl who self destructs if she loses taking her enemy with her, a guy who rips off his shirt and gains stats from it, a girl whose pretty much a tank and immune to traps. Definitely may invoke that ""rage"" sense similarly experienced from old mario party games its got that nostalgia going for it.  This is the kind of game that will upset you & your friends but you'll keep playing a few days later. All Hail & Praise Popolord may her hyper be swift and the stars a'plenty. (/ '.')/			"

												For people who dislike RNG or luck heavy games, I recommend turning away now. 100% Orange Juice is a party game where you play as one of many anime-styled characters from the orange_juice game lineups(Suguri, QP Shooting, etc). You roll dice, collect stars, and beat other people up to victory. You gain cards on the way that'll help or hinder you on getting to your Norma goals.Despite being a Party game and with a simple look, it's actually extremely fun and unpredictable. I also would recommend other orange_juice games to look at, since they're fun and some of them have the benefit of giving you an extra character if you buy them.If you want a fun party game, I would recommend 100% Orange Juice.

												7$ for a casual board game with fun quirky characters.Honestly one of my favorite things about it is that it doesn't really require your full attention. Ill go and take my turn then pick up my book or check my facebook for the couple minutes it takes in between turns. My only major complaints are just nitpickings here and there with the actual game itself.it doesnt say what events are on the field, or when events happen.also it doesnt say what path's you can turn on or not. so you can get a bit mixed up if you arent paying attention.id also just like more cards. ive barely played beyond what was offered on the demo. and i already have 25% of all cards.Final word: love it, great lil time waster. extremely cute.

												Do you want a cute RNG game to play in your spare time? Do you want to be killed by a chicken? How about a duck? If you said yes to any of these questions 100% Orange Juice is the game for you. 100% Orange Juice is a virtual anime board game. You pick your favorite character, go into a map with a selection of cards, which will be used by all players, and try to achieve the five goals (normas) set to win. You can attack other players, set traps, and use cards to try and bring your friends and foes down so you can triumph over them. How to win, card art, panels, characters, pros, cons, and the small details will be the main focus point of this review.At the beginning of the game you’re given a card, norma, and a base. To fulfill your norma you have to land on a base. If the base is not yours you cannot land on it unless you battle someone standing on it or roll the exact distance needed to land there. To battle a character you can pass over them and opt to stop and fight or keep going. When battling it’s completely RNG as your offense and defense will be determined by your dice roll. Each character is given base stats that will either subtract or add to your rolls. If you have a battle card that is your level (number of normas you have achieved) you can pay stars (currency) to use them to help try and sway the battle in your favor. The idea of having normas is nothing new to any game and the system is pretty generic. Complete the goal, base, continue. I personally didn’t find any faults in this system, however, at the same time nothing stands out. The card designs are typically very nice, I’ve only seen a couple cards that I didn’t like the design for. As you’re trying to win the game there will be many spaces you will land on that will change the game. Battle spaces are red and will summon a chicken, golem, duck and later bosses that fight you. The yellow bonus spaces give you free stars based on your dice roll. The blue drop panel works in a similar fashion as the bonus space but you lose stars. The purple spaces teleport you to a random spot on the map which can allow you to have awesome escapes or comebacks. Finally there’s the green spaces which let you draw a card, and the light blue space which allows you to roll to move again. When first playing there is no tutorial to tell you what each of the spaces do, however, the panel art is pretty obvious so you do know what you’re landing on. The panels are colorful and makes the game have a very cheerful and colorful appearance. Trap cards can be used before you move and will be placed face down on top of your current panel unless otherwise stated (Certain characters hypers act as traps to be randomly placed on the map). When a player lands on the trap card they do the traps action and then the panel action under. If the trap card moves your character you will not do either of the panel actions you land on. Some traps in the game are so infuriating that I want to quit as soon as I land on them, others seem really pointless. Each character during the game may draw a Hyper Card. These are character based, each character having their own special hyper. These hyper cards are played like regular cards that can either be used for battles or for map control. Hypers can dramatically change the game, with many hypers you can take the advantage of your allies and gain stars, health, or damage them allowing you to swoop in for the kill. With certain deck cards you can either get another characters hyper or your own, this provides you with a way to try and strategize for the win. In my experience I found the battle hypers to be the most useful as you can swoop in and kill someone and take their stars, or kill a boss. In the game currently there are about thirty six playable characters, some of these characters are unlocked through the store, others are DLC, with other special characters that can be unlocked by purchasing other games on Steam (200% Mixed Juice, Sora, etc). The cast of character all can be found in other games published by Fruitbat factory. If you are a fan of the other games this game is basically a dream come true yet it’s still fine to play the game without knowing any characters coming in (since the storyline doesn’t have any influence or importance in the game).  When starting the game you can play four characters from the start while eight other humanoid characters can be unlocked, as well as the ability to play every enemy character. All the other characters are DLC. While having most character be unlocked through DLC or the purchase of other games may be a turn off, once Steam sales roll around and you have less than a dollar to spare you may find yourself spending it on the DLC.In campaign mode you play the game following whichever character you select’s storyline. Personally, I skipped the story after the first two scenarios. The story means almost nothing to someone who has not played any games with these characters involved. Overall, playing through campaign can be a huge pain but you get a crown as a reward that you can put on your character for completing it all. If you’re into customization it can be a huge bragging right when playing with friends, otherwise, there is no purpose to campaign. There are seven total story paths each having five episodes and a final battle, two of these paths come with DLC. Outside campaign there is Free Play with both multiplayer and single player options. In this you can chose the map, and the field events that occur. Field events can range from drawing a card every seven turns to getting bombed and losing 1 hp. Field events either make your game even harder, or help you. Some Steam achievements can be unlocked easier by utilizing these field events.  Pros to this game:•	Cute characters (And a lot of them)•	Can play alone or with friends•	Character balances •	Spectate system•	Different difficulty settings in campaign •	CheapCons:•	Rage inducing•	The music can get pretty annoying and repetitive, I mute the game.•	Bots do get unfair rolls (not always, unless in harder modes, then always.)•	Profile level can only be raised in multiplayer•	No tutorial for first time players•	Campaign has no real impactOverall, I find 100% Orange Juice to be very cute and fun, and even better once you start playing more with others. I’d give the game an 8/10 because the AI can get pretty unfair, tons of rage, and the music is just too much. (It changes each time someone changes their norma between a track of songs and after hearing all the songs and them getting changed over and over it just gets too irritating.) I don’t think this game is perfect by any means but it isn’t a bad game. I think it’s a game that is worth the original price listed on Steam, and on sale should be purchased by anyone slightly interested in the title. I find the game something I will pick up and play when I don't have tons of time and would like to play without too much thought. It's a game I think anyone with interests in virtual board games and anime should pick up and give a shot. Prepare to be frustrated.			"

												This is a board game full of japanese weirdo. Basic rules are:- throw a six sided dice- move your character that many spaces- optional - use a card- tiles have different effects - some give you stars, some make you fight some chicken or robot, etc.- when you step on a different character you may fight- the one who gathers five normas (well, strange word for goal) wins - you pick what norma you need to gather and the choice is between defeating other characters and gathering a fixed number of starsPros:- graphics are nice if you can stand this style of japanese esthetics- music is really awesome- you can collect different cards to use during gameplay, thus you can somehow expand the game however you like - setting traps, using instant effects, so on- you can actually speed up the game to super fastCons:- and you should speed up the game to super fast, otherwise you may fall asleep- board games can be boring - you may get defeated and lose a few round trying to get up (first round you must roll 5+, second 4+, so on)- this game is very random - you may be winning one minute and get to the very bottom two minutes later because AI used cards to stole your stars and KO your character- this game is just pointless if you are not into japanese games - if so, go for Talisman or Relic instead- pointless dialogue - take a look at the end of my note to see how it looks likeOverall I give thumbs up because this is a really well made game and I can appreciate it but still I am not into such games thus I'll not play this game a lot more. If you are more into european standards of games then go for Talisman or Relic or whatever (Warhammer Quest?). This game is good but weird and chaotic. ___Pointless dialogue:- Hi Abombo, where are my socks?- I like my ice cream better!- You fight for icecream or freedom you lose!- Popopopopopopokakakkakakaka!- Ok you win, take out your dish and have a cake.I made it out but I hope you get the point.---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

Unlockables always feel well placed and worth something. Especially store discounts, that's an excellant unlockable. However a few cons are as followed. Some of the randos that join in a friendly game go bonkers and treat it like C.O.D. level of rageout. Calling anyone they feel is a bad player a ♥♥♥♥♥ or flood the chat with ""PLAY THE GAME RIGHT♥♥♥♥♥♥"" This should honestly be monitered as kids are likely to be drawn to it's cute overtones.

												As long as humans have lived, humans have always thought the origin of salt was from the sea or the salt mines.Yet, recent studies suggest that the true originin of salt would actually be from HUMANS.This game is a tool to extract salt from people, and there is nothing better than it.In this game, you face 3 other players on a board game, where you can battle each others with dies, you can use cards with various effects from giving you move attack or evade, traps that will make you discard all your cards... The strategies are infinite!However, almost all actions are dictated by the RNGod, and you shall bow before its might!I strongly suggest this game if you wish to have a fun time with friends, where the only winner is the game.

												7$ for a casual board game with fun quirky characters.Honestly one of my favorite things about it is that it doesn't really require your full attention. Ill go and take my turn then pick up my book or check my facebook for the couple minutes it takes in between turns. My only major complaints are just nitpickings here and there with the actual game itself.it doesnt say what events are on the field, or when events happen.also it doesnt say what path's you can turn on or not. so you can get a bit mixed up if you arent paying attention.id also just like more cards. ive barely played beyond what was offered on the demo. and i already have 25% of all cards.Final word: love it, great lil time waster. extremely cute.

												Pros: Fun game. Great soundtrack. Fun characters. Fun after dozens of games. Even more fun to screw over your friends.Con: No real story. Some characters feel very situational/weak and in need of balancing/tweaking.Ugly: Teleporting midgets with kleptomania now make we want to kick a midget every time I see one.10/10			"

												Do you like board games? If so, you should consider this game. 100% orange juice is a game filled with so much randomness, it would make TF2 random crit haters cry tears of blood. With just enough skill involved to make it feel like you can control the outcome, 100% orange juice is a game you will keep coming back to, no matter how many friends you want to punch in the face.

												This is a situational game to recommend. Singleplayer has major faults.To be to the point:+ Has a card system. You can use cards you obtain in matches. You obtain them by buying booster packs with in game currency, they contain one random card.+ Freeplay is great. No rigged dice for anyone.+ Online multiplayer.+ Lots of characters to play.+ You can gain levels in freeplay to unlock new characters, and colors for those characters.+ You can obtain new costumes and hair randomly when playing in freeplay.+ Updates and fixes are frequent.+ Avatar system so you can pick a character, hair color and outfit to display yourself as.- Campaign AI have loaded dice in difficulties higher than casual, it can be very bad in late levels of campaigns. (Can take 50 tries to win a final scenario even with ""best build."")- It can take SO many tries to get some of the achievements, such as 100% binder completion, or finishing a game with 1000 stars. - Occasional bugs such as: When fullscreen and alt-tabbing, game closes. Doesn't save avatar upon closing game. However, they'll probably get fixed.- FRUSTRATING. (Can be rewarding.)			"

												While this game may appear cute and lighthearted, those that have suffered through the RNG that is 100% Orange Juice will tell many tales of valor, bravery, drama, and the most important story of all; how can the RNG screw me over on winning today? Though despite that, 100% Orange Juice is still a decent game to play with friends as with playing with others makes the game more fun and less of a stressful mess of RNG screwage. That, and human players can't rig the dice like the last boss in story campaigns >_>			"

												100% Orange Juice: The madness of a tabletop game now on your PC! The game plays just as any classic tabletop game: you roll the dice , move the amount of squares you rolled and then wait for your turn. But 100% Orange Juice puts it's twist on the tabletop genre adding many more fun things such as changing one of the core mechanics of most tabletop games. Usually tabletop games require you to get to the end goal in order to win , but in 100% Orange Juice there is no end goal. The map is just a massive circle. This had me really confused at first , but then I realized what the end goal really was. Points. Each level requires you to get a certain amount of points in order to win. You can get points by stepping on blocks that give you coins , fighting mobs such as chickens or monsters and by fighting other players. You may gave noticed a pattern by now , but fighting is another core mechanic of the game. Your attacking , dodging and evading skills all depend on the character you choose. The fighting works just like in any turn based RPG: You attack , dodge or evade the opponent's attack then you attack again. Simple as that , yet , if you don't know all the character's stats , you may have a bad time figuring which option to choose. The game features many unique and colorful characters , many of them being from the developer's other games which means that this is a massive crossover game. You don't need to play the developer's other games in order to get the basic idea about each character's personality , because that's why you have the story mode. I was really hesitant to metion the story mode until now just because it is so confusing and ovet the top , but I'll try my best to explain it as briefly as possible. So one day this guy named Kai drops his wallet on the street and as he reaches for it , a little girl named Marie Poppo comes and steals it. As Kai chases the little girl , he discovers more people who had something stolen from them by the same girl. After chasing the girl some more , you find out that she was working for some kind of evil overlord girl named Tomomo who was behind this all along. You beat her , get your stuff back and keep your new friends. Well that's the basic premise of the plot. The story mode features 5 characters with 5 chapters each but unfortunatley all the character's stories are just retelling of the story I mentioned above but from a different point of view. I recommend finishing all the stories though because some dialogue is changed and so is the ending depending on the character. If you're not interested in the full story , you can get the most out of it just by playing Kai's campagin but you wouldn't get all the cards.Cards are another one of the game's mechanics , each card granting you unique abilities and helping you in battle. There are plenty of trap , battle and boost cards and collecting them all is a real challenge. But if that's not what you came for , you can always jump straight to the multiplayer.The multiplayer is really fun. You can play with up to 4 friends on various stages from the story mode. You can also play with random people if that's your thing but I digress. The multiplayer can bring countless hours of enjoyment out of the game. 100% Orange Juice is a criminally fun game to play either alone or with friends once you get a hang of all the mechanics. Even if you're not into the chibi aesthethic of the game , you can at least give it a chance just for the charm and humor of the characters. Now that I drank all my OJ I can rate this game a solid 8/10			"

												Do you have friends? Do you like a nice board game? Do you like pain loops? WELCOME to 100% Orange Juice.You play a roll your dice move your mice board game, but when you run into other players theres a short battle, sometimes you can play a modifier card before the battle to modify the chances of winning. You can also play a card before your roll at the start of your turn. Some cards can move everyone around, cause you to roll a specific value, place a trap on the board, or place a piggy bank with a bunch of stars.Now to win the game you need to do one of two things. You need to get a lot of stars (the points or currency of the game) and keep landing on one of the home tiles, or you need to win battles against the CPU enemies, Boss CPU enemies, or your opposing players.Now the game can be played single player with 3 CPU players or 4 player multiplayer with up to 3 of your friends (over the internet, sadly no type of couch co-op). There's also a single player story mode where you can play various boards with a loose story for why you are on specific boards, why you are playing against specific players, why the board effects are what they are... It's a wacky time, usually resulting in the persuit of pudding.But be warned, if you don't take care this may be harder than you think, even on the NORMAL difficulty you will encounted painloops with the story, moreso if you do not go to the in game market and buy (with in game money) booster packs so you can get more cards to modify your deck. There are DLC you can buy, and I highly suggest doing so (especially if the game is on sale like it is as I write this review) as some of the DLC characters are fun to play as and the additional cards from the DLC booster packs (still gotta buy them in game with in game currency, which you only get by playing) add some extra fun when making your deck.

												Defenetly a genre we are lacking on PC, the mario party esc genre was never really brought here and most people probably have to settle with emulators and hamachi if they ever want that kind of experience on PC.Thankfully this game brings the complete friend-hating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG fun to the PC market and I've never had so many of my friends hate me because of it. This game has a random generator system for almost every aspect during the gameplay and it can be both terrifying and completely hilarious depending on what end you're receiveing. I completely recommend this game. There are a few characters that are a bit more powerful that your friend will call you out for (protagonist priveledge) but when you win the game nothing matters but that glorious victory!			"

												Its good....like really good if you wish to forge strong friendships or break them like UNO. Alright, aside from the colourful visuals and catchy music which are both great, the gameplay is fairly simple as in easy to pick up and very very difficult to master (emphasize 'very' here).  Its basicallya board game with a fun winning system (either KO your opponents or gather stars to win or you can KO opponents and gather their stars) and has tons of replayability just to get more cards or to try different characters or ways to win. The story isn't that bad either......well.....it is quite comedic so yeah....it doesn't take itself too seriously. However, do be warned that this game is just better with friends. While playing online is fun, the game is overall better playing in multiplayer with people you know because that way all of you can blame RNG for giving one of you so much luck and the other just couldn't get his or her game face on. A solid 8/10 for this game!			"

												100% Orange is a nice and tidy board-game. The graphics aren't that fancy but the look does fit the game very well and personally i like the anime-ish style. The game isn't hard to learn and you can get the hang of it pretty fast. This game is meant for playing in multiplayer though there is a singleplayer mode but in my opinion it's more like a tutorial than a long-term feature.The developers are pretty active and are regularly adding new features and content though latter does cost a bit. But you're already good to go without the need to buy any dlcs if you just want to have a nice and cozy, sometimes hair-mussing time playing.			"

												This has to be one of the most addicting games I have EVER come across. It's pure fun packaged and wrapped in a cute and adorable way. If you like mario party, and anime (but not the mini games), then this  the game for you! I highly reccomend this game for those especially whom are competetive amungst friends or other people alike! Especially since the game is 75% off right now.SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! GET THE GAME!			"

												100% Orange Juice is a full course meal, complete with:LaughterTearsRegretMisclicksPopo... and more with an excess amount of salt.On a more serious note, 100% Orange Juice definitely is a fun, inexpensive way to spend time with friends. The rules and mechanics are easy to understand, and the quirky themes can lighten any mood. I recommend playing this game with a friend(s) using any chat software, but if you don't have friends willing to play OJ there's always the friendly community.I've been playing OJ for two years now and the game still feels fresh. Not to mention it's continuing to be updated. Mob hypers soon! I wouldn't doubt if they added more characters. There are also seasonal events, like the current unlockable halloween costume event.Here's the part where I tell you the negatives about OJ.If I had to pick one thing that bugs me about the game, it would be the AI.-Online: They're questionable when it comes to some of the decisions they make.-Story Mode: Loaded dice...It's not game breaking, but it is mildly annoying.This concludes my review on 100% Orange Juice.If you're thinking about playing OJ for the first time, my advice would be to not underestimate anything. Especially Jonathan (Seagull). "

												for those who want a quick answer before i start this review then here it is: ITS AWESOME BUY ITRight im starting this review right this game is composed of story mode, free play and shop ill start with story mode.Right story mode is you know playing through the story of MANY charactors of this game and there is fairly alot and you unlock charactors whilst playing through certain charactors stories, which you purchase from the shop feature ingame with the ingame points you earn. right the story mode while leave you happy and raging at the same time. The aim of the game is to get enough stars or kills to level up 5 times and win the game you get stars from landing on the star points or battling the other charactors killing them and grabbing there stars. Or you can go for kills which is basically knocking them out so they have to revive the following round. You start as a base and when you get enough stars or kills you have to get back to your base to level back up do this five time and you should win the game, You also get certain cards in a deck which will heal you, kill others or be used as traps to steal stars ect.This is where luck will either help you or get in your way, ever round you move around spaces on a board, yes this is a board based game anyway every round you have to roll a dice and the number you get with the dice is how many spaces you have to move, abit like monopoly. with the battle system it is the same you charactors have there own stats which will add to what you get on the dice roll, what number you get with the dice will go with your stats and deal the damage to the enemy.BUTon the single player the bots in my experience and many other will alot of the time get the best of you the bots are super lucky, thats why i said this game is based on luck and you will either hate it or love it. The bots have a habit of usually rolling quite high sometimes and it will really screw you over. you might lose a couple of times but when you go back and win its the most best feeling ever. It feels like you just done the best achievement in your life XD.the freeplay is basically multiplayer which is the same as the single player story mode except you play with other people on the maps with your chosen charactor and cards you also can unlock cosmetics for your charactors like Hair, hair colour and costume colour, and there are certain charactors you unlock on multiplayer.The shop is a feature where you buy the charactors and maps and colour packs you unlock in story mode and free play, but dont worry you buy these with ingame points which earn through playing through story mode and freeplay.I have brought both dlc for the game and say it is definitly worth it,the two dlc packs consist of two charactors per dlc. so you get 4 when buying both. IT adds to the roster and gives you more charactors to add to the many in the game.THATS  PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING, i hope you havent turned your brain into mush by now. Overall its a must buy game.

												i wish i could get back all these hours/days of my life but at the same time ive enjoyed every minute. highly recommendanyways, i think it's important to note that this game is best played when you dont want to play a skill based game. winning is totally rng, which i personally rly like because it means i can just chill and play and enjoy myself and it isnt like a stressful experience. every once in a while though you get some angry dude rolls bad once or twice and starts complaining about everything and ultimately ragequits. dont be that guy. everyone hates that guy. this isnt cod.have fun. enjoy the cute anime grills.

												This is a surprisingly fun 4 player dice and card boardgame featuring a bunch of characters from Orange_Juice games! If you enjoy those boardgames that make you hate your friends like Mario Party and Dokapon Kingdom and have such friends to play with, this is a great game. Your goal is to choose a ""norma"" or objective: you can choose to either collect a certain number of stars or kill a certain number of players/critters, then touch a flagpole to complete the goal. Cards will do a lot of stuff like disable players, steal stars, manipulate dice rolls, force a fight, etc. and they often cost stars to use. Players can build decks of cards for a game, but they are combined and shared between all players.Singleplayer is an unfortunate grind and doesn't get any more interesting until the very end. Since the AI is rigged with loaded dice (what singleplayer boardgame doesn't have these?), it can be a frustrating game of patience with the rng to go easy on you, and since you're playing by yourself you can't enjoy it with friends. So I highly reccomend playing with buddies.			"

												-Characters taken from the games made by these japanese indie devs. You probably aren't familiar with any of them, but they're designed distinctively and have a good amount of personality.-Board game gameplay that lends itself to swift turnabouts, high stakes duels, and masterstroke plays. Playing with friends on a skype call is recommended so everybody can hear the yelling.-Generally a very friendly community, and reliable developers. Semi-frequently updated with new, quality content, usually in the form of very cheap DLC.			"

tl;dr Anime Mario Party that somehow manages to have MORE RNG and yet still be more fun. Use voice chat when playing with friends.100% Orange Juice is a strange beast--it's made me loathe my friends and even question my relationships--and yet it's the most fun I've ever had with a party/board game.100% OJ is extremely RNG-heavy; any game aspect where an outcome can be determined by rolling dice has dice. Explaining the gameplay is rather difficult, but you learn it quickly; I'll try my best to explain it here. The first player to get 5 Normas wins; Normas are achieved by either collecting stars or winning battles, and subsequently landing on a home tile. Additionally, a single card can be played during a player's turn; cards have a variety of effects from allowing you to roll two dice, to warping all players to random spaces. Some cards can only be used in battle, causing things like stat buffs and debuffs, or conditionals like a battle lasting until one player is KO'd. There are also trap cards, which are laid down at the player's current tile, and have effects like forcing players to discard cards, or--worst of all--forcing the victim to exchange star counts. In terms of battle, every character has their own stats for HP, Attack, Defense, and Evasion. HP is a simple number stat, but ATK, DEF, and EVD are done D&D style in that they add or subtract from a roll. In combat, the player initiating combat rolls first to determine how much damage they deal. The target then must choose to defend or evade; defending subtracts the amount of the target's roll from the attacker's roll, while in evasion the target roll must be higher than the attacker's roll to avoid taking damage or else take full damage. Unless certain cards are played, the target then gets to attack before combat ends. Overall, there is a lot of die rolling, hence why many call it an RNG simulator. I concur.Surprisingly, this game has a story; though it's not terribly engaging, you do need to play it as it unlocks characters that can then be bought from the store using your total accumulated stars. Each of the four starting characters--QP, Suguri, Marc, and Kai--have their own story, but they're more or less the same, with only level order being different. Overall, the story is a good choice if you have no one to play with you, but if you always have people to play with you, it becomes tedious as you play it to unlock more items when you could be playing with your friends and having more fun.Overall, 100% Orange Juice is this odd case where it has infuriating amounts of RNG--so infuriating that you wind up laughing with everyone else you're playing with whenever ridiculous things happen. It's a great choice if you have plenty of friends on Steam who can play with you and if you can voice chat with them; you'll have a riot of a time.			"

												An epic tale of a young man like many a young man whose wallet is stolen, on his quest to retrieve it from a seemingly impossible enemy he becomes friends with those experiencing similar trials in life. Orange Juice 100% is 1000% worth the money and time that will be spent on it. The gameplay is deep and engaging with many outcomes you would never expect thanks to the almighty RNG. Multiplayer mode is also great fun to play with friends and return to the days when people would hang out in person before ending their friendships over a game of monopoly! 10/10			"

tl;dr Anime Mario Party that somehow manages to have MORE RNG and yet still be more fun. Use voice chat when playing with friends.100% Orange Juice is a strange beast--it's made me loathe my friends and even question my relationships--and yet it's the most fun I've ever had with a party/board game.100% OJ is extremely RNG-heavy; any game aspect where an outcome can be determined by rolling dice has dice. Explaining the gameplay is rather difficult, but you learn it quickly; I'll try my best to explain it here. The first player to get 5 Normas wins; Normas are achieved by either collecting stars or winning battles, and subsequently landing on a home tile. Additionally, a single card can be played during a player's turn; cards have a variety of effects from allowing you to roll two dice, to warping all players to random spaces. Some cards can only be used in battle, causing things like stat buffs and debuffs, or conditionals like a battle lasting until one player is KO'd. There are also trap cards, which are laid down at the player's current tile, and have effects like forcing players to discard cards, or--worst of all--forcing the victim to exchange star counts. In terms of battle, every character has their own stats for HP, Attack, Defense, and Evasion. HP is a simple number stat, but ATK, DEF, and EVD are done D&D style in that they add or subtract from a roll. In combat, the player initiating combat rolls first to determine how much damage they deal. The target then must choose to defend or evade; defending subtracts the amount of the target's roll from the attacker's roll, while in evasion the target roll must be higher than the attacker's roll to avoid taking damage or else take full damage. Unless certain cards are played, the target then gets to attack before combat ends. Overall, there is a lot of die rolling, hence why many call it an RNG simulator. I concur.Surprisingly, this game has a story; though it's not terribly engaging, you do need to play it as it unlocks characters that can then be bought from the store using your total accumulated stars. Each of the four starting characters--QP, Suguri, Marc, and Kai--have their own story, but they're more or less the same, with only level order being different. Overall, the story is a good choice if you have no one to play with you, but if you always have people to play with you, it becomes tedious as you play it to unlock more items when you could be playing with your friends and having more fun.Overall, 100% Orange Juice is this odd case where it has infuriating amounts of RNG--so infuriating that you wind up laughing with everyone else you're playing with whenever ridiculous things happen. It's a great choice if you have plenty of friends on Steam who can play with you and if you can voice chat with them; you'll have a riot of a time.			"

												100% Orange Juice is basically a simple little RNG and strategy board game where the object of the game is to complete 5 normas (quests) to win. You can also have a max of 3 cards in your hand that you can use. Each card has a different cost and effect and you'll see by playing how they work. You compete against 3 other people or CPU and the quests are either to win battles or have a certain amount of stars. Either way, you need to get 5 completed before your opponents do to win.I'm still not exactly sure what orange juice has to do with this game but that aside the game is actually pretty fun. I started the campaign without knowing the rules or how to play at all, and it took me 1.5 games to pretty much learn everything just by playing. With that being said, the game's rules are simple enough to get used to quickly and there are more multiplayer lobbies than you'd expect. By winning games you can also get points which you can spend in the games store to buy custimizations, card packs, characters, etc.Overall, 100% Orange Juice is a casual little game that I would recommend to anyone if the price drops under $5.Rating: 7.7/10Recommend Price: Under $5			"

												100% Orange Juice is the apex of virtual board games. It is the most exhilarating, adrenaline-flowing, heart-pounding, rage-inducing and rewarding thing to come from the country of Japan since the kotatsu. If you don't like anime, don't let the artstyle pull you away from making the best purchase of your video gaming career.While the singleplayer gives some interesting scenarios, the meat of this game is multiplayer over VoIP. Listening to adult men get frustrated and laugh like drug addicts, while watching small girls bouncing around on a disco board to happy-go-lucky music, is an amazing sight to behold for the low price of $3.  Friendships are at the stake, and it's your job to be the cute chibi girl to burn it all down to the ground.|||Let Justice Be Done, Though Lolis May Fall|||			"

												probably the best board game on steam. single player is engaging, with four stories to beat and some extra levels. collecting cards and unlocking characters is fun and gives a reason to keep playing. speaking of characters, there's quite a few, with a wide range of stats and each having their own special card. you can use these characters online and play with friends. playing online is way more balanced than single player, because the single player seems to have really weird rng that can be frustrating at times. other than that, though, the game is incredibly funjust like my chinese cartoons/10			"

												It's pretty fun if you've got friends to play it with or can find an open lobby. The method of unlocking characters is to beat the campaign mode, which is a little time-consuming even if you do hold down ctrl + shift to skip most of it. Once you have them unlocked you don't ever need to do that again, though, so it's about 1-2 hours of your life lost to have more fun in multiplayer.And boy, is multiplayer fun. This is a Mario Party or Dokapon Kingdom-esque game that takes elements from both - You 'level up' via stars or wins and the first to reach 14 wins or 200 stars is the winner... Provided they can make it back to a 'home space' before they're killed or worse. There is combat, both against the environment and other players, and there's a decent cast of characters that fit several roles - PvP oriented, star collection oriented, and a mix of both. I've had a lot of fun with this game, and I'll probably keep playing it for a long time.Definitely recommended!			"

												Wacky fun. That's really the best way to describe it. A 2D digital board game made solely for the anime-girl enthusiast, you and three other players collect cards, gold, and experience from traveling around a flat map and killing monsters and each other. Unfortuantely, the game isn't really self explanatory and it helps to play with friends when figuring out how things work. Each player has a set of cards that they put into the game deck, which are then shuffled and dealt out to players randomly. These cards can either hurt a player by dealing damage, heal damage, lay traps, give coins, etc... The players take turns moving around the board and landing on spaces, which give coins, cards, or spawn monsters where the player must fight with dice rolls. You can also fight other players to make them lose their next turn, or lose gold and slowing down their progression in levels. The objective is to level up to level 5 first, by either killing enough people/monsters to get experience or by collecting coins from spaces and other players. There's definitely a difficulty curve, but the online multiplayer is surprisingly very stable. The art might turn people off at first, but at the end of the day this makes for a very fun game to play online with your friends.			"

												Do you guys wanna have a bad time?This game is amazing. I never knew this game was a thing and I wish I could play it more.Anyways, it is kinda similar to mario party, where you want to collect the most stars or kills you want. Star for the Pacifist route and the kills for the genocide route. Of course it can be change after you complete your objectives and each characters can perform much better in certain objectives.But here is a twist, you will die over and over again, learn there is something else then just a board-games playing with popo. You will rage quit any times like dark soul level. You are about to win, but Mary popo wins by steeling half of your starts and into the point. And saddly you can play the best character at the early of the game if you do your campaign.The music is great and Yuuki theme is the best in my opinion.And many unique characters with different play style.

After more hours of gameplay, this game became more competitive and fun to play. Playing with friends is even better and the story mode is all goods to play. Tricks will be used, everyones luck will be random, and Seagulls will destroy you. My personal favourite board game ever.-Easy to learn system-Awesome card abilites-Hard NPCs -Variety of characters to play-Chickens and seagulls that can wreack -Tears friendships apart-Praying for a roll of 6-There is no orange Juice in the game9/10			"

												100% orange juice is a casual card/board game. That has a cute anime chibi theme to it, from the characters you play, to the cards you use.Gameplay: 8The game play here is pretty solid. You start off with a character, then you build a deck of cards that is used in the main game. Once everyone has made there decks the game will start. Once in the main game everyone's decks are placed into one pile in the middle of the current board. Which will be used to draw cards from. So that mean you can draw other players cards while they can draw your own. You'll find your self playing on different boards that can have a different setup each time you play. Each board has there own ""board event"" from doubling up on Star, cards, or losing stars, to being randomly teleported to a different square and much more. You have 6 different square types. Home, Card draw, star bonus, star lost, monsters, and teleports. most of these are self explanatory. Home is where your character starts the game off at. Home also is used to accept and complete missions also While it can heal you or anyone else for one hp if landed on it.  However one of the benefits about your own home is no matter what you roll if you end up going to it or passing it they game will allow you to stop at your own home and if you do so, you won't be able to use the rest of your movement. Monster squares are two fold. Monster Squares are events where you end up fighting a basic monster to gain more stars. But be careful they will fight back and knock you out resulting in you losing half your own stars. After so many turns every monster square will turn into a monster boss square which spawns harder monsters to take down but gives a greater star bonus when defeated. After a boss has been defeated all monster squares goes back to normal monster squares.You start a new game off with one card that is drawn from the deck in the middle. You are able to get more by landing on the green squares. Some card require you to pay and/or have the right level to use it. While many different card types to be used like Traps, Hypers, battle, events, and boost. Each can effect the game differently while adding more strategy to your game plan.Characters have there own character cards that shows there stats to attack, Defend, Evade and HP while some have card Ability’s. Every character has there own hyper card that is unique to them, However it is possible for other players to take this card from you and use it.The goal of the game is two fold. Either win by having 200 or more stars, or winning fights between monsters and other players. At the start of the game each player starts off at level one. To be able to level up you must complete missions either by collection enough stars or winning enough fights. The high level you can become is level five.Combat in this game is determine by a dice roll on a d6( a six sided die). When entering combat with a player or a monster your allowed to choose one card from your hand that can altar the fight, Keep in mind that only certain cards can be played during combat. The attacking player will always go first. While in combat your base stats will effect your rolls. When someone attacks the defending player or monster they have a chance of rolling either a Defend or an Evade roll. Each one plays out differently. While choosing a defend roll you Subtract your roll to the damage that is being inflicted on your character to a minimum of one damage. While Evading you MUST roll at least one number higher than the current attack number to avoid taking all damage, If you roll equal or less than the attack you will take the full on coming damage to your character. Both sides will be given a chance to attack and defend. However there can only be one attack and one defend roll for each side. There are cards that can effect this however. When fighting a fellow player, if you successfully knock them out you will gain half of there stars into your own pool. After a player is knocked out, every turn that comes they will need to roll to be brought back up, if they fail to get back up the rest of there turn is skipped.Now the bad part about the game play is the RNG (Random number generator) factor. However do not let this discourage. There will be times you feel like the game is cheating you while other time you feel like things are playing out in your favor. If you get easily upset or take game seriously then this game is NOT for you. This game is a fun casual game that almost anyone can pick up and play. And If you don't mind the RNG factor then you might find this game to your liking.When finishing your current game, every star you have collected will be added to your game profile to be used in the store. The store is where you buy booster packs, More characters, Color pallets for characters, and boards. However the bad part about the store is that you must level up your profile to unlock more stuff from with in the store. To do this you have to play online with either friends or random players. It's not much of a big deal really but it still would of been nice to have a leveling up system in single player for the people who are just wanting a fun quick game and not have to play with others. However this is still a minor thing.Graphics: 7The graphics in the game are very colourful with an anime style look and feel to them. All the characters are chibi form. The game has very playful and inviting graphics that is simple but yet nice to look at.The only real problem i can see with the graphics is when you are playing on a board the background has the same repeating design over and over. It's nothing major. Some people may find it distracting or annoying. Music: 8The soundtrack is great mix of easy listening music, to upbeat techno, to anime style music. One thing that can be a problem is while playing the music can repeat it's self over and over again. Story: 3The story is all over the place. There is no real “story” being told here. Every character you can play as has a some what of mini-story to it. The story’s are mostly a random reason to play the game with other NPC's you end up meeting. Some of the reason can be cute and funny.Online: -I normally don't review online play for games. However with how the game is setup it forces you play online to unlock more stuff as I stated above. Over all it doesn't bother me that I have to play online. However I believe a game shouldn't force you into playing online to unlock everything. There are much worse examples out there that does this than this game does.Final though. I give this game a 8 out of 10. While this game is very casual and fun, with no real story going on. It's play value is really high. It may be annoying with the RNG factor however this can be the most fun part of the game of just not knowing the out come of whats ahead. I can not stress this enough that this is a casual game and should NOT be taken seriously. It's a very light hearted game. I can see this being a fun game that the whole family can enjoy(if you have mutable computers, steam accounts and willing to buy this game for each account). For the price it is well worth it. I have spent hours playing this game and  I can say that I have not been disappointed. It's a very simple game but can have enough complexity to satisfied most gamers.I HIGHLY re command this game to pretty much anymore. Just don't let the RNG factor stop you from enjoying this game.

												When I first saw this game, I thought it would be some little game strung together for the sake of it being there.What I found instead was quite interesting.100% Orange Juice is a computer board game that roughly works like a cross between monopoly and munchkin, although it has MANY things which make it unique, at least from anything I've ever played before. Throughout an entire game session, dice-battles and star-collecting (stars are the currency of the game) occur on every turn, but the game is only won once five goals (or ""normas"", as the game calls it) are achieved, which is determined by the number of stars or the number of enemies beaten. What's very nice about the norma system is that you can chose between either of the two goals, although it should be warned that a norma can only be advanced once the player returns to a home square.With lots of things that affect the progress of the game, it's not a kind that you sit down and relax to as you play it: one wrong move or half-baked thought can be detrimental. However, I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone who wants to have a solid strategy-focused game either, because at times, outcome can be as random and undefined as a game of poker. But for the patient, this is quite a cup of tea, and a great one, in fact. It's fun to experiment with the different elements of the game, seeing which might bring about a more likely (though still uncertain) victory.Oh yeah, and there's apparently a plot to this game. Haven't wasted my time enough to know all about it, but the other aspects alone should provide more than enough to satisfy.Much like a cup of actual orange juice, 100% Orange Juice is a sour kick if you're not ready, but tastes very good once you let the sweetness make its way in, even making the tartness feel like it truly has a purpose.

												This is truly a unique concept, combining card game, board game and RPG genres. I would have given this game a 10/10 but since there is no manual or tutorial it is more so a 9. However, when you finally figure out how the game works, it's loads of fun ( at times frustrating ;P ). It does not have minigames (like in Mario Party), so it is pretty much based on luck (which I don't have, hehe) and strategy. Overall, I loved the charming characters, the card play, battle system and the online play as well. It may seem a bit quirky if this isn't the kind of game you would normally play, but I do suggest trying it out, at least!			"

												Hime doesn't get to have nice things: the movie: the sequel: the saga: the game director's cut edition with preorder exclusives.Now, for my (slightly more) serious review.Ever wanted to play board games? Ever wanted to play board games and RPGs at the same time? Ever wanted to infuse copious amounts of luck into something to see how you strategize around bad luck?This game's got you covered. 100% Orange Juice is a game that combines a stardard dice-rolling board games with a combat system. You and three other players choose ten cards each to shuffle into a central deck. You can draw a card from the deck by landing on certain spaces. At the beginning of your turn, you can either play a card, if it is applicable, or you can move. Spaces can give you stars, take your stars, give you a card, teleport you to another space, or initiate combat with a simple enemy.The combat system is simple: Roll to attack. The other side can choose to evade (take no damage if their roll is higher, but take the attack roll in damage otherwise) or defend (take damage equal to the attack roll minus the defense roll, but always take at least 1 damage). Then, the defender gets to attack and the attacker has to respond. The character you play as affects your final result: Character stats affect their maximum hit points and can add or subtract from their attack, evasion, or defense rolls. Once both sides have taken their turn to attack, combat ends. Don't fret; if you die, you revive at full hit points once you roll above a certain threshold (that decreases for every turn you stay dead).Players can challenge other players that happen to be within their movement range, stopping them from moving any farther and initiating combat with the other player. Defeating a player grants two wins instead of the one win you would get for defeating an enemy NPC.The goal of the game is to collect increasingly large numbers of stars (given in slowly increasing numbers at the start of each turn cycle, called a chapter, or by defeating a player or enemy in combat to take half their stars) or wins, and then landing on a checkpoint space. Each checkpoint, called Norma, grants multipliers to rolls on star-giving or star-taking spaces when you achieve it. Once someone has reached the fifth norma (the colored stars next to your character's head indicates what norma you're currently on), they win the game!Of course, it can't be that simple. The cards you draw can be played in battle or at the start of your turn, if you meet the required norma and star cost (green stars count for one, yellow stars count for ten). You can play an event card that causes some effect to happen immediately, from dealing two damage to a random player to giving a +2 modifier to everyone's attack roll for their next battle, either attacking or defending. you can place a trap card on the space you are currently on,  that will affect the next person to land on it, not excluding you, with something like a -2 to their defense modifier for the next three chapters or skipping their next turn. You can play an effect card that affects only you, such as negating the next trap card you land on or instantly healing 1 hp. Battle cards, played before the attacker rolls, can affect roll modifiers or have more unique effects such as preventing the battle from ending until one side is dead.Each character also has their own unique hyper card. A Hyper card can be an event, battle, or effect card. They tend to have powerful effects, like forcing everyone else to skip their next turn, or allowing you to roll two dice for everything until your next turn. You are only allowed to have three cards in your hand at most, and if you pick up any more, you have to discard  cards until you have a hand of 3.The boards you play on aren't just for pretty backgrounds and their space layout, either. Most boards have events that happens at regular intervals such as Regeneration (everyone heals 1 HP), Minelayer (a random trap card is placed on a random space), or Charity (everyone draws a card).How and when you play your cards, where you choose to move, and whether you choose to fight a player all require luck for your rolls and strategy for your decisions. You may end up being in last place despite your best efforts, or everything might go perfectly for you, but entire games going the way you want them or the way you don't are few and far between. Most games will see you madly scrabbling to recover after a loss, wildly defending your position while you're ahead, and denying other people's victories whenever you can.6+4/10 game, except the seagulls keep killing me.

												If you like being subjected to the cruel sense of humor of the RNGod, then boy is this the game for you.I wouldn't recommend playing this game alone, it's best played with friends or acquaintances, because it's a board game, the more the merrier. The luck aspect of the game just makes it so much more fun and frustrating, and it has given me plenty of laughs.Games go by fast enough if you set the speed to 4, and you always should if you ask me, so it's not that time consuming if you want to play something with people and don't have an hour or so to sink into something else.

												Description: 100% Orange Juice a game that pulls characters together from other games that Orange_Juice have created into a single game of crazy board game goodness. This game is basically summed as a board game meets card game. It has a few scenarios for a story mode with some extra/challenge scenarios after the scenarios to round out a decent pure singleplayer phase. The game is prefered for it's multiplay, it's multiplayer is for up to 4 people with cpu players filling in the blank spots and with some fun rewards you can unlock from multiplayer instead of playing the scenarios. There is also a free play mode to just jump in and play some against some cpu players instead of playing scenarios again and again or going into multiplayer.Good: It's a fun game with tons of replay to it. It's great for casual time wasting as well as just something for you and your friends to get together and play for a fun game night. The music for the game is fantastic as well ranging from simple little beats in the menus to jazz and techno/dance for character themes. The visuals are pleasing (if you apreciate cutesy animu). The cards all have fantastic art on them from comical to stunning. Flavor text on each card is a fun read some with refrences to the games they are orignally from to just fun little things. Fantastic thing is for a board game, there is a speed setting in which you can set how fast the animations flow in order to speed up each action in order to not have the game drag on from just waiting on the animations to stop (lots of animations from dice rolls, to card use, movement, and so on).Bad: The game is extremely RNG (like all board games) I am putting it into the bad becasue alot of people tend to rage at RNG and their horrible luck (basically here is your fair warning). Like Mario Party and Mario Kart back in the day, this game can destroy friendships if you are way to competetive. The anouncer can get alittle annoying constantly hearing the cutesy voice call out what panel you are landing on and which players turn it is (mainly because it steps on the music man, so good!).TL;DR: Great little animu board game to get together with friends and play just for the funzies. Great music, fun interesting art and visuals, can be very competetive if you are that kind of player, and VERY RNG!I give it from my own personal tastes as well as the factors stated above,9.5/10 Game as a whole10 waifus out of 10 For Animu goodness12 out of 10 For great music			"

												Wacky fun. That's really the best way to describe it. A 2D digital board game made solely for the anime-girl enthusiast, you and three other players collect cards, gold, and experience from traveling around a flat map and killing monsters and each other. Unfortuantely, the game isn't really self explanatory and it helps to play with friends when figuring out how things work. Each player has a set of cards that they put into the game deck, which are then shuffled and dealt out to players randomly. These cards can either hurt a player by dealing damage, heal damage, lay traps, give coins, etc... The players take turns moving around the board and landing on spaces, which give coins, cards, or spawn monsters where the player must fight with dice rolls. You can also fight other players to make them lose their next turn, or lose gold and slowing down their progression in levels. The objective is to level up to level 5 first, by either killing enough people/monsters to get experience or by collecting coins from spaces and other players. There's definitely a difficulty curve, but the online multiplayer is surprisingly very stable. The art might turn people off at first, but at the end of the day this makes for a very fun game to play online with your friends.			"

Short Review:I've never rolled snake eyes so often before in my life. 1/1Long Review:Summary:100% Orange Juice! is an objective based board game featured an all-star cast from doujin game developer Orange_Juice (hence the title). Originally a single-player only game, Fruitbat Factory has improved the game for its Steam release with widescreen support and HD assets, online multiplayer, character skins, post-launch DLC (with cooperation from Orange_Juice themselves) and continuous updates bringing extra content, fixes and balance changes.What to expect:- Single-player story campaign with difficulty levels ranging from fair to loaded.- A large cast of characters with varying playstyles and unique musical themes.- Objectives: collect stars or just go around punching things.- Dice rolls. A lot of them.- Collectible cards and a myriad of strategies around them.- Risk-reward decision making. This game teaches probability!- Lobby-based online play with a (largely) friendly community.- In-game text chat to yell at friends and strangers alike.- Costume customisation to stand out from the rest.- Chaotic games featuring crippling defeats and incredible victories.- Pudding, strong birds and star-stealing demon spawn.- Valuable life lessons: don't be afraid to fail. And Poppo always wins. "

												This game is super anime which is terrible because I'm not 12. The concept seems pretty cool. It's a board game where the objective is to hit certain milestones in number of enemies defeated or in amount of stars you gain from doing pretty much anything. You choose a deck of cards to bring with you that tend to affect all players and are gotten from various squares on the board and can use the aforementioned stars to buy boosters of more cards.I played the campaign some and considering it has a similar friendship destroying reputation as Mario Party, I'm gonna give the multiplayer a pass. Every sound effect is grating after hearing them repeated for 45 minutes straight. Get it if you like card games and board games and anime. Verdict: It's a game			"

												Without looking at guides on how to play this game I delved right into the action and was immediately confused on what to do, so I quickly searched up a guide on steam and relaunched the game. 100% Orange Juice is a mix between a board game and a card game that is based primarily on luck and a little knowledge on how to play the game, this game has two ways of winning to gather enough stars and to beat enough enemies. To move on the board you roll a die, if you reach an intersection you are able to choose which direction you would like to go (After learning the tiles you can get the best out of your turns/chapters). There are different tiles on the board and an action is performed on each one that may benefit your game or hurt your game (Luck based) these include; gaining or loosing stars, versing creatures, Draw a card and battle. I found this game fun to play, however after playing more than 3 hours I found it very annoying how hard the ai is in this game, so I recommend only playing this with a mate who owns the game. The developer 'Orange Juice' used vibrant colours in the game and a refreshing art style that I have not seen by any other dev although the music is great it became very annoying after the third loop. Overall this game was fun to play, had extremely difficult ai, based upon luck, great visuals, tons of campaigns and content and great but catchy soundtrack. Not quite worth 6.99us asking price through for the content in this game however is definitely worth it if you have friends to play with. *Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*			"

												This game is terrible. It's almost entirely luck. 95% of the game is determined by dice rolls. Games last way too long, there's way too much down time between the player actually doing anything, and there are very few meaningful decisions the player can make on the player's turn. Even the process of starting a new game when you get screwed by bad dice rolls takes way too long. This game is an exercise in frustration.			"

												Well, I'm not a huge Anime fan, so this is a review based on somebody expecting an interesting board game. Let's get to the point: It is not. You have five different field types you can land on plus your home field. You have cards to spice up things, but for me at least it didn't really make a difference. The game isn't a total waste of time, but it gets old quick. You run around the board randomly gaining stars or defeating opponents to gain levels and thus win the game.I bet if you're into Anime this game is a lot more interesting to play and I might have missed most of the card gathering and deck building fun, but for the basic gameplay it's a nope from me.

												A really fun RNG board based type of game that initially was not on my radar. I mean since I didn't play and experience all of its character from the previous game instalments. So, I was somewhat reluctant because I didn't quite fancy danmaku shooters myself (in which I pretty sucked and lack the delicate touch and patience to maneuver myself past barrages of bullets lol). So yeah I didn't really wanted to part my with my money based on that and the fact that it is a board based games after retiring from playing physical board based game since a long time ago.However, a good friend of mine made a mistake purchasing a 4 pack and that he was kind enough to gift me one of his copy of the game (in which there is a hidden clause *cough cough) and my oh my, only then I actually realised it was a fun and addictive game to keep me occupied while I sortie with a good dose of cards to collect and being in such fine company of other fellow loli juicers (pun intended).Happy juicing indeed.Cheers.

												If you ever wanted to make the cutest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friends ever over the most insipidly evil game in the entire universe, andalways wanted to know what would happen if you mixed AM from  I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream , HAL 9000 from  2001: A Space Odyssey , RNG, board games and everything Japanese up in a blender and put it up for sale on Steam, this is the absolutely perfect game for you. Seriously. It's like the opposite of Mario Party, where the inherent evil of the game mentally forces everyone you meet to be unbelievable cuties and incredibly friendly and want to be your friend. Not to mention, this game has quite possibly unlimited replay value due to the fact that the game will quietly taunt you for never beating Tomomo Hell and not unlocking Tomomo to show off that you have Tomomo to your friends because you will never beat Tomomo Hell because you might as well be trying to beat Russian Roulette with 7 bullets in the chambers.In case you hate yourself but also love not having an empty friends list, pick this game up. You know what, get the DLC, too. And never ever ever in a million years play Campaign, unless you want to learn why you can't say ""Campaign"" without ""pain"".Recommended for sadists, weaboos and Hitler.			"

												A fun little game about kawaii waifus murdering eachother to get the norma. The game is a little more rage inducing than it looks but quite fun. It's a simple board game that allows you to draw cards and mess with each other. In order to win you must complete the norma 6 times. You either have the choice of collecting stars or defeating enemies. Be careful though because if you lose a battle you lose your stars. The cards however allow you to play with the rules. It's kind of like Sorry! the board game but different in a couple of ways. However watch out for poppo because she is a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												100% RNG-uice A really fun game to play with friends, I say this, also another way to destroy friendships, I mean, Cloud of Seagulls is OP, as well as Yuki's Gamble and Long Distance Shot, like oh boy, the many fates i've received. Still, I can't keep away from those Chibi Girls, a good way to pass the time, either with friends or on your own. Just beware of the Offensive Seagull, the Defensive Ball and the Evasive Chicken... Because 100% RNG-uice (ayyy) loves to just screw you over with the mobs rolling a 6 which for the seagull is a 7, my poor Suguri or my Saki can't withstand the brute force that is the Offensive Seagull.

												Funny, entertaining, sometimes infuriating and packed with far more content than you might have imagined; 100% Orange Juice is a mixture of boardgame, card game and dice game that pits four characters in heated battle to gather resources and become the best cameo from games you never played. With boards not unlike those of Mario Party yet sans minigames, 100% OJ is based not so much on the stages themselves but rather in the interaction between the character you pick, out of an available 15 plus 7 DLC characters (more on that later) and a very simple deck of event cards that you can build before each match. While it's a bit complicated to explain, here's the basics: Characters are essentially defined by simple stats (health, attack, defense, evasion and how easy they are to revive) and an unique ""hyper power"" that all help define their playstyle. Cards on the other hand, and by extension the decks that you build, are gathered into a communal pool that ALL players in a game can draw from and in doing so define the rhythm of the game; hopefully somewhat in your favor if your deck construction was good and you are lucky enough to draw cards that benefit you. In this way you get characters and decks that, for example, are more suited to travel all along the board and gather stars while others are more suitable for walking around and beating up both enemy players and the NPCs that are scattered throughout the board- with both ""stars"" and combat ""wins"" being the resources that you need to level up your character and in the process win the game.There's more to it than that, too; like the fact that cards can cost stars to activate as well as require your character to be a certain level before use and that for you to level up, you actually need to land in specific ""goal"" tiles that act both as base and healing spot for the characters while they make their way around the board. It's easier to understand once you play the game, and do note that there's a demo available, but it all comes down to fast (15 minutes, tops) and more often than not pretty entertaining matches- even if they DO have more than a fair share of RNG involved (mostly RNG, some would say.)So, while the gameplay can be a bit nebulous to explain, what does the game actually include outside of that? Well much to my surprise the game is legitimately full of content and features that are pretty impressive for something that's obviously a shoestring budget game. With four single player campaigns (as feather-light as the one plot for them all might be,) extra scenarios, custom games, online multiplayer, achievements, VAC protection, trading cards and a progression system that unlocks characters, maps, cards and even character customization options as you progress through the campaigns and play multiplayer matches; there will always be something to play for if you do decide to go deep into things.Now, it is important that I bring special attention to the unlock system as it is something that will both draw in some people and turn off others: You see, you start the game by picking ONE character out of four available choices and to unlock the rest you need to play and beat the different scenarios in the single player campaigns. Usually each new scenario is another character that you can unlock and then purchase ingame (with ingame currency, something that you obtain after every single game you play whether you win or lose) so while the game DOES have a lot of playable characters, the choice to keep them locked at the start is a bit of an odd decision that is sure to annoy some. The same limit applies to cards as well, with ""booster packs"" purchasable in the ingame store and that randomly unlock all the available cards for you to play with. Last but not least, the store also includes certain maps and color packs that are basically palette swaps for character's clothes. It doesn't stop there either. Separate from the campaign and exclusive to the online mode, multiplayer games in turn give you experience points that can then be used to unlock discounts on the ingame store, even more palette swaps and a special set of characters that all have very marked gimmicks and are separate from the ""main"" cast of the game. Each multiplayer match played also has a chance to reward you with special customization options that take the form of different hair colors for the different characters and ones that can't be obtained any other way. This means that even if multiplayer does have a genuine sense of progression without actually affecting gameplay that much, completionists will probably suffer with the random nature of drops. Fortunately the multiplayer mode is pretty alive, albeit at the time of writing probably especially so because of a recent sale, so getting a game shouldn't be hard.Finally and especially after the mention of so many unlockable gameplay features comes the topic of DLC characters and game balance. The question that most of you still reading this huge review probably have is whether or not I'm insane the different characters and cards are actually balanced and thankfully to that I can say: yes. While the DLC characters are unlocked as soon as you purchase them, none of them are actually stronger than the regular ones but rather they have different gimmicks. The same applies to the cards from the DLC pack, doubly so thanks to the fact that all players can draw and use them as long as one player with the DLC includes them in his deck. It IS true that some characters are easier to use than others and that some need to get very specific cards to truly succeed but the balance is good DLC or not and on top of that game is so random that matches are pretty much unpredictable one way or the other. Do note there's actually 7 DLC characters at the time of writing; 6 available in DLC packs and 1 available only to players that purchase QP Shooting - Dangerous!!, another game from the company that brought us 100% OJ.In conclusion: 100% Orange Juice is one of the cheapest, most unique and most enjoyable multiplayer games that you'll find on Steam as long as you are into the kind of gameplay that it offers. Good online boardgames in general are kind of rare to find, doubly so as proper full-fledged games; so whether you have a hankering for something like it, a pack of friends that dig ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting around or even just a few extra dollars in your pocket, this game is a must-have.

												Do you have friends? Do you love playing games with them? Then get this game and ruin all that in a matter of moments! You'll continously screw each other over, scream that you can't hit that ♥♥♥♥ing chicken. Cry when that seagull kills you and takes all your stars. Scream at the idiot that decides to use that one card that summons the boss. Contemplate suicide when you are one turn away from winning and your friend screws you over. Rage when you use your hyper and still lose because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rolls. Swear that the boss is cheating. Learn to hate kawaii anime girls forever.And you will absolutely love every moment of it.The only downside I've found with this game is that it'll never be as fun as that first time you play with your friends without looking at the instructions.

												100% Chance Time from Mario Party. Very easy to learn. 4 player limit.Super short review! If you don't play with people, this game isn't worth playing imo.Ok this game is front-loaded with gambling, driven by RNG, but there are ways, like in any card game ever made, to influence the odds in your favor. That can also be altered by the various game boards' layouts, which make the goals of accruing currency vs winning fights harder. Through patience, you can use the sparingly-dealt cards to completely screw over your opponents at the most critical moment, or introduce a number of cards that can harm everyone, including yourself.So that's why the game is only worth playing with other people. The fun of it comes from destroying your friends and strangers, and then accidentally make them win while robbing yourself blind.The single player campaign is goofy, but it allows you to unlock new characters rapidly, the best reason to play it.

												Played this game for an hour and a half straight and could never get past the first level. The game is horrifyingly dependent on luck, which promotes frustrating feelings of being cheated out of victory when playing against the AI. Several times I found myself fulfilling the criteria to level up, yet could not due to die rolls refusing to allow me to land on a Home space, and lost because of it.There is no discernable difference between the difficulty levels (defeating the point of having difficulty levels), and the alleged ""Easy Mode"" character has no benefits while every other character has significant benefits to accompany their meanger penalties. The cards in the booster pack available at the beginning of the game are mostly just duplicates of the cards you already have (which are mediocre), and since everyone's cards are pooled at the beginning of the game there's really no incentive to put any thought into the 10 cards you pick for your deck.The game's aesthetic and music are good (if a bit generic), however presentation means precious little when you have such a fundamentally flawed game. The devs seem to have barely applied themselves and I have genuinely seen better game design out of high school level amateurs.I recieved this game as a gift, however I sadly consider my friend's money wasted on such a poor product.

												Pros:- A really fun game to play alone or with friends!- A wide variety of characters- A wide variety of maps, cards- Skins and accessories for the characters.- You won't get bored of the game ( At least I can't get bored of it ;3 )- Kawaii voice audio :3Cons:- Poppo *sighs* (Ofc she get's the 1st place on the cons list lol)- Some of the good and cute characters are received only after purchasing the DLC for them.Summary: A game that is always fun.. even if you play alone. There are many characters which you can play with and you can achieve skins for them when you play. A wide variety of cards which you can choose from.. Anyways.. they can help you friends/enemies or annoy/destroy them.. ( Be careful tho.. some of your cards can hurt your character too ). So if you are searching for something fun that will calm you down, you definitely should buy this game! I'll rate this game 10/10 "

												I just realized my success rate with this game is overwhelmingly bad. I mean seriously, it usually takes me 4-6 fails before winning a single round. My dice chances are the worst, even my random card picks are so bad. I don't even think buying dlc characters would help me. Gawd, I hate this game. //slits wristWhat's even worst is I can't stop playing it despite my frustration. If you're M get this game, no kidding.EDIT: Ok i've read that aside from strategy, you actually need to study or get yourself used to probability rate (or something like that) to increase your chances of winning. Don't let this cute game fool you. It's serious stuff.			"

												This game is pretty fun. It is a video-board game with a lot of RNG so many may not like it. But if you like fun casual games, you will likely enjoy this. This game is at time exciting, frustrating, and rage inducing. You might be the type to play it once in a while and you'll like it. But if you get really into it, be prepared. After playing this game for so long, it has taught me that trying to win as hard as you can is not the way to go. Having fun is more important than winning. Even if you play 'low-tier' characters that are super fun instead of the 'top-tier' chars you probably wont notice a difference, and you'll enjoy it more.  Also its a lot more fun in online multiplayer. The community is also really nice and friendly, so no need to worry about that. During the steam sales you may find the occasional jerk who just bought the game but those type of people dont play for very long lol. Its also definately fun to play with friends you know as well.Or for those of you who like cute things, a more informative review would be the following:10/10 - Everything is cute. Mega cute.			"

This game is worse than uno, monopoly, and catan all combined when it comes to destroying friendship. You'd start to love and hate this game at the same time. I used to have 3 best friends and now we all want to kill each other because of this demonic game. PS. Don't mess with the seagull			"

												OJ has a nice feel to it and reminds me of some of the games I grew up with. I like it. It's incredibly solid gameplay-wise, with impressive balancing. I never feel significantly handicapped by who I'm playing as, except for a few gimmicky exceptions. The card count is high enough to allow for a great number of deck configurations but low enough to be easily accessible. The AI is dumb and gets dice advantages, but the multiplayer community is active and overall very pleasant. I wish there were more boards, maybe even some sort of board-making tool, and there are some crappy ones, but overall there's a good selection.There's an occasional connection issue online, and the DX9 update seems to have caused slowdown for some, myself included, but this is pretty easy to overlook overall.Don't let the DLC scare you off. Because of the way the deck is handled, you can experience a good chunk of DLC without even realizing it, and there's really no paid advantages.Game's definitely worth the full price in my opinion, though I got it on sale. The DLC isn't any gamechanging stuff but it's good to grab on sale.I've gotten a lot of mileage out of OJ and I don't feel burnt out at all. It's a riot with friends and is just a nice experience overall. It sounds stupid, but it's good to have an enjoyable game every now and then which isn't all about blood, guts and murder.Even if the anime style throws you off a bit, as it did for me, it's still massively enjoyable. Turn off voices and you're all set. It's grown on me quite a bit anyway.			"

												A fun, kawaii RNG based board game. Many strategies can be applied to increase your probablility of winning, but the RNG will make sure you can't win or lose the game nearly every round. Most fun with human players, there is almost always somebody willing to play with you, and it's hard to find ♥♥♥♥ players. Lively conversation can be had about what's going on in the match if you or another are a little creative, and it adds to the social aspect greatly.Certainly worth full price, doubly worth it on sale. I haven't felt I spent my $ so appropriately in quite some time.100% value!			"

												100% Orange Juice is the funniest board game available on Steam for you to play alone or with your friends in Multiplayer Mode (supports up to 4 players per match). Even though it relies heavily on luck, all the strategies and choices made by the player are decisive in the matches. The game has a vast array of well-balanced characters, each one with unique stats and abilities, all drawn from games made by the publisher (Fruitbat Factory) and the developer (Orange Juice). The game grants a great variety of events per match due the combination of cards, field events and dice rolls, making each one (even the singleplayer matches) fun and unique. Playing 100% Orange Juice never gets boring, you know? But please be careful, Poppo can drive you mad.			"

												CUTE, COMPLICATED JAPANESE GAME THAT MIGHT END YOUR FRIENDSHIPSOK, not that serious, but competitive friends might get in for a fight! A mixture of Mario Party, trading cards and RPG, OJ is an addictive board game that seems too complicated at first, but after some time paying attention to what happens after reading the guide file, it becomes extremely funny! Your objective is to clear tasks (caller ""norma"") before your opponents do. Whoever clear all levels of norma first, wins the game. Simple? Not so much! The board is filled with slots that will either benefit or trouble you, such as the drop slots, the bonus slots and people can even drop traps for whoever's coming! Not only that, but there are monster battles and a boss can either be summoned by a player through the use of cards or the game itself will place it there -- and they're not fooling around! Although the battles have a basis on chance, it's quite possible to follow a strategy so long as you know the character you're playing with. That is very important when fighting opponents, since they can be far more dangerous than regular mobs!If you want to have some casual-yet-hardcore-competitive-fun with your friends, OJ is your game! I didn't find a single thing I don't like about it yet and the best part is that no one suffers netwrok delay (I'm in Brazil and I play with a friend on the US, so we do have issues with certain games). Worth the full price, even more worth it on sale. I didn't think twice before buying the 4-pack for half the price!			"

												100% Orange Juice is 100% chance. Whether its by getting killed right after collecting enough stars to win, or stepping on a boss panel & dieing 5 times in a row, something will troll you.These aspects will make for fun rounds with friends.Sound asset seems to be kinda repetative, especially if you hit speed up [Shift + Ctrl], so I recommend lowering the voice & effect volume a lot.Tip:Unless your masochistic, don't play single player with the character marked as expert.41 first casual campain matches lost [13 hours]. 42nd try I finally won. Not kidding. That mode seems to be weighting the dice rolls to make you lose, rather than just having a character thats hard to deal with.			"

												It's a good game, I like it because..something? It makes me go back in somehow...maybe to test if i get lucky and WIN?! --but how frustrating is it when you have both final win conditions and not only can you not roll enough to get to your Home number but also get teleported several times over when you are thissss close to getting to it, also get stepped on enough times to not get back up then have someone else win?! Holy crap I just get SO furious!!!			"

												Sometimes the ""random"" number generation makes me feel like this game is 100% B.S., but other times, I can't help but laugh at other's bad luck. So far it seems like a lot of grinding is required to unlock everything in the store, but overall this game is very fun, even if you're just going to play it by yourself.			"

												Do you think you've felt TRUE sadness?Do you think you've felt TRUE anger?Do you think you've felt TRUE happiness?Don't claim you have until you've played 100% Orange Juice, this game will bring you to undiscovered levels for every emotion you've ever experienced. The singleplayer is so cruel and brutal you'll soon realize underneath the cute anime faces are demons that feed on your misery, once you get further into it, it gets so frustrating that when you finally do win you feel robbed from the joy because the horrors and suffering you had to endure leaves you scarred for life and cursing your very existence even as you watch yourself fight against all odds to achieve victory.When you're stuck on a level you start to wonder how you can hope to beat any other challenge in your real life when you can't even defeat little anime people in a game of dice.Despite all of that, don't think your only option is to suffer alone, play online and listen to your friends and even randoms laugh at your existence as ninja seagulls and chickens trained in dance by Michael Jackson juke the very attacks you put your heart and soul into only to hit you back twice as hard, leaving you on the cold hard ground struggling for life until the game pity revives you because you couldn't even roll high enough to deserve a revival.When you finally see your friends, the cpu's, or randoms suffer in the anime mario party yugioh dice rolling mayhem it's the most glorious and satisfying feeling you'll ever experience in your entire life, it makes you forget everything terrible you've been through and fills every orifice of your heart with happiness. As your friends threaten to remove you from their lives it simultaneously restores your faith in justice and karma within the universe.Ultimately this game is everything you didn't know you wanted in a digital board game, and an experience you didn't know you needed.88/8 Best game on Steam			"

												This game is great if you like kawaii animu characters, board games, dice rolls, and ruining your friendships. The entire game is RNG. If you cant handle the fact youre gunna roll poorly every now and then, leave, go find another game.The game is played by rolling a die to determine movement, land on a bonus panel? roll a die to determine bonus. land on a drop panel? roll to determine how much you drop. land on a battle panel? roll to determine attack. didnt kill the thing and now its fighting back? roll to determine how well you defend, or whether or not you evade it. Also the game has a card system kind of like items, there are draw panels that give you a card, the deck is determined by what each player puts into it. some cards influence battle, movement rolls, inflict damage, heal damage, and alter stars and let you draw cards. Also each character has a special (Hyper) card which is a card specific to them and usually has the best effects.			"

												So this game suprised me, I wasn't expecting something quite as addictive and fun, the game has some fun characters, intersting and easy concepts and is definately worth the money!The game's RNG doesn't get in the way of being skilled and alot of the games skill actually focusses on adaptive strategy, adapting to the situation you're in and selecting your decision.The game is very fair to anyone, you could put a total noob against a game god and the noob still has a good chance of winning. The game's online play is very fun and playing against 3 other friends whilst chatting online leaves you with over an hour of joy per game of players screaming, laughing and praising/praying to the RNG gods.However, the game still could use a little more improvements, I wish there were more Norma options and whilst the game is pretty deep in terms of what you can do, I'm always wanting more! Otherwise this game is a great game to play with friends or on your own. 9/10 recommend.			"

												100% Orange Juice is a board game that consists of 20% skill, and 80% luck.  You do have some decisions to make, but fate is mostly decided by the dice.  Gameplay consists of choosing cards that will tilt dice rolls in your favor, choosing your path when you see a fork in the road, choosing to fight or not, and choosing if you want to advance by collecting stars or winning battles.  Although it may sound like you have decisions to make, you'll quickly realize that there aren't too many opportunities to make decisions, and ultimately the dice decide everybody's fate.Check out the demo to get a feel for the game.  If you like cutsey anime characters and games of chance, this is made for you.  If you really like being in control of situations, you should probably look somewhere else.			"

												Ah, 100% Orange Juice. The game that has more potential to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and throw your computer out the window the moment you use by only 1 star on the goals.To be honest, I originally got this game only because it was cheap during the Steam Sale, and it looked incredibly...whats the word...Awkward and weird. But later found out, (just moments before telling everyone in chat that I wouldn't get mad at the game ever.) that losing 3 times in a row on the easiest difficulty on the SECOND episode makes you immensely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.I never threw more fits in 5 minutes in my whole life because of this game.So if you want to have a rage, drink some coffee, chat 'em up in the group chat, and above all a terrible day, buy this now!

												Plays like a cross between the Game of Life and Talisman e.g. dice-based RNG heavy board game with character stats, battles and some cards. Not as good as either of the games it's inspired by, but overall still pretty decent. I have no idea what the setting is, who any of the characters are, or what the story in ""campaign"" mode is about. Apparently they keep stealing some guy's wallet so then he challenges them to play a board game. I assume something is lost in translation.This is not a deck-building game, CCG, European style board-game, or particularly strategic or tactical in nature. Will appeal to a wider audience than most digital board games since the gameplay is relatively simple.Recommended, if on sale. Otherwise, get Talisman, Elder Sign, or Ascension first.			"
