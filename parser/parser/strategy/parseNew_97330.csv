												A fragmented player base brought on by new year to year versions instead of add-ons to a base game.A weak, difficult, and time wasting multiplayer experience brought on by said fragmentation and lack of basic functions like rank/matchmaking or even the simple ability to add someone to your steam friend's list while in game. This in addition to the general problem of online games being invisible to the player or knowing how many people are online playing at a given time - thus giving the impression of a dead multiplayer experience. Hell you can't even vote to restart a multiplayer match in-game that you might have drawn no lands in.Confusing, overpriced DLC that often ends with people not knowing what they have bought, have already, or should have and thus ends with a multitude of complaint threads on these forums.Slow UI, slow load/boot up, problems with card selection/assignments, & genreal bugs that seem to never be fixed year to year as one game is thrown out for the next.This game has now 4 editions 2011,2012,2013,2014. The consistency between all versions seems to be a lack of attentiveness to increasing value to the basic player experience through debugging and improved multiplayer funcionality while adding as many ways to fleece the player of their money.This combination of problems diminishes intrest year over year and will eventually lead to a product few want because those potentially interested have already had some form of irritation or negative experience with a past iteration of it.The future is dim for a product that adds little - if any - value, year to year, while holding fast to the mountain of mistakes in its past. Buyer beware.			"

												Much like the table top version of the card game, but on PC. You need to take care of how you send spells to the stack, as the game will follow the rules to a T - often times leading to effects you may not have desired. Overall a fairly fun experience, gets even better if you have friends to play with. It is slightly trying at the beginning if you are used to playing your own decks, as they limit you with what you can use to start out. The game does provide the option to unlock more decks and cards for the provided decks as you play.Review for badge progress - feel free to ignore			"

												Great game if you're new to Magic and want to try it out, and it's great if you're an experienced Magic player that's looking for some challenges. The only thing about this game I didn't like was the online pvp matches were dead. All the single player stuff is very enjoyable. Get it, you won't regret it!			"

												Magic 2013 is a card game, in this game you battle an opponent by summoning monsters and playing artifacts and spells to get their life to 0, make them run out of a library (deck) or win by card effect. everytime you win a game you unlock a card for the deck you are using unless you've unlocked all the cards for that deck.  you do have to unlock decks by beating certain levels of the campaign. Pros -- I found this game to be very addictive, clever and fun.- you can customize decks with set cards to make your decks unique and to work around your play style whilst stopping decks becoming over powering.- this game has 3 game modes on multiplayer which are free for all, 2 head giants (2 v 2) and planeschase which is FFA but with a deck in the middle which changes the game by adding new rules, effects, abilities, adding life and even destroying cards.Cons - - The AI knows what's in your hand and the order of your deck. i believe this since the goblin deck has a card that has an ability, which reveals the top card of your opponents deck that player can play it if its a land. - Do not be zoomed in on a card as its leaving the battlefield since this can cause the game to crash and you can have the card stuck on your screen zoomed in making the game unplayable since you can't see what's going on.This game does require alot of time if you want every card unlocked or if you don't want to spend lots of time unlocking cards  you can purchase a deck unlock if you prefer. I chose to unlock the cards through winning games since I don't want to pay for something i can get for free whilst playing a game I enjoy. I would recommend this game since the game is only around Â£15 if you purchase the DLC which gives you more decks and it's a load of fun, especially the multiplayer.			"

												If you've not played Magic in over a decade and want to tap some mana, this may just be the game you want to pick up. Here, you get a number of decks to play with, several modes and styles of play including multiplayer.Things to keep in mind:You won't find cards from the early era of magic you may recall from ages past. Alpha, beta, The Dark, Arabian Nights? Unlimited, & 3rd edtion? Not here. What you will find are a selection of decks from moderan 2013 era magic. What matters however is that you are given numerous ways to play the game and a number of various decks to mess around with.You can buy this with a number of unlocks set, or with all cards unlocked. The locked variant might be for you if you enjoy the challenge of unlocking cards and the related achievement pleasure that can be had from unlocking. If you just want to play with cards, as many as you can get your mits on (without grinding) - you may want the 'Complete' edition.At worst, in this release you can't build decks from an entirely raw ensemble of cards. You can however heavily modify the numerous decks that you are given. Most of these decks have anywhere from 30 to 40 specific deck limited extra cards that can be added or used to replace default deck setups to modify your style of play. Despite these official limitations of the 2013 M:tG game, there is actually something of a modding scene. Google for mods and you may just stumble into what you want if you really want to build decks from scratch / have minor game play bugs fixed.A very minor user specific issue that can be disabled: Foil cards. IRL they're entertaining and in the game you can have them too. Yet they're animated and constantly glimmer. The constant animation can become a little irritating, turning a novelty special card into a literal headache. Fortunately, - the game has an option to remove the appearance of foil on all foil cards.So, all in all this is a solidly entertaining version of Magic to mess around with on a computer. Be it offline multiplayer locally, online multiplayer, or in single player vs. AI's of varying difficulties.			"

												Good game, but the intermediate to advanced levels and achievements are quite tough unless you're a regular Magic player. Deckbuilding is kind of a bear (some things are just easier in real life), and I take issue with how the rules for some of the card powers were interpreted. All in all a solid Magic computer game, with a reasonably tough AI for non-veteran players.			"

												This game is great for learning how to play Magic, which is why I got it. The main problem with this game is that the save function is glitched and only saves the previous match but not the one that you just finished, and the company behind the game doesn't give a damn. This game is well made, but at its core, it is still a cash-in by Wizards of the Coast. Buy this game if you have friends to play with, or if you just really enjoy Magic enough that you don't mind your game not always saving. For the most part, I don't feel that I can positively recommend a game that its own company doesn't care enough about to make sure the save feature works properly.			"

There are bugs EVERYWHERE and the AI cheats so it gets the best cards and you get the worst. Oh yeah, and you have to unlock the actually decent cards.			"

												I review this as a total noob to Magic the Gathering. I found the game entertaining and quite challenging. I haven't racked up many hours or progressed that far through it but that's largely because of other pressures. I was impressed by the gameplay and the stylishness of it. It's fun and challenging and justifies some hard strategic thinking. At my level I don't have a deep enough instinct to construct good decks. It is very easy to get a suicidally unbalanced deck or one which is hopelessly unable to counter a specific strength of a particular opponent. So far I have done ok - the game is forgiving (in the early stages at least). For beginners I can give a strong recommendation. For experts, go with what the other reviews say.			"

												A good solitaire replacement, that's all. If you dislike luck factor in your games this is a definite no-no for you. There are many overpowered and many weak decks. You can't build a completely custom deck. If you want that www.mtgonline.com is what you are looking for. However you can customize the premade built-in decks by adding and removing unlockable cards from them. There are many bugs, exploits etc. in this game and they are never going to be fixed. The developers are horrible. They only care about making money as making a proper game then fixing & updating it with new content is much more difficult than releasing basically the same game every year. You don't want to play DotP with strangers all the time. There are cheaters, the folks who never get bored playing the same overpowered decks forever, people who leave if they don't get the perfect opening hand they want etc. Easy to make friends in this and people who play this game are generally real nice and interesting. You don't miss much by not playing but I still recommend this game anyway. I have to warn you though, when the new version will be released this summer, the multiplayer of 2013 will die and the multiplayer is everything this game is about. The AI sucks.6/10			"

												No free deck building which makes every game predictable and takes out 90% of the point. The decks used by the AI are terrible. Most of the time its multiple copies of the same card thrown at you continuously. There should be a cap of 4 of any individual card in a deck but this has been completely ignored and makes for very unimaginative decks and repetitive games. On the plus side I didn't pay very much for it and it killed a few hours. So if you have low expectations, enjoy regular in game advertising, slow irritating animations, and pointless emo character bios then i'd recommend this game.			"

												Great game, spent many enjoyable hours with it.  Been playing Magic the Gathering for nearly twenty years ago and I still love the game, blows my damned mind.  It's a dead game now though, every year when they released the new Magic the old community would die.  There are some people that play but they use modded decks and there is a community for them.  I believe that there is one of those for 2012 and 2014 as well.  We do have Magic Duels now which is nice but a huge pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥at times.  Go to that, it's free and has a lot to offer including an active community.			"

												Way better than 2012 Edition, This was so worth it. After (I think) 88 hours I still don't have all the decks unlocked. I loved the revenge campaign and that the challanges were also extended with the DLC and getting all the achievements was amazing. Unlike Magic the Gathering: Duels of the Plainswalkers, with its %100 cards unlocked achievement. I still don't have that on 360 and I love those classic decks. It was just too much. Here there is never too much in the wrong place, I've dealt over 200 damage, attacked with 168 monsters at the same time, and had over 400 Health. 2013 has a player summary page to see these stats and what deck color you use most, it's pretty great. Too bad this franchise almost never goes on sale, because I got mine for half price and same with the DLC packs, so I got the complete game for less than the game, full price. Buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, I'll play it with you.			"

												The 2013 installment of this series is very nice. The deck options are decent, but they seem a little bland (all one colour). There are some nice game modes and replayability. Get the expansion and/or some deck packs because those single colour decks can get stale. It plays the same as most of the 'Duels' games (not a bad thing), so if you've played the others, you know the drill. However, the different game modes and decks offer a lots of freshness! Check it out, it's one of the better games in the series. I still think this series is good for offering Magic in videogame form, without getting into breaking the bank on cardboard crack. It's very casual, but it is also great for superfans.			"

Magic the Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013If you're new to Magic, this is a great place to start. I decided to try this after a friend introduced me to the actual card game, which I found surprisingly entertaining and so decided to try my luck with the video game. What drew me into the game in general was the artwork, and it still fascinates me how this simple but effective illustration style manages to make the action jump right off the table. As a complete newcomer, whereas more advanced players understandably criticised them, Duels' limitations felt like positives to me, where an unrestricted version of the game could have made things prohibitively complex. The only negative I can find personally is the shocking amount of attempts at monetisation.Pros:Stunning fantasy artwork and sleek user interface;Mechanics are easy to learn, but the game itself hard to master;Single-player campaign's gradual learning curve adequately prepares inexperienced players for more challenging encounters;Clever puzzle scenarios are a nice break from the regular game while continuing to teach useful strategies;Overall simplified approach of Duels is perfect for new players.Neutral:Very simple narrative thread serves its purpose;Ready-made decks and limited customisation possibilities help level the playing field;Background soundtrack is subtle enough that it stays fresh for a while.Cons:Inordinate amount of attempts at monetisation;Some questionable AI decisions at higher levels.

												This game is pretty old now, and there are updated versions you can get if you want. If this game is on sale versus the newer versions then it's fundamentally the same game. Magic the Gathering hasn't really changed as far as rules and real gameplay goes, but the newer versions have the updated cards and slightly better mechanics. I would compare this to textbooks for school, the older ones are cheaper and still work, but the newer ones are better and have the most recent information.			"

												One of the better duels of the planeswalker games, everyone i play with seems to enjoy this one the most out of the whole series but i personally perfer 2012 since its less buggy than this one and this one seems to freeze up too much in my opinion. and 2012 has more avatars to choose from haha.  if your intrested in one of games this isnt a bad one to get but i would start with 2012 and buy this one if your looking to add variety			"

												Introduction:My only prior familiarity with Magic: The Gathering was via my oldest son, who gravitated towards the card game.  Such games follow an effective business model, encouraging individuals to invest large quantities of money into cards to ensure probability is in their favor.  Though the game seemed somewhat interesting from what I had seen, I simply did not want to go down that investment path.After looking at the Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the PLaneswalkers series, my interest grew as not only did each new version add additional layers, but was also a finite investment, regardless if one purchased all the DLC.  From the standpoint of true Magic: The Gathering fans, I can understand how this would be a complete affront, given it is a trading card game.  Looking through the reviews, I gathered as much.Summary:After assessing all the Duels of the Planeswalkers series, I can say without a doubt that my favorites are 2013 and 2015.  Personally, I think 2013 is a great way to get started with the game, moving towards 2015 once one truly is ready to truly get into deck building.  Having stated that, if you are tride and true CTG fan, perhaps something like HEX might be of more interest.  Nevertheless, given Magic Duels is shutting down for good, I caution anyone considering that route as such games can quickly become a money sink.			"

												Riding on the success of DotP 2012's improvements, the 2013 release introduces revamped decks, a new unlock system, and a new game mode. While 2013 has less decks available (16 versus last year's 19), they are overall more accessible for quick play because of the 10 promo unlocks provided post-release. The decks are also more balanced in power overall because you aren't locked out of the best cards anymore. However, this is a double-edged sword; While you can unlock a total of 40 cards per deck, many of them are dups and you can only unlock one at a time. To put this into perspective, beating the first campaign (the longest in the game) will unlock 26 cards.While I enjoyed the difficult challenges (the hardest challenges of the DotP games in my opinion), this game is riddled with issues that will never get fixed or improved since the devs have moved onto their next yearly release. Locking out all but two decks at the start is a terrible way to introduce new players to MTG, especially considering the target market for these games. The one new game mode, Planechase, is only worth playing with friends; The AI is terrible at it, seeming to attack and roll the planar die randomly. Despite being marketed towards new and casual players, this game can only be recommended for experienced MTG players because of the unlock systems and frustration with non-human Planechase.			"

												What can I say, a game that hearkens back to my junior-high days playing in the lunch room with 3rd Edition.  The cards are new, some abilities are new but all are easily understood.  It's a great nostalgia game for me sans the hassle of having to obtain the physical cards.  Not being able to create your own deck is a bit of a let-down but most - if not all - of the pre-made decks are full of potential and quite capable of defeating any opposing deck in its own way.  The challenges are also excellent thinkers and a bit more difficult than in the previous game.  The new Planes Chase mode is interesting - it is akin to playing Magic in the spaceship, Heart of Gold, while the Infinite Improbability Drive keeps kicking in and chaning the rules every turn.  All in all this year's offering for Magic was quite enjoyable.			"

												Finally the game I dreamed of. These games have improved on the previous a little bit with each iteration but 2013 is the first that feels complete in my opinion with the option of manually choosing what lands to tap. This system is still a bit awkard but it's better than being screwed by the AI. Don't expect deck building but you can unlock up to 30 cards to customize your pre-built decks. It's a nice option for people who already play the TCG and a cheap entry point for people who appreciate the strategy of Magic but don't want to spend a lot on cards.			"

They mostly improve the game on each release in the amount of features put in and the polish the game gets. 2013 main feature was getting the Planechase mode but not the biggest fan of it as its a big four player mess of a mode. Chaotic and fun but perfer regular duels. Quite mixed achievements and in a good way as they cover pretty much all aspects of the game so you at least try them once along with some that needs extra focus such as beating all challanges or doing the entire campaign.Time to 100%: 18-20 hours			"

												Magic 2013 was... underwhelming. While I appreciate all the new cards that were added, the experience as a whole felt less interesting than Magic 2012Fortunately I was able to unlock cards this time around. Given the sheer number of decks, they really should have awarded at least two cards per battle. 30 battles per deck is just a horrible time sink, especially when it's not as fun as it used to be. I'm also starting to wish they had an option to turn off ALL animations. If I'm going to be grinding a longâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥game, I don't want to see every card taking 5-10 seconds to play.Sadly Archenemy mode is gone, and 2-headed giant only exists in custom games. I actually found both of those fun. In its place is Planechase mode which... *shudder*. Every round you wait for 3 CPUs to take their turns and they spin that atrocious dice over and over again. It's just... kill me now. Every time.To the game's credit, decks felt more balanced overall. There's some strategy involved where some decks fare much better versus others, instead of a one-size-fits-all deck, but I kind of miss the feeling of overpoweredness from the previous game. The puzzles are still fun too.Overall it's a distinctly inferior game compared to 2012. On its own, only average. I'll rate it 6/10. It makes me wish I was playing the last one.			"

												This latest version of magic includes some new deck configurations, new multiplayer mode ""planechase"" and some nice little gameplay tweaks.  You start with a fully unlocked Garruk deck and then unlock additional decks and cards as you play.  The first campaign is deceptively easy... the revenge campaign requires some deck building skill to beat.  Beyond that there are the usual challenges and the new ""planechase"" mode which requires that you constantly shift your strategy.  Overall this is a fantastic upgrade... the new decks have some very interesting cards, and as usual I love the artwork sprinkled throughout the game.  Recommended highly.			"

												This latest version of magic includes some new deck configurations, new multiplayer mode ""planechase"" and some nice little gameplay tweaks.  You start with a fully unlocked Garruk deck and then unlock additional decks and cards as you play.  The first campaign is deceptively easy... the revenge campaign requires some deck building skill to beat.  Beyond that there are the usual challenges and the new ""planechase"" mode which requires that you constantly shift your strategy.  Overall this is a fantastic upgrade... the new decks have some very interesting cards, and as usual I love the artwork sprinkled throughout the game.  Recommended highly.			"

												Love this game, gets annoying on the revenge campaign since i really cant win against one of the ai goblin deck. Online has basically been depleted, even when spending about an hour waiting for someone to join your game, you may not actually get someone. Ive fully unlocked 4 decks with most of the cards unlocked for the deck, its really enjoyable with battling mates and seeing who can screw over who. i didnt think i played it that much however with playing over 106 hours its still a game which i can always go back to, it can be really awkward at times when you dont have any land cards, but even that doesnt slow the game down.i think this is an amazing game but wish there was a more active online.

I continued to enjoy the game for four duels.On the fifth duel it was revealed that all the AI players receive the same cards every game.I struggled with a green deck, and quickly realized that the AI drew and played the same card each time.Even with the maximum number of cards in the deck, it is statistically impossible that a randomized deck would deal the same hands in the same sequence ten times in a row.

												Eh. I'm not a huge fan of playing MtG through the computer. There's something about shuffling the cards, the smell of the cards, and the physicality of playing across from someone (or a group of people...EDH anyone?). The game itself is not bad, but it's not for me. There were also times when I wanted to do a complex trick in a game, and either the game couldn't accomodate the trick (even though it was within the rules of magic), or I couldn't figure out how to do it within the game mechanics. I actually lost a few matches that way.I'd say it's a pass, unless you want to learn how to play - then it's pretty good!			"

												""Magic the gathering"" is the best card game ever invented in the history of the universe. I liked this version alot better than the 2012 version. I have not yet bought the 2014 version, but I will probbably get it eventually. There are not many differences between all of the duels of the planeswalkers games. But at this moment (11/28/2013). I would reccomend this above the other versions. I definately like the physical cards much better than the virual ones, but this game would be great to learn on and see if you are serious about getting into the ""magic the gathering"" card game. It is fun for both experianced playes and noobs, so there is no excuse for not buying this game (other than if you don't have any money) but on a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 9.5.			"

												Sad? Lonely? Vastly overweight? Covered in zits and random patches of facial hair? Do you have no-one to share your extensive knowledge of Star Trek weaponry with? Have you ever found a dry roasted peanut under your many armpit folds...4 days after eating said bag of peanuts, then gone ahead and eaten it anyway? Do you spend your days wondering what the touch of a woman would feel like? Are you thinking about ending it all? Well none of that will matter when you buy 'Magic: The Geekening'! Available for a sniff of the price of most individual cards online. It's like The Lord of the Rings had sex with a game of Poker, and then genetically mutated it so that the computer knows EXACTLY what card to play to end you. This game teleports you to 2013 where you can play against the same people as you did in 2012, and some others who I've never heard of. Time travel is the 'Magic' aspect of it. Not much changes between now and 2013, apart from the revelation that Kim Jong Il isn't dead. He's actually the Gangnam Style man, after extensive facial roundening surgery. One great thing about this game is that you only need to use the mouse, freeing up the other hand for you to interfere with yourself while watching Shemale Schoolgirl Tentacle Hentai on your duel monitor set-up, and arguing online about who is better, Captain Kirk or Professor X. Before, you had to leave the house to play this game with other like minded freaks. Now, you don't even need to get out of bed. That's 98.6% less wheezing and movement required. If that isn't worth the price of admission, then I'm a sexual predator (I'm not, by the way. I prefer the term, 'Enthusiast').			"

												this game stinks for a lot of reasons....not magic the gathering itself but this particular piece of software. for the following reasons and more:1. the graphics are abysmal. you cant see most of the cards and sometimes one is indistiguishable from another. very tiresome zooming in and out and it doesnt let you see your opponents cards if he plays several rapid fire....you cannot learn and improve this way.2. this is probably the worst of it. it forces you to play red. i keep hoping that at some point the nazi software will allow me the rest of the game but so far i went all the way through it and it still forces me to play red...maybe if i play a human opponent or do other things????? who cares? it should either explain clearly why it does this or it should give you the whole game up front.3.  it seems to have some problems calculating damage. couldnt see this until i finished the entire game against the first wave of AI but then it started screwing up. a card that cost 4 mana and was suppose to do 4 damage to a creature and 2 to the player damaged the creature ok but did absolutely no damage to the opponent. and no dont tell me i am a noob because there was not a single card played by the AI. whatever. how did this piece of garbage get a 77? 2015 cant be as bad.

												In this game you play as Geralt, a pasty white witcher whos task is to slay monsters. The plot becomes very strange as you begin to summon monsters rather than kill them. Additionally it seems the game isnt very well balanced, with some portions being completely random while others are incredibly difficult and frustrating. Even on the easiest difficulty Geralt has no simple sword attack, so youre completely reliant on dumb animals. Additionally it seems all of the exploration is created by you. To make matters worse theres no RPG elements in this and certainly none of the promised sex scenes. I bought this game for two reasons: to fight monsters with a big sword and to masturbate to pixels. Luckily through sheer force of will I was able to complete one of those.10/10 was okay			"

												The differences between 2012 and 2013 is like this. 2012 is cut dry and magic, just straight playing the game. 2013 is that but with 10 new decks, they replaced the archenemy game mode with planechase, the encounters are cool and fun, there is some storytelling to go along with the campaign, which is nice, it adds a little extra to playing your matches along with bakground info on the planeswalkers you face, and on the highest difficulty on both(planeswalker) 2013 is little bit easier than 2012 based on first impressions, it's still a tough game, but on 2012, it took me almost a week to beat the first planeswalker, in 2013 I beat the first one in the first game. So take from that what you want. And also there are player rankings to go along with everything,All the mechanics are pretty much the same, it plays smoothly, and i'd would say that I like 2013 more than 2012. This is the one I would recommend out of the two.			"

												It's everyones favorite card game MTG as its usually reffered to but on the computer. If you enjoy lots of lore and lots of PVP action using card mechanics to beat your opponent then this is the game for you. MTG is a very diverse game in and out, I personally enjoy the real card game face to face with another player but I must say nothing beats collecting the cards and seeing some that you dont have the money for. This game already has a large audience since MTG has been around since before I was born. Nonetheless if you enjoy card collecting and playing against many people this game will always deliver. But seriously go COLLECT the real cards it's way more satisfying!!!			"

												Initially the game had some attraction on me when I played through the demo, since I played the card game originally somewhere in the 1990s. But this game gets boring real fast. I have no clue whether all these gimmick decks are the current state of play with MTG. You're better off spending your cash on a real card game and a phone call / IM and play it in real life - or play for free with something like Hearthstone - which actually doesn't try to milk you for money.

												Another solid installment.  Decks are fun, although nothing shockingly new.  The campaign was fun, as usual, with the new twist of ""encounters"" where the enemy plays the exact same cards every time.  Planechase replaces archenemy, which is fine, but it's brutal in single player mode, as the AI tends to gang up on you.  The challenges are difficult as usual, so you will either continue to love or hate them.  Nothing super new, but more of what I liked about the previous two.			"

												This is a great game for learning magic, albeit the mechanics are a little hard to integrate into the game, making it very slow, especially with a lack of options in order to optimize play speed with more experienced players. This game starts out amazing, but you slowly realize how long the grind is in order to unlock every card. Also, there is not as much customization in decks as there could be as the cards you unlock is set, and some cards you may not be able to get 4 of. As an advanced player, this game fails to meet my expectations, however for intermediate and beginning players this is a great game.			"

												It's Magic: The Gathering.....Okay I'll give a serious review, for those of you who don't know Magic is a card game outside of the game series. If you don't know about the game I would wait until a sale or I wouldn't buy it, the game will teach you how to play but if you don't know if you will like it what's the point. I do play the card game a lot and I can only review the game on it's hardest difficulty. I'm going to split the review into different portionsCampaign- The game has a single player campaign that's seperate from the custom matches, don't expect a super great plot but it's enjoyable. The campaign in my oppinion as an experienced player was to easy even on the hardest difficulty aside from a few challenges, at least until you face Nicol Bolas the final ""Boss"", although by using Jace's deck he is super easy. I did think it was fun though and will get you through if you feel like playing magic and nobody else you know does.Decks-The game features a bunch of decks unlocked through the campaign mode, for those new to the series you cannot create your own deck but by defeating oppenents with a deck you unlock specific cards that can be added or removed to that deck and only that deck. You also cannot modify lands, which is a huge bummer. Playing through the campaign I noticed the decks don't really seem to be balanced, the game is much easier using certain decks.Multiplayer- I can't say to much I don't play online to often, I hear there are a lot of cheaters but I can't say for certain that there are.Custom matches- Not only are there normal matches ranging from 2-4 players but the game has a planeschase option, it definitely adds a lot of fun to the game. Some frustation too.I reccomend this game to anyone who plays Magic, in all honesty I enjoyed this one more than Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013			"

												I bought the Gold Game Bundle of this game. I played the card game as a kid many years ago and loved it, and also really enjoyed playing this digital version now. The problem is that whenever I unlock a card and then exit the game, the card is locked again when I come back to play later. I did some research and it seems to be a pretty common issue for some people that's been around since release with no known real solution - at least not that I could find. Considering the fact that the whole purpose of the single player portion of the game is to defeat opponents to unlock cards, I obviously can't recommend the game and would advise that people not waste their time unless they plan on buying all of the unlocks with cash to play multiplayer.

												Very entertaining game for fans of the cardgame. Helps teach you mechanics if you don't otherwise know them, and can provide intersting challenges for good players.Limited to specific in-game decks with limited customability via unlockable cards, but the decks are arranged beautifully. The two headed giant mode lets you play a 2v2 match, and there are many great deck synchronizations to choose from.RECCOMMENDED			"

												Initially the game had some attraction on me when I played through the demo, since I played the card game originally somewhere in the 1990s. But this game gets boring real fast. I have no clue whether all these gimmick decks are the current state of play with MTG. You're better off spending your cash on a real card game and a phone call / IM and play it in real life - or play for free with something like Hearthstone - which actually doesn't try to milk you for money.

												It's Magic: The Gathering.....Okay I'll give a serious review, for those of you who don't know Magic is a card game outside of the game series. If you don't know about the game I would wait until a sale or I wouldn't buy it, the game will teach you how to play but if you don't know if you will like it what's the point. I do play the card game a lot and I can only review the game on it's hardest difficulty. I'm going to split the review into different portionsCampaign- The game has a single player campaign that's seperate from the custom matches, don't expect a super great plot but it's enjoyable. The campaign in my oppinion as an experienced player was to easy even on the hardest difficulty aside from a few challenges, at least until you face Nicol Bolas the final ""Boss"", although by using Jace's deck he is super easy. I did think it was fun though and will get you through if you feel like playing magic and nobody else you know does.Decks-The game features a bunch of decks unlocked through the campaign mode, for those new to the series you cannot create your own deck but by defeating oppenents with a deck you unlock specific cards that can be added or removed to that deck and only that deck. You also cannot modify lands, which is a huge bummer. Playing through the campaign I noticed the decks don't really seem to be balanced, the game is much easier using certain decks.Multiplayer- I can't say to much I don't play online to often, I hear there are a lot of cheaters but I can't say for certain that there are.Custom matches- Not only are there normal matches ranging from 2-4 players but the game has a planeschase option, it definitely adds a lot of fun to the game. Some frustation too.I reccomend this game to anyone who plays Magic, in all honesty I enjoyed this one more than Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013			"

												Although no where near as diverse as the actual table top trading card game, where you can use ANY cards you have in a much more social setting, this is a great electronic verson of the Magic the Gathering. For only $10 (not counting optional DLC), you can play with several decks of every colour in a campaign, in custom games against A.I., or with friends in several game types. The DLC offer allows anyone to purchase extra decks too, again for a fairly low price (especially during steam sales. :D).The deck building is pretty basic too. You have a set series of cards for every deck and the mana is automatically added for you. Although this can be a pain at times to those who (like me) have been playing for years and like to play around with little things like that, it is perfect for new players who only wanna focus on getting ""the best cards"" into their deck.The only REAL complaint I have is the game timer. While this does make sense for being a PC game, the timer is too long in some moments and too short in others, making the game speed and attention to detail needed very out of flux at times. But as long as you have nothing else to look at you can work with it fairly easily.Overall while this game is more of a plan B for when you can't meet your friends on Friday night it is still a good alternative for a few short games evry now and then, and it is a GREAT game to help those who are new to the game to learn both gameplay and deck building. Just keep an eye on that timer.			"

Deck customization is limited and you have to unlock or buy cards for the full decks. For me, what ruins it are the glitchy graphics. Nonetheless I do recommend it anyway for the casual players.The catch nowadays is that you will have a bad time finding online games. My advice is to join the Steam group: Magic: DotP 2013 (for those who still play) - it helped me at least...			"

												As a standalone game, it's a fun and effecitve introduction to the card game; games are faster paced and more balanced than the preceding installment with more diversity in playstyles between decks.As a simulation to the actual game, it's pieced together suprisingly well; advanced mechanics and techniques that weren't built into the previous game are actually possible now.  Decks in the game also have 40 unlockable cards, making great diversity even among similar decks possible as each deck can have multiple strategies present.It still feels a bit like a bad console port, but it seems that bugs found in the game are being handled and fixed at a much better rate than the previous planeswalkers games.

It doesn't seem to be worse.Just don't buy the Special Edition, as it's a waste of money unless you get it for 50% off or more... and even then it's questionable. You get foiled cards (meh), 5 wallpapers (they're bad), the 2nd comic (low-res PDF), and the soundtrack (6 songs that you can find online for free). I should have bought the regular DotP at $5 instead of the special edition for $10, but oh well. It's not an AWFUL deal and the game is still decent.			"

												I love this game. It is just like the xbox360 version except since you can use a mouse it makes it much easier to play and to various things like viewing cards larger. When I played it on the console I found I kept accidently swapping views or zooming on the wrong cards but on this it is a lot easier and while I have been playing Magic for years this game is simple enough that someone just starting out can play. My step father knows nothing about Magic but knows I have an interest and tried to play it on his own and he got a handle on it very quickly because you have the options as you play to see what each thing means. Like ""haste"" doesn't really tell you by the word what it means but with this game you can click more infor and it tells you exactly what it means.			"

												Only played the single player campaign.That was quite enjoyable. Collect cards, build your perfect deck, beat up baddies. Since I've never played the table top version I can't comment on the accuracy of the rules. Graphics are pretty enough and functional. There are plenty of cards to pick from. Don't bother buying any of the packs, you can unlock cards in game just by playing.There is no story to speak of though.			"

												I played the release of the prior year quite a lot and I found it very entertaining, this one was not as good however. Perhaps I just became bored with the concept due to playing the 2012-version too much, perhaps the decks included in this version are just more boring to play (which I find is true for myself), but for whatever reason the 2012 version was better. I think the balance was better in the 2012-version also. This is not a bad game however, but I would recommend the 2012 version over this one.  "

												~~2015 RETRO REVIEW~~If you want a MTG game to play, buy this or DotP 2014. As of writing this, this year's MTG game isn't out yet, but DotP 2015 is absolute garbage.The singleplayer in this game is pretty solid, as are the decks, but the real star for me is the Planechase mode, which is the main reason I keep this game installed. Overall, I'd say it improves on the DotP formula established in the original and 2012 enough that you don't ever need to go back to those, but the fact that Planeschase is here makes this irreplaceable.

												One of the best games I've ever played!At the moment I recommend getting the 2013 version and not the 2014 one because of the unreleased dlc(bugfixes) and lack of mods. This version has aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of mods behind it and if you can set up a game with your friend(s) using *the same modded decks*(of which there are dozens up in the forums) then you'll never be bored again. In terms of the dlc, I suggest you don't waste your money on them unless you want to play against strangers using those decks or you're in it for the campagin, at your own risk essentially.			"

												6/10, above average. Same old in new dressing.There are some variety on decks, so gameplay isn't as predictable as on MtG 2012. This also means you have to pick&customize decks which are able to beat opponent (on 2012 it was very possible to play whole campaign game with only one deck).This is welcome gameplay adjustment against human players, but when playing against Planeswalker AI (which knows players' hand and library) to unlock decks there will be some frustating moments as without unlocks you don't have any kind of edge against AI.Some decks have been beefed up considerably (e.g. Garruk), other my old favorites are barely playable (Jace, Lillian). One of funniest 2012 modes on single player, Archenemy, is replaced by boring Planechase lottery mode.Game has still same interface bugs as MtG 2012 (and earlier MtGs). So you're sometimes practically screwed by game as you can't do certain actions. This is especially bad when playing MP games.Recommending 2012 for new players.			"

												The special edition unlocks every card for each deck (including foil), but you have to unlock the extra cards on the standard version by battling the single player AI. There are various single player modes and multiplayer modes. There is some degree of deck customization but you cannot have less than 60 cards per deck, and you cannot remove standard land cards.pros: addictive gameplay, includes a tutorial for newer players, good soundtrack, and visualscons: clunky menu, clunky UI, needs more deck customization, multiplayer browser needs improvementFor all the Magic fans, this is worth trying out. A free demo is available if you are undecided.			"

The AI is now just about flawless, new interesting cards and deck themes from the new sets are always being added, interface looks much better and the challenges are even more mind boggling. Plus the campaign is stepping in the right direction by giving the planeswalkers bigger introductions and having you shift through the planes, that and you now have your own player statistics page.

It is, in the first Campeign.A lot of thinking, a lot of frustration and a little luck for any higher level...Sound simple, but it is not always, as each combat summons (pun intended) a different approach to beat.I don't like the fact that the access to many of the cards is DLC'd, and there was no sale in the past 2 years.

												The differences between 2012 and 2013 is like this. 2012 is cut dry and magic, just straight playing the game. 2013 is that but with 10 new decks, they replaced the archenemy game mode with planechase, the encounters are cool and fun, there is some storytelling to go along with the campaign, which is nice, it adds a little extra to playing your matches along with bakground info on the planeswalkers you face, and on the highest difficulty on both(planeswalker) 2013 is little bit easier than 2012 based on first impressions, it's still a tough game, but on 2012, it took me almost a week to beat the first planeswalker, in 2013 I beat the first one in the first game. So take from that what you want. And also there are player rankings to go along with everything,All the mechanics are pretty much the same, it plays smoothly, and i'd would say that I like 2013 more than 2012. This is the one I would recommend out of the two.			"

DOTP was designed from the beginning to be a gateway to other ways to play Magic, such as Magic Online, so don't expect too much content. However, what you get for its price is definitely worth it, especially if you've never played Magic before. The deckbuilding you can do in this game is limited to tweaking the preconstructed decks, but it's still entertaining and gives you a taste of how it feels to fine-tune a real deck.			"

Beyond it's absurd limitations on gamemodes and deck customization, the game is flat-out broken in some aspects. Certain cards just don't work, the interface is bugged and tells you the wrong buttons to press, and on top of this, you can't direct damage how you desire, which is huge in Magic. 0/10 why do I have 30 hours in this god damn game.

												Magic is by far the best trading card game I have played yet. This game gives you new mind sets of strategy when you play and gives you more thought to how you play and how you can interact with everything, even if you're just going against AI. If you have 10$ to spare this game will keep you up and running for a while.			"

												Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013 is an amazing game for players who want to experience a more strategy based game that doesn't lose the action of a normal strategy/FPS/TPS game and still keeps a player on edge. Based on the card game, Magic has several cards for summoning monsters, using sorcery, and playing tricks on your opponents. You can either play on a campaign mode (with AI) or with a random player from online in a variety of gamemodes.  It is improved with updates to new cards and is just as good as its other sequel/update, Magic: The Gathering -Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014. The I expect the new update to have new unlockable decks.			"

												Overall, a terrible mtg game that gives you crapy decks to play with poor mechanics and the most basic cards out there. The campaign is fun for the first 30 minutes, then it goes steadily down hill with no light ahead. The final boss, Nicol Bolas, uses a completely over powered deck compared to the ones given. After playing 20+ times with various decks I still havent beat him and its not because of my skill but because of theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥poor cards provided in the player decks. After beating all campaign matches other than the last I was only able to unlock cards for the basic beginer green deck. This allows no customization of the other decks seen in the game. Also, when playing online, I have seen attack phases and 2nd main phases completely skipped for players,. this is a glitch & should not happen. So there is nothing good to say about this game other than that it tries to imitate mtg the card game, which is a wonderful game. Being a true mtg fan I'm grealtly disappointed by this game..Game Grade: F- (Took a great card game & turned it into dry, unfair and irritating experience)			"

												A much needed upgrade over the 2012 version.  Magic DotP 2013 offers some much needed multiplayer variety.  Two headed giant, Planechase, and just playin multiplayer with up to 4 players add a new twist of fun.  Still lacking a full deck editor, there is a wide variety of preconstructed decks available and you can customize up to 30 cards in each of them as you win games and unlock new cards.  For a small fee, you can unlock entire decks to speed up the process.The biggest downfall is the computer AI in single player.  Set teh difficulty too low and the computer plays like a complete newb.  Misplaying and skipping obvious combos.  Set the difficulty higher and the AI alwasy gets taht one card they need to stop whatever combo you are trying to pull off.  It's a little more than luck when the AI gets the exact card it needs out of its 60 card deck to counter the exact combo you are trying to pull off every time. Only stomach the single player to unlock things that you want, if you don't want to spend the $1 to unlock a whole deck faster.  Stick to the multi-player if you want to have any real fun with this game.  The decks are nothing spectacular, but against each other they are fun enough to enjoy a good game.  The interface was designed for console games and is a little clunky at times, but manageable.  It can be a lot of fun if you have friends to play it with, and is an excellent tool for showing new players the basics.			"

												This is a great game for learning magic, albeit the mechanics are a little hard to integrate into the game, making it very slow, especially with a lack of options in order to optimize play speed with more experienced players. This game starts out amazing, but you slowly realize how long the grind is in order to unlock every card. Also, there is not as much customization in decks as there could be as the cards you unlock is set, and some cards you may not be able to get 4 of. As an advanced player, this game fails to meet my expectations, however for intermediate and beginning players this is a great game.			"

												This is a terrible piece of garbage.  Their idea of a campaign is a list of opponents that you check off one by one.  Their idea of deck building is letting you add a couple cards (and never remove cards) from a bunch of crappy pre-made decks.  This game does play Magic but it does it in a way that fails to capture any of the fun aspects of the real game.  If you want a fun Magic game with a great single player campaign, well you're out of luck because it doesn't seem like Wizards is capable of making one, this definintely isn't it.  If you want to play Magic online with your friends, avoid this and just get Magic Online.  On Magic Online, you can play certain premade decks with your friends for free.  This was a complete waste of money.			"

												This game is great for fans of the card game, or people that just want a strategic game to play. They do an excellent job explaining the rules, which is great, since magic can be a difficult game to learn.  Haven't tried out the multiplayer, but there are 4 sections to the single player, which makes the game longer and far more enjoyable. It's not that demanding to run, which is always good. Only downside to this great game,  is you have to use premade decks, you can't really create your own, which is something i really enjoyed doing when playing the actual card game.			"

												I like this 1st release far better than the 2nd release. The 2nd was an absolute total bomb that was little more than a few cards added to the decks of the 1st release and rearanged past the point of being broken till there are basically 3 or 4 OP decks. Those decks (in the 2nd release) are so powerful that its useless using the rest of the decks in the game - thereby making the 2nd release 80% useless. I actually came BACK to this game and enjoy playing it much more. The only thing they got really good in the 2nd release that makes this one a bit annoying is that you can choose how many land cards in your hand.

												Good Game But ...This game is good and all, with new game modes, new decks etc etc .... BUTThey replace Kiora Atua with that ugly merman .. EWW He has very bad cards in his deck, pretty weak compares to other planeswalkers' decks. I WANT MY KIORA BACK :cPuzzles and Encounter Challenges are really well done, and Twin Headed Duel is the most fun out of all. Oh, also, those new Planeswalkers are pretty much awesome, aside from that stupid merfolk dude :/ "

												Overall, a terrible mtg game that gives you crapy decks to play with poor mechanics and the most basic cards out there. The campaign is fun for the first 30 minutes, then it goes steadily down hill with no light ahead. The final boss, Nicol Bolas, uses a completely over powered deck compared to the ones given. After playing 20+ times with various decks I still havent beat him and its not because of my skill but because of theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥poor cards provided in the player decks. After beating all campaign matches other than the last I was only able to unlock cards for the basic beginer green deck. This allows no customization of the other decks seen in the game. Also, when playing online, I have seen attack phases and 2nd main phases completely skipped for players,. this is a glitch & should not happen. So there is nothing good to say about this game other than that it tries to imitate mtg the card game, which is a wonderful game. Being a true mtg fan I'm grealtly disappointed by this game..Game Grade: F- (Took a great card game & turned it into dry, unfair and irritating experience)			"

												The differences between 2012 and 2013 is like this. 2012 is cut dry and magic, just straight playing the game. 2013 is that but with 10 new decks, they replaced the archenemy game mode with planechase, the encounters are cool and fun, there is some storytelling to go along with the campaign, which is nice, it adds a little extra to playing your matches along with bakground info on the planeswalkers you face, and on the highest difficulty on both(planeswalker) 2013 is little bit easier than 2012 based on first impressions, it's still a tough game, but on 2012, it took me almost a week to beat the first planeswalker, in 2013 I beat the first one in the first game. So take from that what you want. And also there are player rankings to go along with everything,All the mechanics are pretty much the same, it plays smoothly, and i'd would say that I like 2013 more than 2012. This is the one I would recommend out of the two.			"

One of the best Magic games along with the 2014 versionPROS:- The decks are incredibly well balanced. Almost all decks feels equally powerful. To begin with many of the decks will feel very weak but they get much stronger as you progress and unlock all cards. I have unlocked every single card in the game and I consider the 2013 version to be absolute best Magic game in terms of balancing. - A lot of different variety of amazing decks to suit your playstyle. All feel great as they get full unlocked and tweaked to perfection.- Plane Chase (not in the later versions): This game mode is essentially is a regular 2, 3 or 4 player FFA which you battle across a variety of diverse worlds, each with its own unique effect on the game. This makes the game unpredictable as it can quickly turn the tables. This game is pretty fun but does not seem very balanced. For instance if you encounter the plane called Jund, you better prepare to get steamrolled very fast if you are a non-green, non-black, non-red colour player and your enemy is. CONS:- Virtually no one playing the game online. If you want to play against other players online, the 2014 and 2015 is still the best options. 2014 will mostly be Two-Headed Giants mode. 2015 lacks Two-Headed Giants mode but will have better chances of finding FFA games. But the game is absolutely amazing if you have friends playing it.This version plays slower than the 2014 and 2015 version. It will not play as swift and responsive as the later versions. The longer wait between turns is a little annoying.BUG: Deck ""Peacekeepers"" does not seem to unlock cards properly. You can unlock the first 10 cards with a promo code. The rest will unlock as you win games but as soon as you exit the game, the unlocked cards will be lost. This can be fixed if you go to the ""Deck Manager"" and make a small change before clicking ""Back"" and then save the changes. CONCLUSION: I would definately recommend this game despite it's flaws. I would say I slightly prefer the overall play of 2014 version but this is still one the best Magic: DotP. Better than 2015 and MUCH better than the new free Magic Duels, which is an atrocity to be perfectly honest. If you are new to Magic Duels of the Planeswalkers and have yet to decide which version to try, I would recommend the 2014 version first for the above reasons. There are not exactly a lot of players playing it, but you can often find Two-Headed Giants games in 2014 version. This does not seem to be the case in this version. A real shame because it has some really kickass decks. Keep in mind that this game is very rarely on sale. If you see it on sale you should buy it.			"

												This game is really good cause it has the cards and you fight them and you don't have to make the sound effects like when you play the card game in real life because the sounds are on the computer game already and so are the cards so you don't need to go to the comic shop and spend lots of money on the booster packs to get the same cards all the time and have lots of colours you don't need also.  I recommend it for these reasons and for the particle effects that you dont get in real life also.  It's better than real life			"

												The game is balanced, has a wide variety of cards and playstyles. The drtawings are stunning and colourfull. Nevertheless, the bugs and crushes arrive pretty much every other game which is bizarre and unaccaptable for the game that was realised almost 5 years ago. The camera angle is sooo bad, the portatraits block half of the creen and the arid view makes the cards tiny and hardly visible.			"

Whether it be playing the story to unlock the well structed decks or kicking butt online the feel of the game is great.There isn't a large amount of decks to choose from nor can you build your own from scratch but the more you play the more of your decks you can unlock and customise them to play the way you want.The visuals are amazing, although the game sometimes lags when foil cards are played but they can be avoided by removing foils from the game.I would recommend this game to anyone who love's MTG or want to challange there minds. 7.5/10			"

The AI is now just about flawless, new interesting cards and deck themes from the new sets are always being added, interface looks much better and the challenges are even more mind boggling. Plus the campaign is stepping in the right direction by giving the planeswalkers bigger introductions and having you shift through the planes, that and you now have your own player statistics page.

												Awesome prize from /u/narpas. Pretty much everything people say in the reviews is true: the game is smooth and offers tons of controlled variability on the get-go. As a veteran to Magic, the game is very watered down, but still fun because the power levels of each deck are balanced. Interface is clean, art is very cool, gameplay is a little slow (but very accurate), and challenges require some hardcore multilateral thinking. This game is a must-have for beginners and still engaging otherwise.			"

If you enjoy lots of lore and lots of PVP action using card mechanics to beat your opponent then this is the game for you. MTG is a very diverse game in and out, I personally enjoy the real card game face to face with another player but I must say nothing beats collecting the cards and seeing some that you dont have the money for. This game already has a large audience since MTG has been around since before I was born. Nonetheless if you enjoy card collecting and playing against many people this game will always deliver. But seriously go COLLECT the real cards it's way more satisfying!!!			"

												Although no where near as diverse as the actual table top trading card game, where you can use ANY cards you have in a much more social setting, this is a great electronic verson of the Magic the Gathering. For only $10 (not counting optional DLC), you can play with several decks of every colour in a campaign, in custom games against A.I., or with friends in several game types. The DLC offer allows anyone to purchase extra decks too, again for a fairly low price (especially during steam sales. :D).The deck building is pretty basic too. You have a set series of cards for every deck and the mana is automatically added for you. Although this can be a pain at times to those who (like me) have been playing for years and like to play around with little things like that, it is perfect for new players who only wanna focus on getting ""the best cards"" into their deck.The only REAL complaint I have is the game timer. While this does make sense for being a PC game, the timer is too long in some moments and too short in others, making the game speed and attention to detail needed very out of flux at times. But as long as you have nothing else to look at you can work with it fairly easily.Overall while this game is more of a plan B for when you can't meet your friends on Friday night it is still a good alternative for a few short games evry now and then, and it is a GREAT game to help those who are new to the game to learn both gameplay and deck building. Just keep an eye on that timer.			"

												Planechase is the best mechanic and it absolutely sucks that it was taken out of 2014, why I recomend this game over the new one hands down every time. I think this game is great and I love the cards. I don't like the idea of not making my own decks but the decks that are provided are amazing and worth playing again and again.I recomend this game to all my friends and because of it me and my freinds buy the cards so we can play in real life, this is just hell of a game.

												Initially the game had some attraction on me when I played through the demo, since I played the card game originally somewhere in the 1990s. But this game gets boring real fast. I have no clue whether all these gimmick decks are the current state of play with MTG. You're better off spending your cash on a real card game and a phone call / IM and play it in real life - or play for free with something like Hearthstone - which actually doesn't try to milk you for money.

												For new people: Magic: the Gathering. I'm sure you've heard people talking about it, and it's as comprehensible as discussions of quantum mechanics, or foot-to-ball. This game is the way you can experience all the depth and stategy and variety that Magic has to offer without buying a million random cards, then STILL losing because you're playing against losers with no life who've spent more money than you.For Magic 2012 people: Way better than the previous versions because the deck balance is now -excellent-. I no longer only feel like playing 1-2 of them. I know the DLC is a pain, but they add a lot of variety to the game.			"

												Look, you either know Magic: The Gathering, or you don't.  So you shouldn't need a reccomendation, but I'll say this about the 2013 duel of the planeswalkers shell.  It's an improvement in most ways over the 2012 version.  While they stumble a bit by removing some of the popular play styles from 2012 (archenemy WHERE ARE YOU?), and it's crippled in multiplayer by server lag, making the game often unplayable online, the single player game can't be faulted.The single player game, turn based and fun, is a great fix for those M:TG players who want a computer experience that's actually like the card game.I'd give the game 7/10 stars, and that rating would be higher if multiplayer was CONSTNATLY crippled by server lag, making every attempt I've made at the game, completely unplayable.

This version has aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of mods behind it and if you can set up a game with your friend(s) using *the same modded decks*(of which there are dozens up in the forums) then you'll never be bored again.

												Very well done for novice and veteran players alike. Pleasant graphics, local and online multiplayer makes this game make this game a must-have for a MTG fan or even someone new to the series. The only thing that bothered me at first is that you can't make a new deck from scratch, you just choose a pre-made one, which, once unlocked can have up to 90 cards, but you can customize those, choosing which leaving and which taking with you. So overall, the customization is not perfect, but it's there and it is enjoyable, I guess they didn't want this to beat MTG online which is full of micro transactions for the cards you specifically want.But which one to buy? This is quite important :I recommend the gold version because the base version doesn't have all decks you are supposed to have and doesn't have the expansion campaign. While the complete version, which costs a lot, just breaks the game for me, because it unlocks every deck and cards, while the gold version, you have everything in-game, but you unlock cards and decks beating bosses, players and encounters (which is a lot more enjoyable if you ask me).It is both fun to beat friends or bots in the campaign, or even co-op with your friend to take down some strong decks controlled by bots. I recommend it.			"

												It's pretty much what you'd expect, with a few new things from the previous versions of DotP. It doesn't seem to be worse.Just don't buy the Special Edition, as it's a waste of money unless you get it for 50% off or more... and even then it's questionable. You get foiled cards (meh), 5 wallpapers (they're bad), the 2nd comic (low-res PDF), and the soundtrack (6 songs that you can find online for free). I should have bought the regular DotP at $5 instead of the special edition for $10, but oh well. It's not an AWFUL deal and the game is still decent.			"

												MTG is a card playing game set in a fantasy universe. You play a mage who ""casts"" the cards and you have one or more opponents who play/cast cards of their own. Each player starts with 20 life and  you must lower the life of your opponents to 0 to kill them. I would recommend this game for fans of MGT and for people who don't have experience with the trading card game but I would advise you don't pay too much for this game. This game is well suited to teach you Magic: The Gathering's rules. There are a nice selection of decks to choose from and there  are some puzzles you can solve as well as a campaign. The graphics are very slick and smooth, the music is great and the sound effects are good too. I have some negatice criticism about the game too. You cannot create a deck from scratch. As such, if you wanted to play a custom deck and build it all from scratch, well here you can't. The campaign feels very short and be finished in just a few hours (on normal). The decks that you are provided with all begin with just a subset of the full deck. To get the cards that you are missing, you must win battles with that deck. Cards are unlocked one at a time and it feels extremely long to unlock all cards. So to resume, let's say it's a nice magic but very limited in terms of replayability. So my advice is: Buy this game if it's really cheap, say 5$. You'll then get enough entertainment from this game for your 5$. But otherwise, the game will quickly feel like it's missing some features that were deliberatly locked in order to include that content in Downloadable Content (DLC). I have not purchased a single DLC.			"

												Interface is sterile and clunky with mouse, because I guess this game is a money grab of a port. Interface, sound and music is a huge downgrade from the first Duels game. The decks here are less clever and original than in the previous game. Most of the story mode consists of 'encounters' which aren't fights against other Magic decks, but just an AI that casts the same spell infinitely until you find a way to beat it. This has nothing to do with the rules of Magic. The cinematics with the 'animated' comic book panels is beyond outdated for a 2013 game, and do not serve to 'actionize' the superfluous story. (Wizards, please. This is a card game, not a Marvel cartoon.)There are some hours of entertainment in this title, but you might want to skip the cheesy cinematics and the great amount of forced tutorials and just get the first Duels, which is better and cheaper. The few things in 2013 that work, work a bit better in the 2012 Duels and much better in the 2009 Duels.If you are playing to learn the rules of Magic, this title might be a tad easier to get in to, but once you're learning, you'll find the encounters boring and the real opponents too few. You might try your hand at playing online, and with luck the servers are faster and more stable than they were at release. Otherwise you're SOL.			"

Multiplayer is a no-go.There is a single player campaign. I tried it out. It consists of duels against the AI controlling different decks to unlock different decks, and various cards. But, it also consists of, I guess you might call them lesser encounters, where the AI's decks are completely broken. I'm talking 6 or 8 copies of a card, order of card draw seem to be preset, and so on.You can't build decks from scratch.Music is pretty great. Reminds me of Torchlight, actually.TL;DR: Don't buy. Just don't. "

EDIT: The text below was written before Steam Recommendations became Steam Reviews.I'm pretty sure that everyone even slightly interested in collectible card games has heard about Magic: The Gathering. Duels of the Planeswalkers is a digital version of the game that is mainly designed for people that are just getting into M:TG and its rules. The game is lacking some of the core features of its physical counterpart, but can be very addictive nonetheless. It's still the most complex game in the genre and it is being upgraded year after year. One of my dreams is to have a game like that, but with all the M:TG cards in it, a trading system, tournament action and everything else the non-digital version has. This would be just perfect. Also, the card artworks rule.			"

												A few bucks for hours of gaming? Sure why not :D many decks, a ton of cards to unlock, free promos will make many variations, even if decks are pre-made. A blast online, still good offline.			"

												More Kings Bounty... I really overdid 2012 and this was more of the same. Is it good? Yes.Is it Great? Well, if you like Magic it is I guess...The single player mode is pretty good and there are modes in it to keep you entertained for a long time. More of the same, but if you like the same, then do it! I feel the same way about this as with 2012 and 2014. 2015 was the issue..			"

												On balance I would have to say this is a good game, though not without it's flaws. It is fun to play for a time but decks can become so ridiculously overpowered that they seem unfair. However the game isn't without it's charm, and it's probably worth a try.			"

												As a standalone game, it's a fun and effecitve introduction to the card game; games are faster paced and more balanced than the preceding installment with more diversity in playstyles between decks.As a simulation to the actual game, it's pieced together suprisingly well; advanced mechanics and techniques that weren't built into the previous game are actually possible now.  Decks in the game also have 40 unlockable cards, making great diversity even among similar decks possible as each deck can have multiple strategies present.It still feels a bit like a bad console port, but it seems that bugs found in the game are being handled and fixed at a much better rate than the previous planeswalkers games.

												This digital implementation of the classic epic card game M.T.G. offers quite a few things of what any M.T.G. fan would expect : original M.T.G. artwork and cards, official ruleset and a variety of multiplayer game modes. All work quite well, with a streamlined and bug free interface. The game is accessible even to newcomers, through extensive rule help and tooltips on every aspect of the game mechanics and preconstructed decks. There are interesting singleplayer modes too. Moreover, constant update and DLC support is there to keep interest up for everybody. There's  deck customization available  but it's still as limited as it was in the previous version - sadly. M.T.G. fans will probably like it too much, despite its somewhat elementary setting, but I would recommend it to anyone that is even remotely interested in card games.Verdict : Solid. 8/10			"

												Donât want to spend a lot of money on real MTG? Buy this game and play MTG cheaply, of course in a more limited way. Deck customization is limited and you have to unlock or buy cards for the full decks. For me, what ruins it are the glitchy graphics. Nonetheless I do recommend it anyway for the casual players.The catch nowadays is that you will have a bad time finding online games. My advice is to join the Steam group: Magic: DotP 2013 (for those who still play) - it helped me at least...			"

												If you are into Magic: The Gathering, you'll love this.I have some slight gripes about weird glitches that happen such as computer attacking when it's not their turn, planechase cards getting stuck at full zoom, other random things that happen when they shouldn't. Hopefully these problems will be fixed in updates of some sort.However, it's still an enjoyable experience overall.			"

												The game is balanced, has a wide variety of cards and playstyles. The drtawings are stunning and colourfull. Nevertheless, the bugs and crushes arrive pretty much every other game which is bizarre and unaccaptable for the game that was realised almost 5 years ago. The camera angle is sooo bad, the portatraits block half of the creen and the arid view makes the cards tiny and hardly visible.			"
