Early Access Review
								DO NOT LET THE MIXED REVIEWS SCARE YOU AWAY. READ ON!This game has had quite the history on Steam. Before you buy into all of the negative or positive reviews on this particular game, allow me the opportunity to provide some enlightenment.It is true this game has been an Early Access game for a couple of years now. It is true that it is still incomplete. It is also true that this game has been consistently improved upon week after week, month after month. It is also true that the developers consistently respond to the Community feedback, and incorporate many ideas with the direction and focus of the game.One thing a lot of people do not realize is that this game was one of the FIRST Early Access Games through Steam, and at that time, both the developers and the Steam Community didn't really have a set standard of production of how far a long a game had to be, before it was released into the Community. Folk Tale has paid the price with mixed reviews because the initial launch of the game was virtually unplayable.THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE. This game has two builds, experimental, and public. The Experimental build is the most active, up to date version of this game as it stands now. It is updated almost weekly like clockwork. More content and fixes are added in every single patch. The Public build is a more stabilized version of the game for those who do not mind having a slightly slower updating schedule for a more stable platform. This build is the culmination of all of the successful experimental build patches, usually about 6-8 patches, that get rolled in all at once.Both builds are extremely playable. Almost all of the negative reviews for this game have focused on issues that have been long ago resolved, or people that are sour about buying into an Early Access game, even with the full knowledge beforehand that it was incomplete, hence Early Access.A fair assessment of this game would be that it has about 50% of its total content at the time of this writing. That DOES NOT MEAN it is only 50% playable.The content that is available is well balanced, well executed, and with a mountain of community support behind it. In my 25 years of gaming, I have never seen a more proactive, responsive development team that regularly updates and informs the community about the goings on of the current state of Folk Tale.Should you buy this game? I would. Even with only half of its content available, this game kicks the ever living crap out of almost every other game in this same genre. I would not be surprised, if once all the content has been implemented, this game would be priced in the $60 range.Don't let negative, EARLY ACCESS, reviews color your vision about this game. This will be a must have, and in my opinion, already is if for no other reason than the Community and Developers that stand behind it. Try it for yourself, and find the magic of Folk Tale. Give this game a fair chance, and I promise you personally, you will not be disappointed.EDIT: As of 18 March 2017, FolkTale IMHO is now closer to 85% of its total content. Just a little more patience and positive vibes and this game will finish with stellar results!			"

Early Access Review
								This is difficult for me, as I rarely write negative reviews. I'm the type of person who writes a review when I really enjoy a game; but I do feel like I have enough history/experience with this game to review it and having had so many friends ask me if it was worth a purchase in the recent Winter Sale, it's easier for me to put my thoughts down coherently rather than have to explain individually why the answer is no - even with the 40% discount. This is gonna get long, so I hope you like reading. Otherwise, you probably shouldn't be in the steam review section. Or you can just read the TL:DR. Start scrolling.A Poor StartI bought this game in May 2013. This was back in the beginning days of Early Access, when we had little idea what to expect. I expected regular updates and what was advertised; but I think like many who bought the game back then, I was left sorely disappointed. The initial release was a bare bones poor excuse for a broken demo, with no ability to save, and a few hours of gameplay and little to no communication from the devs for the longest time.Waiting PatientlyI waited patiently, surveying patches as they came. These were incredibly slow to start with, but eventually - as the years, yes years - ticked by, as the game went on sale and I presume, as the developers obtained more funding, the game did shape up into something that's definitely playable. The game has come a long way, but even after 3.5 years of early access, it has a long long long way to go. It begins to beg the question how long is too long? What is unreasonable? On the one hand I appreciate developers not abandoning a game that clearly doesn't have the funding to be completed promptly - on the other, should they have taken my money in the first place without explaining how long a project was being funded? History Aside - What the game is todayBut I don't think it's fair to rate a game positive or negative based on yesterday. I recently reinstalled after 6 months+ of not looking at it, and the rating of this review is based on what the game is today, in Alpha 29, as if I'd just purchased it and holy mega batman balls this game has CHANGED significantly from the beginning. Everything from the core design and artwork and writing - it looks like a completely different game. So I'm swallowing the bitter pill of 3.5 years of waiting and throwing myself into what is ultimately, my favourite genre, a game-starved genre that I will eagerly buy anything in. Psst, don't tell my husband I said that, he says I have too many games. How is 1050 too many, it's not even over 9000!Strategy / BuildingThe surface allows you to real time build your village and set up supply chains. This is what I really love; my favourite genre. It's pretty standard to be honest for this sort of game. You chop wood and turn it into firewood, you catch fish and eat them, you shoot animals and build a butcher. You reap wheat and turn it into bread. The problem is, this is a very standard supply chain feature for a strategy game. It does not have even half the depth of for example, The Settlers series. It's very very simple, and currently, it seems incredibly easy. 30 minutes into a game I had hundreds and hundreds of fish mounting up every tick. My villagers were set forever. Even if you set them at max food for max happiness; the food chain supply is incredibly easy to overstock on.The buildings can be upgraded and that's a neat feature; and you can research plans and upgrades, which does add a little depth to the overhead map. On the whole though, I see no advantage to playing this over The Settlers if you want a supply chain game. Yeah, even the most recent one (7) which wasn't amazing. I feel like people looking for this sort of genre are looking for a lot more challenge and depth to their strategy, and this light-version doesn't scratch my itch for that at all, but does have potential for the future, if the buildings were vastly expanded and balance was approached.ARPG Style Dungeon CrawlerSo you get story and quests in the campaign and you take your player controlled champions to various dungeons to fight and loot. You can equip a wide range of armor and weapons and there is a decent amount of enemies and environments currently implemented. This gives the game a really nice dual-aspect. You can level up and assign some basic stats, very RPG-lite but certainly an unusual feature in a building game. Strategy/management on the surface, and then action and loot in the dungeons. That's a great idea, but only if it's actually implemented well... yeah, you can see the next part coming can't you...The Skill UI is impossible to use effectively. You have a party of heroes with unique abilities. These are pretty cool abilities, each champ is special and brings something new. But you can only select one. You can't pause, and you can't queue up abilities, and you can't switch between heroes effectively. So you basically have one character you can use, and the rest of the party is auto attacks. Why give us so many great abilities and then not give us the ability to switch between them in a meaningful way? The UI is also lacking. If it had a hotkey bar where you could set your skills it would be significantly improved. As it is you have to mouse click around the champion icon.The idea is fantastic; the current implementation is frustrating.There is no PauseThe game needs a pause. It needs it desperately. Even when you are on the build menu, the game does not pause. Your villages are doing things, including getting attacked and dying, whilst you scroll through a menu trying to decide what to upgrade, research or build. We're in management. Just pause it! How can you have real time management with no ability to manage constructively when stuff is happening.Writing & StorylineThe writing is tongue in cheek sarcastic. It attempts to be witty, but honestly, it's tiresome. At first I thought the tutorial was entertaining, but the truth is after the first few instructions about Bob, it became eye-rolling. The entire game is written in a very light hearted fantasy-trope manner. And I guess that's okay, it's a certain style, and certainly some of the writing is very witty and sarcastic. But it also detracts from immersion when it's constant. I  do think this type of writing is better when peppered in with seriousness; such as The Stanley Parable or Portal 2 - games that managed a witty and sarcastic sense of narration and humour but also built character and depth to the story. This is all surface waffle in exactly the same style throughout.It's not a bad story though at it's core, I just think that the style should be used more sparingly and the game should try and take itself a bit more seriously to give the humour more impact. Personal preference, perhaps others will love the goofy writing. Okay, I think that explains why when my friends ask me if they should purchase in the sale; my answer is still no.TL:DR I'm currently pregnant, and to be honest my kid will probably have chance to play this game before it's fully released based on the current timeline. Things progress, but it feels like nothing is really implemented to the maximum of it's potential, and overall this game sits securely in the realm of the mediocre. Great concepts as tested in Alpha 29; but there are too many flaws that make this game frustrating and ultimately, not fun. In short; keep an eye on it, but spend your money on something else right now.Note: I do update early access game reviews. I will come back to this game, although likely not for another 6 months, and we'll see where we are then. In the past I have completely rewritten reviews, and I'll keep an open mind for the future... but developers should be aware that people who have supported this game for 3.5 years may not posess an unlimited amount of patience.

Early Access Review
								I've had this game dusting away in my steam library for two years just waiting for the release announcement after the initial play to see how it looked. First impressions were very positive with good contrasts, interesting visuals for the animations and I've always generally liked this genre. Well after two years I decided to give it another go and quite honestly there have been very little improvements I truly wish there was but there hasn't been. The interface is still just as awkward, the villagers are about as smart as a brick, the camera is slow, the amount of control you have feels very little and lack luster and overall it's just a big let-down on what I had imagined it would of become by now. Now before someone throws the ""It's an Early Access Game"" I will say that I know this, I got it on it's initial release to Early Access and I had high hopes for it but within the two years, there hasn't been much in the way of progress. I'm quite tired of seeing games with this big blue sticker being slapped on them ""Early Access Game"" as if to be a kind of selling point like ""We'll get better soon, promise!"" but for it to never actually happen. In it's current state the game is not worth it and if I knew how slow or none existant the effort to improve and develop this game would be, I wouldn't of bought it at all because it's just a wasted space in my steam library and money from my pocket that could of been spent on things much better. Don't listen to the ""Positive Reviews"" all being spammed because they've all been encouraged to do it and it's really dishonest and terrible marketing on the developers part so please spend your money else where if you actually want a game.:: Edit ::I decided to indulge the comments about me apparently saying things that are untrue and sat down for a full two hour session to see the differences. Things they've added short list: Upgradable buildings but they don't work even when you have necassary resourcesMore buildings that some are simply filler and the rest are extra for ""needs""More worker roles that are all equally slow at their given tasksDiseases are a thing and the villagers are too stupid to use medicine you have stocked I understand they reworked the game but the bare bones of the game from the original early access is still all there. Things the same short list:Your NPC's are still as dense as a brickNo adjustable camera speed just slow and mildly faster by holding shiftYour militia are still generally very ineffective Resources are painfully slow to gatherAmount of control still feels short in contrast to what it should beGameplay feels unengaging and lack luster just waiting on resourcesDay - Night cycle still doesn't seem to change anythingSummary: It feels like a game that had high hopes in a lot of ways yet lives up to very little of them so I still don't recommend it. P.S Everyones entitled to their opinion, don't try force feed your own to others.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought Folk Tale within about the first week that it was available on Steam. I thought it looked like a cool concept, and I had no idea that the trailer was actually the entire scope of the game back then. In the time that this game's been in Early Access, I:* Finished a Master's Degree* Moved to a new city* Moved to another new city* Held three different jobs* Witnessed the birth of four children among my friends' families* Developed a hernia* Had enough time for the hernia to heal without surgery* Bought a new computer* Beat The Witcher 3* Beat The Witcher 3 AGAIN* Read 14 different books (CORRECTION: 15)* Watched approximately 1000 sunsets* Deleted 20 duplicates of some crazy French stalker's comments on this review. Mon Dieu!Pro Tip: Wait for them to finish it, then maybe take another look.Edit:To be clear, before anyone throws the other obvious argument at me... Yes, I have played the game since those early weeks and, yes, it has advanced since then. But progress has been limited, and at this pace Folk Tale is more likely to die a slow death than ever realize the charming vision it had when it first came to Steam.I've already paid for it, so I'll certainly give it another look from time to time to see if anything ever becomes of it, but the whole premise of this review is that this game's a terrible risk compared to most other Early Access titles. What exists right now is still a bit of a mess, and not worth the price, and there's a very good chance that that's all you'll ever get for your money. Anyone who doesn't already have money riding on it should definitely wait.I'm not wishing doom on Games Foundry, and I'll eat my own words if they ever manage to turn this ship around, but... don't put money on that, either.Edit #2:In my continued drive to live at 3.82x the speed of Early Access development, I just finished another book..... ""A Great and Terrible King: Edward I and the Forging of Britain"" by Marc Morris. Lots of fascinating historical anecdotes, and Morris is also an incredible narrator.Edit #3:Three of Folk Tale's most loyal minions went through and downvoted... every single review I've ever written, even ones that no one had ever voted on before. I would like to thank these brave heroes for taking the time to read my previously-unnoticed reviews.			"

Early Access Review
								This is from the developer of the game:""Hi Folks, We're picking up way too many negative reviews, and I don't think we deserve it....If you want Folk Tale to fail, vote with a negative review. If you want Folk Tale to succeed, vote with a positive review.""http://steamcommunity.com/app/224440/discussions/0/135510148090438876/If you want to support a dev that blames their customers for making the game fail and blatantly asks them to rig the review system, then by all means give these guys your money.As for the actual negative reviews, mostly of them have to do with the game being in early access for FOUR years now during which time it's gone from a 0.2 alpha to a 0.5 alpha. At this rate there will be a beta in 2022 followed by the full release in 2030, so clearly all the downvotes about this game taking too long are undeserved.			"

Early Access Review
								I supported this game very early on when it was released into early access almost 3 years ago. 3. The progress is extremely slow and I think at the very least their price point needs to lower. They had to have known just how slow their progress would be and if not they should be more transparent about the issues.If they continue at this rate of progress what will it take? Two or another three years at the most? At that point how outdated will the final product look? I suppose it could be magnificent, but I doubt it. Highly.This game has plenty of potential, for sure, but you can say that about many games in early access. They would be more deserving of your investment than Folk Tale. This game should not have been released into early access with nothing but bare bones, I remember that it was. I didn't mind supporting the development, but time and time again, I come back and barely see anything different from the last time I checked in.I don't think anyone will get their money's worth from this title at this point and fear a Spacebase kind of situation happening here. Do not purchase this game at this point in time.			"

Early Access Review
								Folk Tale has been available since the 30. May 2013, and since the release very little has changed aside from bugfixes and the addition of a savegame feature. In my opinion the game was released on Steam too early.It has a very nice art style and the concept for it looks great - but the available playable content is very, very limited.The plan is for this to be a sandbox experience type of game with stuff like building your own town, crafting, sieges, characters that gain experience and equip items that monsters on the map/in dungeons drop, and much more. Together with the overall graphical/sound quality of the game and the chosen theme, this would make for a great experience.But only a tutorial for one of the races is available for now, and even though the developers are commited to communication and bugfixes, the available content does not warrant the purchase of the game at the time of writing this - 28 November 2013. There is also no set date for the release of new content to the game.You can read blog posts and news about what the developers eventually plan to add to the game here:http://blog.gamesfoundry.com/  "

								EDIT: I see the review trolls are hard at work! Also, please read all the comments here. You will learn a lot.This a rewritten ""review""/response to Simon Dean's latest attempt to scare people into rating his poorly designed game positively. The post is copied from the forums and a perfect example of everything wrong with this game. I'd love to respond to this on the forums but unfortunately I got banned over a year ago for toxic behavior that never happened. So, I will do it here.>> Games Foundry  [developer]	Feb 26 (2017) @ 10:31amI don't think we deserve the negative reviewsHi Folks,We're picking up way too many negative reviews, and I don't think we deserve it. I've long acknowledged that we launched too early, and ever since we've remained dedicated and hard working in moving towards our goal of delivering the best possible game we can make for everyone.Is 57% (the recent review score at the time of posting) truly reflective of what we deserve? If it is, then I've misjudged our approach and radical changes need to be made.So here it is:If you want Folk Tale to fail, vote with a negative review. If you want Folk Tale to succeed, vote with a positive review.That's ultimately the impact that reviews for Early Access games have.I buy lots of Early Access games, and if I don't think they are worth playing more at the time, I let them cook for as long as they need. I don't take a dump on their ongoing efforts that are intended to benefit me by making the game better. That only serves to do financial harm and demotivate them.Last edited by Games Foundry; Feb 26 @ 11:24am <<My response:Your game receives negative reviews because it is poorly designed and it takes you ages to strain out the most insignificant updates which don't improve on the game's fundamental flaws so they don't fix the things that are fundamentally wrong with it. As I've said time and again, ~""the problem is not how long the game has been in development but the poor quality of it after having been in development for so long"". Is progress being made? Yes! Is that progress fun to play? No! You can acknowledge what you did wrong in the past all you want to, it doesn't change the present. You DO deserve the negative reviews because the game is not good and a huge number of it's recent positive reviews would be negative if those reviewers understood the history of this game and it's woeful development progress. Your game is failing because you have no vision. It's failing because you let a handful of people on the forums lead you around by the nose and dictate to you what the game is supposed to be instead of knowing beforehand what you want to do and just fakkin' doing it. This is what got you into this whole mess right from day 1 when you shot yourselves in the foot with the sandbox poll. It could've never been more obvious. Who are these people? What qualifications do Freddy, Pornbruv and that asshat Shadeling have that makes you think their opinion of the game is more valuable than someone else's who says the game sucks and then tells you why? Because they nod their heads and tell you what you want to hear? How has that sort of thing worked out so far?And how dare you once again resort to scaring buyers with threats that the game is going to fail and their money wasted unless they recommend others buy something they really don't think they should? And for what? So that, at someone elses expense, the game they paid for won't fail? Nah, I'd rather it fail. And what about ""Folk Tale is fully funded through completion and beyond""? Which is it, because both can't be true.I have news for you. If you finished the game tomorrow it's still going to be a failure. Why? Because despite what your handful of fans tell you Folk Tale is not a good game. Despite what they tell you it's boring, and shallow, and poorly designed. It looks good but is ultimately disappointing and not worth the money. And this is Games Foundry's fault, not the negative reviewers, because it's Games Foundry that's developing it this way.			"

Early Access Review
								My first review ever.And im sad to say its a negative one.I bought into the game as they first advertised it.I bought it straight of the shelves expecting alot of fun and since i love building and enjoying a good laugh i took this game in.Patiently i waited. i understood they needed time to finish it. retooling it. redoing it. whatever. time is what they got.And for a long time all i got in responses to my when is it going to be finished was a bunch of idiots hagging on me because i was impatient that i wanted it. its been 3 freaking years.Impatient is going nuts after a week or 2. a month or 6 months. a year. hardly.2 years. let alone 3 freaking years.This is a game that had potential but i feel like the devs have no deadline. they keep selling this early access♥♥♥♥♥♥in the hopes it will continue to feed them.Yes they say they are working on it but what the ♥♥♥♥. in theese 3 years ive built about 30 houses and were almost finished making the worlds largest silicone refinery of its scale....No this has to stop and if i can save anyone from spending 25 bucks on this garbage that isnt coming out in the coming 2 or 3 years more then so be it.This game is long overdue and if you are reading this devs youre welcome to excuse yourselfes by making some claims to why its taking this long.But if fact checked you know im right. you have been dragging this whole game along for far to long.

Early Access Review
								I'm not one to write up a review for an early release game as I feel that Steam shouldn't even allow a review till full release but they do anyways for early access games.  So after reading a lot of the outdated reviews I decided this game needed one. First for you impatient people, do not buy an early release game. Some devs prefer quality over quantity and these devs are just that. Yes the process is slower then most of the games I have snagged in early release but it's been worth it.So far the demo in game shows a ton of promise and I can't wait for the RPG elements to get added into this game. But as of right now they've done a really good job with adding sandbox, character editor, and a map editor. I've monkeyed around with all the features and have enjoyed it. Personally I could say yes buy the game now but we all have different preferences and patience levels. So where the game sits at the moment if you enjoy editing and messing around with sandbox games it's worth more of a look into for you. If your steam library is lacking sandbox like games this probably isn't the game for you. I will update this every once the game comes out of early access. You can get more info at the devs blog here http://blog.gamesfoundry.com/ "

Early Access Review
								If you want to see the game, watch the videos. My opinion is that it has a solid foundation now and has already begun implementing many of the big items that many of us have been waiting for. I have read a lot of negative reviews like anybody else looking at a mixed review game and there are many older reviews that really did make sense at the time they were posted, but this is now and that was then.The game?In short...Your the hero looking for treasure chests, killing enemies, and progressing through a story. Your also the one controlling the growth of the town, building walls, and making troops to travel with the hero and guard the town. However, the game is made so you can set up your town and use a summary to see whats needed or if anything is. That leaves you free to focus on your hero at times without your town falling apart. Make sure you have guards though.Few more details...The game looks just like the videos, smooth and tranquil. Your townspeople walk everywhere to do their job. (transport goods, plant trees, hunt animals, eat, etc.) So you will not see somebody working a farm non-stop and you gather food over time. It is easy to get caught up watching your people and forget that you need to clear our enemies from a nest or go look for treasure chests. Do not be fooled though. Enemies are hard and your hero is not an unstoppable force. Nests and such also grow over time if not destroyed. That means larger numbers and can quickly wipe out everything you have worked for. You should also make or find better equipment for your hero, guards, and citizens. Don't want to micro manage? Make the gear, move it to your inventory, put it into the citizens place of employment, and they will equip it if they can. There is a lot more than just your city building and townspeople. (i.e. story line, settements, other heros, etc.) I will let the videos, images, and devs cover the rest.The devs?In short...Watch a recorded live feed to get a feel for them. They will look at and test things simply because a player mentions it. So yes, they work very close to the players. You can see the peer to peer communication in the live feeds all the time. Updates are pushed out as quickly as possible and content is always being adjusted to find the best settings, look, and/or feel.In detail...Do you think the game is how it is now because the devs said it will be this way? If so, you are wrong. Countless things have been adjusted because of player comments and many times they are tested on the spot during a live stream. The devs are normally guys. They do talk to people but they do not talk down to people. Some of the reason things move slower than you may like is because the devs are working so close with the players to revise anything from NPC spawn rates to graphics, but don't be shocked if they say no.

Early Access Review
								When I first purchased Folk Tale a couple years back I thought it showed some great promise with it's concept - a fun city builder with a few RPG elements thrown in. I played it for a couple hours and thought to myself: ""Well I supported the project, I guess I'll just wait and let the developers work."" I have not been disappointed with the progress that has been made coming back to it a couple years later.Building is rather enjoyable and watching your town grow into a bustling city is a rewarding experience. As your city grows you're constantly devising ways to improve people's 'happiness' by offering more rations or creating new jobs to keep the populace content and working away. All of the jobs work and the villagers carry out their tasks with little prodding from the player, allowing you to focus on city planning and defending. The jobs themselves are varied and all play a role in how well your city will run. There are also research trees for each profession to improve productivity or expand the area in which they will work.There is a fair amount of building options to make for some interesting town ideas. Buildings are also upgradeable to improve their capacity as well, allowing the player to go for a more minimalist approach if they so desire. Many of the structures work in tandem with others (A hunting lodge will have villagers collect meat, but in order to feed that meat to your citizens you must also build a butcher, etc). I like the idea of this because it makes the player have to do a small bit of planning in order to maximize efficiency of these professions. The buildings are all unique as well and visually different so smart building placement allows for some beautiful looking towns and cities. You can also place buildings nearly everywhere and rotate them as you see fit, allowing lots of freedom in where you want your town to be located as well as how you want it to look.As for the game itself: The UI is simple and easy to get into. There are tooltips for beginners that explains what each building does, and what other buildings compliment them so that they work properly. You can also assign jobs to individuals without having to click each villager and send them off to the proper buildings, and it's easy to switch a villager from one profession to the next. There is also some layer of complexity with the research and upgrading systems, to allow players some freedom in which areas of production they wish to improve. Everything works great and I have experienced very few bugs outside of a single crash on the tutorial, which worked later when I tried again. The game runs great and is very stable for an alpha build, and it's optimized well and has no frame rate issues.The heroes portion of the game breaks the mould a bit as you can use them to go adventuring. You can also train some soldiers to aid your heroes along in whichever endeavours you want them to have, adding a sort of real time strategy feel to the game. The heroes also have unique abilities and can even be fully equipped from head to toe with various armors and weapons (As can every villager or soldier in the game), allowing the player to make them as strong or weak as you want.All in all Folk Tale is a lot of fun, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the future of the game.

Early Access Review
								(TL:DR at the bottom)PrefaceWhen I normally see a new game that interests me, the first thing I do is check out the reviews.  With a title labeled as “mixed” the first place I usually jump over to is the negative reviews and see what people are saying.  This game, with its “mixed” rating, was no different.  I saw claims that the development team wasn’t active, they were bullying people on the forums, and the game had almost no content to it.  Something to be avoided, right?  But I noticed something else.  On many of the negative reviews the developers had replied and tried to help resolve the reviewer’s problems.  That doesn’t seem like bullying to me, and certainly doesn’t seem like they aren’t active.  So I went and checked the positive reviews.  The top one was written by a fellow named “Eddie=VX9=” and pretty much his first statement was that you shouldn’t judge this game based on the negative reviews.  I continued to read his review and was fairly impressed by its content.  This led me to risk purchasing the game.  Do I regret that decision?  Obviously not.ReviewWhen I first jumped into Folk Tale I have to admit, it wasn’t a positive experience.  But it was my fault.  I’m a regular player of RTS games and figured this was just like any other so I selected to start a new campaign.  Big mistake.  The story began and I immediately realized I hadn’t a clue how to play.  Sure, I was able to grab some units and defend the village.  I was able to get a few people foraging for berries and wood.  But I didn’t understand how the buildings worked.  I had tons of meat but my villagers were leaving the village because, I later found, there was nobody turning that meat into something actually edible.  I didn’t have a butcher!  So my first shot at the campaign ended in under 20 minutes with my villagers abandoning me.  Yay team!I then went back to the main menu, clicked new game, and sheepishly clicked Tutorial.  Within another 20 minutes I had learned everything I needed to learn to give the campaign another go.  It turned out to be a fairly easy task to assign (or remove) villagers to buildings, although a little different than other RTS games.  Once I had the basics figured out, the campaign called me once more.  This time I had everything under control and really started to enjoy the game.  I found that this wasn't only an RTS experience, it has a bit of RPG dungeon crawling to it as well.  Quite a nice experience overall.Admittedly I haven’t tried the sandbox mode yet.  I assume it's basic village building with random attacks.  I can imagine that would be an enjoyable experience.  There's also the in-game map/misison creator which gives you pretty much endless replayability in this title, and I'm heavily looking forward to messing around with it.  I did notice there wasn't any multiplayer, and I wish there was, but there is so much else available that it really isn't a big loss.Now, let’s get down to the nitty gritty.Graphically, I absolutely love this game.  I really don’t know what to compare it to because I haven’t seen any RTS games with this style of graphics.  It’s almost Disney-like, if that’s a word, with overtones from the Settlers series.  You can look at the screenshots and game play videos for yourself.  I would have liked to see better animations on buildings being constructed, like maybe showing them in different phases of construction instead of the completed building simply rising through the ground.  That’s not a major complaint though.Audio in the game was fairly well done, and I love the music, but I have some reservations when it comes to voiceovers.  Much of the campaign dialogue has voiceovers but you’ll have some instances where it almost seemed like a voiceover was missing.  A quick example would be the start of the campaign where the villain was talking to his henchmen and, while his voiceover was awesome, the henchmen had nothing but a text box.  It almost seemed like the henchmen’s voiceover was missing, which it could be considering this is still an early access game.  A game should either have full voiceovers, or none at all.  I’d like to see that corrected before final release.Game play itself is rather well thought out in Folk Tale.  A lot of the villager control is handled by an AI, which can surprisingly be turned off (per unit) if you want.  You simply assign the villager to a building (promote) and they go about the job without any further action on your part.  When you remove a villager from that task (demote) they return to a simple villager and do the “grunt work” around the village.  These villagers are your builders and resource carriers, but can also be assigned to other tasks like berry foraging and tree chopping without being assigned to a building (job).  You also have control of the distribution of materials as well as collection of taxes.  These help you fine tune the happiness of your villagers and can also help get you through tough times without your village becoming a ghost town.  The effect is limited, in that if you have no food increasing the amount of food a villager receives obviously won't have any effect.  You also have the RPG aspect, which means not only do your main (hero) units level up and get stat points, but you can also equip all of your units (including villagers).  Equipment is mostly found by either defeating enemies or forraging through the various dungeons (like the bandit cave).TL:DR & ConclusionAll in all I have to agree with the excellent review that “Eddie=VX9=” did.  This game may have had problems in the past but it’s well on its way to becoming a game that any RTS fan would love to have.  The RPG aspects mixed in with the RTS makes it a wonderful experience.  I'll admit this game may not be for everyone, but it's a game I'm glad to have in my collection.Note To The DevsYou're doing a great job, the whole team, and I don't want you to get discouraged by some of the negative reviews this game is getting.  Honestly, most of the negative reviews are either way outdated or absolute nonsense.  I can see the road you've laid down and I, as well as others, are very excited to see the work continue.  Keep it up!  This game has a ridiculous amount of potential in both the game itself and the community it can build around it.  It deserves to be finished, even if it's just to prove the nay-sayers wrong.  Once it's done you might even consider raising the price a little, because it'll be worth it.  Keep your chins up and speak proudly about this game when you do.  Here's to the future!  :beermug:			"

Early Access Review
								There are some pros and cons...Lets start with the CONS:- One of the biggest (but seems like a small issue) I really need a pause button in battle. Phew, im getting to old for this biiip. The chars have some different abilities, and you need to use them, in order to make a good battle / survive. So the pace is to great, to use all your chars abilities with a satisfactory outcome. Results in death/penalty and most important -> I have no time to enjoy the battle...- Constant attacks on my settlement from critters... Lets have some privacy pls :) It just gets to me, that while im in ""sim/building mode"" - and I cant have time to really get into depth with my settlement. When I want action, I can easly take a squard / heroes and venture out in the wilderness or go questing.-  To far into the game, you can afford defense - and its annoyin when the rate of attacks are so high.EDIT: They added this in pervious patch (didnt notice):Player: Made villagers a little less squishy by doubling their healthPlayer: Non military villagers now flee when they or a nearby unit is attacked and they have less than 50% healthWhich means, less villager loss...Pros:- The mixture of building, questing, exploring: I like it...- So far, a very good story, that lets me choose sides: I like it...Conslusion....Potentially a very good game, I would use hours and hours in... But for ME - its gets to ""stressful"" with all the battles and attacks, that havnt got the right ""tool"" to make them very successful. (pauseing a battle). Lets build cheap defense in the beginning, so we can focus more on the building/manufactoring.The devs, have a good concept with the mixture, im just affraid that they ruin the building ""time"" with all the attacks.

								This♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game...I originally bought it a week after release on Early Access. It actually was a better game back then, compared to now.The Devs are children. They have no set goals for the games, and let any swinging dik sway the games course. Which by the way, went from a story driven game, to now, nothing more then a sandbox story builder. They completely removed the story. They also removed the tutorial. Updates are rare, and add almost nothing. Oh, sweet, you want to fix two or three bugs? Awesome, if you updated more consistently and actually provided content instead of you know, taking content away.Interface sucks. I'm not even kidding. It sucks.You feel like you have no real control. Its more of a point in the general direction and hope it gets done.I'm sure you have read positive reviews that try and sway you to buying the game, but lets be completely honest here. This game had alot of potential, and originally, had my focus to buy it because of the story driven village mayor type feel it claimed to have. Now, the game is worse then it was when they first released it. They never update the damn thing, and when they do they dont fix sh it. So if you wanna waste $25, or in the case of the sale, $14 on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ product created by crappy developers. Be my guest. If I could get a refund, id demand it in a heart beat. "

Early Access Review
								While I do appreciate the consistant flow of updates from the development team on this project, I'm still very disappointed.  As someone who isn't at all interested in 'sandbox' style game play, hearing that it has changed its course from the original intention of campaign play and humorous cutscenes makes me feel that I was promised something, but then it was taken away from me after I paid for it.  My money was meant to help aid in the creation of a game that interested me.  When playing through the tutorial, it was that style of gameplay (specifically that it had an engaging story and memorable character development) that set Folk Tale apart from the rest of the generic mess of simulation games in this community.There is something to be said for a team that takes their vision a step further by adding fun content and dialogue.  It takes more time, but the rewards are much more satisfying and create an impact with its players.  The same old mediocre Minecraft mentality of 'Here's an open area.  Build something' is as common as the air we breathe.  Developers don't actually have to put any creative effort into it as its expected of the player to create their own source of entertainment from what's given to them.  At first, Games Foundry didn't seem to share this mentality.  This had style, appeal, and put a smile on my face when I played it; leaving me following its progress nearly every step of the way.  Until recently.Now the initial build has been scrapped and my generosity is funding a 'redesigned concept' based on a communal vote that I did not agree with.  I do understand that the development team takes the consideration of the community very seriously, but it's painful to see the initial concept tossed to the wayside when there are so many other sandboxes out there to play already.  Trying to give it another chance, I redownloaded it to see what new updates had brought us over the course of a year's time.  Seeing the sandbox mode in action only further confirms my reason to be disappointed.  I could feel my heart literally sink to the bottom of my chest at what was on my screen; a hollow, depressing, deconstructed shell of its former self.  It is unlikely I will be installing it again; regardless of full release.Folk Tale was moving down the path of something refreshing and unique to its genre, but chose to sacrificially overhaul creative integrity and design in lieu of a popularity vote.It's sad; incredibly unfortunate because I was looking forward to this game immensely and will no longer be supporting any Early Access titles on steam from this point forward.  The idea of purchasing an apple with expectation I will receive my promised apple, then paying for it and being forced to receive an orange doesn't sit well with me as a consumer.  It builds very distrustful raport.  I do not want another development team to do what Games Foundary has done.  If a refund were possible, I would respectfully ask for one.  Much to my chagrin, I'm sure my investment was used in the very destruction of what I was looking forward to in the first place-- days and days of wonderfully rendered graphics, stories of adventure, silly voices, and village building.  Now it's nothing more than a graphical editor with bland, blank slate maps.It was beautiful and engaging the way it was. Now I scroll through it in my Game Library, sigh regretfully, and continue on.-----------------------------------------------TLDR;Potential to have been a truly inspiring indie title to pave a new path into this genre, but fell drastically short by letting the controversial steam community decide what the game 'should be' after it was already in development.  Thus, the team overhauled it into a sandbox-focused project instead of campaign with interactive story content.If you're into blank slate gameplay with some customization quirks, do support them as the quality of gameplay will be worth its pay for you.  I won't deny that they work hard on Folk Tale; regardless of opinion.  However, if you're supporting it in hopes for something more, be advised to take your money elsewhere.			"

								Folk Tale looks fantastic, animates well and sounds greats. But while it attempts to marry many games we love, it doesnt play well because each of game mechanics doesnt feel consequential - It just feels like a beautiful empty porcelain vase...(As a village building sim)For example, the building a village part of it does not really have any cause/effect and consequence. Do you need wood? Just cut from the abundant forrest. Need stone? There's a quarry right there. Need fish? No need to travel, the river is also right beside you. Need more people in your village? You dont have to wait ala Banished and plan ahead... Just plonk a cottage and you will have almost instantaneous  population increase. If a villager dies, a new one will come in less than a minute. Need materials to build new structures? As long as the material numbers are there, you can get anything done instantaneously. No merticulous building like in the original Tropico or Banished, where you can see each citizen chuggin along with materials in hand. What happens in the day and night cycle? Nothing! Its just a cosmetic effect. Does it matter if your buildings are far apart? Not really. There isnt a need to fine tune village efficiency because everyone is way too effcient to get to any meaningful bottleneck. This part of the game feels like a Facebook game, just with better graphics.(RPG Play)So you have this avatar where you click to whack a enemy. You hit once, and he hits back and it cycles on at perfect interval. There's no weight to the combat and no real strategy to talk about. Whoever has more might and number will win every time. Its 2016 and such banal combat is really for age 5 and under. The regeneration of health point and magic is so fast that you dont need to worry about what is down the road and just bulldoze your way through... (Village Building + RPG)Wouldnt it be great if you really build a village up like Banished, worrying about how to get enough food for next winter or your villagers will die, then painstakingly build an armory to equip your hero with the last iron resource so that he can open up a hostile piece of land which in turn allows your villagers to build a mining facility there...? This is simple causality, which unfortunately Folk Tales does not seem to be strong in. Instead, Folk Tales' two core mechanic doesnt really influence each other and is so devoid of a relationship that they are simply two games sharing a common space. Unfortunately neither one feels really well thought out...			"

Early Access Review
								I went looking for an Age of Empires online replacement about 12 months ago. I tried to play the older AoE series but was left wanting. Even with HD, AoE 2 was still fun but extremely dated. I then tried Banished, fun but grindy and boring once you figured it out, and no military system.I've been searching steam and saw many possible replacements. Many games that were great looking in their own right, but not exactly what I was looking for; then I found Folk Tale. About 6 months ago I was on this very page and allowed myself to be turned away by the negative reviews. 2 weeks ago I gave it a deeper look. Most recent negative reviews were from people who put in hardly any time to give an objective review.That being said, this game is EARLY ACCESS. It is not complete (They estimate completion next year) and does have bugs. There are missing economic systems, features, items, campaign elements, etc...1. The game is extremely playable in its current form. You can play through and enjoy it.2. The bugs that I have encountered some of which were annoying, did not prevent the overall game from being enjoyed.3. The economic system is unbalanced, but is clearly being improved/updated/added to. It can easily be worked with/around once you understand it.4. The graphics and style is gorgeous.5. It is clear that the team is very active with the community, responding to posts of all types. Watching the most recent dev blog, they have already found a clever solution to a problematic economic feature (Which was end game limiting) they had added (Which people were complaining about) and were testing it.6. Games Foundry releases almost monthly updates with substantial fixes and improvements. If you do the research, you will see that they have a very detailed and full roadmap.7. The community driven approach is refreshing, allowing you to affect the final product, People complain about the initial large scale changes to the game (As community requested). But it's clear that now that they have implemented the changes, they are moving forwards and still adding in the features they had originally intended.If you enjoy these types of games and give this one a solid chance, I think you will find that there is a very high ceiling/a ton of potential for this game. I wish they could distribute the tutorial level for free as I think it would allow many people who are on the fence to try for themselves and not rely solely on anonymous reviews.			"

								Bought this game thought it was ok but that was when it first came out heaps of bugs, no content, followed it for a few months and everyone was bagging it saying it was going nowhere yada yada. I'm like its early access you morons what do you expect.Anyway since then I've bought a house got a partner and had a kid... I'm thinking maybe now, just maybe, they might have been right.My kid is one and I'm hoping I can pass this early access game down to her when she turns 21 so she too can pass it down to her kid and so on until one of my ancestors can play the finished game, given the way its gone I imagine by then it will probably be like a sci fi alien dating sim or something given how much its chopped and changed on the way.So basically if you are thinking of buying it, don't, instead write the name of the game on a little peice of paper and drop that peice of paper into a glass tube filled with an ipad, a ♥♥♥♥ing gameboy, a bunch of other♥♥♥♥♥♥from 2017 and bury it, whoever digs it up in a 1000 years will then be able to play the most amazing game of all time... pokemon!! On an actual gameboy!! Oh and a chance to buy a freshly finished Folk Tale: Babes if the Orion Belt, the best alien dating sim ever made.			"

								I purchased this early access game at its start which is running close 2 year now and the game no matter what you hear this game has a long way off to its final completion.  The Forum is closely monitored by the game developers to suppress negavitve feed back and even deleted complaints about its bugs and problems. We have a saying in the USA ""buyer beware"". So if you are thinking about early access to this one you have been warned.Posted: Jan 18 @ 10:59am Edit: My View Has been Flagged by this Developer as ""abusive"" and I have Reported there harrasement of my view and constant emailing my account to Steam. It Aslo was the 2nd Most ""Helpful Review"".  Keep looking on the forum and the constant bans to anyone posting anything they call negative...2013 when this game was started..asking $20 and now they have the nerve to ask for $24.99..Be warned wait for the final release to this game..which might be outdated at its completion.

								For its timeline I would say that the amount of content is a little on the slow side. That is really the only gripe for me. I am thoroughly pleased with how it works as a community with your townsfolk. There are aspects of the game I am still learning too. I have yet to explore it in full detail and settings. For the artwork and sounds, I give it a B+. Music is good too, but can get repeatitive, but all these kinds of game do that. I agree with price point being an issue. This type of game and pretty much anything on my wishlist, gets puchased when on a sale of some sort. Bottom line, worth the buy and to be played. You will miss out if you don't pick it up, but I would look for that sale price to bring it to $15 or lower based on current content.			"

								Folk Tale looks beautiful, it has charm, it has soul, music is fantastic, it's pretty complex considering you can research ton of things. It's similar to Age of Empires but with better graphics, more charm and better music and much more complexity and depth. What's there not to like?Not to mention one huge thing I realized while playing this. There was NO game in my life that I played in this genre in which I actually CARED about my peasants. I know them, I feel for them, I don't won't them getting hurt. They progress through the game, they have their inventories so I can gear every peasant individually, they have experience levels, it's like massive city builder RPG. Fun, addictive, charming and innovative and I just scratched the surface! Highly recommended! Graphics:  ★★★★★ Sound:  ★★★★☆ Gameplay:  ★★★★☆ Potential: (EA) ★★★★★   Overall:  ★★★★☆ "

Early Access Review
								The game looks really pretty but it's just not fun. I've been playing through the campaign and the whole mechanic of strategy / rpg is just really awkward. 70% of time you feel like 'Why did I just spent half an hour building the village, if I am just questing at the moment?' Having the village makes almost no difference to the rpg part, because you cannot take your soldiers with you to dungeons. The story then turns and your village gets attacked. Village defending was very difficult, again because the game doesn't have good mechanics. It's really hard to see where your villagers and soldiers currently are or where you are being attacked. So the enemies were destroying my buildings while I was looking for soldiers on the map and trying to tell the silly villagers to just get out of the way! I know, there are selection groups where you can set a number to select your soldiers, but the groups seem to get reset every time I exit dungeon. Plus one barracks can only train 4 soldiers and they get killed pretty much straight away. Overall, the game is more frustrating than fun. I keep questioning the game design choices almost every step of the way through the campaign. It seems like the devs had an interesting idea at the beginning, but they failed to put it together into a solid game experience.			"

								This game has been in Alpha longer than I can remember. The devs can't seem to make up their mind on the direction they want the game to go, it started as a linier city builder, went in the direction of an open sandbox builder and seems to slowly be progressing into a dungeon crawler with heroes. Honestly, I had fun playing the game but if you're trying to choose between this game or another  and are on a budget, I'd suggest staying away. I'll have kids and send them to college before this game ever even goes from Alpha to Beta.Can't recommend unless you have a ton of money to burn on games, then sure go for it. "

								Early Access Review (12/01/2015).I wouldn't usually do any sort of review for a game but, due to the many negative reviews this game has received in it's earliest days, I've decided to write this brief early access review to help balance the books.Do not be put off by the earlier reviews as there is a real gem in development here. It has all the standard Strategy, City Builder, Civ and management type elements in the game with the added RPG factor where your villagers can level up and wear found loot items etc. The RPG side of the game is currently being developed alongside the more conventional elements of the genre and I am quite excited at the prospect of the final product.It has a well developed economy and mechanics system that is still being developed and enhanced. The visuals are very pleasing and conducive to an immersive and relaxing gaming experience. Especially useful when you've had enough of shooting zombies in the face. There is a real cuteness about the game and the characters, the animations and the art style are all very well done.The game is still early access so it's still a little limited in terms of how many hours you will get out of it in it's current state. This will change quite soon judging by the developers roadmap. Once upgradable buildings etc are implemented (which is soon) the play time will be increased further. That said once you've played whats already there you will like me, no doubt be very excited about what is coming. There is a development roadmap and the planned features will make this a well rounded and very polished game. Probably the best in the genre(s). On to the developers themselves. They are very active devs with regular roadmap live streams showing what is being worked on at any given time. They are very active in the community section inside steam and listen to and act on feedback received from it's early access players. They have stated that they have the required funding to finish the game and have a 9 man team in place to do so. This is not some fly by night early access project. These guys are passionate about their game and that shows itself in the game.If you like this style or genre(s) of game then I would recommed keeping a very close eye on this one. It's a game I expect to be playing for a long time to come and is a real credit to the devs.I will update this review as the game evolves and go into greater detail as the game changes. If you are unsure whether or not this is worth a purchase, at least add it to your wishlist to follow the games progress. I believe that any gamer who likes this genre, will see this product for the quality it is and consider it a worthwhile purchase.			"

Early Access Review
								I've dreamed of a cross-genre game like this for so long, something that blends a citybuilder with an RPG character building experience, and Folk Tale is certainly starting to deliver on that. I've played and loved the citybuilder genre forever (such as the Caesar series, the Settlers series, the Warcraft series, and many others, including more recently Banished to name a few), but always wanted for more depth and customisation. I've played and loved thousands of RPGs in my life too, (from Pool of Radiance and Neverwinter Nights, to Icewind Dale and Skyrim, right through to Divinity: Original Sin and Pillars of Eternity), but I always desired some home base and village building elements. Well peeps - we're almost there! Our dream is being realised. This is a MASSIVE undertaking that Games Foundry has embarked on, and they should be proud of their work. I'm enjoying this game immensely, and recommend it to anyone who is willing to support a small team of devs making a big game with even bigger expectations on it. If you don't understand the concept of Early Access and expect a well polished, perfectly balanced, and full game at this point, put it on your wishlist. However, I for one believe in the concept, I believe in the direction, and I believe in the potential, and happily supported the Devs with my hard earned cash to continue the process. Under the above proviso, I hope you do the same.Now onto specifics:FUN FACTOR: Heaps of fun with a cute sense of humour! The village building maps are enjoyable; there's a real sense of accomplishment in building up your village to a city size. There are monsters spread throughout the map to vanquish and loot, and who occasionally attack you to keep things interesting. And there's a wide range of buildings, upgrades and items to analyse and discover their interconnectedness. The dungeon crawling map is a fun addition; running around with your hero slicing and dicing mobs while collecting treasure. Overall, there is currently limited content (4 to 5 maps), but there is a in-built level editor for you creative types, and it's great fun for shorter gaming periods. GRAPHICS: Really good! Nice looking and easy on the eyes, fantastic art style and cute detailing in buildings, protagonists and mobs. SOUND: So good!!! The music and ambient sounds are pleasant and never off-putting, but the voice acting! It's top notch so far; the advisor is both posh and somewhat imperious, but his voice is lovely, the hero is extremely heroic and (Old washed-up) knight-like, but hilarious. His battle cries make me grin constantly.GAMEPLAY: Ok. The interface is a bit clunky, and there's some important missing stuff there (such as a villagers list, but that's in the works according to the Devs), for example it's difficult to both find individuals, and to equip them. But the basics are there, and improvements are being added regularly. However, the camera controls are (currently) quite bad. The camera movement is slow, and the changing of camera angles just annoying. Still, these are forgivable whilst in EA.REPLAYABILITY: Yes and no! This goes back to the first point, there is limited content, but updates are monthly. So I will come back once a month and play the same maps for a few hours again and again to check out the new stuff. I will do this until it's released. Once it's released as a full game I believe I will come back to it regularly, because there are campaigns planned, there are factions included, plus there will be custom content using the level editor.In closing, I would first briefly like to touch on the most commonly maintained negatives in the abundance of unhappy reviews, in order to explain them more clearly, and to debunk those that don't really apply anymore. I don't do this for any reason other than the fact that I really love this game, and I don't personally feel that the current rating is reflective of Folk Tale's current state, nor its future potential. (Please keep in mind that the views and opinions expressed herein are those of the author only, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of any other individual or agency) ""There's no story mode / save function / tutorial..."" Not true, as all have now been implemented.""There's no updates..."" Blatantly untrue! Updates have been one a month since June 2014.“It's unplayable...” Ridiculous! I have no problems playing it, and there's plenty of 'Let's Plays” online “No Dev involvement...” Preposterous!!! The Devs are invested, approachable, and transparent, consistently replying to players reviews or requests. “Game changed direction after I bought it...” This is partially true, but it changed focus (after a public survey), NOT direction. The citybuilding aspects were focussed on at the outset to get the economy and village system basics working. Now the Devs are focussing again on the RPG portions.“The Devs asked for supporters to give positive reviews to improve the rating...” SO WHAT?! If you entered your baby into a baby pageant, would you not ask your friends to give positive comments, votes and support? As I said before, the Devs are INVESTED DEEPLY in their cross-genre experience. Wishing for positive reviews and asking reviewers to reassess after so much has changed is hardly doing any harm. Wouldn't you do the same for something you believed in?     TL;DR: In conclusion, I really like this game, it has amazing potential, and I love the direction it is headed in even more. It has good graphics, great sound, and is a fun and rewarding experience. If you want to see a seamless blend of citybuilding strategy and customisable character based RPG, then this is going to be it. But be warned; if you don't understand what early access is, if you don't realise it's sometimes a gamble, if you expect a fully completed, polished and perfectly balanced game right now, then hold off – it's a work in progress and currently somewhat limited in scope. But  for me, it's starting to look like the citybuilding RPG cross-genre game I've always dreamed of.			"

								Do not buy this game. It is, as is stated, still under development. While it has the oppertunity to be a great game it is unfortunatly not, there is too much left undone. I do know that it takes a while to create a game, but this is taking far too long. I bought the game fairly early in development and saw it add a load and save feature as well as some bug fixes, but thats it, nothing more. Save your cash on this and don't buy Folk Tale.			"

Early Access Review
								Suprising lack of content....I bought into this game because of all the newer reviews saying that the game has been really coming along.  I've had my eye on the game for some time, and finally took the plunge, and WOW was I suprised - for two reasons.The game is even BETTER than I had imagined.  It is such a great blend of RPG and City Builder.... but goodness is there a lack of content and so many features missing.  Seemingly simple things like research options that are in the game, but not functioning.For example, you can uprade your fishing huts to provide +1 fish per catch with 2 of the first tier of research options.  But then at the second tier, the +1 fish research option is there, but says (not implemented).  Why? How? lol, if the first tier is implemented, it's not like it's a new mechanic to have the code in there for +1 to each catch.  There are a ton of features like this that are not there ""just because.""  None of the magical items tell you what they do, so that whole really cool feature is actually not there, which seems so easy to implement.  Those are just a couple examples of features that are there, but not functioning (and actually say right in the game ""not functioning"" or ""not implemented"" or ""broken""). In all honesty, this is one of the most promising games I've ever played. but for such a suprisingly great game, what happened here guys?  I put no to recommending this game, not because it's not a good game, it's amazing, but it's worthless to buy, because for $30, you can get maybe 10 hours out of it before you're completely bored. And there is better value out there, especially with the sales.			"

								I've been following this game for a long time. I agree with some reviewers that it is much too early in development for how long the game has been available, however, that is not a reason to rate the game such a low score. That has nothing to do with how the game performs or how well you like it if you actually play it. At least half of all scores I've seen was some variation of, ""This game still isn't finished, 1/5"". I went ahead and bought this due to some good reviews from people who actually played the game, and I agree that it is a fun makeup. I like the idea of a sandbox-type game like Banished with an RPG element to change things up. Currently as of 8/7/15 there is only a few RPG elements implemented (such as the hero), but more are supposed to be implemented very soon. The game has a clear road map to finish, and it looks very attainable. The graphics and sound are good so far, and the gameplay on harder settings have a sense of urgency to get things running ASAP before you get attacked by spiders/goblins/other beasties. I look forward to when this game is actually finished, as it should be as good as I originally thought a few years ago. This game is going in a good direction, IMO.			"

Early Access Review
								Is Folk Tale worth the price? No, not yet.      The gameplay has the basic RTS feel to it but it was bland and basic 3 years ago. Today it still feels bland and basic. It feels like a mix of Stronghold Crusader, and sunday cartoon. Which is unique I will give it that. Progress has been made sence when I first played it several years ago. It has improved and implemented progressivly better and better features for combat, building, planning, research. But it stilll falls short as far as any meaty content that you can sink your teeth into. A few one liners are good for a first chuckle, but after repetivly hearing them it wears thin. I enjoyed the early story a few years ago that got me hooked to Folk Talke to begin with. It was a slapstic tale with great charater personalities. Today it seamed to have droped the main plot for a base building RTS like Stronghold Crusader. Which is great I loved that game. Yet Folk Tale needs to push past its current development block and decide what kind of RTS it wants to become. Playing single player world with no greater plot, conflict, or tale is just faffing about.			"

								I would definitely suggest this game. The developers are polite, kind, and really seem to listen to feeback. They update us as to what is going on every month, and they even redid a massive overhaul of their game almost immediately after hitting early access because they released a poll for the people who bought the game and found out we mostly wanted a sandbox type game. Everytime I visit the forums I see the devs responding to most threads, and they are incrediably professional, even when the posters get a bit aggressive. These are definitely the kind of devs I like to support, and this is definitely a game I cant wait to se in it's finished state!			"

Early Access Review
								FOR THE LOVE OF TOAST!   This game is like Warcraft and Simcity made a baby, if you like building a city and making sure its safe for your towns people, this is the game for you!Pros :  With this game you have the choice (as it stands now) to either play the Campaign or play in a Sandbox enviroment.  The Campaign allows you to learn the game in nice easy pace. You learn how to control a Hero and some City Watch.  But in the start thats not going to be enough to beat the level.  You will have to create a couple more City Watch.  But thats not it, you have to not only keep your town safe, but make sure your townies have food and are warm.  Because if you only produce a war like village your people will start to starve and leave.  I can't tell you how many times I have made the mistake of rushing to build a barracks and some City Watch but even before I could gather the wood, stones, and Iron my people were Starving and leaving and then there I was with a sorta nice looking town but no one but the birds to keep me company, haha.  One thing that I love of this game is the different professions that you have access to (22) you first can have a townie start his life in your town as a farmer then change him to be a miner then a monk and then to a City Watch or anything else.  And as your Townie does his job he gains xp which he uses to be a better person.  As it stands now they have Two different Factions (1) the Gladefolk and (2) the Whithering Dead.  The Gladefolk are like tree people, meaning they are all about peace, love, and mother earth.  The Hero for them is called Willow the Healer, who thus in the name is a healer, she can also revive those around her that had died in one of your awesome battles.  The Whithering Dead on the other hand are there complete opposites!  They are pretty much Necromancers, their Hero is named Lilith the Necromancer, she can raise the dead put some hex's on people and other Necromancer stuff. There is another Hero named Ser Gregory who (as the game guide states) is neutral but in one of the campaigns you get him as your starting Hero He is pretty much the tank of the three main Heros.  There are some other heros that you can find around the grid as well.  The Loot!  OH MAN THE AMOUNTS OF LOOT, every thing you kill, find, harvest, or dig out of the ground has some sort of use in the game.  For example for you to make mead (Beer) for your townies so they have a better life, you first need to get honey, to get honey you need to build a Bee Yard, to harvest a Bee Yard you need to build a Monastery and then you need to train some Monks.  Sure its a lot of work just to create mead but so worth it.There is a world editor, so if you are not feeling the grids that were put together you can create your own landscape! Cons: Now mind you this game is still in early access so some of these cons are because they have not been programmed yet, Buuuut I still feel the need to put in what I have noticed.There is a lot of weapons that can only be used by one person/Hero, Also when you go into a cave or something like that there is a lot of loot in the caves that you pick up but does not trasf to the main grid (Now I know that this is a bug or somthing so take it with a grain of salt)  There is no way to build any type of a pathway or road, like you can build a beautiful town but it will not look more like a quickly built settlement, if they were to allow you to build a road be a dirt to start then a stone road after.  The benifits of having your people walk on a road could allow your townies to walk faster or be more productive or something.The bad guys do not respond, now they may put that in later but as of right now if you kill everything in the grid you will have nothing to fear and then it gets kinda boring.  So hopefully they will make the change if not then i guess you can just up the difficulty!Now that you know my take on the game you should be filled with the wonder that is this game if i were able to rate the game I would give it (in its state of early access) a 4.2 out of 5  Because although it is a great game if they were to say its complete now, would tarnish Games Foundry's Rep as a Gaming company!Buy this Game! You will not regret it!			"

								Its been a  while since I updated this so I'll update it again :-).The game has come a long way since it first appeared in early access.The devs continue to be very atcive on the forums and are very transparent with updates.  The game its self is a fantasy RPG/Strategy mix , with and in game editor & campaign mode, so there's plenty to have a go at. here are my pros & cons :-)Pros:-          1) Devs contrinue to be active and frequently publish live streams anlong with regular                 game updates          2)Single player Campaign is fun and graphics & art style are slick          3)Sand box mode to launch player made maps from workshop          4)Editor to create maps along with RPG elements to create missions.Cons:-          1)Game was released way to early and is still in early acess          2)No current ETA on release          3)As it is early access there is still bugs and issue to fixOverall I still dont regret buying this game I have enjoyed  following the game & all the updates and I still feal its worth its current price with the game in its current state. All credit to  the Devs they just need to contrinue to push to the finish line :-)			"

								I really wanted to like this game. I really did. It has some severe balancing issues, such as one spider walking through and destroying all of your villagers and heros. The main problem is that the story line pushes you to progress, but doesnt give you enough time to level your heros. Your villagers are mere cannon fodder, good for taking about one hit then dieing. It is also hard to tell where your troops are, less you select all your villagers and send them into combat.Won't recommend in current state.			"

								Absolutely recommended. Although still in the development stage, this game is amazing for RPG enthusiasts who'd like the added bonus of manipulating their own world and stories. The developers have been actively creating and improving multiple facets of the game since inception, regularly keeping backers involved in the process, and acting on requests and recommendations from us.As each patch is released, it is abundantly apparent that Folk Tale will be an amazing game, well worth the wait and worth every penny invested by us. I'm VERY excited to see the finished product, yet I'm in no hurry to do so lest a premature final product takes away from the remarkable content being added every time a patch is released.To the devs, my heartfelt thanks and congratulations on the quality of this game so far! I anxiously await the next integrations and surprised that undoubtedly wiill continue to amaze us.~ Roxy			"

								Yes it is in an very early stage. But so far it looks very promising and could become exactly the right mixture between village builder, rpg, and light strategy game!Edit: It has been a long time since my inicial review and the game went trough some changes (especially the move away from the original campaign and towards sandbox). Apart from what some other negative reviwers say, I think the move towards sandbox was a good one.That being said, the sandbox mode finally starts to turn into a game! There are still some things missing, especially the UI still needs some work. Also some features are not fully implemented yet, but you get a good impression of what's coming. And I really like what seems to be coming.For the first time since the old tutorial/campaign, sandbox mode feels like a game and I am having fun upgrading my villagers with better equipment and exploring the wilds! My positive review still holds, now more than ever!			"

								I really dislike games in Early Access.  You can thank GODUS for that. For some reason I saw Folk Tale and started reading what the devs seemed engaged and responsive.  I'm glad I bot the game.  The updates have been continuous.  Is it ready? As of October 2015,no.  It is still in Early Access.  When you look at dev feedback survey, they admit they released the game too soon into Early Access.  I play it once in a while, delete from my downloads, then then check it out every few months.I give it a thumbs up because I like what they are doing and I am not getting the GODUS vibe.  If you want a fully developed game, don't buy Early Access.  If you are patient and want to support these devs, buy it knowing it is not ready for release.			"

Early Access Review
								Summary: Great ideas and excellent writing with longstanding balance issues and poorly implemented RTS controls.Pros: Excellent writing in the tutorial, quests, dialogue. Very good job and very funny with lots of funny references to find. Tells a fun story and makes you want to play all the quests.Graphics are pleasing and interface is decent.Cons: Poor implementation on balance and controls. Balance:Far too many spider attacks even on easy mode. What happens is this, villagers are assigned to work buildings. When a spider kills a villager the building he was working at produces less and when this happens enough of the overall village happiness drops to the point villagers start leaving. This causes a snowball effect where leaving villagers drop the happiness rate faster and faster and the only way to increase it is to assign more villagers to those buildings which you don't have because they are all leaving.  This is very frustrating and unfun.  I restarted a few times on standard and a once on easy. In each case the game was tons of fun at first sliding into a frustrating job of micromanaging spider attacks and eventual village death.  I was so busy micromanaging I couldn't pursue the very enjoyable quests.Controls: The game plays like a Realtime Strategy and city sim. It lacks the standard RTS controls however making it difficult to manage 30+ villagers at a time when they die so often to spider attacks.  There is no option I saw to set a rally point for produced troops.  No queue for multiple orders or waypoints.  You can set a particular building to 'auto-fill' positions with villagers but it always fills to max. I would have liked to set it to only 1 villager as a baker for instance rather than the max of 4.   You get attacked from multiple directions as well so it would be nice to set a guard point and have the barracks automatically train new villagers as soldiers and send them to the guard point to replace losses.I always consider how long a game has been in development and check if they have any outstanding issues that have persisted for a long time without the devs resolving them.It seems from the other comments and reviews that there are many such long-standing issues with Folk Tale so I don't recommend this for anything above $10 until they have adjusted the spider spawn rate at the very least.Also: The tutorial was so funny and engaging that I forgot I was making breakfast and I burned my toast.

								HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THEY ACTUALLY LISTENED!So my first review was rather on the negative side wich was due to a few changes in gameplay that caused micromanagement.But now:1. They have given the townfolk some brain!2. They have made a auto-equip button for soldiers!3. They have added auto-management to buildings!and4. The tutorial is much better, be it a bit condescending in tone but since it´s directed towards ""bob"" and not me I guess I can live with that... the part about micromanagement enraging bob cracked me up thou and felt quite personal... xDSo here is the new review:+ Great, realy loveable GFX, they are crisp but not high poly and at the same time believable+ Very well optimized (so far, have not tryed what happens when town gets bigger), runs well even on older hardware+ Fun, yet realistic(ish) gameplay+ ""Aquarium"" feeling like the old time ""Settlers"" games++ Again, they realy listen to the players and make changes based on demand, this is so important for a EA title, I have to give it a extra + sign...- Some minor things like balancing (how many farms per farmer, how many windmills per bakery etc) should be more clearly visible or a clear rule should be established like for example 4 hunters can supply 1 butcher for 100% workload and 4 farmers can supply 1 bakery for 100% workload etc. that way we know OK: 1 winmill with full workforce and supply 1 bakery with full workforce...Other than that I don´t have much to complain about yet, but I will keep playing and I´m sure I can come up with something :D			"

								To say I am blown away is an understatement. When you read the negative reviews and some recent comments you would NEVER expect such a high quality experience even at this stage of development.The graphics are absolutely gorgeous the entire art design is just superb there is a real ""fable"" flavour going on and the entire aesthetic just adds to a bizarre feeling of polish even though the game is Alpha. Animations, models, textures, everything just looks and behaves so damn smooth I am struggling to believe some of the recent reviewers actually fired the game up.I will say that personally I am drawn by the sandbox aspect of the game so take that into account when reading this. I don't really care for story and campaign in an RTS I am much more interested in dozens of random maps, random events and different challenges and paths to the goal each time i play.With that said there is a VERY large amount of sandbox content here and all the implemented systems work very very well.The description this game gives where it says if you like Warcraft 3, Settlers, Banished, The Guild, Black & White 2 are a bit deceptive. To me it sounded like if you like those games you will like this ... what it didn't say as boldy was ""we are combining ALL of these games as one""They really have!!! the depth of this game and the realisation of its future potential makes you wonder how Anno 2205 even exists, how Settlers has gone downhill like it has ... tbh it is probably in light of the recent decline from the AAA studios that makes Folk Tale stand out that much more!!!I love management games, i love tycoon games, i love WC3, Settlers and the Guild but to have all these rolled into one game where each aspect doesn't feel like it was watered down or neglected for the sake of being able to make that statement .... I really am blown away.This game is proof that a book really should not be judged by it's colour and it is also proof of just how bad things can go when marketing a bit too early. I feel deeply for the devs in that respect because it is clear to me now this is a labour of love and reading any comment on these forums from the devs should bring an immediate sense of encouragement and understanding as to why the game is as it is and how things are handled going forward.I cannot recommend this enough if you like ANY of the games mentioned in the description on the store page. I have no doubts this will be finished and even less doubts that it is going to be a sleeper hit. I imagine it being absolutely huge in Germany if it isn't already.These guys truly are a diamond in the rough and all negative reviews really should be ignored at this stage. This is a game where a new page has been turned and due to the way EA works it is suffering from past mistakes but what cannot be overstated is that those mistakes have clearly been learned from and NOTHING but good things are happening going forward.

Early Access Review
								I was drawn to this game by the vast amount of developer communication there is. I'm a fan of city builders in the vein of The Settlers and the earlier Anno titles, so while I am usually cautious with Early Access games, a detailed developer response to a recent YouTube video and a look through the game's Steam forums showed me the devs are in it to win it with this game, and boy does it show!Folk Tale oozes charm. The graphics, music, voices, and story come together for a lighthearted fantasy experience similar to that of Warcraft or Fable. The presentation earns an easy thumbs up, though obviously, some assets are not yet implemented or are waiting to be iterated on.Gameplay-wise, it's a standard medieval city builder with a fantasy twist. The production chains, resource management, and city planning we all love from the likes of Anno and The Settlers are here, plopped inside a fantasy world where the undead lurk and heroes answer the call to action. The latter part is represented by a robust action RPG element to the game, which is very responsive, fun to watch, and serves as a momentary respite from tending to the needs of your town. A perfect genre pairing, if you ask me!I am eager to see how this game will grow and change, but the currently offered experience is well worth it for any city building fan, especially at its current twenty dollar price tag.

								The game was originally a very humorous blend of city builder and resource manager with a bit of RTS elements. That was apparently too much for this developer to handle, so it was scrapped and turned into you sub-par RTS with no soul. If that is what you like, zerg away.			"

Early Access Review
								When I first bought this game, it was very different, the campaign mode gave it some purpose and it had a lot of potential. I hope the campaign mode comes back. (Unless of course I'm thinking of a completely different game).I'll review the game as it stands currently. There are fairly regular updates which is important for early access. But generally it doesn't feel like much progress is being made. Game still very buggy and unbalanced. There are like 5 basic sandbox maps (inc. tutorial).While the general ""Early Access"" issues are forgiveable, so far gameplay wise there are a few week points:1) Combat needs serious work2) AI, why can't the city watch proactively defend the village?3) Managing soldiers, and their items (and managing items in general) is janky as hell.4) Managing your villagers is rather difficult, in that you have to go to each individual building, a general overview of idle workers and stuff and their statuses would be cool.The art style is gorgeous even if the graphics generally look a few years out of date, it's not competing with AAA titles though so that's not too much of an issue.Also, I discovered that the camera is actually useable if you hold shift while moving it. It actually moves at a decent speed. Cool feature, wish it was more obvious.I like it, you may too. But I can't recommend it for everyone.			"

Early Access Review
ConceptThe secret to writing a good review for an Early Access game is knowing that your rating directly impacts the potential of the game. To say that this game is currently not even close to the game I would like to play only serves to remind me that I very much want this game to be made.As such my initial review is positive. It's never a good idea to shoot down the developers of good ideas. Folktale is a good ideaWith my review of the dream of the finished product out of the way, I'll now proceed with my ill-informed review of the current game based on the one time that I sat down and played it far closer to sunrise than I had intended.DesignAs is apparent to anyone who has seen the screenshots, the content for this game is fantastically designed. While the style, particularly the hand-drawn textures, is reminiscent of the dozens of Warcraft descendents, the characters and environments still have a fresh, unique feel to them. At no point did I ever feel that the content side of this game wasn't delivering. Top of the alphabet!GameplayThe gameplay is where my dreams have yet to materialize. At the time of this writing, you'll actually be able to experience two separate games upon launching the Early Access. The first is a tutorial written and programmed on what must be an earlier yet more complete version of the game. Your main concerns with this version will actually be the lack of freely placed structures and the unusual lack of the standard RTS right clicking.After finishing the tutorial you will be stunned to realize that the sandbox game is actually a significantly updated version of the tutorial, adding both of those features as well as a plethora of new UI elements and ways to control the game. Suddenly the game you thought might be close to finished has a long way to go but has so much more potential.Later, after you've forgotten how excited you were twice already, you'll slowly realize that you have no idea what you're doing. The game's economy has no balance; the population is refilled automatically as part of a short-cut to make the game playable; enemies don't have any way to spawn after you've defeated them once; leveling structures isn't implemented yet; leveling characters is currently useless; the item menu is buggy; there is no way to save; and several really important features are buried in the UI and left unexplained.What's important to my expectations of this game, however, is that most of the features of the game have been noted and exist as hollow buttons. I have no trouble seeing the game that this will be and every window has been designed carefully. The only things that I see that have been rushed are the ones necessary for the game to run.InterfaceThe interface is unexpectedly confusing. The game launches from a few different menus since it is, in fact, two iterations of the same game. None of the menus have back buttons to the main menu so I found myself quitting and reloading a few times at first. Probably the most frustrating thing is that I can't visualize the economy in any meaningful way. My best guess was to build one of everything and assign the maximum number of people to each structure. There are very complex UI elements in place to describe, in fancy percentages and statistics, exactly what is going on in any structure. Unfortunately the game runs to quickly to justify the time it takes me to grasp and micromanage these features.Controlling the workforce is also annoying because the player currently orders citizens to work in certain places rather than ordering a building to hire a certain number of citizens (as in Tropico). If people aren't happy in your village, they'll leave without warning you which post they abandoned, creating holes that lead to more unhappiness and more holes. If you're off exploring the map, you might come back to discover that your whole town has unraveled and no one is working at all (an amusing byproduct of the Early Access release).Anyway, it looks as if a large portion of the UI is in place but currently does nothing so I have no real complaints. There is an economy window with no function and there are two or three extra features to extend the game that either aren't forward enough or that you just don't realize exist (science and crafting).I expect that lots of streamlining will be done along the way and the vast majority of the things I've noticed are far too obvious to be accidental. Features will be implemented and, when enough of them are stable, the devs will start paying attention to the desperate need for balance. Until then, I'm content leaving Folktale in my library for a future date.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game, about when it was first available, and back then it was Very, VERY Crude, but I felt it had a lot of potentiel, but uninstalled it and decided to check in on it a while later.Then I kinda forgot about it, up until today when a friend of mine mentioned he had looked at it, and though about buying it, and I remembered I had the game. So I decided to reinstalled the Experiemental version, to see the latest results.And my reaction was Astonishment... Everything had changed, and the crude game I once had a great hope for, have evolved into a game I already at this point, think I could end up sinking hours upon hours in.What this have shown me up till this point, is the developers are very hard working, and take the feedback from their community very seriously. And I will recommend this for anyone, who wants a great experience now, and at some distant point in the future when they decide to pick it back up again.			"

								This game has been in development for far, far too long. The devs screwed the pooch with this one. As far as i can tell the game has come far in the years its been in development, and im no game dev but it seems glacial at this point. That and the fact that one of the devs basically made a sob story forum post trying to guilt people into positive reviewing the games saying that it would fail without it is a bad move. I played for 30 minutes today and i dont know what i even payed for it anymore, but i suppose the game would be worth that price had it been handled well. The game is fine, if a bland fantasy game and i really wanted to believe in the project. But with how these devs have handled it, i cannot reccomend. Maybe check back in 4 years to see if its complete. At the time of its compeltion i will edit this review. Until then, steer away.			"

								This is a kickstarter type game, so it's currently just a tech demo/tutorial. Keep in mind it has bugs. That being said.. I love what I've seen so far. It reminds me a bit of Bard's Tale, in it's humor. Right now it looks a bit ""stiff"" as far as the building placements go, I think they are going to change that... but I really enjoy this game, I've played the tutorial several times thru. If you have the patience, this will hopefully turn out to be a great little game!!! The art and music in the game are really nice, too!!			"

Early Access Review
								I had originally given the game a good review about a year ago. It had potential, yet that potential has gone nowhere. The game is no closer to being finish now as it was then.The amount of progress in this early access is nearly neglibile compared to what other developers have done in early access. You can find dozens and dozens of similar complaints, more than other early access games. In fact this is one of them early access games that has given early access games a bad repuation about producing results.There is a lot of complaints on why this game has taken so long. I can tell you exactly why that is. The developer is too busy playing with social media than producing results in the game. Think about how many hours a week a developer spends playing with social media, now multiply that by four for a month, then ten times that for a year. That is a lot of lost manhours for what?About six months ago the developer deleted one my posts in the forums. It was a topic where someone was bashing the game the game and throwing insults. My post was deleted yet the topic remained unlocked and the posts with insults by the troll were allowed to remain. Then last weekend I run across this topic when trying to find out why towers stopped working and if these quests in the campaign are implented yet.http://steamcommunity.com/app/224440/discussions/0/364040961436251211/?ctp=2The original poster was allowed to insult people giving the game a bad review repeatedly. I spoke up about how it was wrong to trivialize the terrorist attack tragedies and compare the developers to being the terroist victims. The fact a developer was involved in that topic and allowed the post to remain made it even worse. My post saying it was wrong and offensive to use a terrorism comparison was deleted, yet the post making the comparison was allowed to remain.It could probably be a good game if the developers stopped trying to be social media stars and did their real jobs, producing video games. If you think I am wrong take a look at some of your favorite games and see exactly how much social media interact those developers do, not much if at all.This is definitely one of them early access titles you do not touch until the game is completed. Even then I would be wary because at the rate of development you can be pretty sure the game will be released too soon (funding issues) and will be full of bugs to be patched later.			"

Early Access Review
								So that was hmmm... quick? 6 hours in and game completed and I think the longest part  was the tutorial... How long has the game been in development? Campaign mode was easy and incredibly boring - the thing that took the time was constantly running back and forth over and over between locations. :(I can see that this game could be really good! It's something I'm interested in definitely, especially liking games like anno and banished! I also like that I can go and explore and do separate missions! Awesome :)Having said that, this game is so long in development and does not seem to be progressing anywhere at all  :( I see people commenting on the campaign in 2015 and I don't see any other options or further storyline... Paid research upgrades do not work so don't bother researching tech as it does NOTHING! Look at your production tab - you will see the base rate and it will never change - even if you have a fully upgraded and fully research building. Basic!Don't bother whipping or paying people to work harder - again does nothing except cost you money. Balance of the game is weird - I have 1000's of food - change from x1 - x2 consumption (100 pop) and within 5 minutes food is gone and people leaving and unhappy...""Salvaging"" does nothing but just make your items disappear - you can't craft anything of value and you have to MANUALLY distribute all your crappy loot individually to each separate workhouse... I appreciate having more control on your loot and items and what you do with them but why not just be able to place in warehouse and let your villagers best arm themselves? Of the 6 hours it probably took me about an hour to distribute loot... Many items are unexplained in their purpose or what they do - rare item - X ring but that's it... OK so what do I do with it?I really want to like this game but I can't :( If I see how long the game is in alpha dev (more than 2 years...) and how little you can actually do with the game I have a feeling I just wasted 6 hours and 20 bucks...  If it was more fun with less irritations I would say meh... but it wasn't a great 6 hours! So I recommend to you if you have 20 bucks free and 6 hours to really ""waste"" and not enjoy it that much... I figure most don't or won't so I unfortunately cannot recommend this game! "

Early Access Review
								This game is great. Base building is fun and challenging, you need to pace upgrades with expansion. The maps are huge and beautiful. I've only played the free build because of the difficulty scaling.Difficulty scaling is the downfall of the game in my opinion. As your hero levels the mobs become much more difficult. They become too difficult. As a level six hero, with advanced equipment I was unable to kill even two basic mobs. Two wolves were impossible for me to kill.This difficulty scaling makes the game impossible. I start a free build city in Haven, build my base and train enough troops to clear the level. At the end my hero is level 6 and I travel to the next town. In the next town I retain my level and equipment. When you start a new town you must (required) kill the starting mobs near your town. At level 6, with the mob difficuly scaling, a level 6 hero with advanced armor and weapons is unable to kill the basic mobs.Until this feature of the game is adjusted there is no way to play from one town to the next. This game is limited to one map at a time.I hope a developer reads this and considers making adjustments. However, it is worth noting, the difficulty is something I enjoy, its just moving from one town to the next that is impossible.			"

								This game is, unfortunately, a perfect example on why developers should not listen TOO much on the vocal part of the community. The plans they had in the beginning were very promising. A campaign driven game. The vocal community wanted sandbox, and the game is now in what seems a never ending early access... The game is frankly a mess. Trying to be a little bit of everything, with no real goals, make it bland in every part. I really wanted this game to be good. It was really promising. Sadly I can't see it be a finished product in a long time. If they went with their original plan I have no doubt that this game would have been finished, and a success too. Now the game is panning out to be for a minority of players, with increasing development time and cost.The developers are trying to keep us updated, but developer blogs do not really cut it. We want a game. Not videos of what might be. Yeah. I know. Early access. But this game have been in this state a long time. As it is now. I can't recommend it at all. No one would be happier than me if I'm proven wrong about the game in the future. But I doubt it will turn out great in the end.			"

The minotaur is coming for your money. Run while I reinstall his game and see it in the same state it was 1 year ago!

I checked every day for months for a promised ""SANDBOX MODE"". Finally I gave up. Here I am now reinstalling the game to see how it has developed.... sandbox, with only humans, very little additions, massive amounts of bugs, countless actions require you to quit to the desktop and restart the game just to move on.... I'm horrified by this purchase, and will never buy anything Early Access again. I just can't believe this is still available for purchase, when its still in an early alpha stage this long into being on Steam. Every concept is great, sure, thats why I purchased it. Had it said all the stuff it does now in the ""Early Access"" portion over a year ago when first being introduced, I would have simply clicked store again. I feel like this game should come out to be gold to be worthy of my $20 with all this interest, I can only hope. Just wait for it to release, whenever that may or may not be.Summary? The game has AMAZING ideas, and concepts. But, I advise NOT TO PURCHASE it, until it is released.			"

								This game has so much potential! For those who don't really have the patience to spend time creating, the gameplay itself has come leaps and bounds since i began playing, with loads of replayability per map. But my main focus isn't on the way the game plays in an immediate sense, but where this game has the potential to go in the next year or so. With a large enough community, and with player-made campaigns and adventures being uploaded I would love to see this game flourish in the same way as Little Big Planet did, regarding the way the community was shaped. Having said that, this game IS early access and there are features that are incomplete at this point. Personally, no regrets. Patience is finally paying off with developers that take pride in what they're making, and are delivering on their promises.			"

								TLDR: okay game, 4 years after buying still in alpha, probably never be finished. hope its done before I have kids.Bought this in 2013 under the premise of a simple city builder with light RTS and RPG elements.4 years later I'm to understand it's still in alpha and no longer a city builder, but more a of a settlers style RTS. I suppose I should be happy they're still supporting it. But, after doing an entire Degree in the time it took this game to reach alpha 30, I doubt It will ever be completed. I mean it's been 4 years... for alpha 30, Please just stop adding no concepts get whats there to a 70-80% polish and add a campaign so i can sit down and build a empire before I have kids. Being honest avoid this, you may find some enjoyment but you'll have the buyers remorse after it finally enters beta in 2021.			"

								Bought this when it came out as early access two years ago. Game is still in alpha so I don't expect it to be finished for at least another year. However, from what I've seen the developers are very active on the forums and respond to players quickly. This is not something a lot of early access developers will put effort into doing so I'm very satisfied with supporting this game. The early access pricing might put off some people, but in my honest opinion I think the money is being used well and the developer isn't making lots of empty promises but actually delivering weekly/semi-monthly content and bug fixes.Recently played this game and I really like the addition of the research system and the dungeon-crawl-esque instances. Crafting system and equipments have also added to the depth game. The dialogue humor in the campaign is kind of corny though.			"

								Diablo had a child with the Settlers franchise and out came ... Folk Tale. This is a definate buy in my oppinion if you like RTS/RPG with a lot of building and character inventory customization, every single character can be equipped and that includes farmers and the like. The customizations are not visual though, they consist of upgrades and gear, visual effects might be applied or not.The game is very ambitious and has been in developement for a very long time, I suspect it still has a long way to go, campaign is only about 5% done ...

								Posted Jan 5/17It's well on its way to being an excellent game. Pros:-Fun and easy to build your town-good controls/UI, not confusing at all-tutorial teaches you the basics (this should be an obvious thing but many games miss it)-this is just my preference, but it has a fog of war element but leaves the map revealed once explored. I really like that.-The game looks good, assuming you like its style(except for one thing I'll mention in cons)Cons:-(EDIT JAN 12/17-The developers responded to my email about this issue and said they are working on a fix, still hasn't been implimented but they are aware and working on it)There's a huge enemy balance problem right now.  It appears enemies scale in difficulty based on how big your town is, not how powerful your hero is.  The hero doesn't level up that fast so I was often sending level 3 Sir gregory plus 10-20 town guards to fight a level 7-10 Spider queen who was destroying my village only to have her kill pretty much all the guards and gregory every time(he respawns every 30 seconds so I was able to take her down eventually, BUT SHE RESPAWNS EVERY TEN MINUTES)-Sir Gregory looks ugly AF-The town guards don't patrol at all so when you are attacked you need to find a few dudes and then have them run accross your town to help defend, which can be annoying as it's hard to track them down (and as town guards they SHOULD be guarding the town anyways).-There is no auto cast or hot keys for the hero. You need to select every attack of his and then select enemies to hit yourself which is annoying in a battle when you have multiple heroes and units under your command.  Ends up making you babysit one hero to make him usefull and hope everyone else does okay just using their basic attacks.  This needs to change for sure.I would recommend the game though because most of my cons feel like things they are working on fixing (except for how ugly Gregory is (probably)).			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game when it first came to early access. However this review will focus only on the current game, versus the price point of $24.99.I think this game, in it's current state, is very fun. There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing gamebreaking. honestly this is how I would have expected it to be years ago, but that's beside the point. The gameplay reminds me of sim city crossed with Banished, and World of Warcraft. The graphics are very immersive and the townspeople have a quirky charm to them. The map feels expansive enough to me, and there is a real feeling of mystery in the land. Your town may be peaceful for days and days then out of nowhere spiders are attacking.FINAL THOUGHTS:The world feels like it's really alive, and this is a fantastic sandbox play. My problem is the price point. I'm very glad I bought the game years back and it finally ended up being playable, however for an early access game of this genre $24.99 is pretty steep. Most games like this I have been playing and liking even more lately are around 10-15 bucks. So I'm going to say that this game is a really good one, but it gets a thumbs down on the price point.

								Honestly, the game has some work to be done. But the devs talk all the time and respond to questions and concerns. It's a small team and they all do things outside of this so yes, it takes time. But what they have so far is very nice. Went from preset building areas, to build where ever you want! "

								So having played quite a bit I would have to say I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of games such as banished, stronghold crusader or even games like warcraft 3 it has elements from games I played years ago but with very pleasing graphics and enviroments remnisent of warcraft 3. At present I have come across some bugs and I can get a large villiage up and running in about an hour however I think its great fun with good replay value, the built in editor should give anyone willing to put the time in hours of enjoyment creating new levels. As I said it has some problems but looking at the patch history it has come along way and with the new patches will get alot better.Note: at present your main hero character does not respawn I learned this to my peril save often!

								Campain Mode seems to be progressing well. However, that being said I only give a yes recommendation tentativly.  Playing in sandbox mode I fould to be quite challenging.  The happiness of your citizens are way too demanding.  As well they are way too fickle.  You cannot seem to go beyond 40 villagers without them all leaving due to unhappiness.  Its a viscous cycle, you can't maintain your happiness level without villagers to provide what your villagers are unhappy about and so on and so forth.I do see great potential in the game however to those who like citybuilding type games but this game also has an RPG element to it as well, so I found it quite enjoyable.  To sum up:  Villagers get unhappy too quickly, tough to maintain.  Great potential though.			"

								I bought this game quite some time ago because I really enjoy city-builders and this one had real promise. A lot has changed in development but I'm not even remotely disappointed. Their character editor and map editor are both startlingly extensive and the main game mode is leaps and bounds beyond what it was when I first played. They've taken the advice and suggestions of their players and gone from a stiff but lighthearted citybuilter to something considerably more organic and immersive (and they maintained both the beautiful style and pluck of the initial concept as they did).  I was concerned back in the earliest builds that they'd make some ridiculous blunder and have the job assignments strictly gendered. I'm so glad to see that they didn't and that (aside from some questionable villager commentary that I assume will be updated or varied eventually, and the lack of variety in models which I also assume will be updated) there's a notable lack of sexist shenanigans.There's still quite a bit they have to implement (in game mechanics, balancing, etc) but it's already fun and enthralling. This game is a delight and I expect it's only going to get better as development continues.  Right now, even without full features, I feel satisfied that I've gotten my money's worth.			"

								For a team of 9, this game shows promise.  The 3D concept and implementation of this style game requires a larger team which they do not have, and with limited funding delays are expected.  This team is going up against software giants such as EA and the like.I have played through what is available and I honestly enjoy it.  If the team can hold true, keep the big picture in mind and release the full features within a set amount of time, this game can easily be a David among goliaths.  I'm standing by the team and hope they can deliver.    I am excited for the features to be continually implemented, Great job Games Foundry!			"

								Folk Tale is a Fantasy village builder action role-playing game.The game is currently in early-acces.The game currently has alot of content, even though it's in early acces.The game has a sandbox mode, you can also play the Campaign.The campaign is still under development, but from what I've seen it's very promising.You start out with a group of peasants, you construct your city, your villagers have needs. of course you have to keep your villagers happy. some of the needs are: Warmth, Different sorts of food and clothing.Your villagers can gather food, wood, stone and iron. to make your villagers work more efficient you can construct buildings, such as a woodcutters hut and a Fishing hut.You can also upgrade the buildings to increase productivity.You need certain buildings to craft items for your villagers/soldiers to use.There are many sorts of buildings to construct, and the developers keep adding more!Besides the city building you can also explore the world, the game features a real-time combat system.You can manage the inventory of every individual villager. In the world there are many things to explore. such as different cultures, monsters, dungeons and many more!There is alot of contact between the developers and the community, every patch features many improvements, balancing, bug fixes, new content.If you enjoy micromanagement, city builders, story-rich, fantasy, action, RPG, adventure, crafting games you won't regret buying this amazing game!

Early Access Review
								BUY if you want to support a fun shell of a game with interesting ideas and potential. DO NOT BUY if you are expecting anything like a complete game that lives up to its promises (yet).I just didn't know whether to go thumbs up or down, agonised over it for a while and went with up purely because it's early access. I thought I'd start out by supporting the devs with a positive review and see where it leads us. I'll change to thumbs down if my  faith is not rewarded.The shell of the game is fun, intuitive, nice to look at and has a great deal of promise. But it is, currently at the time of writhing this review, a SHELL. The main mechanics for building and growing a town are largely in place but many of the interesting features promised in the Steam screen shots and video are missing. There is no way to 'make friends', discover new worlds (there isn't even a world map implemented as yet). You build a town, form a small raiding party, wipe out everything on the map and that's the game done (there are only 3 maps available in sandbox mode).There are plenty of building to choose from, although they are all standard for a game of this type (logging camp, windmill, bakery, tavern, barracks etc) but there really is only one way and order in which to build them if you want any success.  Establish an economy and a small army, venture out rinse and repeat.The RPG element is totally missing from what I can see, as is diplomacy and any sort of 'world' mechanic (I looted loads of items on the first map and had nothing to do with them). The resource build/gather mechanic is in place and it's fun to implement (odd lack of any ability to build roads not withstanding) but it's going to be repetitive without the other half of the game promised by the promotional material.This was a borderline thumbs up giving the devs the benefit of the doubt. The content available is fun (although not original) but all the originality is in the other HALF of the game's promises that are not in place.			"

								Folk Tale definitly is the most promising game on Early Access, the concept is amazing! building and maintaining a village, create a small army and do RPG like quests. Every character has his own level progression and loadout, and it's gonna be a Sandbox game which is awesome. BUT, since the release in may 2013 the devellopers haven't added anything besides the save and load feature and a few bug fixes. I know games aren't created over night but I thought the point of Early Access was, at least according to Steam, that you buy a game for a low price, you get to play it AND see the game evolve, but nothing really changed since the release. The devellopers are still working on it though because they release ""dev blogs"" every now and then and some youtube video's to show us what they did. So what's included in the game when you buy it in it's current state, a tutorial which takes about 1-2 hours to finish, thats pretty much it. If one of the devellopers is reading this here's some advise that will statisfy most players; add the map editor, we might not be able to do anything with the maps we created but at least we get to play around with it. And maybe you should add showcases like they did in ArmA III, like small quests that can be started through the main menu to show some new monsters, enemies and features. I'm not a develloper but I cannot imagine it would be hard to do, and you will regain some trust with the people who have forgotten about the game or lost faith in it because they didn't see anything change for months.So should you buy it, if you like the concept, yes. It might only have tutorial for now (and you should keep in mind when you buy it that it might be like that for another few months) but as the game grows bigger the game will become more expensive. And to be honest, it's probably the best and most fun tutorial I've ever played so the game should be great when it's released.EDIT: The developer told me in the comment section that we'll get a preview of the location editor during the christmas patch!!!

Early Access Review
								Well, I was very leary of buying this because of all the bad reviews and the very immature additude of the developer, but I did anyway. First of all, the game isnt bad. It's got alot of great ideas in it. It's a sort of Age of Empires meets Rimworld I guess. So if you like that kind of thing, this is perfect.Not hard to jump into. Everything is pretty self explanitory. Tutorial was made as if explaining the game to a five year old, very easy to understand. I had one crash. After I figured out this was another AOE kind of game, i tried exiting out of the tutorial. Loading screen became stuck at 40%. I simply closed the game window and restarted. No biggie.Starting a new town is fun, but after that it got boring for me. The map I played on wasnt that big. My knight eaisly eliminated any hostiles i found. didnt find anything really cool to explore, which is what i was actually hopeing for.For me the game isnt bad. But its not my kind of game. Personel opinion time.....The dev made comments about negative reviews and how he didnt think his game deserved them. No kidding, no dev believes that. I can almost assure you that any time a dev says or does something that even seems suspect, your going to get more negetivity. I agree the game doesnt deserve negative reviews. Its not a bad game. But the dev does. And thats why i give this a thumbs down.Again, nothing against the game itself. Just the developers.			"

								About a year ago I gave this game a review that did not reccomend it, my reasoning was I felt the story had been abandoned for an open world sandbox game that had not been the intention of the game at the time. However because this should be about whether or not I reccomend the game to new buyers I've decided to change my original review to a positve one. Folk Tale now has a very clear goal in it's continued development as an early access game. With an art style remeniscent of Fable and gameplay like that of Black and White it's good fun to play for a few hours at a time making use of each new update and keeping track of the development bloggs. If your new to the game you'll know what they are offering you from the trailers and enjoy it for those reasons. Whilst I hope that when the game is finished it will have a full story mode that still holds all the great humour that I enjyed two years ago.			"

The Stream description does a great job of letting you know ahead of time what you're in for -- ""If you ejoy Warcraft, The Settlers, Banished...."" I really like Banished but think the game needs more depth to hold my attention. I've also always loved games like Warcraft and Age of Empires except I've always wished I could spend more time on the survival elements of those games.For anyone who has felt the same way, I prescribe Folk Tale by Games Foundry.

								Got this in 2013, which is when I started a relationship with someone who wasn't a gamer. They'd never heard of the idea of early access, but thought it sounded interesting. Fast forward four years, I hear them start laughing, loudly, as they get on their computer after work. I walk in and, once they've settled, see whats on the screen. Next day I decide to give it a whirl while my internet is down, and progress(maybe) 20min further into the story before it force-stops me. We laughed and laughed, then they said it was another day-z. I replied with the fact that this is an RTS, so it is much more shameful, being incomplete still. Don't give em your cash.			"

Early Access Review
								So far, the game is pretty good, but it is can be unforgiving if you mess up. Once villagers become unhappy, they start leaving and they won't stop. This requires more balancing, as once they start leaving, businesses start to empty, thereby reducing the production of things that keep villagers happy, which reduces unhappiness even more and causes more villagers to leave.Basically when unhappiness outweighs happiness, you're  screwed. The only way to really counteract this is prior knowledge of when villagers desire what. So here is an important pro-tip:At 30 population, your villagers will demand new clothing, and at 40 population, they will demand mead. So try your best to prepare these industries in advance before hitting the population mark, otherwise you will be crushed by unhappiness. The game itself is becoming great, but the unhappiness mechanic really guts your village when it takes effect.			"

								This could be, and likely will be, a fun game.  As it stands, it is not.  The campaign is half baked and poorly implemented, with multiple, long stretches of running back and forth across the same terrain just killing time.  It plays like early MMO gather quests where you run around, kill things, come back, run back, kill some more, return, rinse, repeat, rinse repeat.The sandbox mode is interesting, but also broken and woefully incomplete.  Each resource can be gathered/created in exactly one way, and if that way is not present, too bad.  No animals around to hunt so you can gather hides?  You lose. Want to buy it at the market?  It takes 50 of those non-present resources to build a market. The economy cannot recover from the absence of a single critical component and your time has now been wasted.I expected the game to be rough and in need of polish.  It is not ready for polishing--it needs some core development, some tuning and THEN some polishing.  This game could be good in about a year.			"

								This is a fun, relaxing, charming and at times beautiful RTS, RPG, hybrid, whatever you want to call it.GOOD STUFFSatisfies that village building itch. And finally a forgiving game that goes at a relaxed pace.The score is lovely, the humour a little cheesy but not overly cringworthy. And some darker choices in the campaign are great to see and follow.Placing buildings feels good and they look gorgeous and unique when upgraded. It can get expensive, but its perfectly feasible to knockdown and rebuild structures when the village grows and you want to replan.The RPG level on your heroes and villagers is minimal but in my opinion just the right level. At first I didn't want to micro-manage all their equipment, and I could (seemingly) safely ignore it, but I found myself eventually drawn to and actually enjoying it. Something I love about it is the way the ground you slowly expand over still feels alive and natural. Your woodcutters automatically plant saplings as well as fell trees - so there are always trees growing in the town. The hunters still find and hunt animals on your grounds as well. And the villagers go absolutely all over the place, which looks great, all with their own needs (like hunger and new clothes), even delivering firewood to cottages which I thought was a nice touch.And it's great to zoom out after a number of hours see how your village has become a huge, fortified town.ROUGH EDGESStill some rough edges, obviously. But not had any crashes or game killing bugs. Just a few wtf moments where things haven't been implemented, aren’t obvious, or the where the campaign isn't finished.Villagers can lose their gear when you start reassigning jobs, which calls for a bit more micro-management.And it needs an easier way to distribute clothing and gear to the masses. Although this in itself isn't really necessary, but it's nice to know your villagers are as protected as they can be.Combat is fun, but a little weak at the moment; I think it mainly needs a lot more audio.And overall it needs a bit of balancing here and there. At the moment, if anything, it's all too easy.DEVSI only just came in at the end of March 16. I looked at the Negative reviews first, and it seems that many of them are complaints at development time. Fair enough, I have a few games on my shtilist that have taken an age and I thoroughly regret backing. And this might of been one had I found it years ago.But, judging this game on it's current merits, I think it deserves a much higher rating.Judging the devs is another thing and maybe they deserve the knock - But thankfully not for me to argue or care about.---------------At the end of the day this is a great game in the making. I want to see this game complete.This, to me, is one of those EA games where all the problems are positive ones: I just want more of it: more hero's, more gear, building animations, deeper combat, more to do in town. I can't think of anything to really complain about, want removing or drastically changing at this point.It's more than just a great foundation, it just needs a more content and polish.Most certainly worth it in a sale if you're unsure.

								Ok, so here are the things to know......The game looks very much finished, but it is NOT, do not expect a finished game, but a game that the dev's are still putting a lot of work into.Visuals look great, for what it is that is... its not a SE or Ubisoft game. Visuals are nicer than say, Stronghold 2, and thats more than enough really.Gameplay... They changed what it was, it was originally headed towards a Stranghold 2 campaign style game, but decided to go Sandbox... Make sure you understand the difference, before buying this game. I personally am glad and sad at the same time... The reason being, while I was enjoying the tutorial style story telling and such, it made me think the game would become quite easy to complete in the end, not based on difficulty but length... how long would a company wanna make a campaign right? (CoD takes a few hours at best) I like the way its going, but I hope they decide to add back in a campaign later on. (Dont forget this iws an early access alpha game)Audio is just great, love the simplistic ambience and sounds, plus the sountrack behind it.Bugs... Well, not really, a lot of stuff in game is not ready yet or implemented, but it seems you will be able to customize quite a bit from buildings to your people... could be nice!If you are looking for a game that holds a lot of promise, and potential... this is the one to support.

								I reccomend this game for its idea and what it is planning on doing like tower defence minigame update that is coming out but however as you mabey can see the game is far from finished. My suggestion is to watch some developers blogs and mabey do some research first if you like games as Settlers or Age of Empires this game can turn out quite well for you.This game doesn't have frostbite 3 engine grapics but bit of world of warcraft like in my opinion a game shouldn't be juged at its grapics (most of the time).The developers are doing a great job after a time of silince and I have fait they will put out a good game but it may take a while before this game reaches its point you can enjoy its full content for now there is a map creator to toy with and a charcter custumizer (Warning you can make disturbing monsters) but concept wise the game sounds like a great multietasking town manger game with rpg elements.

Early Access Review
								NOTE: I bought this game in early beta stages in 2013.  As with all beta, there were a ton of bugs and issues and so I put it back on a shelf until it was more polished. I think people have to realize that when something's in beta, it WILL have issues. If you're judging an entire game before actual release, you need to adjust your expectations as such. That said, I just opened up the game yesterday after shelving it for more than a year, and wow. I'm quite impressed with the changes. This game has a little something for everyone.It works on the same principle as other sim building games -- where you set up a village, nurture its growth by adding food supplies, shelter, and defense -- but it's so much much more than just your basic sim build.Each of the various buildings you can place in your village are upgradeable, require specific sets of values (happy peasants, enough wood, etc) to upgrade, but you can ALSO spend resources learning specialized tricks for each trade - your blacksmith learns how to make plate, your tavern learns how to host a mead festival (and brothel! oh my!) -- each building and the workers in them are part of a giant cog that makes your village work. Once you research tricks for your trade, you can actually craft items. Yes, I said craft items. You can equip your peasants with tougher gear so they can fend off invasions of spiders or other enemies. You can make regular cloth or silk, plate armour or swords -- the choice is up to you.BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!You also get your own ""hero."" A goofy, loveable type, he ventures out into the world to fight the invading forces, collect resources and discover loot. He levels up like you expect in a traditional MMO, and gains experience, stats and strength. Those with OCD for building sims and building sims only may have some trouble multi-tasking -- the resources your ""hero"" collects are necessary for some town upgrades/builds -- but it makes this game so much more complex than your traditional RPG or city builder.My first day back playing, I lost 10 hours to the game. That's the first time a game so engrossed me in such a long time.The pros:* You can create a bustling village, complete with its own economy (heck, you can fill your citizens up with mead and have them drunk all the time, so they don't complain about taxes).* Each industry (mining, tailor, bakery, farm, blacksmith, tavern, etc) is fully upgradeable. With each upgrade unlocking new skills.* Each industry has specialized knowlege to learn; unlocking different abilities.* Each sim resident can be geared up with items you craft.* Your hero explores the rest of the map, fights enemies and comes home with loot.The cons:* While the humor is great in this game, the narrator can be a tiny bit grating at times. He's especially gleeful and sullen when your villagers get upset and leave. Bit of a drama llama :)The game is absolutely worth buying, particularly if you love sim building and RPG. I haven't seen any other game out there quite like it. "

It is an early access game so we have to remember that the devs can only make it better from here. It may not be done now, but when it is finished it'll be a true gem! The game play is smooth, entertaining, and fulfilling. I suggest you give it a try  ;)			"

								*I bought this game at the very beginning of early access and was drawn to it with the story line which seemed very enjoyable and interesting. It looked like it would have quests to go save one of the villager's wife who had been captured by some goblins, while also building your town. Now it's just sandbox. Woo hoo, I built a building. Yay, more people are coming to my village. Oh no, someone has a fever and then takes medicine. No quests, no direction. I like the graphics, and the music is enjoyable. But that's really all that it's got going for it so far. I really hope the developers will find a way to bring back the story that was originally set when this game began.*UPDATE: Another player has informed me that the story is in the works to be coming back, indicated in their comment to this review! This restores my hope in this game and I have changed my decision on if I'd recommend this game. This information is much appreciated!			"

								DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE RATING!Most of the poor ratings are from the early , early stages since release and the game has come a long way since then.If you scroll down you will see that everyone who has played Folk Tale recently would reccomend it!Folk tale is a unique game that incorporates RTS , RPG , and city building together. Despite currently being in early developement , it is actually quite amazing and you will get at least 10 hours in its current state. However i felt that what's as great as the game , is the developement team. Every week the developers release updates to the game and keep us informed on how the game progresses with Blog , Videos and streams. I have to admit that when i first brought the game , there was little content other than the tutorial but in a few short months , it has become one of my most aniticipated games for this year. I highly reccomend you give this game a chance and help these great new developers!			"

								Now I loved the premise of the game, when I first bought Folk's Tale it promised to be something completely different to what's out there...That's it. It's been 3 years and the game still isn't complete with no story to speak of and last time I played it, it was just one big tutorial. A complete waste of time and money. I'm sure the developer had the best intentions but so did I when I went to Uni. I said i'd revise every day and not go and drink at everyplace i could until I forgot my name and lost my dignity.. but I did.... There's plenty of early access titles out there which promise similar things but i'd purchase those over Folk's Tale. It seems like it will nebver be finished unless one of the big boys picks it up and pumps in the $er.....			"

Early access is true but the game isn't like other titles where it is broken and buggy, it has yet to crash or freak out on me, it is more stable then some full games. I would reccomend it, if you like games like Tropico and Age of Empires or any RTS city builder then I would give this game a try. 8.5/10			"

								I know this game is still in progress and hoping for more story and quests but I have played this game very early in development and can see so much growth since then. It has been around a year since I originally played the tutorial and can't wait till it's done but am also glad that they are taking their time to get it right! It is great to be apart of the build and give my thoughts and ideas as it grows. I enjoy playing beta games and have played many different games in progress. The reason I like that is because you get to put feedback into the game so the developers can get improve the game in a way that will be fun for everyone and also have a wide variety ways of playing because many of us have different styles of playing. I recommend getting the early access to help the developers get more ideas and to help make a better game in the end and remember that you must be patient during the creation process!			"

For a 'sandbox' game it does not yet have a sandbox mode and the only game mode you can play gets boring quickly when you realise you cant put random peasants in the stocks. If you are interested in a game like this go and get something like banished, but if you can wait follow this and join the rest of us hoping the devs will live up to their word.			"

								Tl;dr version: Buy it if you are fine with it being Early Access for awhile, or if you want to get involved in the building/scripting tools. If you aren't cool with that, don't buy it or at least don't trash it when you knew what you were buying.Folk Tale has popped up as a recommended game for a long time. I really liked the art style, which reminded me of Kingdoms of Amalur, The gameplay leans more towards guiding a hero around and city building than the unit/tactic juggling of RTS games. I held off buying it because of the negative reviews, but over the past few years, those reviews have gotten progressively better. The biggest complaints seem to be that it is very much an Alpha build, and that the Devs don't just finish it, already. I took the plunge and played it during an open weekend and enjoyed what little there was to it at the time. I liked it enough to buy it after reading that this wasn't abandonware and that the Devs were releasing updates every week or so. Sure enough, the Experimental Builds are making a steady, if slow, march to a whole, satisfying game. The changes are enough that I check back in every few months, and the gameplay feels better and better. There's still some long-standing issues (ale, firewood, clothing) if you overbuild too fast, but the Devs have addressed other, more pressing issues.			"

								This game has been in Early Acess for a long time, and the development is very slow.But.This game not only has a great potential because of it`s rather original idea (a RPG and city management mix), but i`ve noticed a lot of good things in this gameFirst of all, there are many different models for the villagers (and i think you can create more?), and knowing the amount of roles in this game, each one providing different outfits for the villagers, is very impressive. It helps showing that even though the developers are slow, if they continue like this, this game will be very detailed and diversified.But when it comes into the gameplay, it`s not really great. It`s everything but begginer friendly, and you will have to do a few tries to make your town survive. The game also appears to have a lot of depth, but it`s unlikely that you will see all of it. not because there`s loads of it, like The Binding of Isaac, but because a lot of things arent implemented and the things that are are sometimes only possible to get in certain levels/modes or using cheats. Pretty annoying if you ask me.The soundtrack is something in between alright and good. it`s not bad, but it isnt something you will remember.Overall, i recommend it, but if you have other options, i`d sugest you to wait until the game is more developed(Although i wouldnt count on that. 3 years have passed already)			"

								This game in early access is without any doubt in my mind absolutely brilliant.Ok, now that's out of the way, the tutorial that comes with the game is fully playable and very good, but it's not what the games about. It's about a lot, lot more than that.It is now a sandbox game, we have an editor to design our own  levels to share with the community and eventually portals to join them together to make complete worlds, we already have Grasslands, swamps , snow zone and more on the way, the models, animations and artwork are amazing.I could go on at length (but I won't ) If you have a little patience then buying it will be worthwhile or wait a couple of months and look at it again, but to me it's alread worth the price tag.They are only a small team producing outstanding work, given the time (and the support), they will produce a brilliant piece of software.

								Sadly i have to agree with most of the posts afore,while i am still excited about the concept, the game in its current state hardly deserves the title. A lot is drafted, but nothing is fleshed out. The game has good graphics and an immersive soundtrack. Other than that, there is not a lot to play with. Most of the production chains are useless. There is only one tier of armor, that merits the effort of making. None of the weapons are. While there are three diferent food production chains, which are not optional btw, you cannot really get a grasp of where you are standing with either of them. The hero is weaker than any basic arbalist (arbalists beeing the only military unit that do any good, having the ability to carry worthwhile armor). Basic mechanics, such as an hidden inventory slot for production and recruiting buildings are missing. This says a lot about the production value. The GUI as well.As a summary i must sadly say, the game provides only a few hours of gameplay. One hour for the town and maybe three to get some walls around, since the mobs constantly respawn, basically the only way to get some peace for your settlers.I hope my review saves others the 20 EUR i spent, and is not regarded as an angry review. I play games for more than twenty years and i concern myself with quality and project management for a living.@Devs: If you are willing to fill the games basic mechanics with life, which would be probably an undertaking of mere hours, i am sure you will get better reviews. Rather than putting effort in the misleading advertisements, reconsider what is needed to move the project along.9/10 for the idea and concept2/10 for realisation			"

This game is great in many waysLet me explain!If you love games like ""Settlers"", ""Knight and Merchants"", ""Majesty"" and ""Age of Empires"" you will love Folks Tale even more:Regarding city life:- It has a detailed city to grow and expand with people that you can custom their items and fulfill their needs.- Many decorative parts- city defences that come near to Stronghold and work much better than the crap in ""Settlers 6""- Citizen will take you part of their private lifeRegarding fights:- you will need to explore the map with your troops or heroes in order to fight monster.- monster will also attack the city- monster drop loot which you can give your people. It uses a similar system than most RPG, for example like World of Warcraft.Regarding exploring:- Folks Tale has a game breaking new feature:Your map is actually just a part of a whole world. You can take your heroes, all with special skillable abilities to other places.- There are desserts, dungeons, swamps, boss fights, snow lands.- Each map has allies or enemies, you can choose to smelt alliances.Why did this game stay in early access for a long time?- Well the development team changed their plans aprox. 1 year ago from campain to sandbox. Since then the progress on sandbox has been enourmous and continued.How is development doing at the moment:- The dev team is really hardworking. Everything they have on their dev roadmap is coming along well.- The dev team has a very clear strategy since they changed to sandbox- They even respond to the community in the forum within hours- They have Sunday Life streams where they present in over 2 hours !!! what they developed in the last 7 days. Progress each time is astonishing. And it is on sunday, their freetime...- They have once in a month a big patch update and once in a month a big blog update.If you like to know what is still to come:Check the dev roadmap:http://www.gamesfoundry.com/roadmap.aspxI personally have never seen such a transparent and clear formatted roadmap, see what already has been established!!!This game is definitely worth to buy. Either now to support them, or later.			"

								Just a very brief review. The game in general is progressing nicely, with an excellent citybuilding element already present. The second component of the game, the RPG element, is in its early stages of implementation. So expect to see more on this soon! From what I've seen so far, and what is to come, I would recommend purchesing this game!Rather than discuss the positive aspects of the game, as many have already done, the thing I'm mainly overwhelmingly happy about is the engagement with the player and supporter base. Monthly patches, twitch streams, regular blog updates and just prompt and effective communication on the forum are just some examples. On that note alone, if you are into the citybuilding/RPG genre of games and crave involvement with the creative process (mainly through feedback), I strongly recommend this game.All in all, this has been the best experience I have had from an early access game!

Early Access Review
								I just picked this game up a couple days ago and it's a pretty fun mix of RTS/RPG/City Builder. From what I've read, this game has been in Early Access for quite some time, and apparently it initially wasn't in a good state, hence the mixed reviews. The game seems to have come a long way since then, so I wanted to write a positive review to help this game climb up to the positive score it deserves.I can't speak for how the game used to be, but from what I've seen, the game is enjoyable, (mostly) functional, and you can see that the Devs are commited to it. A major patch comes out every month. You build a city from scratch, starting with basic resources and then expand to more complex resources that require a supply chain. You can also produce items/gear to equip your heroes (and citizens) with. With your heroes you can explore dungeons to obtain resources and loot, similar to a dungeon crawler.Despite the positives, keep in mind the game is still in development, so there are obviously things missing. You can see some features that aren't implemented yet, the UI can be clunky at times and I have run into a few bugs, but overall, you can still play the game and see the developers vision. I'm excited to see how this game progresses.			"

								There are very few games like this anymore. A mix of RPG and city builder (like Spellforce or Warcraft) that I wish there were more of. So, if you desparately miss those types of game this is worth a go. However, the sandbox mode is not currently what I'd consider true sandbox (the three maps are pre-determined, never change, aren't procedurally generated). Also, many production chains don't exist (just place holders). You quickly reach the end of what you can build within a few hours. The campaign is in rough shape with plenty of bugs and is only partially completed. In current state the amount of play time you'll get will be limited.I hope that development continues/picks up so this game can fill this game genre gap.			"

Early Access Review
								Folk Tale is an RPG/RTS sort of game. I normally get burned out on RTS games, and I'm not great at those. I adore this game. The storyline keeps things interesting. I can switch back and forth between building up my town and exploring a dungeon. Before I break down the individual aspects, I'll say this: This game is currently early access. The storylines are not complete. If you go into this, knowing that this game is unfinished and constantly progressing, you will be way happier. Okay, we'll start with the resource management aspect of this game. There are a lot of buildings to place that tie into other buildings. For example, in order to make clothes for your people, you need a weaver, cotton fields, and a tailor. There are items that you can equip to your workers depending on their profession. You can research things for each building (except the cottages); an example would be that you can expland the boundary on the windmill, which increases the space for crops. The people can either be assigned manually, or you can have them automatically accomplish tasks. As far as resource management games go, this one has a lot of little things that make it charming. I adore the fact that you can equip people with the items you find and loot. On the RPG side of things, you start the game with a hero, Ser Gregory. There are other heroes that you can have join forces. When it comes to the dungeon runs (sounds like a digestive issue) you fight bad guys, you loot chests and barrels, you fight bosses, you get lost, you try not to get killed. They're everything you could ask for from a dungeon run. The equipment items you find have stats that affect your heroes. Certain items come in common and rare. What they have planned for loot and magical items is really exciting. Ser Gregory has special attacks he can do, the power slam, which affects the baddies that are right in front of him. There is a shield bash, and some defensive abilities. I believe each of the heroes will have specific abilities. The storyline has different paths you can take. The animations are really fantastic, and the amount of detail that goes into everything is staggering. As of right now, there are two branches of the story. You can investigate the gladefolk (which is a gorgeous, newer addition) or you can locate the sandal factory. I am really excited for where the story will go from here. Like I mentioned before, this game is still early access, so there will be waiting for certain things. I strongly reccomend trying this game out. I personally love the excitement of updates. It's like exploring the same game over and over again. I also really like that this game has a sandbox mode and a world editor. ;TLDR Early release game combines RTS and RPG succesfully. Highly detailed, gorgeous, and a lot of fun.			"

								I have never really cared enough to post a review of a game, this is my first. It bothers me that people give this game poor reviews. It's an Early Access game!! There will be bugs! I'm sorry, but you're an idiot if you purchase an Early Access game and expect it to run perfectly. First and foremost, Folk Tale is (and will be) brilliant! It is exactly what I've been wishing for in a game. At the moment it's more or less just a city builder like Banished, except it will be so very much more when complete. The realm is rich with detail, the humor edgy. It's been fun to watch this game come to life throughout the entire process. This game has so much potential it's hard to be patient while waiting for it to be complete. I've been hooked since I first purchased it, which was BEFORE any save was available. The developers are much more transparent than any other EA games I have purchased, keeping us up to date on what is on task, sharing artwork for new features/characters/buildings etc that will be implemented in future patches. I don't know what the final price will be upon completion but I've definitely gotten my money's worth out of what exists right now.If you're considering this game, ignore the haters. Most didn't even take the time to read the discussions or the Folk Tale blog. If they had, they woudln't have been wanking about half of the things they were.			"

								I gave this game a thumbs up when I first bought it in 2013 I believe it was. After all that time they have only added two story line quest. There is a lot of hot fixs, but the game was never really that broken that they needed to fix problems with the game over finishing the story line of the game. The sand box mode is also fun but the map is small so again there is so much to do till you are bored again. Until this game gets finished or they lower the price of the game I won't give it a thumbs up.			"

								I've been following the development of this game more or less closely and I am impressed - not only with the progress gamesfoundry made but also with the courage with which they took on the challenge to transform the early average concept into a sandbox game highly demanded by the community.Of course this is a rocky and never straight path, but seeing what they have achieved in the last year I am confident this will be one gem of game once it is finished, which it isn't yet and most likely will not be for some time.One has to understand, that this is a huge undertaking for such a small company. So I fyou expect something playable and want to start building your little own world right now, I suggest you wait and watch a bit longer.However if you want to be part of the process and you know what developing games is about, I really recommend diving into it: the editor, the sandbox player and the community. Give your feedback and help making this project a success. Given the very moderate pricetag this is almost no risk compared to prepurchasing one of the much more expensive Titles that don't give a wellyouknow about how you want to play a game.I'm not in anyway related to the gamesfoundry. I just bought this a while ago and I love watching the progress.			"

								For starters the game is in early access (EA) and therefore has what all EA games have. Broken mechanics or balance that simply isn't implemented yet. I have never programed but I know as with any project development takes time.I bought Folk Tale after watching the videos on youtube that the lead programmer as uploaded. There is a lot that is not in the game at this time but you get a great idea of what the game will have in the future. This is a massive project that can (and will) have major success. EA means you can over look those blemishes and enjoy an evolving work that will have ups and downs. I support them and suggest you to do the same.			"

								I really enjoy this game.It combines some of my favorite gaming genres and elements - a singleplayer citybuilder game with crafting and economy combined with exploration with leveling up characters and looting stuff.The game has been on early acces for years, and it does not look as if it's going to be 100 % done anytime soon. However, the community is very active, and there is a good comunication between the users and the dev-team. The game includes a map-editor with all the features that the dev-team uses to make the campaign. As a result, there are several usermade maps and even campaigns in the workshop. Some of these includes long questlines and even homemade voiceacting.So, while this game has a long way to go, I think it is a great game and if you enjoy citybuilder games and loot'n level-games like me, I think this game will be worth your time. I really look forward to any further development :)Cheers			"

								Don't let the mixed reviews stop you from purchasing this gem of a game! When I purchased this game, About 2 years ago, The game showed a Lot of potential, The game had great graphics and a good feel to it, Since then the game has been updated a Significant amount and now it looks even better than before! The storyline in the campaign is getting  on greatly and the recent updates make the game even more playable, The resource managment + Ciry building aspecs and loot collecting add a Sim City / Diablo feel to the game which personally I feel is amazing, The merging off the two genres gives the game something very special! I'm happy to see the devs are releasing updates frequently and are making every effort to improve how the game runs! So far, Considering the game is in early access, already feels like a work of art! I'f you're having any doubts about this game then be sure to read the reviews From after the biggest, Most recent updates!			"

It has a lot of flaws inherant to early access games (missing systems and such) but each update brings with it fixes and more potential, if they can refine that down then they will have a big hit on their hands and I am excited to see the game as it gets more content and polish.

Early Access Review
								Once upon a time, there was... a game, which stood in the Alpha-status for far too long regarding its reputation.I'm really conflicted about Folk Tale, to be honest. I bought it right after its release on Steam to support the development, because - as I thought - it handled a niche with a lot of potential. I played the tutorial, participated in a vote about what monsters are to be implemented (sadly, my nagas and lamias didn't make it) and regulary read the development blog. But this is about an honest review, about the question if (and if or if not, why) I'd recommend this game: The answer, at the current state, would be no.Many people here noted the time-span, in which Folk Tale has been... well, ""released"" on Steam and this is fairly a good point. But I'm not concerned about the actual release of the Sandbox mode, but rather about the support AFTER it's release and the frequency of implenetation regarding new ideas. Take the example from above: When do I get the chance to play Nagas and Lamias, actually? Will there be any chance? Will there be another game after Folk Tale (a question, none developer could answer honestly, at that point, no offense) and if so, what happens to this one?At the moment, Folk Tale is just neither red nor blue. There are a lot of promises, only a few backed up by ingame content. And such, there has been no reason for an investor, to trust in this product (as said, at the moment). If - and only if - there will be a full playable sandbox mode (which isn't buggy as hell with enough ""managing a whole fantasy town in a strange world""-atmoshpere), you should definetly check this out.Until then, keep your hands by your money and wait, as those do, who have spend their money.

								This game is a hallmark of what gaming should be.Not because the game is beautiful (which it is), or funny (which it is), or has engaging gameplay, depth and charme (which it does). The true strength of this title, that sets it apart of the rest, is the developer.I have never (and might never again) spend money on an unfinished title, but this time I had to do it, simply because the developer is in constant, open, honest and fair contact with everyone who wishes to engage them. They treat people like humans, not wallets. Every week, the boss himself (whom we all who usually tune in just call Simon) streams for hours, talking with viewers about the game, taking suggestions and criticism, offering insight in their vision, or just chatting about kinds of toast.As you can tell, I WANT this title to succeed. It's an ambitious, inspired work by ambitious, likeable people.If you don't believe me, do yourself a favor and come by the streams or write in the forums sometime, and see for yourself.As for the actual content ingame, it has grown tremendously in the last months. I won't go into too much detail as the game is A. still in Early Acces and stuff will evolve and B. because you can read all about that on their homepage anyway.As jaded and critical as I am, I believe in the end product of Folk Tale.TLDR: The negative reviews on here are outdated and misguided, the game is alot of fun and has an awesome, unique charme, and the developer is absolutely worth supporting.

								My play hours on this game do not reflect how much time I've put into this game. Living in an EXTREMELY rural area, I lose internet often and Steam tends to not recognize how much time I've been on this game. Anyway, I've had this game since a few months after it was released on Early Access, and I only have one thing to say about this game. SUPPORT IT!! There are mixed reviews and I don't know why. After seeing so many Abandon Ware game from EA, I adore these devs. All they have done is listened to their players and upped their game every-single-time. If you don't agree, go to their dang website and see how much they do. Look on the forums here to see how often you can get a response from them. This game will truly be amazing when it is complete. To keep this review from being pages long, I'll simply say this. This game in INCOMPLETE (Durr), but continually gets better. IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, because the price will only go up as it gets better. Buy now, support devs who care more about you than about pre-sales and enjoy watching a game as it develops; especially getting to be a part of having a voice in the development of this game. I definantly recommend this game to any and all.			"

								This is my first review ever, since I normally won't bother. But this game is worth playing. I purchased it expecting a mix of settlers and perhaps Banished. Instead I received that - and more. First of all - locations are amazing. Maps are detailed and it's easly visible that there was lots of love put into them.Music, buildings, people - all of this fits nicely into landscape.As for game itself. When you start - it's hard to stop. Even if it's just a sandbox. And I hate sandboxes. I hate aimless games. But here it's just fun to see how your village grows in this awsome enviroment. And with things to come - RPG flavour, dungeons and such - it will be grand.Just one thing though. Give it few mins to grow on you. and RTFM :3			"

Buying this game means you can help shape final product which is nice.However, if you are looking for a game you can play through or beat, this is not the game for you.Overall I think the game is very unique and will end up a wonderful product in the end.

								The potential for this game is brilliant. The devs have big plans but seem to be taking their time over it. If they can sustain the love and get the balance between RTS/Sim/RPG right, this could be rather special. At the moment, it's hard enough feeding the villagers bread, clearing trees and conquering mighty berry bushes. A long way off where it could be, levelling up your blacksmith so he can craft an epic rolling pin for your baker. Don't buy if you don't have patience.			"

								I've had this game on wishlist for over a year.  Back then, I was reading overall negative comments.  But also taking in consideration the huge potential and the fact it was in Alpha, I kept it on wishlist.A while ago, there was a discount.  I bough it since comments were taking a more positive turn.  Game was..... hum.... unclear.  Clearly unfinished.  Could barelly figure out... anything !  But looked and felt smooth and ""in-line"" to something GREAT.Triied it again, recently.  And the development is moving forward greatly and the game is taking shape. Up to this point, it really feels like it is in the good direction to reach its full potential.  The game is currently playable, but clearly lacks a lot of features and has almost no ""tooltip/hints/help"" yet.  This is not negative.  It's just a side-effect of ""not being ready"".  Things could still change so why make a full help/guide just yet, right ?   So if you ""try"" this game while in beta, keep in mind it's not completed...As of right now, I am really excited with what I have seen and with the way developpers do their work (their web site gives a lot of infos).Can't wait to see the final result.

Well being a realist im investing in this games development and I am having a great time, Seeing Games Foundry's Roadmap has showed me of a 30 Dollar game in the near future and I am just stoked to see this game come to Launch. There is a lot to do yet but, its gonna totally be worth it.  I read on the Dev's blog that a lot of the negative score on this game was do to it being released into early access to early, haha, So with that said they have ""trashed"" systems that were not working and implemented user suggestions, I can honestly say that this game is totally worth it.Thank You Games Foundry, for coming up with a great game, It took me a while to figure the systems out, But I do love a challenge.

								It seems to me a lot of the negative reviews posted here are from people who are misinformed or just plain impatient. The devs of this game asked the community about a year ago if they preferred a sandbox or campaign mode. Most of the community chose sandbox so the entire game has been re-written the last year to acomplish that. We were told it would take awhile and now the foundation is complete so there will be updates more regularly. How many game developers do you know that will re-write the programming on a game they are developing to meet the wants of the community?  The devs of this game stay in constant contact with us on the forums and have not once failed to meet a promise they have made. Developement was slow at first but now is speeding up since the foundation is complete. This game IS worth your time and money. While its not near completion just yet it is getting there at a steady pace now. I personally have bought games on steam that the devs don't keep the community updated or leave the game broken and basically give up. If your one of those players who have had a similar experience  I can asure you that this game is different.In fact I can promise you this is the most active development team I have ever seen in an early access game. Please Help support Games Foundry and buy this game. It will be an investment well spent.			"

								I come back to this game more often then any other game- I really like it, and it keeps getting better and better- many updates- Dev's have stayed with costumer's the whole time' and they even emailed me when I failed to read the update information- which is really nice- it was my fault cause I didn't know I could chop my own wood, eat berries it pays to read instructions- I think this is my favorite game and I remodled and played hours in the editor, making roads and deleting roads its simple to use.  I have changed bridges from flat to bridges with rails, I remade all my peoples with firey red hair,I put berries around the water fences rockeries. I wish sandbox army training was similar to the game, I believe this will be coming soon. I have enjoyed this game so much, I love the cute little houses- the artwork is beautiful designed. The Dev's are helpful and with the game always- this really shows that they are always completing more and more- its a village of adorable little peoples and can design and place things anywhere I want-  in the sandbox mode. I am looking forward to a new Ice world, and I love this sunny world the very most. I have had many games in early access and none have been so involved as Folk Tales or updated as often. This game is loved and cared about and alot of passion and time has been given to this game.			"

								Got the game today, have been keeping it on my Wishlist for over a year.Haven't watched much before, didn't know too much about it at the moment of purchase.In short, if you like the Settlers franchise then this game wants to be in a similar category. Of course with some Warcraft (not World of Warcraft) RTS elements, such as champions, fighting, loot, etc.But the ""economy"" is similar to what Settlers is.PROs:- Inspired by Settlers (probably)- Smooth building mode- Interesting ""tree"" of buildings and upgrades- The start phase of a new game is much more enjoyable than it looks like.CONs:- Sandbox has 3 levels of difficulty, one map per difficulty, so only 3 maps. You can't just start a game with a different layout and try to build it out. You always know the exact starting location. That's boring. Personally I think that a simulator like this needs a random map generator.- In Sandbox mode you need about ~30-45 minutes to have all the buildings and some of the important upgrades. After that there's not much to do.- Some people complain about the rate of updates. I have 5.6 hours on this, that's 2 sandbox games (unfinished, there are no victory conditions). Was it enjoyable? Yes. Does the game feel like a good product? Yes. Does it have great potential? Yes.Would I recommend buying it now? No.			"

								They've still got a ways to go in development, but the game is GORGEOUS.  I guess you have to like the lighthearted style; but for me, it's actually the game I've always dreamed of!Cartoony; humorous; deep citybuilding economy; full freedom of camera(you can look up at the horizon); full micro of each and every one of your citizen's gear/posessions; non-instant building placement; pre-gunpowder-tech combat; huge(ish) environments; a campaign story with character role-play elements; Eyefinity friendliness; I could keep going.  I LOVE THIS GAME!If you're a conservative buyer, at least track it's development; as there isn't MUCH gameplay yet; but with every patch(roughly monthly), they add a little more to the economic chain, and there is combat and level editing coming along nicely, also.Every(?) Sunday the main dev gets on twitch to show off the progress they're making that week, and just hang out with the fans.  This is one of the games that truly show that the publisher model is being pushed aside, and we're really starting to see a true renaissance in gaming.  If that's your bag, pick this game up only to help assure this funding model stays around; and let this game see the light of day.TLDR:  Buy it.  It's good.			"

								So far, I've enjoyed the couple of forays into the Folk Tale world. I like the concept and the early gameplay is acceptable, for the most part. There were some continuity issues, IMHO, in the early releases that kept me from reloading the game for a bit. I've read the dev blogs and see that there are some improvements that truly sound interesting. I'm looking forward to having a bit of time to check out the updated version. I also anticipate future development for this game. I definitely recommend giving it a try, especially since the Steam Autumn Sale is offering a premium price.

								Folk Tale takes many great elements from other games (Warcraft, Stronghold, etc) but does not improve them or bring anything fresh to the table.  I purchased Folk Tale when it was barely playable, and after several year it is still very lackluster and mechanically weak.  I still have high hopes, and I would love to recommend this game, but for now it's got a long way to go.			"

They have added many new features since I last played, and I'm looking forward to acually playing the game, and (hopefully) see more big updates soon.			"

Early Access Review
								Dear developers!You have something here that is very, VERY promising. I ripped 5 hours straight last night and the game flows very well. The gameplay is very addicting, the soundtrack and voice acting is also on point. However, I have some things I was annoyed with. 1. I could'nt see that buildings where upgradeable until the 4th hour or so. The indicators in the sidebar showing upgrades, research etc are just way to dark, so I did'nt even see them.When I started upgrading, I had a much easier time to keep my villagers happy. 2. The Quest list is blocking the view of the inventory. I had a hard time seeing everything.3. The hero is very weak. I had to bring a party of 12-16 soldiers just to stand a chance.4. There is no settings for controls within the game. I didnt realize you could turn the camera until I played around with the keyboard. 5. The camera is very, VERY close when you reach higher altitudes on the map. You need to be able to zoom out more on those heights. 6. The mini-map. :DBut these are all minor flaws in an otherwise VERY promising game. It feels like the perfect spiritual sequel to Warcraft and has a perfect blend with Diablo infuences. I'm looking forward to see this down the line, and I will keep supporting it.			"

								Folk Tale: Coming along nicely!Having been a causal player of Folk Tale for some time now I'm pleased to see it is starting to make some real progress in terms of gameplay and expanding the stability and playability of the game. A great atmosphere and active town building keep me occupied. Previous point releases of this game have not lived up to my expectations, but recent updates are beginning to bring it together into a well designed, clever and entertaining game. Still very early days, however I feel the development of this game is proceeding well. As of March 2015 it's starting to take shape and will keep me coming back for more. Well done Devs! Keep up the improvements and you will have a masterpiece of the genre on your hands.			"

								Its a mix between village builder and rpg,its not a bad idea but its poorly executed.It wants to be both and ends up being nothing.Rpg element of the game is just boring and seen it 100 times before,while the village builder is actually quite nice but there isnt nearly enough content to keep you entertained for more than couple of hours,much of the things arent still implemented and there simply isnt enough complexity with the building aspect.Also the game is poorly optimised.It is an early build bla bla,but its in early build for couple of years now,so unless you want to wait for couple of years more this is what you get.Its overpriced and poorly done.Would not reccomend.

Early Access Review
								I first purchased this game as ""early access"" in the VERY early days of it's availability, and quickly ran out of things to do. In fact, I used it as an example to others for why not to buy in to early access games.  After recently DL'ing it to check out how far it had come I was very pleasantly surprised.  While the team behind it is obviously very small, and still has a ways to go before a full launch, the game is already very fun and has all the elements it needs to be an extremely well received title.  *When* it's finished, I'll definitely be recommending it to my friends who enjoy RTS/city-building games.  I see that the reviews are showing up as 'mixed' and I can only assume that most of the negative reviews are from the early era where (like me) they were dissapointed at how little content/progress existed for the price asked.  I hope those people give the game another shot, as I have.			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased this game in May 2015, and have followed its progress each week. This is an updated review from the one I wrote shortly after that.One thing I must say: The development progresses constantly, with what appears to be a goal of polishing as it gets done. Nice work!Positive- It has a full editor to make lots of worlds, and dungeons that you can play in, or share online for others to play too!- There are 100's of free items to build with to make amazing looking worlds or dungeons- The game looks really polished and reminds me of Fable, with its hand painted artwork approach- If you play the tutorial, it is like a 3D version of a city management game, with crafting and building upgrades etc- You can move the camera anywhere in 3D, even following the peasants and workers around the village.- The game has been balanced, and is enjoyable to play.Negative- There is steady progress in the development, but it might appear that features are not moving along in strides.SummaryBuy the game. I did. Why? To give this producer/coder, and his army of artists and other helpers, a bit of cash to hopefully in some years, get to a point beyond alpha. He has a great idea, and the helpers are doing what they can to support him. With a bit more cash, they might succeed and I really hope they do.Also, if you buy the game, you get the sandbox tools (which is built into the game) for free, with 100s of items to build with and decorate your dungeons or landscapes. There is also an included visual script tool to make spawns, and quests and NPC dialogues. Its like a free game maker even inside this game!			"

								It's a city-builder. Well, more of a village-builder, really, in a high fantasy setting. You're (hopefully) building the human settlement that could withstand the onslaught of monsters and what not. Though, buyer beware, it's early access, in alpha stage, and overall far from done. Unless you're okay with alpha-testing games, I advice waiting.Charm and humor has already been implemented, and of now, it's a good small game with clear ambitions of becoming a great large game. It's promising, both in the good and bad sense.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Followed game since before release and through patches since release. Very disappointed; game is incomplete. I purchased this game on the day of release; I followed it before it was even released on Early Access on Steam. Since then, I have kept my eye on the game as it rotted away in my Steam library. As a gamer who grew up on RTS, RPG, and Simulators, this game should be everything I desire in a game. It has so much potential; it breaks my heart in its current state. Yes, this game is beautiful. Yes, this game has endless character. But it is so very incomplete. It's early access, but that is no excuse. It has been almost two years now since release. We deserve more from this game. I would hate to see this game wind up alongside games like DayZ, known for sucking consumers in during Early Access and then providing a flop of a game. I cannot recommend this game, as much as I'd love to. If things improve, I will gladly and wholeheartedly change my review, but until then, it's a thumbs-down from me.Edit #1 (Aug. 29, 2016)I've given this game a bit more time to develop. The new campaign seems to be developing a feel similar to the classic Warcraft III, but with a good sense of humor. The characters are funny, with some references here and there. I can see a good story developing from this. Unfortunately, everything still feels clunky, even after so long. The music score is good, as are the voices and the writing. The gameplay itself is lackluster. Many features are simply unavailable, and the core gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. If combat is going to become key to the game, more combat-capable units are needed. The first part of the campaign pits your hero and some militia up against units that are far superior and will simply crush you, leaving your hero dead over and over again. The building ideas are good, and seem functional, so not much to discuss there. I'd like to see a few more facets to flesh the game out, and I know the sandbox mode definitely needs more work. I'll keep checking back every once and awhile to see where things go, but I cannot change my recommendation at this point.			"

								I look forward to the development of this game being completed. I will edit my review if/when that happens.EDIT: The developer of Folk Tale commented on my review suggesting the experimental build. Allow me to elaborate the reason for my review.I liked the concept of the game when it was on Greenlight over 3 years ago. Your optomistic imagination of a thing will usually outshine the actual finished product. So, I voted for it on Greenlight.After it came to Early Access, I watched it for another year. Development appeared to be stalled at one point, then regular updates resumed. I purchased the game during a sale, anticipating a steady update cycle to release.A year and a half has passed since that time. According to the production schedule on the developer's website, the majority of listed items in future versions are already completed. Perhaps the game will reach 1.0 fairly quickly, and will actually release in 2017.But the game is currently missing basic featuresEDIT: List of missing basic features (not including factions and maps, which are not part of the basic game mechanics)- Mechanics: Unhappiness, Anger And Revolt- Buildings: Carpenter’s and Carpenter- Buildings: Crooked Cauldron and Witches/Warlocks- Buildings: Jeweller’s and Jeweller profession- Buildings: RoadsI do not want to play it as an unfinished game. For this reason, I DO NOT recommend it to any other customers.			"

Content is always added to improve gameplay through patches, so that players always have something to do. Again this is not the finished game yet so the game will improve.			"

								If this is the first Early Access game you are thinking of spending your money on then I advise you don't. As others have mentioned this has been on release now since May 2013 and nothing has made it to alpha testing with the community in regards to game content. The playable content that exists will not exist in the final release as its a tutorial for the campaign based game which is not being built. So the videos and the screen shots above do not represent this game. The developers have said that the content in the tutorial will be stripped out and some parts maybe used. So please don't be fooled. All that players can participate in is a vision of what sandbox will be, but you can do that for free anyway ;)			"

								First off let me say that this game is in Early Access and has the potential to change over time from what my review is saying (6/2/2014). This game is by far one of my most highly praised games among all of the ones I own. I personally do not rate games highly unless they either have great potential and are living up to the expectation, or delivered on exactly what I desired and sometimes more. This game while in early form, has a great location editor and sandbox foundation, as well as the development team is transparent with the community giving us updates on the game's status and what we can expect. While many people rated this game down, it has come a long way from what it used to be, with more frequent updates, blogs, and responses to the community. I have never had to wait longer than 3 hours when I posted in the forum asking a question or making some form of a comment. This game has been delivering on everything they promised and continue to listen to the community. I would highly suggest this game if you are even remotely interested by what their vision for the outcome is!			"

Folk Tale is an Early Access game in Alpha Development by Games Foundry Limited.  It is a Sandbox mode City Builder which includes combat, events and will have quests and adventurers.  It will include not only the traditional city building but strategy and role playing elements.The Location editor is currently available for those who enjoying making maps and they can be uploaded on the forum for others to play.  The World Editor will be added in the future making it possible to connect up different maps for questing.  These are the same tools the developers use for making their maps and is well supported by Games Foundry.There are bugs and glitches which is to be expected in alpha development.  Community supporters help with testing and making suggestions.  I find being part of this process great fun and a good learning experience.  The save/load feature is not officially enabled but there is one available through the consolePeople often post on the forum asking whether they should buy or not.  I recommend this game to anyone who  enjoys city building in an open world with free play.  It is still in the early stage of development and game play is limited.  Each patch which comes out monthly adds to the game play.  Games Foundry provides monthly  blogs on the progress of the game and the developers are very responsive to the community answering questions and suggestions.For information regarding the progress of the game please check out the developers' Roadmap.

Early Access Review
								I want to take a moment to comment on 'Folk Tale'.  I have been watching since it first appeared and became extremely interested in it after watching some videos and visiting the developers' website.  I wrote a comment before I purchased the game and then waited til it was playable to buy it. Folk Tale is an immersive City Builder type game,  but with a twist of RPG and some of the real-time civ games I've played.  I really like the game overall.  It has great graphics (which are not my main point of interest), a deep building system and plenty to do while you're waiting on new villagers to arrive.  You can craft, battle, follow a guy or gal around and watch them work, lash the workers into a working frenzy, and even research upgrades on each of the buildings you've created.I cannot end this comment, however, without bringing to attention a few bugs I noticed in the most recent update--the experimental build which came out on Saturday.  First off, before this latest version, the battle system worked flawlessly, but now, I notice that not even Sir Gregory can damage the foes (like the goblins outside of the human woodland area or even the bandits at the beginning of the campaign).  This makes the campaign-mode unplayable again and further makes it lose some of its greatness in the sandbox mode.  I would recommend that the developers take the time to fix whatever could be causing the issue at once and then release another update (so I can kill things again!)   Also, the new happiness system is pretty cool.  It is MUCH BETTER than the old repeated warning about food supplies being low and such.  The only thing is, with the happiness system implemented, it is difficult (nearly impossible) to keep folks happy at the beginning of the game.  By the time you build a farm, a fishery and send a person off to gather up berries, the people are already leaving because of low food supplies.  I would say the easiest fix to this problem would be to change the amount of food each villager eats when they are hungry.  I know you can alter the 'rations' meter, but it just isn't enough to keep folks around.  Besides, making them eat less than they want to automatically makes them mad.  I even went as far as to give them extra amounts of firewood to offset the issue, but I could never draw in the new villagers I needed to make the town continue to grow.  Anyway, I really love the game and will continue to watch for updates.  You guys are building a dynamic game here.  I know there are nay-sayers, but I think it's coming along well enough and offers quite a bit of humourous detail to offset the small downsides to the project.			"

Early Access Review
								When I saw this game I thought it would be an amazing fantasy type strategy/sandbox game, sadly, due to the bugs, lacking of content and poor execution of its key features to a degree this game was a disappointment which has heavily made me turn away from Early Access Gaming. Yes it is in alpha, but as other critics have clearly pointed out, it could have been much greater by now in all senses. My most annoying problem with the game wasn't the bugs, but instead the heavy lacking of interactivity due to the poor camera system and interactive features which were essentially non-existent through my play through. The video made it seem that the villagers would come to life and fill one with a sense of realism in the sense of the town which in turn makes everything more meaningful, but there is very little of that. You barely interact with people, no personal conversations or quests, just stats and names and the randomly generated chat sequences with other NPCs that pop up. My only nice point about this not yet finished game is the art. It is the only immersive thing about the experience of this early access title that is  worth any looking into, but yet, you don't have to buy the game for that! Just go on google images or dwell in the images above!My rating is -2/5, 24%, 2/10 and I'd only recommend this game to the developers so they can look over this poor excuse for a game and entitle it a time waster. I'm sure as the development progresses it will be indeed better, but it’s not worth its current charge, simply get it when it’s finished.(My own opinion and this information is related/valid through my personal play through with the game)			"

								I was about to write a long review about how this game had potential but nothing materialized after 4 years. I will just summarise what I think about the game. Camera angles don't work very wel, the controls for your heroes/peasants are extremely limited, buildings are extremely hard to place as some terrains will bar you from building anything, it gets a little crowded  so buildings cant be built too close to each other. Combat is simple and easy enough but you can't attack en route. I think this time I have given up on this game, 4 years in and still in early access. There should be a timeline how long a game can be on early access before people get their refunds. Not recommended.Review from 5th February 2014I'm a patient person but I've had this game for almost 7 months now. Although, seeing the videos of their progress and blogs on upcoming content, it has taken too long for them to release any of it. I understand it's in Alpha stage but there hasn't been much changes aside from the map editor that I don't use. It's a great game with great potential, I love how they are always communicating with the gamers but they better release something because I didn't pay for a broken unfinished game. Those who want to play this game should wait for the full release (if it ever gets released). Not recommended until the full game is released and playable.			"

The trailer is skillfully cut to make the game look better.Right now i can't tell if i have been fooled and invested in 1 hour tutorial, or if this is going to turn out good even with such a bad start. I think the developers should relese more contet asap, just to prove that they are still going for it.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR : I would not recommend this game for its low replayability, and painfully slow development speed (alpha for.. 5 years now. What they are doing with the money from sales? definately not hiring developers). Despite the developers campaign to improve its tattered reviews on Steam, they only seem to reply to reviews and havent actually addressed any of the issues, and are now only breaking up patches into smaller segments.The combination of a medieval city-like building game with that of an RPG style is a great and unique spin on the conventional strategy game, introduced by developers who bring a fresh new perspective to the table. With a great genre combination, and an overall awesome concept- the only aspect that truly disapoints is the execution.In its current state, replayability and game functionality are low. The game is quite easy (even on the hardest map) and only takes 2-3 hours to have seen it all. I understand it is in very early development, but the game as remained in an alpha state for years now. The response to it's players complaining of a slow pace was to seemingly split up its patches into smaller patches, all composing of bug fixes. I would like to recommend buying this game to support the development team, but it may just be trying to fuel a fire that has no oxygen left.If you buy this game, don't get me wrong you will have fun for a few hours, but thats it. You still have a ways to go before playing this game with all it's features and content. I'm obviously no game development expert, but I do not at all feel this game will be finished Early or even Mid 2016 (Make me eat my words please!).			"

								As the other reviews on this games page, I would absolutely not recommend this game.Also just as the other reviews, I've had this game since it hit steam. All it had then, was a tutorial. Guess what.ALL IT HAS NOW. IS A TUTORIAL. The game was like 20$, and I absolutely can't say I got my money's worth out of it.Please, go spend your hard earn money somewhere it's more deserved. Like Rust or something.As to the devs of this game ; Please pull your heads out of your♥♥♥♥♥♥and get something done.			"

								This is my first Early Access game and it will be the last, I bought it around mid Aug of 2013 and so far only minor changes has been made. I played again today before I wrote this and they still had the same bugs on the tutorial (which is only one you can play atm), advisor tells you to right click the villager and its really left click and clicking on your mini map doesn't move you to that location etc. I would recommend this game when it is COMPLETE, but not right now. Reason being too many empty promises, developer's blog (Who cares!) all they are doing is giving false hope. I am not saying the idea and the concept of the game is bad, but its not going any where and I don't think they are going to make any major changes any time soon. If you are reading this and having difficulty making decisions rather to buy or not buy, just ""wishlist"" it and check back on it time to time, check the news, updates and don't bother with the blogs. Hell I can write a blog about how I kick the cat because it left me a nice steamy present inside my shoe. "

Early Access Review
								After 2.5 years I figured I'd give this game another shot. Old review at bottom.I'm not sure what the developers have been doing for the past years but the changes are very unnoticeable. A boring campaign, generic heros and... the same 3 maps as before. The heros are not customizeable except for gear and become repetative and dull to play very quickly. Building a town is frustrating as most resources do not replenish (or do so at a very slow pace?) so to keep playing in sandbox you have to rebuild your town over and over again until the map is empty. The enemies in sandbox are not challenging and there isn't much replay value in the campaign.Core mechanics are still missing, such as multiple saves that you can name, random map generators for sandbox, and siege. All of the examples were things that were promised to be in development over 2 years ago. Kudos for the game still being developed at all but even in ""Experimental"" the game is light years behind worth recommending except to my worst enemies. Old Review:Horrible early access game. I've had it for half a year and there hasn't been a single PLAYABLE update. While the concept is great and IF it should ever be released it will be a great game. However it should never have gone out to the public in this state. All you get is 1 little tutorial level that is nothing like the games final goal. Not worth paying for at this time.			"

Early Access Review
 **DO NOT BUY** I purchased this game over two years ago. I was originally supportive of the concept and art work. I played the game for a few hours until I ran into phases of the game that were clearly not fleshed out and so I put it on hold. I was very much looking forward to playing the COMPLETED game. Since my purchase, almost nothing has changed or been added. The only things that are being worked out do not address the fact that the game is not finished. For example, why do we need more monsters if it is almost impossible to have enough resources on the map to have a functioning economy. I highly suggest you make the resources respawn.Now this whole time issue is frustrating, but it sounds like the developer is one guy; therefore, I really shouldn't be so critical. The reason that I am furious and give this a double thumbs down is that now this game wants the players to MOD the game?! Are you serious, we are baically being asked to purchase a video game and then build the levels. This is nonsense and should not be allowed on Steam, but of course, Steam does not care about where their royalty stream comes from. Only that they get a few % off suckers. In conclusion, this game is never going to be even remotely completed.You have been warned.**EditI have recieved numerous messages and threats from people, clearly, affiliated with the development team. GO FIX YOUR GAME and stop harrasing people who feel cheated for purchasing your sub-par product.			"

								I've been hungering for a game like this. A city management/rpg hybrid. Like if Banished and Warcraft had a lovechild.The game is in early access still, but so far plays pretty well. I love the overall aesthetic, and light-hearted approach to this. You're not going to find anything groundbreaking in terms of mythos. We have standard heroes, civilians, and creatures like orcs/wolves/spiders etc, here. But the originality lies in the merging of genres. I think it was clever to not break too many molds here: the familiarity makes the game accessible.I have encountered a game breaking bug, that seems to happen at random - is being ignored at the moment (unsure why. my guess is priorities)DO NOT LET THE ""MIXED"" REVIEW PURSUADE YOUthe negative reviews are based on issues that have long since been addressed and are no longer existent in the game.should you buy it? YES. This game is already solid and the devs have all but proven they're committed to the cause. This is a wonderful merging of genres that hasn't seen the light of day since ""Warlords: Battlecry"" (released 15 years ago)Pros:+easy to learn+great merging of genres+addictive and entertaining+your town IS able to become self-sufficient! (this is huge! and I hope they don't remove it. it's nice to be able to let your town go about it's business while you're off adventuring)+regularly updatedCons:-still in development (which is clearly stated but that still means it's incomplete)-once you've built everything, stabalized resources, and cleared the map of chests, there's not a whole heck of a lot to do (see: my suggestions)-the occassional bug-lack of depth in leveling your heroUPDATE: I have about 8hrs of game time already, which is great! I'm not too interested in the campaign, mostly the sandbox mode. I've done everything there is to do in Sandbox mode. The only thing hindering this game's experience is a lack of ""stuff"". My Suggestions:-More playable heroes (desperately)-bigger/better sandbox maps-caves/dungeons-random town-threatining events-some sort of wizarding or magic academy. train magic users for battle or even helpful things like enchanting crops so they yield more for a while, summon wild creatures so your hunters have a plentiful hunt, etc-maybe the ability to build ""wonders"" a la Civilization - a large, beneficial structure, that's very resource heavy but helps the town or your hero a great deal.-town notice board where citizens can ask the hero for assistance (basically a quest generator)			"

								3 years out and this game is finally beginning to look like something worth playing. I used to make a Warcraft III mod/map that is basically this game (city builder RPG), but this game does it much better. It still feels like an alpha, but now with the campaign and everything, it's really looking to be something. Progress is steady, somewhat slow but picking up. Now all we need is the ability to conquer other regions...			"

								Was excited to see what the Devs and artists had done for this game so got myself a early access release. Bugs are minor, and the community seems to be giving feedback as and when issues occur. While the game mode is still largely unplayable at the time of writing (in that there's not a hell of a lot to do or any clear goals), I've enjoyed the tutorial levels and little bit of messing around I've done so far. Art style and storytelling is incredibly charming and gives one a sense of nostalgia for world builders of old. So far the difficulty curve seems rather steep, but I don't think its fair to make any comments on actual game play until this game is complete - which looks to be a long way off. Looking forward to playing this once the scenerios and game is complete and would recommend people giving it a play.			"

								This game has incredible potential.  RTS City building  RPG is brilliant! If you played Age of Empires where you can place buildings anywhere/anydirection, CIV for the in debth city maintaining mechanics (happiness, research etc..), and Dawn of War for the wicked charater custumization (gear, stats, skills).  Now picture this in one game... ladies and gents... Folk Tale *trailer plays*.  The closest game I can think of that compares to this would be The Guild 2 and that flopped like a fish out of water, but it could of been grand.

								This is an EA game that has great potential. A huge sandbox style world with multiple maps and some good features. The devs are active in the community and listen to feedback. So much so, they rewrote the base code to allow for free form placing of buildings instead of a grid style placement. This set them back a few months and once that part was finished the game has gotten much better. 3 thumbs up from me.Curious where the 3rd thumb came from lol.EDIT:::: So after a long hiatus from the game, i have come back to check it out and boy has it gotten even better. There is a really nice tutorial now that will teach you all you need to know to get started. The game play is smoothed out and I do believe that the potential mentioned long ago is being realised and achieved.At this point in time, I am glad to have supported this team as they are making a fantastic game.

This game was created for early release on 2013 and with no release date what so ever, has some looked at the calendar? I'm starting to think that this game is just out to get your cash.

								After having cleared out all of the initial maps, I can say it was worth the $15 I got it for. I hope development continues because I really would like to see what it's like as a finished product.By ""clearing the map"" I mean establishing a stable economy, setting up the villages defenses, and then taking a team out to explore the entire map and clear out all enemy camps.I enjoyed solving the puzzle of stabilizing the economy, but once I found a formula for it I was able to recreate it on every map. The pattern I used on the easy map also worked on the medium and hard maps. The differences were that the resources were less conveniently placed from one map to the next, so the village was more spread out. Also, as maps got harder, enemies would attack from more directions and in larger numbers, so the point where there was a bear den that continually spawned bears right in the middle of my village on the final map. Nothing a dedicated crossbow tower couldn't handle though.At the moment, enemies are pretty weak, and only pose a threat to non-combatant villagers. Once soldiers have half-way decent equipment, even the hardest of enemies are pushovers. The defense towers make short work of them as well. They can mess up your town pretty bad if you aren't prepared for their attack though. Hopefully the balance gets worked out here.While very basic at the moment, arming my soldiers, sending them through enemy camps, getting loot, and leveling up is always fun. There are pages on each character profile for (not yet implemented) traits and abilities, which I can't wait to see. Every once in a while an enemy would drop a weapon that is like 5x stronger than any others I could get, which was pretty fun, but further contributed to combat being easy.There is another map which shows a different kind of game-play. You start with only 4 peasants and some equipment and have to fight your way out of a crypt. It was pretty easy, but if monster balance and traits/abilities get worked out, I can see that as being another fun game mode. I can see the map editor mode being used to make fun maps similar to this one especially.I'd say I got my money's worth as is, but am excited to see what it turns in to. "

Early Access Review
								Overview:Stronghold 2 got herself pregnant, the father? She can’t decide if Warcraft 3, The Settlers, or Banished is the father, and she is only in the first trimester so it’s impossible to tell currently, but she does have a name already picked out for the child; Folk Tale.  Early Access:Currently this game is in early access. Why is this important to say when that should be obvious? Because there are those, ah hell who am I kidding, MOST “gamers” don’t know what the hell that means apparently.  Early access games can take six months, they can take five years, they might never be finished; picture it is like a kick starter but the dev is nice enough to give you free copies of their beta’s and alpha’s as they build the game. This is not a completed game and it may never be a completed game. A dev company can promise to “complete said game” but that is all it is, a promise, there is nothing legally speaking they have to do other than slap a “1.0” sticker on the game and walk away. People need to know that and understand that going into any EA game.  The Game Vision

The Game Currently (May 13th): Currently the game has a tutorial and basically what I would describe as “Beta Maps”, four of them, which take anywhere from five to ten hours each to really enjoy. That means you are talking about twenty to forty hours of gameplay if you just gave each of their maps a real shot. Don’t look at “how many hours” people have put into the game, many have put far more hours into the game than it says on Steam as for some reason the hours are just not clicking over correctly (offline mode possibly?). The three more sandbox style maps (Easily labeled on the side as easy/medium/hard) basically are set up just like most RTS games, you have a couple villagers and some supplies and build from there. Unlike most RTS games however (Other than Banished for some reason… for the life of me I don’t know why that game gets the reviews it does) Folk Tale currently does not have an “endgame”, ie. killing the enemy base, completing the mission, etc. Basically you build you city, survive and run amok as long as you desire/ can survive (ie. Banished) and that is that.Anyone who has played the Stronghold games will find this game strangely familiar, even the voice acting. The same style of walls, buildings, humor, villagers are not produced they just “appear” if you have the houses to support them and the happiness to attract them, etc. If I were to sum up the game currently I would say it is 50% Stronghold (Economy/Buildings/ Defensive Structures/Audio/Troops), 25% Settlers 7 (Economy Chains/Buildings/Villigers), 20% Warcraft 3 (Fantasy world/Combat), and 5% Banished (Possible sandbox?). (That’s a 100% right? Good…) If they threw together a random map generator and multiplied the map size by at least 3x this game would dwarf Banished in its content alone. The combat is vastly different from Stronghold, in favor of what I see as the developers taking a page from Warcraft 3. Instead of vast, vast armies you now command a smaller crew (with heroes in the works) that can all be personally equipped with gear and upgraded as they level up. I am assuming they will have a “Hall of Heroes” style building like Warcraft to bring your heroes back from the grave- hasn’t been implemented yet.The Problem:It is so hard to understand the minds and predict the mood swings of gamers today, I would dare say it might be impossible, and at the very least it is clearly the most difficult time I can recall- and I have been in gaming a long time. Call me sexiest if you must but when did gamers start acting like a bunch of girls thinking with their woman parts more than with their brains? Basically all you have now are angry fan boi’s- I know, I get in trouble for bringing this up over and over again, but it is just sadly the truth!- and all they do is evaluate a game or a developer emotionally and then damn the facts. This game is absolutely no different. You have a group of people who didn’t like “not getting their way” in a vote that happened apparently years ago and because of that one event and how it made them “feel” they grouped up and went to war, the game itself be damned “I just don’t like the fact I didn’t get 100% of my way when I contributed a drop in that bucket!” Looking at the facts, logically, with a clear mind, I ask “how could any developer making a game in early access please every single person who signs on and supports them in early access?” and then I ask “how would you make sure that the majority of what your early access contributors are asking for, you are providing?” and I dare say that you will not come up with a better solution than what this developer did- vote and follow the vote. So looking at this logically, with your head, I ask “why hurt much?” Why do “gamers” now go through reviews and upvote and downvote purely off of if they recommended or did not recommend, the review itself be damned? Why do “gamers” now overlook countless flaws, countless bugs, countless AI failures, pay to play/win/continue features in a game purely because “the developer… giggle*, is my friend!” (God, I am looking at you Banished/Creativerse) while at the same time these same “gamers” take dumps on games that have more content, less bugs, better AI, and no pay to play/win/continue features in their game just because something or someone “rubbed them the wrong way”? The problem? Gamers need to start putting the game first (Thank you Divinity Original Sin) and put their emotions in their purses, loyalty to a developing company be damned! (Who is Larian Studios anyways?)Bottom Line:So basically if you think you would enjoy a game that would have the combat and fantasy style world like that of Warcraft 3 while having the economy and base building of a Stronghold then I would strongly recommend supporting this game as I have not seen anything similar in years (Warcraft 4 is basically every modern day MOBA, no thanks, and the new Stronghold was a step back in every sense of “step back”) and I don’t know when or if you’ll see anymore. I have played AAA titles that were not as fined tuned as this game currently is, and those games have sold for over $50. The developers of Folk Tale are claiming that they are still a long ways off from where they want to end up- that should impress and scare most of us.  If you would like to see my thoughts on other games or movies check out my blog which you can find in my Steam profile or by google, search Ashley and Micah English. Thanks.			"

								I'd say the game's pretty good, reminded me a lot of Spellforce, but better, and less focused on military. I had some trouble keeping villagers around at the start, once they don't get what they want for so long they all just kinda leave and as far as I can tell it's impossible to get them back, making your village just, dead... Spiders were pretty much a plague until I figured out the walls you can place can have arrow thingies set up on the towers and that pretty much negates any issues the spiders once caused... The military aspects to the game certainly seem lacking right now that's for sure, but I love the style and everything.What's given of the campaign so far is short as hell, takes like an hour to get through if you're not focusing on building. Is it worth 20 dollars as is though? Eh... I wouldn't say so, not yet anyway, if you want a city builder type game I'd say go get Banished, if you want a RTS/RPG type game, try out Spellforce... But I think once this game evolves, gets bigger, etc, it'll be a damn good game, because what's here, so far, is pretty damn nice, worth supporting imo. Totally recommended to anyone that typically would consider getting into an early access game, for sure.			"

								Ok, this review will be short and will be a living review because as the game progresses things will change.  Would I recommend buying this game?  Absolutely!  Brings all the fun elements of an RTS, RPG in one game. Is it still too early in development?  Considering the game has gone through many iterations.  I believe the design, content and actualy game development has come a long way.  So, yes the game isn't 100% complete (missing features) but, def worth the price tag and on the right track.Some of my favorite aspects is the game has a Diablo, Warcraft 3 vibe to it.  Graphics are interesting and unique.  Factions might be limited but, I can feel they will change over time to have and have a more robust feel to them.To Be Continued			"

								I'm having a lot of fun with the game. The graphics are so cool, and the way the people go about their business...I just love watching them. Then you have the exploration with the hero side of it. That just adds more fun things to do. Quests, dungeons, fighting off intruders, etc. If you're on the fence, I will tell you that I definitely don't regret the purchase. If it takes a long time to add even more awesome features to the game, I hope they do it. It will just up the replayability value, in my opinion.The game is completely playable from what I've seen, and I've played it for almost 4 hours straight with no bugs, glitches, DCs, or weirdness at all. I was playing the campaign mode, mainly building and killing stuff all over the map.I love these kinds of games, building a town from the ground up and managing resources, keeping the people happy, and defending your settlement. With the hero RPG aspect thrown in, it's even more interesting. I've played many city builders, and I have to say that this is my new favorite.Highly recommended. It's on sale at the time of this writing, so pick it up and enjoy. :)			"

								It's been a long time and each time i open it up something new appears.It may seem like they don't care but all their effort is shown by how much it improves each time.I have waited this long and will wait longer for its finished product beacause Folk Tale deserves it.It's the tale you create with your own oppurtunities.

								Having watched this game for a while, I boticed that the reviews had taken an upswing recently, so finally purchased. Whilst it is an entertaining game with some very lofty ideals and far-reaching concepts, many of these have either not been fully implemented yet, or they need a lot of polish and balancing. But even as it stands, the game is playable and enjoyable, albeit frustrating at times. Yes, it has been EA for a long time, but this is a game slowly forming and maturing and can only improve with the more interest and input and backing it receives. I do recommend this game to others, but the biggest negatives thus far:* No in-game pause. There is a lot to do in the game, but it all has to be done in real time, and many of the micromanagement elements (talked about later) are left undone as you rush around, trying to keep everything going, especially in the early game. You can stop the game by opening the settings menu, but you're unable to do anything* Combat is very unformed. Without the pause function to regroup and refocus troops, you often find yourself throwing everything you can at enemies, with your heroes lost in the very early game, with no way (that I've so far found) to revive or replace them. Enemies also tend to wander in a little too often at times, often undoing lots of hard work.* Building placement and world interaction is pretty basic. Building placement is touchy (to say the least), with every building requiring quite a bit of space, or just refusing to go into places you would excpect it to go. So far, there's also no way to remove or add any in-world items beyong buildings, either. This results in a wide spread of buildings placed down with little thought, just wherever they'll fit; and with no roads and no decorations, there is little visual cohesion to help turn it into a real town.*Micromanagement needs to be dropped or nerfed until it's more fully-formed. The RPG elements of leveling up, making and finding better equipment, researching new things for buildings is great, but there's so much to do and precious little time. Did I mention there's no workable pause yet? Pretty sure I did. Defeating a group of enemies can result in some little bits of armor that your workers can use, or you can begin crafting armor and weapons for troops and workers, but these have to be handed out individually, piece by piece, a tedious process you quickly tire of. There seems to be no way to queue research for buildings and upgrading buildings can be a really expensive option for (at the moment) little gain in many cases.It sounds bad, I know, but I do recommend this game. It's playable, it's enjoyable and it is slowly coming together. Many other people have complained about the lack of a serious campaign so far, but, for my tastes, I would much rather they focus on getting the city-building and micromanagement elements streamlined and rock-solid, then they can begin to flesh out campaigns and really bring the RPG elements to life. There's so much potential here and the developers are moving in the right direction. I just hope they don't lose faith in the game before it's done.			"

								What a great start. If this is the unfinished copy I can't wait to see the finished version and I'm happy to be part of the process. Has all of the best ideas from RTS and city builder games rolled into one. I love the way you can zoom in so close and look at the details of the little villagers working. No pixelated or tiny people like simcity games. Think more of the details in Warcraft 3. Every single one of your villagers can level up and become a hero in his or her own right. Simple select one of your villagers, add epic loot taken from the local monster community and send them off to slay wolves trolls and necromancers in the hills. Obviously it is still early days and many features are currently not operational. But the game is still loads of fun as it stands.			"

								I would say this game has gone through some major changes since I first purchased in in Beta. I am leaving a positive review, but only just. When I first saw this game I fell in love with its quirky humor and easy to master game play. It was simple and the game ran well that way. A sandbox was the wrong direction in my opinion to take this game as other series have done it as well. A linear level based town building game in which you unlock new area's to expand your influence by completing quests would have been a superior game in my opinion. That said the curret build runs well and they are putting in a lot of work. I just wish I got the product I paid for and that the game hadn't changed direction in the way that it did.			"

								I have been with early access from the very beginning, and this game has ALWAYS shown such great promise. Yes the game is still in development, but it’s to the point now where it’s fun and challenging. The hard maps are hard, frustrating, and extremely addicting to play. The updates are more-or-less pretty regular and new content is being added all the time. I think what makes this so endearing to me is that the developers really listen to feedback from players and try hard to add suggestions that make sense and increase playability. So much has gone into this game that came in from community suggestions that it’s completely different from when it was orininally launched. When I initially downloaded it, sure it was fun… but after about 2 hours I had seen and done it all. But now that Sandbox is here and stable… I can’t get enough. Great Job guys. On a side note; I kinda feel sorry for the new people coming into game at this point. They will have missed the early “Tutorial” game and all the humor it held. But I feel certain it will be back soon, as there are still silly little things tucked away here and there in the game which promise copious amounts of jocularity to come. I highly suggest that if you join early access, you join the Dev Hang-outs and give feedback. You never know, your suggestion could turn a great game into something Legendary!			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game when it was in very early access, whilst the developers seem very keen and offer many updates on their progress, very little ever seems to get done. Have they run out of money? A key programmer has left for pastures new? I don't know, but what I do know is nothing much has happened in the year or so since I bought this. I have a horrible feeling my money has been wasted and I should have backed someone else.The game itself (what there is of it) is fun for about an hour but once you finish the tutorial there is little else to do, it looks like the recent update has made an attempt at a level designer but this itself looks amateurish and lacks any structure. Maybe one day this game will be finished, if there is then a demo I suggest you download that first before forking out for the 'finished' product.I really cannot recommend this game in it's current state, hopefully when/if the game is finished then I can update this mini review and wholeheartedly back this game, but judging on this past years performance I fear not. But time will tell, in the meantime I recommend Banished as it of a similar ilk but perhaps not as ambitious as this product and is of a far simpler nature.			"

								I've had this game on my watchlist since early 2013, and when it was on sale, I thought ""surely, it's somewhat finished now?""I did the tutorial, which worked, if somewhat wonky. The campaign took me about an hour to get stuck in; doors that don't open because the content isn't there, areas missing where I'm supposed to meet an NPC. Of course, the campaign can be the last thing to be completed, but the rest feels defective as well; a lot of micromanagement, weird controls and menus that offer no information, as well as useful information hidden away. Finally, I looked at the roadmap. The aspirations of the devs are high, and given the amount of time it has been in development with this little to show for it, unattainable. This is nowhere near finished, and will likely never be completed.			"

								[2016/1/1]Let's get to the point. The game has a lot of promise and potential. I love the concept, the art and the design, but it has not reached that potential as of yet. The game has the city building (basics) pretty much down, but lacks most of the RPG/RTS features and deeper management aspects as of the moment. Beyond that, the game doesn't have very much to do once you get the buildings built and supply/production chains established, which is why the game is not at its peak.I am still recommending it because I've noticed that the developers are very active, appreciative and humble, implementing user ideas/suggestions and being very open with their community. I also feel that the game has a lot of potential to be something great.			"

								I bought this game when it came out a long time ago, at the time I was quite disappointed with the game as it still felt like buying an engin without a car. I decided to pick it up again yesterday after reading the recent reviews. So far, I love it, the game is challenging and paced well, I played for 7 hours straight and did not feel bored even playing the sandbox mode. There is alot of potential here to make a good mix of warcraft 3 and the settlers games, and be vastly superior to both. That said, it is just that, potential. The game is still lacking pieces and feels bare at times but I see alot of promise. Based on what I have seen, the money I spent was well used.April 2017Coming Back again Later now in 2017 and I am still impressed. The game has been polished up nicely and is runing smoother. Alot of the problems I had with it when I wrote My initial review above  are fixed with a little new content added in. Its worth 20$ for an early access game, and that is more than I can say for any other early access game I have played.			"

								As many posts have mentioned, there is very little game here. I would not spend money on it until more progress is made, because all that is currently available is the longest, most protracted tutorial in history, and not much else. It looks nice, but there's not much substance behind it, unfortunately. $20 is an awful lot for what some people are defending as a ""tech demo"", one that you'll get the same 57 minutes of enjoyment out of that I did.EDIT: For the sake of context and continuity, I've left my original review up, but I'm adding an amendment...one that isn't for the better. Sure, they got a whole whopping one level finished in three years. They seem to have fixed most of the bugs, or at least that's what I got in the 0.4 hours I could stand playing the re-engineered game. By game I mean ""boredom simulator"" because in 40 minutes I was so absolutely exhausted by the the gameplay I couldn't continue. When you feel a sensation of actual physical exhaustion from a game, you know it's not headed in a good direction. Everything you do in the game requires such an annoying amount of micro-management that you don't even know what to do half the time. Requirements for many tasks have no real reason for their existence, other than it was some inexplicable choice on the developer's part to waste your time. The economy/building/research system is infuriating. 40 minutes was all I could stand of this, even the tutorial will kill your interest alone. Stay the hell away from this and buy Banished instead, which is a far superior and much less tedious game.			"

								This is really an amazing game. For people who like RPG, Action, Adventure, and building cities, this game is for you. Just note that it is in Early Access right now so there will be quite a few bugs and uneeded features. But aside from all of that, It is really fun to build a town, gather resources, upgrade structures, Battle against lots and lots of great enemies. Now, of course there is one huge downside to this game. As your progress, and as you build a huge and incredible Town, It starts to get boring. All of your structures end up being completely upgraded, everything is complete, and your end up with nothing to do. The worlds that players spawn in are only so big. they should be bigger though. Bigger worlds for building on, More enemies to take out, Stronger enemies to brawl with, More harder assults on your village from enemies. Everything becomes a bit too easy as your town becomes stronger and stronger.So those are my thoughts on the game. There are many ups, and many downs. But the game is still in Early Access so I can't wait until it is finished. I hope everthing turns out amazing in the end!			"

They were trying to build a wall at the time, apparently they can only do that from the side that faces outside of the city :/ (I also had a door in a different place they apparently had no desire to use). Appart from that, and turning a blind eye to the obvious pieces still being tinkered with, I'd say this game is shaping up to be pretty damn cool. Oh also the spiders ... I hate those damn spiders! You cant kill a nest without half a dozen queens making a bee line to repopulate it within seconds.

								As a map maker, modder and big fan of user generated content, I am very optimistic about this game and what it can entail. Looking at my hours played, this should be no surprise. Although it does not directly support modding, creators can make whatever they want of the game, be it modifying the city building, or simply create a standard RPG with factions, dungeons, boss fights and loot - completely skipping the city building aspect of it. Endless hours of fun definitely awaits.However, if you are just a player, content will be rather limited. Seeing as the entire campaign is going to be made in the editor they are giving to players. Then obviously the content has taken a hit and only 8-10% of the campaign is done (still some good hours though). You can randomize your own maps, pop in a couple of enemies and have fun fighting with them, but for a tailor made experience, you might want to wait a couple more months, wait for the campaign to be nearer completion or the integration and implementation of steam workshop.However, as it has developed, I am quite confident that it will live up to whatever expectations you might have to a game of this genre. if you are or have a little map maker inside of you, or maybe you want to tell a funny story, buy ASAP and start creating. If you are a player looking for a finished product, either wait for completion or grab the game when it pops up on sale.			"

								As a map maker, modder and big fan of user generated content, I am very optimistic about this game and what it can entail. Looking at my hours played, this should be no surprise. Although it does not directly support modding, creators can make whatever they want of the game, be it modifying the city building, or simply create a standard RPG with factions, dungeons, boss fights and loot - completely skipping the city building aspect of it.

								I have been hovering and lurking waiting for someone just like me to go ahead and buy the game, even though it's had ""mixed"" reviews for quite a while now.I have encountered only a small bug and it's nothing big, but the game is definitely stable, looks great and the audio is already smooth and atmospheric.This game in its current state (Decmber 2015) is definitely working, and it runs great.So far the mechanics are working well and the interface is welcome.  Lots of options but sorted properly.  I'd like it a little tweaked eventually, but I'm sure with time things will only look and feel better.Free movement and free building placement is where this game shines over ther rest.  I can allow my mouse to hover at the villager level, into a small fire and watch as my little guys move around.Black and White 2 was my go-to sim game for years because I had lost all my disquettes and CDroms over the years.  This game looks like all my faves (i.e. the ones listed in the description) but keeps me intrigued because of its freedom.  I hope the devs never take this away. I have not played much but I fully intend to.  I have a feeling that FT and I are going to get to know each other very well.Buy it if you're intrigued and ready to commit.  It's worth the cost.			"

								LOVE! I had to say I was getting mad at this game for waiting so long to do anything. At first the tutorial (like 2 years ago whew!)  was fun enough to buy. It was like Settlers 7 with a bit of on rails exploration. But unlike the massive steps back Settlers 7 took in placing things and game play, Folktale stepped forward and took the exploration off the rails and allowed free placement of buildings. You are going in the right dirrection!! I would say it is a mash of the the good old Settlers where you actually got to build your town, combined with a bit of Diablo-esk exploration and game play. Keep it up!			"

								Great overall building game with some cool ARPG elements like equipment management and unique heros. Graphics are nice for the look the game is going for and it runs smoothly. It's got a helpful tutorial that will walk you through setting up a small village and teach you all the controls. It's definately more of a building and town management game right as combat is sparse in sandbox mode. Only the combat I've seen is  the occational bear that wanders too close to my hunters and the rat men that were guarding the iron mine close to the starting point. I'm sure it picks as you progress, and the campaign has more fighting if that's what you want.My biggest complaint is villager management. It's easy enough to assign villagers to a role through the building recruitment dialog, but there's no way that I've seen to select them from the overhead view without just clicking straight on them. It's hard to tell who's who unless you've learned to recognize the outfits at a glance and equiping individual villagers is an outright pain in the you know what. The only way to assign villagers to combat is to box select them, which is not ideal as you may be sending poorly equiped villagers to die while your axe-weilding woodsmen and bow-sporting hunters carry on like nothing's wrong. I'd prefer to see a window with all your guys in it similar to what a lot of RTSs have or at least the ability to set groups that can be selected with a single button click. Again, though, it's in good shape for an Early Access game, and they update on a regular basis. If you like ARPGs and RTS games, I'd give it a shot.			"

								I'm going to try and give a quick review. DISCLAIMER: I'll go ahead and point out that I only have about 10 hours played on this game, and this game is far from complete, but I believe Folk Tale has a chance at being something great.Note that this game's developement has been very long and slow. It's unfortunate, but with small developers taking on big tasks that happens. I've definitely gotten impatient with this game's progress at times, but the one factor that gives me the utmost faith in this game, and its developers, is consistency. They push out a stable build about every month or so, and it bring content and mechanics every time. This game is shaping up, and it is starting to look very good.Right now the story line isn't fleshed out very well, so you've got a little bit of a city builder going. But the thing I find most captivating is that it is some sort of RPG-RTS-City Builder-Simulator hybrid. All of your townsfolk can level up and equip armor and items, making every unit you have unique. Then you have hero units that you recruit as the game goes on. Each one has different abilities (like rogues, healers, warriors, etc). You can give them gear as well. It's just a really cool idea and is improving all the time. There are dungeons to explore, enemies that try to invade, and everything between. The game is also visually appealing to me. It's not cutting edge by any means, but the art has that World of Warcraft kind of charm to me. The price of this game is pretty steep considering how much content is missing. As it stands you can get about 15 or so hours out of the content before you're stuck trying to find things to do other than min-maxing your units and town. But I recommend it if you see it on sell or you're looking for a game like this to get behind. If you're not looking to buy, I at least recommend following the development of this game. When it is done it's going to be very good.			"

The graphics, sounds and new take on this type of game feels very different and interesting to similar games and they are doing an absolutely amazing job. I cant believe its alpha to be completely honest as it even has tiny details such as a little screen shake when you zoom in on a wood cutter, cutting down a tree :) I cannot wait to see what the end game is like as they have absoltely everything they need to make something really fun. Best of luck to the devs you have made something really special here!			"

								Based on what I have seen and read from others, I went and bought this game last night. I like it a lot and am really excited about updates in the future, not to mention the finished product!Somethings that could be changed.(not sure if the plan was to or not already) save games... players should be able to name the saved game. Again, I know its not a finished product, but please implement this.Another thing I am not sure if the devs know it needs work, is the editor. Namely the character editor. All you can do is hit exit when you are done and this sends me out of the game completely back to my desktop. Bug? Known non finished product? Not sure. I personally dont like the respawning of the spiders next to my town. I have to keep a few town watch near there permenantly to deal with them.I play Banished and had always wanted some combat aspect to it. While FolkTale is a little on the cartoony side of things, I am 100% okay with this as its not stupidly childish or anything. This adds the Banished element of town planning with the combat element I felt Banished was lacking.But the game is tons of fun and has great potential. Really hoping they keep this going in the right direction! Awesome work so far!!			"

								From building nice bustling villages in lush green fields to fending off fiends in dark dank woods, Folk Tale has abeautiful combination of sandbox city builder and RPG. While most of its aspects do focus on constructing a small villageinto a town. It allows you to loot your fallen foe's and put there gear on any villager or craft some at your blacksmith's. The graphics are lovely, like Black and white 2 polished - 4/5The UI is easy to navigate, clean and doesn't clutter your screen - 4/5The content is hard to speak for as its early access. 2.5/5 for now. A lot of time spent on mechanics therefor level choice is limited. How ever the map editor available can change this is you are willing to invest the time. 5/5 potential content.overall 3.5/5 currently.			"

								If you like RTS games, I can recommend Folk Tale. It's a bit of both Warcraft 3 and Settlers. Warcraft 3 because it contains an RPG element and you build structures to gain resources but Settlers, because there's a little bit micro-management with your buildings and villagers.I watch the GamesFoundry stream on twitch every Wednesday and through that, I know they are constantly updating the game to become better. They also listen to the community and make changes if necessary.Which was evident from the start when the game wouldn't let you train female villagers into certain working roles, but people complained so they fixed it.As of this date: Aug/2015, there is no victory point. Meaning  you will play a map and it will simply never end unless you did badly. However, that'll most likely change soon.If you like to craft your own maps and give them out to a community to play, the game got a powerful and simple editor for you to mess around with. Steam workshop will be available for the game soon to facilitate map making and sharing.Finally, I would like to list some of my pros and cons:Pros-Fun game play.-Great British humor (Think modern Monty Python).-Excellent map editor.-Developers heed feedback.-Beautiful music score.-Heroes and villagers can level up.-Love the loot system and that you can give new gear to your heroes and various professions.-You can research upgrades for your buildings.Cons:-No end goal to a map yet.-Voice acting is a bit wonky and can be repetitive and annoying.-Sound design and foley is less than adequate.-No guard tower unless you build a wall which can ruin your village layout.-No story in the game, however, I know it is coming.-Professions, like the baker, will get flour and return it to the bakery and it'll automatically generate the bread. You will never see him make the bread which makes me feel like he should just be a carrier instead of a fully dressed baker.-While crafting is nice, it is a micro-management that becomes tedious for a large village, as you have to hunt down the house that can craft the item. It would be much better with a crafting tab that contained all the recipes.-You cannot set what sort of crop you want to grow until the field is complete. While minor, if you are pulled away from your field before or as it's being built, you might forget to set it to grow cotton and later on wonder why you never get any cloth bolts made. "

Early Access Review
								I bought Folk Tale at Alpha 29. I found the RTS part completely unbalanced as both settlers and soldiers alike are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to fighting. Melee characters like spearmen or the allegedly superior town guard can't even beat a couple of rabbits of the same level (no kidding) without major losses, and large numbers of them make little difference as collision boxes prevent (which is good) swarming a single enemy. Although I suspect major modifications will occur when game goes Beta, for now I feel like the only viable option for armies is going ranged (and kite or use terrain like rivers or cliffs as walls - since walls are out in that build) or mix (and use the melee as blocker cannon fodder).Playing a couple of games in campaign and survival mode I found out that some attacks are scripted and come from spawn points (which may at some point be right in the middle of your town). Beside the awkwardness of having some wolves spawning in the middle of your settlers and considering how weak all of your troops (including heroes) are, carnages often occur. Of course with a high morale, the losses of civilians aren't that annoying if you have auto-recruit on on your building, but for the useless soldiers it leads to you micromanaging them (as there is currently neither a rally point feature on the barracks nor the auto feature do produce anything else than the basic spearmen which you have to retrain manually).I also found out that monsters level up based on a criteria which I haven't been able to identify yet, but that I suspect to be town military strenght capacity, which may lead to game breaking situations (if you evolved your town too quickly comparatively to the leveling up of your troops and heroes, every unit will end up being one shot by monsters and - considering also the XP penalty for death - will never get a chance to level up and compete ever again) where heroes don't stand a chance to beat dungeons and where you have to kill thousands of monster with a swarm of arbalist (the only viable option) to get a chance to level your soldiers up to be more competive in small numbers). So you may find yourself in the dire situation of a very steep increase of enemy level when uncovering the fog of war of a new enemy (i.e. a spider nest) or going into a dungeon. That is a bad - and hopefully very temporary - design choice as players who will focus on upgrading their town and defense over exploring and expanding may end up in a situation where any progress is made impossible.I was at first very disappointed not to find walls, towers or anything that could actually make me compensate the lack of individual efficiency of my military units by using a bit of strategy. Alpha 29 has no walls. After some research I found out they used to be, along with several towers and, well, a major bug which may explain why they have been removed. Well, walls are essential and the new engineering turrets, while a cool addition, aren't compensating the huge necessity of having walls in this game.I was suprised that, having had Folk Tale on my wishlist since about 3 years now, the very good looking game was still so lacking in terms of polishing of the game mechanics and content. In fact, there seems to be so much remaining to do that this game may remain in Alpha for a couple more years. I understand that the scope and ambition of the game are huge, mixing all those genre from RTS, city builder, TD, RPG, MOBA, and it remains extremely promising (although as to be expected with such a hotchpotch that actually none of each element has any depth in it - i.e. the economy, while having some illusory layers of complexity is absolutely unchallenging and is extremely linear as you will always build the same things in the same order starting with one or two food sources, clothes and then mead).Still Folk Tale may end up being an entertaining game with more than decent appearance and sound (the atmosphere of the game sadly is déjà vu and overexploited for medieval cartoonish games, but that may only annoys you provided you are a veteran gamer) if it ever get finished with its actual ambitions. Considering how slow the development process was till now (despite the fact I have to acknowledge that besides the obvious placeholders and temporary features, there is a lot of polish in that game) it would be hard to believe that the final product is going to become some kind of reference unless many many years of work (or an increase in this studio's output) are assigned to this project.In its current state and considering the history of the product, I can't heartily recommend it. Though as the steam review system do not allow me to publish a neutral review, I'd like to be clear that if you understood the ambitions of developers through my or others lucid reviewers comments, if you understood there is little chance that when it will finally be released the game won't achieve some legendary status in terms of depth, strategical options and challenge (despite your settlers dying like flies) and is very likely to just be a very polished jack-of-all-trades game then it may be worth supporting, provided you are patient, or buying on release.

								Even though Folk Tale seems like it's been in early access forever, you can now start to sense that this game will achieve greatness when it does finally release (officially). The latest builds really make it easy to recommend the game in its current state. If you enjoy city building games like say Banished, you'll probably immediately fall in love with this game as it does more than just the typical city building things. You get to build armies, quest, loot, craft and more. Which is what drew me to the game in the first place. Games Foundry have done a great job thus far with the game, and hopefully their hard work will pay off in the end. :)

Early Access Review
								I bought Folk Tale a while ago and have not played much, about 6 hours. While the game still has a ways to go, I am confident that Games Foundry will produce a very good product. Why? Because they pump out regular updates, take the time to listen to their players, and use surveys to find out what their investors/players want! They are a very pro-active company and I enjoy the way they are approaching this project. Their player-relations are also very good. Multiple times I have asked questions on the forums and have recieved rather swift responses! The game is on the right track, even though it did have a bit of an early turn around from a story-based RPG to a sandbox based RPG, where I can understand some players argument that they are not recieving the game they invested their money into. However, they may provide feedback to help Games Foundry produce the best game possible, because this company does listen. The best indicator of that is the fact that they made such a great turn around.Another something that I like is that they have a roadmap on their site, detailing and outlining what they plan on making. It helps regular players like me understand what is to come and increases our faith in the company. So with that said, I will be giving Games Foundry and Folk Tale a big PLUS ONE. Can't wait for the next update and keep up the good work!P.S. Defenitly more than one hour of playable content. No idea why people keep saying there is only one hour!			"

Early Access Review
								I got this game the second it became purchasable, i have waited a long time to play something other then the tutorial, but i am good at waiting so it never bothered me as i got plenty of early acess games in my library.Some allot worse then others witch in this case is a pretty good experience in telling whats good and whats not.This game has come a long way and are starting to become playable, while others whine about time i say take your time and make a great game.Folk Tale is a sandbox game, and at the momment players can use a couple of premade maps or and make their own and try and build a city.There are monsters in the game to kill and a couple things to craft but not much, and at the momment there seems to be loot and it can finally be equipped tho some of the loot seems to have no effect.So if you are interested in this game then i would suggest to buy it, but keep in mind that you are buying an early acess for the sole purpose of being able to support development and get to try out the game during development.If the price tag seems to much for you then i suggest holding off until more content are added.

								It looks good and it's improving, this is a game that tries to use Early Access to get players involved in development and to help pay for development, unfortunately a lot of reviews don't seem to appreciate this fact and just bash the game for not being a finished product. I've seen it improve drastically since they first announced it, they're constantly working on it and making updates, a lot of the negative reviews aren't even accurate anymore.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is early access and far from completed so bear that in mind when deciding to buy it.However it has a lot of potential, mixing RPG elements with RTS gameplay. The tutorial is very fun but hasn't been updated in ages, all the work has gone into sandbox mode where one finds the latest updates to the game content and gameplay wise. Visually it looks stunning.The game isn't really playable right now from my point of view, you can do most stuff you'd expect but there is no way to win sandbox maps for instance as enemies simply respawn.What works: building stuff, putting villagers to work, combat, equiping units, some economic chains, craftingNot done yet: saving the game, unit stats, food consumption, disease, balanceI don't regret my purchase, the game is promising, visually stunning and the devs keep us up to date on the progress being made on a weekly basis.Buying this game right now however is more about supporting the development of the game then getting a game you can already properly play and enjoy early. So keep that in mind when deciding to purchase :)You can also check their weekly updates about the game on youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa7W66RPP2X-BKPhhH1a4nw "

Early Access Review
								Whilst not entirely finished (as was expected with an early access game) I thoroughly enjoyed playing through what I have played so far.  The game has a uniquely quirky vibe to it and isn't afraid to poke a little fun at itself which I find refreshing.  I absolutely adore the art of this game, it reminds me of games like Fable, warcraft or torchlight but has a personality of its own as well. - Dec 2014UPDATED REVIEW BELOW - May 2015:Does this game have longevity potential to provide more than 8-12 hours of village builder gameplay?Currently I have over 28 hours played, 24 of those hours have been recent experience. I bought the game when it first hit early access and played the tutorial several times through. This game has come a long long way since then. It still has a ways to go, but the sandbox game has a lot of potential. The management of all the different buildings, villagers, resources, upgrades and trying to keep the villagers warm, fed, happy and healthy all serve to keep you on your toes while you expand your village and explore the surrounding landscape. This is a game that I don't tend to burn myself out on, It's a game that I keep coming back to whenever the GF guys add something new.With only 28 hours played you can't really call me a fan boy, that being said, I do enjoy this game and I expect to get another 100 hours or more out of it in the next year or more. It has great potential, it has great art design, great mechanics and a great feel to it. If there was a downside, I would say at the moment it is content. With only three or four maps currently available if you tend to burn through content you might run out quick. With all that being said, with 24 hours played on the new content I can honestly say that I still have a lot more time to give to this great title and I really look forward to seeing more from Games Foundry. http://www.gamesfoundry.com/gameguide/gettingstarted/Check out the gameguide if you are interested in the features currently available.

								Has a lot of potential, but it is still in Alpha and has a very long way to go.  If you want to check it out, its quite beautiful - but don't expect to find a lot there.  Much more here then there was 6 months ago.  By leaps and bounds.  However, this is still an ALPHA version of the game.  Expect a few hours of fun, not much else.  But, it is progressing very well - so hopefully someday we will have a wonderful game to play.			"

Early Access Review
A Surprisingly Fun Hybrid of RTS and ARPGThough still a little rough around the edgesFolk Tale is a pretty funny game. That's probably a good way to start off describing it. It is a tongue-in-cheek parody of many of the city builder norms, with writing that often breaks the fourth wall with self awareness, constantly referencing the player as a God named Bob. I wasn't outright laughing at any of the humour, but none of it was lost on me either, and the humour was just another aspect of the game that gave it its overall charm.Speaking of presentation, the game looks really nice, with a cartoon-like middle earth setting. The character models and building models all look pretty decent, if not slightly dated. That being said, I was pleased by the overall aesthetic of the game, as it all just works together.There's quite a bit of voice acting in the game, and happily, it's done excellently, with a Monty Python's esque gritty English to it. None of it sounds amateur, which helps to build on the immersion and the humour of it all.If only performance were as good as presentationThis game is still in early access, and from what I can tell by the negative reviews, it's been in early access for a long time, much to the dismay of many negative review posters. I would say my biggest issue with the game is that there is slowdown over time. I have a village with 130 some odd villagers. All of them are rendered, walking around, and mixed with dozens, if not hundreds of wild animals and monsters constantly walking around the map. Over time, the game becomes more and more choppy, though I found saving, closing out the game, and reloading it made my FPS feel more solid. For the record, my computer is pretty mid-level, with a GTX 1070, 16 gigs of high performance ram, an i7 4770, and running the game from an SSD drive. I feel like my computer should be able to handle the game a bit better, but maybe performance optimizations will be the developer's last major step, who knows.On the bright side, the game didn't crash on me, in my 5 hours of straight playing, though, as mentioned above, slowdown became an issue. Ok, enough about that performance stuff, what about the gameplay?I haven't played the campaign mode, but I did play the tutorial first, then jumped right into the sandbox mode. I do like me some sandboxes, and this one didn't disappoint. Immediately, armed with the knowledge imparted on me by the tutorial, I set about making buildings, assigning villagers to jobs, and having my heros (you start with 2, and it stays that way, as far as I can tell) do some light scouting. I found myself quickly upgrading buildings, researching new technologies, and seeking out more resources to increase the speed of my resource gain. My only gripe with the map I was on was that there was only one iron mine. This meant that all my resources were gaining so fast, while my iron was a constant and annoying bottleneck.Still, that didn't change the fact that I completely enjoyed all building up my village and even bringing my heroes into two dungeons to experience the ARPG aspect of the game. Speaking of which, the ARPG aspect is pretty solid. You take your heroes into a dungeon, and you're suddenly in a new, smaller map, clearing the dungeon of monsters and reaping whatever rewards you loot from their corpses. It's not the best ARPG experience I've ever had, but it's certainly good enough to make me glad it's in the game.So, would I recommend the game to others?I suppose that depends on how ""finished"" you expect the game to be. I had quite a lot of fun with it for those 5 hours I played it. In fact, the time went by so quickly, I suddenly realized I was not going to have much time to sleep before work. I don't experience that very often, as I usually have a VERY hard time getting into a game. If you're ok with the price for what you get now, a very solid city builder, I would say go for it. If you want the fasted development on the planet, you might want to wait. As I mentioned above, there is a pretty solid negative review userbase that almost entirely laments how long the game has been in early access. For me, I already feel like it gave me the emotional videogame joy that I wanted out of it, and as I said before, that is not an easy thing for me to achieve anymore.			"

								It's not an awful game, but it's a point blank disappointment.  I've been waiting years for this game to have some semblance of what it was originally launched to have.  It's not an intensive game, it can't be that hard to develop new content for this.Another example of the steam audience paying some teams salary while they develop a game.  It's like buying a pizza that they let you smell but you can't eat it until it's done cooking.  That pizza takes 5 years to cook.			"

								This review will attempt to insight you, dear reader, about what isn't already obvious to you.Folk Tale is a fantasy city builder with dungeoneering RPG elements. There's loot and you get to assign it! Also it has a fantastic art style. At the bottom of this review you can find info on the games that inspired Folk Tale.The game is dedicated to being a sandbox & having a fleshed-out campaign. All of these facts give it very big boots to fill. The Good Lots of genuine potential. Everybody here gains exp & levels up! Woo! It's tackling a niche, if you're reading this chances are you feel drawn to something refreshing yet familiar Atmosphere is well crafted - both auditory and visually the game is beautiful. Build your town and raise your heroes & soldiers to glory, equipping them for scaling threats. Veterans of gaming, the developers have a clear vision but listen to the community Tools used to make the game are given to players, you get the same resources as the devs The modding community here could explode - parallels between WC3 and FT start to show :) Crafting Randomly generated items = this is not yet implemented!The Bad The game is Early Access, and it aims to be delivered by the end of 2016. And although I personally feel confident in the project, we all know of hiccups that can happen. There are a lot more features destined to be released soon, but it can be disappointing not knowing exactly what the full game will contain. The goods are a plus, the lack of clarity a minus.There's a lot of things on the plate right now, which means features get released but not everything already out is polished, you can really get frustrated at that - for example the UI needs some  updates. At the moment (and I will strive to keep the review up-to-date) there's not many hours of content to enjoy. Because the game has changed direction the updates seem patchy and can really be frustrating at timesThe VerdictOverall is it worth INVESTING in? Absolutely!As a game however - right now - you have to be willing to have patience. It's not complete and although fun, is brief.Hope that helps!-----------------------------------------Similarities-----------------------------------------The following titles I will try to arrange in order of how much inspiration they've served to Games Foundry:WarCraft IIIBanishedMore action orientated games (like DotA)			"

								This game has it in it to be a great city building, town similation game.But it's a bit more than that. Like any city building game you build things like farms and butchers and make little production chains to keep your people happy, and watch them in their day to day lives. thats the City building and town sides of it. But what really makes it shine is the way you start to really get attached to your people. Each charecter can be equipped and taken on missions so you start to feel as though you have helped each one grow, and will probably get favourites and the ones you don't like so much and this brings your little town to life. There is also a pretty cool editor which lets you make your own map and therefore your own folk tale story.This is an EDITED review, my last one complained about the Devs never releasing updates nor keeping us informed for a long stretch of time but I have to say this has been sorted to I am now recommending this game!

								Updated review:Updating now to change to thumbs up review, due to progress in development and attentiveness of game staff! The game ahs some ways to go with a few things being implemented, but for what it has right now it's a functioning playable game. You now have the option to save (one slot, though it won't tell you it's saved, it just does it) and you can continue later. The graphics in the game look beautiful for its style, and the villagers seem to understand (for the most part) what they are meant to do for their tasks. My only issue I'm having is constant complaints of sickness when I have everything everyone says you need to keep villagers healthy. The game is on its way, progressively with good updates. Worth a play. Previous review:At this time I wouldn't recommend the game simply for the fact that you still can't seem to save. It simply hasn't been implimented yet.			"

The building and villager mechanic are well implemented and easy to learn, and the resources are also simple and fun. THe only criticism I have is that the heros have no ai...yet. It may be that i didnt play enough or that it is not complete yet, but i did not like having to control my heros all the time. I want to be able to direct commands but when im not controlling they should just do their thing like villagers. this game has a lot of potential and i like what ive played so far.  two thumbs up5/7			"

Every time I was expecting to see it abandoned... but each time I was pleasantly surprised.I can only recommend you invest In Folk Tale if it looks like a game you may be interested in, these guys deserve the support, and the game is worth  the risk.

								This game will appeal to those who enjoyed:- Settlers 6: for economy (establishing production chains, using workers, etc); - Warcraft 3: for combat and occasional dungeoneering missions, visuals and day-night cycle.However, please note that the game is still in development, so certain features might be missing (like world map, for example). Content-wise it's playable. Campaign and sandbox are playable, but by no means are complete. Personally, though, I would greatly appreciate to see the seasons change. Basically, this game is what Settlers 7 should have been. Definitely recommended.			"

It got kind of easy once you get the hang of it (Expected that the raiding parties get more stronger based on population?).  Kind of clueless at first since i started at the newer version without the Tutorial listed as my option (Later found out that Campaign was tutorial... barely).  So I'll just bare with it for now. ~Will Change my review later based on upcoming updates/fixes.			"

								After playing a short time, I already enjoy the game. As an Alpha things are looking pretty good. Certain things need to be implemented however. I notice that the costs of buildings do not show in the tutorial. Same with training. Also My villagers can't  seem to equip anything. I do reccomend this game but it might be best to wait a while for about 60% completion.			"

Early Access Review
								Folk Tale, the Fantasy/SRPG.Now Ive had this game since literally the first day its been on Steam. The game is by GamesFoundry, a great group of guys who are trying to make this unique game come to life more and more with every update. Although my hours logged arnt that much compared to the others here I have played all through the maps and am currently playing with the map editor, so this gives me a refined base for the game.Lets start shall we?Graphics:The graphics are like that of the Overlord game series, but with less doom and gloom. The etxtures are simply wonderful, even close up you can notice small details in the armor of your population, the riffits on the buildings, the notches in the shields and so much more. While the graphics arnt on a serious manner, it gives the game a serious cartoonish feel to it without being on the Borderlands cartoonish side. I would  give the graphics an 8/10.Audio:The games audio is beautiful as it has multiple sound tracks and a bit more short bits of music for special events. This makes the game feel alot more adventurous and a bit more mysterious.Aside from the music of the game there is also the ambiance to the game. You can hear the frogs croak in the swamps, the wind howling in the tundras, and the trees swooshing in the grasslands. If you zoom to street level in your town you can hear people talking, music playing in the tavern, bees buzzing in the bee hives ect. It really brings the game to life and I hope they expand on this.I would give audio a 9/10Gameplay:In the gameplay aspect of this game it gets a bit odd but fun. The basics of the game are like any other, build your base/village, keep your people fed and happy, defend yourself, profit. While its very copy and paste in other games its very unique in this one. During the missions in the game while you build your village up there are creatures which come for your villagers heads during any point in the game. It may be goblins, toadkin, or spiders (The spiders are 1337). If you manager to survive the onslaught to get enough city guards and crossbowmen then youre set pretty much, as long as you use them wisely. A unique thing the guys at GamesFoundry are working on is a Faction system, much like in World of Warcraft, or ArchAge once you build enough reputation with 1/2 factions on the map they reward you. You may pick a hero from each faction that youre high up in while the other faction tends to hate you more and more, like your ex. But unlike your ex you can actually kill the faction that doesnt like you, or the one you dont like. Another cool feature is the items in the game are used on the models in game. An example is the city guard, just a man with a helmet, padded dress armor, and a pike. You can give the guard a bigger pike and the model changes, an axe and it changes, ect. Same with armor, although not all models work for changing pretty much all of them do. Of course there are restrictions such as guards cant use bows and crossbowmen cant use flaming swords, its still a unique feature that focuses on detail and I love it.GamesFoundry also said they are working on a massive amount of content for the game as well, hopefully sometime in the coming months the content will be finished for the many items they are adding and I can make another eview on more aspects of the game.I would give gameplay a 9/10If you guys enjoyed this review I would check the game out! Watch the videos here or on YouTube, read the forums, or if I compelled you enough get the game?  The game is updated very frequently as well, so thats always a plus to have the creators improving their work often.Comments, questions, concerns? There are forums on 'Should you buy Folk Tale?' as well as the 'FAQ' forum for anything you could ask. Hope to see you in the community :)			"

								THIS REVIEW IS FOR SANBOX MODE: I haven't spent much time in campaign.I don't usually review games as I feel that, unlike most other entertainment mediums, video games are grossly personal experiences.  However, I would like to say that I strongly recommend this game to anyone interested in city building and management type games.  The interface and controls are very intuitive once you learn the basics, yet still give you plenty of flexibility later in the game.  And, in my opinion, later in the game is where things get fun.  Starting new villasges on the other maps while your first village continues runnung is a fun challenge.  I also really enjoyed the RPG aspects such as clearing zones and leveling your hero/heroes, training up your troops and doing the basic quests, as well as looking for the other heroes.Again, I know games are very subjective in nature, however when a game is done right, I beleive the developers should be recognized for their work.  This early access game is on par, or better, than many of the ""full release"" games I've purchased.  If you are looking for a very scripted, linear experience, this game probaly isn't for you.  But, if you like crafting your own experience in a well made sandbox, I belive you will find this game very enjoyable.Sorry for long winded review, just felt that this developer deserved a thumbs up from a long time gamer, I'm an old man compared to most of you, lol.  Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy this game as much as I continue to do.			"

								This is marked as an alpha release I know that it is not intended to be a finished product but it is effectively unplayable.  It's more like a custom warcraft III map that nobody got around to finishing.  I spent several hours building a village with upgraded versions of all of the production buildings.  Eventually at a population of around 100 sickness will begin spreading and you will run out of medicine no matter what you do.  Your villagers will never be happy.  I made a fully upgraded monastary and tavern right next to eachother with a well and several beehives.  the monks stock piled thousands of honeycombs and produced mead far too slowly for my village even with 15 monks working and all research completed.  Don't try to make doubles of any of your production structures either if you do your villagers will inevitably be to far from a needed resource.  Villagers need to be in the area of a resources building to pick it up and if heir cottage is too far from say, the tailor's place they will be low on clothes even if the tailor has a stockpile			"

								This game has been up since 2013, and it has changed a lot, positively. The developers decided to change the whole aim of the game. Instead of an rpg strategy game, it has become a sandbox with strategy and rpg elements in it. I must say that I love it as the way it is now. Beautiful graphics, maps and buildings! The developers really are doing something great with this game! If you like strategy games with rpg elements in it then you should definitely buy it. Please note that most of the comments below are from a long time ago. I admit that in the beginning was not that great, but now it is! The developers earned a second chance and they used it well!

Early Access Review
								Let me start out by stating this is an EARLY ACCESS game. It is not a completed game and many of the reviews on here judge it as if it is completed. The game shows so much promise, and from what the devs have discussed/mapped out for its future...it will only get better. The systems in this game (even those not fully implemented yet) all meld together so well and make every second enjoyable. Whether you are building your very first building or attacking some group of enemies...it just captures your attention. To those of you that are complaining development is taking too long? Bah, take as long as you please Devs, this concept deserves as much polish as possible. I cannot wait to play this current build some more, the next build, and the finished game whenever that may come.This is the game I have been craving, a smooth mix between Fantasy RPG, city building, and RTS. If you like any (or all) of those 3 genres, check this game out. Just remember, every dollar you spend on getting this game now just quickens the process or allows more things to be added.			"

								It's refreshingly interesting on it's take that ""anyone can be a hero"" The term is literal as each and everyone one of your units can gain experience, level up, equip gear and become a badass. The RTS elements are standard with a very Settlers feel and the voice acting and scripting is top notch with clever one liners and interesting cut scene devolpments.			"

It is very easy to sit down for a short play session only to realize hours have gone by.  I love the fact that I am not stuck in a linear progression like story mode.  Another nice rpg like feature of folk tale is that you can level peasants by using them to fight npc mobs threatening your village.  Individual peasants may also equip armor drops or armor you have crafted.     Would buy again and recommend, great game!			"

								so Ive decided to change my review having messed around with the game. My old review was pretty annoyed at the fact that it was sold to me as a campaign based builder, and went sandbox. But that was a long time ago, so I decided to base my current review on what the game is now.My main issue now is theyve had *how* long to work on it and the game is still in E.A.? This game was one of the first announced E.A. games, and it was the first E.A. game I bought. That was in....oh....2013, summer I think?Thats a bit ridiculous. E.A. is not supposed to be for building a game from the ground up, as in ""Hey, I got this great idea for a game..."". Go to Kickstarter for that. This is supposed to be for near functional betas, that need a year or so of tweaking at the most. At least it does appear to be continuously worked on, which is nice.But enough of that. For what is there, the game is good if you like sandbox style city builders. Its just glaringly incomplete. Like even the tips on load screens have placeholders because they havent been implemented. And the game hung at least 3 times on load, seems really unoptimized. Theres a decent amount to do, but its hard to get into when theres so much obviously missingGraphics are excellent, think cartoony ""Banished"". The UI is very easy to use as well.This isnt a negative review so much as a withholding judgement to see what happens, but since Steam doesnt have that option I decided to write this review with a positive.Right now it has the framework of what could be an awesome sandbox builder. Kind of like when you send your guys to go build something and it slowly rises out of the ground. THe game's like that 3/4 built structure right now.			"

								This game has been on early access for two years, when i bought it a few weeks after early access launch it was already a fairly interesting game, the problem was that it was story driven, and content was only for a few hours play back then. In dialogue with the community they shifted the game more toward a sandbox game than completely story driven. The game still features many intrinsic story elements, which at release can be used to introduce the same story driven maps that were in the original tutorial map back in the day.I honestly like the way this game is going, and are looking forward to future updates. Updates come relatively often, and I feel there have been significant and helpful changes. I like where this game is going, but it may not be for everyone.			"

								I just want to say, this game isn't finished, but the devs are very VERY good at listening to people and letting the public preview their builds.  They seem to release major builds every 2-3 months, sometimes they let us preview them early to see what we think, then make changes.  These guys just know how to make a game for us.  What they are tackling is very ambitious, and I was worried at first if they could pull it off, but I'm confident they will make it happen.I get more of a settlers feeling when I play this game, although you can tell they deffinitely want to do more with the game by the time it's done.  If you want to support them buy the game, it's already good albeit small (still in development).  But it's a good game.			"

Early Access Review
								Updated Review:I bought into the early access for Folk Tale a year ago and I have never regretted my purchase.   Prior to buying in, I haunted their Steam forum for a few weeks prior, mainly due to the negative reviews on their store page, and the entire time I was impressed by how interactive and helpful the GF devs were on a daily basis.  There was a lot of animosity being leveled at them at the time because they did something virtually unheard of in game development and that was change direction based on the feedback they received from their fanbase prior to being Greenlit.  Whether or not one agrees with their decision, it's an admirable move because so much more often gamers are not listened to and their opinions fall on deaf ears.So here we are, a year later and even though Folk Tale is just a couple patches away from 0.3.0 (that's my estimate and I could be wrong), and that's the version the devs themselves caution those who want a playable experience to wait for, I am even more reassured than I was a year ago because I've seen first hand how accomadating and unfailingly interactive the GF devs are on a daily basis and I've been watching the weekly dev hangouts each Sunday since they first started and each week, I'm amazed at what they accomplish from one week to the next. Without a doubt, the GF devs are passionate about their game and it shows.  If you have even the slightest misgivings about this early access or just early access in general,  take a peek at the Sunday dev hangouts on twitch and keep tabs on it.  These guys go out of their way to make sure we know exactly what's going on in development.  How many other early access developers do the same?			"

								I've been following this game for quite some time with cautious enthusiasm and finally made the plunge and purchased the game a few days ago.  You can see an in depth play through and review at:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Rq0jnAyAkf1zjDhP60ARAKey Highlights:1.  It is obvious this is game is made by a Dev team that is passionate about the project and is looking to provide as polished and fulfilling experience as they can.    There are still some kinks to be worked out, but I can state that iat this point in the Early Access process the game provides a value that matches its cost. 2.  The Dev team has an easy to read/understand development timeline, and to date they have proven they can be trusted to follow through.3.  'As' is the game is fun, a nice  little way to spend a few casual afternoons, and certainly worth its price point.  A plethora of less passionate Early Access Dev's exist that would put a bow on this and be able to ethically call it complete.   I really look forward to seeing what can become of this project with this development team who seem to have the old ""Blizzard' mindset of ""It will be released when it’s done.""Bottom line:  Already fun to play, and has the potential to be an all-time great if the development plan is executed as briefed (it has been, to date).Very respectfully,Lil'Mac			"

								Considering the fact that it is early access, the game is ok. Lacking a lot, but ok. The bigger question is if it will ever fulfill it's potential. Graphics is good. Mechanics are good. The downside for me is lack of some realistic details. Like building slowly rising from the ground, instead of being built.			"

								Been playing this off and on since release. The original scenario was amazing and I think the devs are getting back to those roots. The latest campaign has similar elements to the release but a much more expanded vision for campaigning now. The addition of items and chacater development definately adds more interactivity. If you like city building and RPG I think you'll most likely get a kick out of this game. Keep up the good work and can't wait to see updates.			"

								If you like British comedy (monty python for example, or Discworld!) and love city sims and RTS, you need this game, even in Early Access!  The concept is sound and funny, the city management is fun and smooth, and the RTS aspects grant a change from just ""keep your peons alive or else you fail"" sims that introduces a lot of fun combat and (in the tutorial and in the future I'm sure) a great sense of humour and adventure to this game!Yes, there are unfinished/bugged/durped things, but this is Early Access.  For all that it is an unfinished product, you can still easily spend hours in sandbox mode or fiddling about making your own maps and challenges.GO FORTH AND MAKE YE TOAST!			"

Early Access Review
								Bernard, who had been recently recruited into the town militia, grabbed a shiny new helm and leather boots, before embarking on an adventure to reclaim some kind of artifact from a monastery filled with monk werewolves.  With one swing of his mighty halberd, Bernard barely scratched the first werewolf he encountered and was killed.  While short lived, Bernard rose from the ranks of nothingness to being a great knight and protector of his people.  Truthfully, he wasn’t so great, but nonetheless, he climbed from being a simple peasant to someone with tremendous potential, even though he never realized it.Much like Bernard, Folk Tale is a game with tremendous potential as it moves forward.  Before I continue, I want to remind everyone that this is an early access game.  Numerous features and concepts have not been implemented, bugs can pop-up anywhere, and the game is far from being completed.  It can be frustrating to see an icon that has no function or to open a building detail page only to notice several upgrades are listed, but none function.  If you are not prepared or have no desire and patience for an incomplete game, do not get this game.  Unless you would like to help fund the project, then by all means, purchase this game.   With that being said, Folk Tale is still an enjoyable experience if a fantasy city builder, with role-playing and questing elements is something that peaks your interest.  As of the current build, gameplay options include a campaign style tutorial, sandbox mode, and game editing.  The tutorial introduces the basics of building, economy and combat.  It is here that the RPG and questing elements are located.  The sandbox mode is what one would expect in that it provides total freedom to build your town without constraints or objectives.  This is the perfect testing ground to further learn the game and explore some of the currently available features Folk Tale has to offer.  And if neither the campaign inspired tutorial nor sandbox mode interests you, fire up the game editor and create your own content.While diverse gameplay modes and editors are great, it’s the core content that drives games into being worthwhile endeavors and consumers of our precious time.  Here is where Folk Tale has set itself up to shine.  From the moment you begin playing the game, the charming, fairy-tale inspired art direction and vibrant color palette catch and hold your attention.  The landscape and buildings come alive through color, detail and lighting (there is even day and night cycles).  The level of detail, whether it be a flower covered rolling hill, a waterfall fed stream with a pedestrian bridge, a newly constructed building or even a simple peasant, is visual treat.  While exploring the land, small, satisfying details are reviled, such enterable buildings that are alive with people and props, which make you want to continue on and see what else is down the road.  The sound is also on par with the great visuals.  The town is alive with the sounds of foot-steps, birds chirping, flowing water, wind and much more.  Once zoomed in close, brief conversations and dialogue from different peasants can be over-heard, much of it quite humorous.  The soundtrack playing in the background also does an excellent job of drawing you into the Folk Tale world with its whimsical melodies.Nice visuals and sounds alone are not enough to push a game into the realm of worthiness.  For that, there must be great gameplay mechanics and features.  With the present build, Folk Tale is just barely achieving that level.  Presently, a variety of buildings can be constructed and the basic economy system is up and running.  For example, you can build a mill and farms to harvest wheat, which in turn is taken to the stock pile to be stored and later collected by the baker so toast can be produced.  This system of intermingling buildings to produce a usable product is well received.  It’s no so overly complicated that excessive micro-managing of every aspect of life is required, but there is enough to keep you busy and engaged.  However, many other buildings and features, such as upgrades and research, have not been implemented in the current build, but the blueprint is there.  This can be frustrating at times, but as I said before, the game is still being developed and being able to see what is down the road is promising.One of the most promising and intriguing features are the RPG elements.  Going back to Bernard, I was pleasantly surprised when I selected him and noticed he was a named character.  In looking around the town, I noticed everyone, from the baker to the woodcutter to the barmaid, had a name.  While some where recycled, they each had a name nonetheless.  Beyond that, the foundation for character leveling, special abilities and inventory management was present too.  The farmers leveled up the more the fields were worked, the militia men leveled up after defeating enemies, and so it was for the rest of the working town folks.  Individual character Inventories could be accessed, which allowed for items, such as better armor or weapons, to be provided.  This in turn raised stats such as strength and armor, among other things.  And each different character, depending on their present occupation, had special abilities that could be activated.  For example, the town priest could heal units or pacify enemy units after activating some of his abilities.  Frustrating, many of these features are present, but not implemented into the current game build.  But knowing these will someday be implemented provides tremendous promise and intrigue.All in all, Folk Tale is a visually appealing game with massive potential.  It could become one of those rare games which successfully fuses different aspects of some of the most beloved game types into one cohesive unit all while still being unique.  However, time will tell as development is 45% complete at the present time.  Concerning whether or not you should buy this game, I’d say it depends to your level of patience with early access games and your interest level in city building, light PRG, and strategy gaming.  If you can deal with this game being a work-in-progress and have an interest in this style of game, then I’d say it’s a definite purchase.  For being incomplete and sometimes frustrating do to non-implemented features in the current build, I can honestly say I have enjoyed my time and can’t what to explore the finished world of Folk Tale.

Early Access Review
								Folk Tale is a game that had the potential to be one of the best city builders ever. The art was a fresh detour from the norm, and the RPG aspect gave the game a more active feel. It is because of these specific things and all the pontential that I'm sad to say: this game has no direction. When is say that, I don't mean it has no direction in the sense that it lacks an attainable goal, nor do I mean that it is akin to Minecraft--the game that made directionless fun popular; Folk Tale is somewhere between what the devs said they were doing, and what a niche in the community wanted. This game doesn't deliver an immersive city building experience--in a fantasy setting, because of an impotent AI that doesn't work half the time; however, Folk Tale also doesn't deliver on its adopted promise to be a great sandbox game, because it has a particular fantasy, RPG/RTS feel to it that requires a strong, immersive base to stand alone in the sandbox enviroment. Even when you ignore the broken AI, odd development choices, and lack of clear direction, Folk Tale still suffers from a start/stop update cycle that adds incomplete, often empty features; during my time in Folk Tale it was common for me to come across a menu option, or tab and be met with ""not avalible in this version of Folk Tale."" The worst instance of this came when I attempted to change the scroll speed in-game; I quickly discovered that the control menu didn't exist, but the menu tab for controls was present. All things considered, I can ignore the fact that this game isn't what I originally paid for, that it still isn't even close to being a true playable beta, or even that many pieces of the current build are either broken/barely working. The reason I can't reccomend this game is because the developers lied; the developers lied--and continue to lie--because they refuse to admit that they've messed up. The developers pretend  that everything is as it should be, and that the game is progressing steadily; the truth is that this game will likely never be released, and if it is will likely be riddled with bugs and unfinished content. Today I gave this game a final chance to impress me after waiting almost a full year for it to be developed more. Today I finally let go of any final hope that Folk Tale will be anything to me, but another reason I don't trust or wish to support indie developers.In my humble opinion I would not reccomend purchasing this game, even once released--if it ever is--I would strongly advise anyone to steer clear of it.Do not waste your money.

								The game is Early Access but unless you're really into this particular title, the actual gameplay is lacking. For $25 you can get a lot more gameplay out of other finished titles, before spending the money on (at best) 3-4 hours of Folk tale.The game has potential solid mechanics and gameplay, there just isn't enough present to warrant the price, unless you just want to donate for the games potential future success years down the line.

Tutorial map is easy and you get the hang of the game if you start on that map first, not like me who was all ooh okay load this easy one and try to figure out how to play.2. Village pictures are all bald men even for the women when clicked on Oo3. Rotation is pretty slow and clunky it takes foreeeeeeever just to turn the map around in order to see a different angle.4. Micromanagement is not fun. I do not want to keep lashing or rewarding my workers to keep productivity up, though I do like the research idea that increases productivity. Get rid of the Lash and Reward, keep the research.5. No matter how many taverns I put out to give villagers fun, there never seems to be enough fun and they all end up leaving the village cos it sucks. I even had all the research done on the taverns and that did nothing to help the situation at all.6. Sometimes it crashes.7. The storage house has research but sadly you can't do any of it, the same goes for the barracks you can't do any of the research on that either.Edit:After the responses from the Developers some time ago I have continued to play Folk Tale, and in addition I have also put out videos on youtube of me going over some of the points and gameplay. I can only say this game continues to improve despite slow progress, so far I've been doing the experimental builds and honestly like how things are going so far.Games Foundry also watch my videos for any points that I make, and have often left me tips and hings in the comment section to help me on my way.

								I was pretty harsh on this review when I first purchased the EA title... about 2 years ago.  I'll leave my old review up so you can see why this game has so many ""mixed"" reviews.  In that review, I was a bit upset because I hadn't seen any real progress towards the game and had just played the tutorial.  I recently gave it another go, based off of the devs suggestion that it has in fact changed and there was a lot more content. So far, I'm having a lot of fun with it.  It reminds me a lot of ""Banished"" but I feel I'll get more than the 40 hours game time I put into that game because it has some RTS elements in it as well.  I've only just begun playing the story mode, so I'll post yet another review when I'm finished with that.  Kudos to the devs for reaching out and suggesting there is more content.I will change this review when the final game comes out... or IF the final game ever comes out.  It shows plenty of potential... however the devs are extremely slow to release updates and it hasn't really had anything more than a few empty promises and a quick little tech demo.  Please do not purchase this early access title, as it is more of a farse to the whole Early Access system and a scam than it is a game in development.I challenge the devs to prove me wrong and finally release something... anything... that shows what they are doing with the $$$.

								This game may be cool in the future, but i have no idea why they released it alrteady. There is at most 30min of game play, and that is it, by far a dissapointment. I would not buy it until they have some content to it.			"

Early Access Review
								I was pretty harsh on this review when I first purchased the EA title... about 2 years ago.  I'll leave my old review up so you can see why this game has so many ""mixed"" reviews.  In that review, I was a bit upset because I hadn't seen any real progress towards the game and had just played the tutorial.  I recently gave it another go, based off of the devs suggestion that it has in fact changed and there was a lot more content. So far, I'm having a lot of fun with it.  It reminds me a lot of ""Banished"" but I feel I'll get more than the 40 hours game time I put into that game because it has some RTS elements in it as well.  I've only just begun playing the story mode, so I'll post yet another review when I'm finished with that.  Kudos to the devs for reaching out and suggesting there is more content.I will change this review when the final game comes out... or IF the final game ever comes out.  It shows plenty of potential... however the devs are extremely slow to release updates and it hasn't really had anything more than a few empty promises and a quick little tech demo.  Please do not purchase this early access title, as it is more of a farse to the whole Early Access system and a scam than it is a game in development.I challenge the devs to prove me wrong and finally release something... anything... that shows what they are doing with the $$$.

								It's beautiful. It's a city-builder RPG that plays like an RTS. It's Folk Tale.For a company with only 9 developers, only one of them being a programmer, this is amazing. It takes a long time for this game to develop, but it is already looking nicely. Artstyle is glorious, and the idea is great. They are focusing on gameplay now, and they are adding several gameplay enhancements and mechanics.The game still has a long way to from the time of writing this, january 2015, but I believe that they will get there and this will become an awesome game.Be sure to be watching the developer streams on wednesday (previously on sunday), to pick up the latest development progress and ask questions to the developers.Edit: To anyone wondering if you can save in sandbox, the answer is YES, via console. Look for the console guide on their website. It might say that it doesn't fully work, but it does work. In fact, right now, it's almost bug-free.			"

They are always there on the forums to remind people that, yes, this game is still being worked on. The updates are a little slow, but that's to be expected with this type of game.			"

								i do not SOFA KING recomend this game DO NOT BUY IT !this was one of the first green lit games ive bought, at first it looks promising and with many updates and features to be added later.....then 6 months pass by they decided to scrap the story line and switch it to sandbox like envrionment....now many many many months later itz on sale.....even though it says early access u should probably wait till game is completed b4 buying it.seriously they had this game on here this long and not much has changed u seriously think that after more time they will implement anything else? itz more likely they just gonna scrap this project and move to a new one.....DONT LISTEN TO THE POSITIVE FEEDBACKS LIKE:""oh how can you criticize a game in such early stages?!"" ""this is such a wonderful game!"" ^---ppl that talk like this probably work for da company or get some kind of incentive....if finally u really are considering to get this game cuz itz medival and funny....go buy dungeons 2....it at least have all those elements and probably better......ps: if u made this game i want a SOFA KING REFUND!

								Where are the RPG elements?.. let alone ""fully explorable building/dungeon interiors and an adventure-focused RPG component""?..Right now this seems to be just a city builder with an overly elaborate food system (several different types of food that give you satistfaction bonuses if you present a diverse, with different options for how to provide them, but apparently you should totally build out all of them and use them all because the tutorial said so.but! there *is* (in some configurations) this totally separate hero dude whom you can make walk around and kill things when you are bored of waiting for villagers to do stuff. And he gains levels for killing stuff! and then you can choose to assign a skill point! SO that's an RPG element I guess?.. until he inevitably dies from clunky controls (and OP poison) and you discover that you can also send hordes of villagers to do the same thing if you really want.Meanwhile for a resource management game, it does not give me nearly enough tools or information to 'debug' my resource flows. Made me appreciate Prison Architect that much more for its great tools for both micromanagement (e.g. following a prisoner/set of prisoners around and actually being able to discern bottlenecks) and macro summaries.

								OLD REVIEWNot at all. This game went from what I wanted in a village sim/adventure game but then they completley turned it into what I don't like. This game is why I dont but early access anymore. when I bought it way back when it was being pitched as quest oriented rpg/rts something that I was very interested in. Then they took out almost all of the RPG aspects then made it a sandbox games. Sandbox is cool and all, but as the main aspect of the game I feel as though I have been baited and switched. I do like sandbox mode on a RTS but I wanted a mission oriented one. Kinda like Tropico, Age of Empires, etc...NEW REVIEWEDIT: The developers have come around and completely made me eat my words. The RPG elements are back with a vengence and now you have the option to sanbox if you like but it isn't the full focus of the game like it was before, the game is enjoyable, good to look at, and fun to play. I look forward to later updates and putting more hours into this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, so my first review was on Feb 11, 2015. It was for a very different game from the one that currently exists. That game was essentially a tutorial that wasn't complete and couldn't be saved. And it got a negative review from me because of these things, and because of changes made that seemed to confuse the game's center. Now, however, the game is much more filled-out. I will note that this game is a LOT like The Settlers, most specifically the single Settlers game I've actually played through (6, Rise of an Empire). Not exactly a clone of the game, but definitly in the same general region of Sandbox-Campaign gaming. It's worth a play, even if it's far from complete at this time.0) Overall - 7/10 - Campaign is small but has a lot of potential if they can expand it across multiple maps and over about 12 more hours worth of space. Sandbox is fun, needs bigger maps. Combat is poor, but workable. City Building has some issues, but is overall a very fun and functional aspect of the game.1) Campaign - 5/10 - The Campaign certaintly shows promise. As of right now it's fairly short and seems to just be a number of placeholder missions to keep the Dev Team aware of what the campagn is meant to be. So while it has a decent overall plotline the campaign is short, fairly flimsy overall, and doesn't give you the impact needed for a solid game campaign. Hopefully this will be expanded as the game continues.2) Sandbox - 7/10 - I've just started playing the Sandbox mode, and so far I'm enjoying it. I won't lie and say it's perfect (it's not lol) but it is fairly fun and I do enjoy building cities and the like. They need to add some more features (roads would be nice, as would more types and teir of building) but for the most part the sandbox has no issues. [This is Subject to Change as I play through the 3 Sandbox Maps]3) Factions - 7/10 - The factions are rather unimaginative overall. Undead v Fae Folk. On the surface it's pretty bland, but if you look a little deeper you'll find that it actually has some decent points for both sides being in a Gray&Grey morality. Needs work on that aspect though - Greed v Self Defense doesn't leave much space for Gray&Grey. It would also be nice if there was a third factions (besides your own) that was fully neutral and could be interacted with. Finally, being able to create peace between the two factions would also be a nice touch.4) Combat - 4/10 - Combat is... not very pleasant to be honest. Heroes are hard to level up past a certai point, but by that same token there isn't any cost of losig a hero (or units in general for that matter). Training them doesn't have an expense, and you don't lose items when your units die in battle. If every time a hero died they lost off of their gear it would be decidedly more difficult and much more important to keep the hero alive. By that same token, if City Watch units died and lost items it would make people more careful about losing them. If that was the only issue it would be fine, however the inability for heroes to self-activate their special moves is rather annoying and leads to more deaths than is really needed. Maybe I'm just not good enough xD5) City Building - 8/10 - City building is fun. As a city builder this definitly ranks with some of the other games I've played. However, it is not without it's (rather large) assortment of flaws and weak points. The biggest of those is the complete lack of roads. Without placable roads that buildings lock to (which was/is my favorite feature in The Settlers games) city planning is a haphazard thing at best. With proper roads and road-locking players could build cities with a lot more planning and functionality than we currenty can. Another issue I have is the space needed between buildings. Granted, the games I usually play that are like this (TheSettlers & Banished) allow buildings that are rammed right up to each other and both have a well-designed road mechanic, but still. There shouldn't need to be enough space between two buildings to cram an entirely different building.6) World Map - ?/10 - This feature is only partially implemented, but oh boy do I like the look of it! If the world map does what I expect it to do, it'll enable more kinds of city, larger and smaller map sizes, and a dozen other cool features. I really hope that it means we will get to see a campaign that's spread across multiple maps with different types of landscapes and creatures to fight, trade, and otherwise interact with.7) Custom - ?/10 - Haven't tried this yet, it's on my list.

								I want to preface this with the game is very much an early access game, so unless you really want to support the devs I DO NOT SUGGEST BUYING IT YET.This is a very promising game in a lot of ways. When I first played it I thought ""yes, I can get behind this easily, so long as they fix the massive lack of features and bugs.""I'm rewriting my review to better reflect the game. Its an awesome experience, and the devs are on top of things for the most part. The releases seem rather slow in a lot of ways, or so I felt at first. Theirs a lot of key features that seem absent (managing your units is an awful time, saving has to be done through the console, etc). In reality, they are trying to flesh out the sandbox aspect, and in turn a lot of the basic things fall behind. The little things that make it easy to pick up and play (no descriptions for buildings, no explanations of why someone cant equip an item, etc). If you read a lot of the posts they are focusing on fleshing out the actual game, which from what I can tell plays pretty good. Just don't expect to jump right in and know whats going on, and spend a lot of time micromanaging and finding your villagers (which is the most frustrating part)			"

								To whom this may concern,I've decided to redo this review, a third time. This time, not because anybody asked, but because I felt the game deserved one for shot. So, here I go.The game is fun, it will hold your attention, and it has DEFINENTLY improved over time. This is, after all, early access. But of course, it has its flaws. I thought this game to be a waste at first, of money and time. But, maybe I was just tough on it. I found the game to be easy, but then again, maybe I'm just good. Folk Tale had a certain charm to it. But, this didnt mean it was perfect. I had trouble with alot of the controls, and the tutorial helped a little, but I was still confused. Now, after playing a while longer, I created my game. I had fun, for awhile atleast. Handled the placement bugs, the bears, yada yada yada. But, eventually, sooner than expected, I hit the point where the game is complete. I've done everything, only too easy. At this point, I stopped and, said ""Ok, that was fun for awhile"". Deciding that I didnt wish to continue playing. Maybe I just dont like the game, not my cup of tea. I would recommend to get this game, on sale, or to get it and, make sure you decide wether you like it or not before you've gone past the TIME OF NO RETURN (2 hours). But if you like Town building, or are able to just connect with your characters, I think you'll like it.If I could tell the dev team anything, I'd tell them to continue working hard. To keep adding and, adding. A few bug fixes, and some updates, and this game will certainly be great. Sincerly,Mastersimoligy			"

								""Village builder RPG"". I expected some sort of almost Sims management game. 3d Fallout Shelter. Something with some individual character depth, and customisation of villages.Instead this is snail paced Warcraft 3 campaigns styled game.-Collect resources, with a Banished level of needs and supply chains.-No choice of starting hero. And the enemies will outscale your hero, so you dont want to level him up.-The barracks requires a 4th base resource that is pretty much not needed anywhere else, so it feels further down the tech tree than is needed.

								Great potential but still has issues.  Reminds me of warcraft 3 - my favorite game.Issue #1 ... I have to buy shirts from market because I can't build the necessary buildings. Took me a 2 games to figure this out because everyone eventually left the village which is frustrating.Issue #2 ... The campaign got stuck when I went to talk to Nara. It created a permanant Willow character stuck at the throne room and an additional one that became playable.  I could get the antidote for the quest but when I returned nothing happened and the stuck Willow was still there with ""talk to Nara and return to Nara"" both remained unable to be checked off. Issue #4 ... If a non hero character dies any inventory dies with them.Issue #5 ... Many of the buildings and upgrades are not supported yet which makes balancing economy and defence semi difficult. Issue #6 ... If you craft weapons at the blacksmith for a proffession (in my case woodcutter) you are unable to unstack them. - I created 8 axes for 2 different camps (4 woodcutters each) and was forced to drop all 8 in the camp inventory. Additionally once an item is placed in a building inventory - it is unable to be removed while in use even if only 1 item on a multiple item stack is being used.Issue #7 ... The carrots harvest value is too low.  I had 6 fields of carrots with 50 population and couldn't keep carrots in inventory.Issue #8 ... Berries stop being able to be harvested as soon as you build any other type of food harvest building.Issue #9 ... I wiped out the camp of Tauren type creatures but they would randomly spawn an attack - either have them respawn in the camp so you can guage when an attack will come or eiliminate them once they are gone.Issue #10 ... Better defined use of gems, rings, charms etc... I can equip them but there is no indication of what they do. Same for many lootable items... spider webs etc .Issue #11 ... I chose to leave the goblin in the cage in Kenny's hideout but then it was permanantly there... possibly an option to come back and release him later. All in all a good game and I understand it's still somewhat in development. Hope this helps! "

Early Access Review
								I bought this game when it was in early access a long time ago and when the game was headed in a different direction, so the current incarnation isn't what I thought the game was going to be. That being said, I am happy with the direction it has gone in, and even though it is currently incomplete, it's still a pretty fun game.I've spent pretty much all my time playing the campaign and sandbox modes, so I haven't given the map editor a whirl yet. This game's primary focus is on village building, but all your villagers can be equipped with gear and called upon to fight, and everybody levels up. You can create soldiers and arbalists as your primary fighting force, and there are unique characters with special powers, abilities and gear. While there are plenty of enemies on the maps to make conquering it challenging, they do leave you alone for a short while so you can establish your defenses enough.The level of involvement is great and I can't wait to see what else they add to the game. Building placement is extremely flexible, only preventing you from placing them on top of other buildings or in rivers, on cliffs, etc, so you can plan it out pretty much however you want. Even in Alphas, the game is pretty stable and I have only experienced one or two crashes. Controls and UI are pretty easy to pick up, for it being such an involved game.My only possible complaint would be about the combat. It's cool fighting with the unique characters, since they have some special abilities, but at the moment, NPC AI is pretty bad. If there are enemies close enough, your villagers will attack automatically, so long as you don't click anything. Several times my melee fighters have let my ranged attackers get slaughtered, while they were moving from one mob to another, so you kind of need to direct them to each mob you want dead. It'd be great if there was an option to have them protect ranged units. These devs are pretty active and seem dedicated, so I don't doubt they'll be making improvements for a while now.			"

								Still way too bugged ,and with tons of performance issues. However its a refreshing game to spend a few hours caring about a town and a few fantastic quests. In this new trend of almost every game being absurdly lego-like or ""try to survive my conception of embiromental world""-game well its put a much needed faith in the gamers who are looking to an actual game wich can be enjoyed instead of topled.

								This game is good.  It still has some issues, but you can still enjoy it.  The devs post pretty regualr updates and but out blogs/videos to let the community know what's going on.  I had't played in a few months and playing over the weekend has made me more excited to see the final product.  Right now it's sandbox, I hope they bring back the story/campaign soon, but I'm beyond satisfied with what is currently available.  I bought it a year ago and still enjoy it, even with the bugs and only having sandbox.			"

Early Access Review
								I wrote a review for this game back on April 2 and at the time I did not recommend this game.  It was not due b/c of poor content or lack of updates, but I felt the game had not been developed enough.  To me, it seemed that Folk Tale was missing some basic features.  Now that I am playing it again a month later; I want to update this review.  In the April review I listed a few concerns/issues that I had.  There were:1) Lack of right clicking the screen to move the map.  2) Main resources not on the main screen.  I would have to go into menu system to view this important information.  3) Easily calling soldiers to the fight. Here is my update, plus a few things for a wish list.  1)  Even though the devs never put in a right click and hold feature to move the map quickly like in most RTS games, they did implement a ""shift"" function.  You still move the map with WASD keys normally.  To traverse the map more quickly, you still use the WASD keys but also hold shift.  At 1st I didn't know if I would like this, but I will say that this works pretty well.  I have been told in the next few patches they are going to refine this feature further to give the player more control.  (Will be able to adjust speed of the camera, etc.) 2) They fixed this.  The important rescores (wood, stone, iron, food) are all on the main screen, plus more.  3) This one is kind of sort of on me.  The game has yet to have a patrol function or a QRF button (quick reaction force, military term)  but you can group your soldiers to a number key and call them into battle that way.  One thing I did notice in my earlier review; you could only have 4 soldiers at a time.  At the time the game did not have an upgrade feature for the barracks.  As of now, it does and you can recruit more soldiers through upgrading the barracks.  The devs have really been listening to the community and this is a huge plus!  In fact, after I wrote my 1st review, I was contacted by them and they talked to me about my concerns.  Amazing!! For that and all the said updates, I am now ""recommending"" this game!  However, do realize that it is still in early access and it has been for a while and probably will stay that way till roughly early 2016 (per game page on steam).  Do not think that this is finished project.  It is not, and the devs would agree.  However, it is still a fun game.  Visually and audibly, the game has really set the bar in this type of genera.   I look forward to future updates and Dev Hangouts on Twitch.  Wish List:  I will update as more ideas and thoughts come to me.  Roads:  It would cool to be able to build roads in the game.  It seems like on the map there are lanterns and wall around that look like they should be on a road.  Or as you build buildings close to each other, maybe a road will automatically appear.  Peasants:  I am not sure if there is quicker way or not.  But having a feature where you can quickly find peasants.  I always seem to have to look around my town to locate them, when I want to manually task them.			"

								Wow.  Didn't expect that one.  I actually got the developer to post on my review.  I appreciate them taking the time. Just got major kudos from that alone. I still stand by my old review though. The game looks, plays, and runs well enough. These guys really seem to know what they are going for... its just... the development... its slow.  Painfully slow.  There is no other word I can think of to best describe these guys. I'll give a thumbs up just for them taking the time to contact me.  Thats definitely saying something.  Just wish things were faster on arrival. But I don't know, maybe it is because they are working on something big.... We'll see.... eventually. *Cough*  [For the record, I declined to talk to them at this time by, uh, not responding.] OLD REVIEW.Slow..................................................................................................................................................................................♥♥♥♥♥...................................................................................................................................................................................Developers.

								While I do recommend the game for what it is trying to acheive, in it's genre; I was somewhat dissapointed by it.The game is fun, don't get me wrong, but it is nothing NEW. A lot of reviewers say it's a blend of a city builder, RTS, crafting game, etc... well, simply put, it is not a blend, it is just a plain old RTS game that has been done many times before since the days of Warcraft 2. The city builder part is a complete joke. And while, yes, you do need to build it, there is no micro managing, or strategic placements and very light balancing; Basically just plop what you need to unlock, or sustain the resources that your villagers demand. I think my biggest gripe with the game had to be that each building has it's own upgrades. These upgrades seem very unique, with there own images (icons), and a breif description of what it does to the building. But in the end, all they do is produce a little more of the item you are making - nothing about what it really describes is unique. After this you realize the game is very simple.It a very appealing game, pretty graphics, gameplay flows nicely, and is fun if; you're young, or someone new to RTS games all together. But if you are looking for something that is truely something new that contains city building and some strategic gameplay, unfortunately you won't find it here.			"

								I'll give Folk Tale a recommend.I bought it during the 2016 summer sale, it's in a very playable state and gave me a few hours worth of fun I don't regret - for that - recommend. Below, rant.The campaign was an alright 3 hour of slow action.The campaign was a mixed experience, it has positives- good story, jokes, voice acting, and negatives- pointless running between the same locations, no challenge, the fact that the city building didn't play a role in the whole affair.The sandbox  is not a challenge, there are only 3 maps, and I'm afraid the difficulty instead of giving you more enemies is dictated by constraining your building space. Too much. It sort of fails as a city builder. And on any map, the special resources and random rocks are everywhere, it's difficult to build especially large buildings like the barracks. You don't decide where to build the barracks, you wave the mouse around the screen until you see green, then plop it right there. I wish there were waves of attackers (and not a spider every 5 minutes), perhaps raid sort of dungeons and all you could go to and run over and over for loot, with the heroes AND city watch or whoever you want to bring along (looking at you, campaign!). That'd improve the RPG aspect and give some replayability. There isn't much replayability, I built a city in the sandbox now, all the buildings are up, all enemies killed. The only joy is that one village of enemies is respawning, but they're oh so weak and don't move... I guess I'm done with the game. Hoped for a city builder to really get my teeth into.			"

								The game has alot of ambition and promise. The environment really stands out with its vibrant colours and very neat graphics and fluid animation. I kept a eye on this for a while since it first came to be 'Early Access' but never purchased it until recently from seeing people play it on Twitch. The detail the the characters are beautiful, especially when you play it on a laptop that isnt even meant for gaming. But it runs like a charm and even on low settings the game looks just as beautiful. Just to point out I am VERY fussy when it comes to games but this one definitely deserves positive feedback and a like +1. I havent been playing it for to long but I keep finding myself coming back to it and to tell you the truth I havent had this much fun since Stonghold 2 and The Settlers series. I really can't wait to be able to play the game once finished and fully updated. Speaking of updates they are really regular and the development team are doing a great job!. It is alot to ask for and it makes me seem ungreatful, but seriously on a level, I very much appreciate all the time and effort the team has put into this and I am one happy customer!. -Feedback-There is one thing I would love to see happen though, this being, more Hero characters in one town, maybe add a inn where you can choose to hire a hero or two from a range of 10-20 characters or even be able to fully customize the looks of the Heros. :) Keep up the impressive work guys!

This is the first game where I couldn't even finish the tutorial because it was that difficult.The campain is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the objectives are just distractions from the core civilisation management and doesn't feel very urgent or even funOnly reason I'm giving it a positive is because it feels very hard worked on and it has promise, lots of promise			"

								Both the sandbox and campaign games are fun. I've played a good few hours. The gameplay action is easy and seamless, whilst the depth and resource balancing make it fun to play. This is still early access so some of the elements of the game are not yet installed, which makes me think this game will become compelling (all being well). If you like townbuilding sandbox games this is right up your street. I like the graphics too, light hearted and a little catoonish, making it a relaxing but strangely absorbing experience. My guess is that this game is designed to appeal to the 'teens' and upward audience, but dont let that put you off if you are ...erm ..more mature like me ... I like it.			"

								The mixed reviews this game has gotten are a little unfair. The reason it is like this is because development is slow, they have a small team. Don't buy this game if you want a complete and finished product, don't buy any early access games if that is what you are looking for. That said the game is starting to get in great shape, but there is still a lot to be added. I recommend looking at their main page and roadmap for the game. They have massive plans for Folk Tale that will ensure a distinct and enjoyable game for those interested in sandbox rpg's, city building and hero development. The transparency with the development team is one of the best I have encountered, and they really are creating a quality game.			"

								The mixed reviews this game has gotten are a little unfair. The reason it is like this is because development is slow, they have a small team. Don't buy this game if you want a complete and finished product, don't buy any early access games if that is what you are looking for. That said the game is starting to get in great shape, but there is still a lot to be added. I recommend looking at their main page and roadmap for the game. They have massive plans for Folk Tale that will ensure a distinct and enjoyable game for those interested in sandbox rpg's, city building and hero development. The transparency with the development team is one of the best I have encountered, and they really are creating a quality game.			"

								The game takes a piece from many genres, RTS, RPG and Open-world. You have your peasants as your basic unit which you then promote or demote as needed to keep your city going. They can focus on gathering resources, resource processing, and combat. As it stands now the project has basic gameplay available - no resource processing yet but the buildings and roles are there just no logic behind them./workhat onAs an IT scrummaster, for a team this size working 2 years on this game it looks great. Some may complain about the lack of content up to this point but you need remember that first they need to build the world and they made some changes based on community feedback which causes rework of many of the upstream tasks, thus changing their plan. The more that support their development by purchasing the Early Access to allow them to increase team size, even with the time needed to onboard the new people it would increase their velocity.  They want their game released as bad as the rest of us but I'd rather them take a page from Blizzard's book and release it when it's done that EA that patches it when it's released. Great job guys./workhat offI've bought numerous early access games and this is by far one of my favorites. I'm looking forward to the continued progress and watching as the game fills in it's already beautiful world with both life and death.			"

								This is a game-changer and I - totally recommend - Folk TaleProbably the game i've been searching for since I gave up with all the new samey-samey stuff.I even reinstalled Warcraft III and Age of Mythology for some decent RTS play.Back to this game...I'd say it's a mash up of WC3, Clash of Clans, maybe even Fable-like graphics and just a  huge new nugget of gaming goodness. Yeah it may not be complete, but it's running pretty well and there is just so, so, so, so much potential here. I absolutely love this so far. I haven't come across any faults so far in my 3 hours of play, apart from one crash but I completely understand, it's in progress and little blips are a given.Really excited to have come across this game and that i'll be able to watch all the new additions as it becomes one of the best games I have played. Quirky, cute and just lovely.Honestly, great job to the small group who are behind this growing masterpiece. Like most people i'd have a couple of suggestions for additions, but you guys are doing a great job already.			"

								I fell in love with this game. Even if it is not finished, it showed so much potential as RPG and RTS. Graphic is perfect and story is really amusing with great dialogs. Developers doesnt slack and I am proud I could play this even in early acces. Also they are really communicative and helpfull. Campaign is not finished, but you can go sandbox or custom creations from workshop. You can expect at least 20 hours of play time if you would want to be quick and see all.I recommend this to everyone who liked W3, Settlers, Populous the Begining, etc.Great game.

Villagers are slightly above ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ levelMission content is still in progress I think or at least buggy as hell that I cannot progress because my characters get stuck in stone forever or isn't able to walk down a hallway for no reason...ContentContentand really just content.

Early Access Review
								I've only played sandbox.---- Immersion ----The game has some funny voice acting and generally very high quality artwork.  The UI looks nice.  The tone and artwork of the game remind me of Torchlight.  The voice acting was clearly done with as few voice actors as possible, some parts obviously the same person's voice - but they are really nice to listen to.  I would say this becomes a major contributor to making the game enjoyable.The maps seem to all be static (i.e. there's currently no map generator).---- City Building ----Growing population goes slowly, to make sure balance is maintained and people don't get upset and leave.  If they do get unhappy, a downward spiral can happen as resources are no longer available and more people become unhappy.  There is an initial learning curve for getting up to maybe 30 people (that felt like an accomplishment), and growth needs to be methodical and calculated to ensure stability.  Because of this balancing act, the city can also be vulnerable to the unhappiness spiral if there are attacks to key systems.Also if the downwards spiral leads to a ghost town (everyone has left) there's currently no mechanism allowing people to come back and starting over.Each building has a tech tree which pushes the anticipated game time out into relatively longish games.---- RPG hack and slash ----The connection between the hero and the town is that an army can eventually join the hero in fighting otherwise impossible opponents.  Weapons and armor can also be built in town.  This becomes a high motivation for enlarging the town, and creates the ""play a little longer"" syndrome which makes this game hard to stop playing.Each hero has special moves that burn ""special move burning delay thing"" (oh maybe it's called mana or stamina or a combo of the two: stamana... :)  lol  :)  I didn't bother reading the game manual.---- Customization ----Oh...  I almost forgot about this!  Modding capability in this game is through the roof, as they provide a full visual node-based programming system to control enemy or camera behaviors for generating cut-scenes and drama.  In fact, when I first installed the game I went straight to __the edittor__ of all things!  I was so excited to want to look at the system right away!Please look at the FAQ threads pinned at the top of the discussions for videos showing what it can do.  This means there will undoubtedly be continuous content being created by the community of players, and more than makes up for the lack of random map generator.---- Grinding ----For RPGs my favorite element is storytelling.  But you may want to cover your ears, as what I will say is not so nice - but after years and years of reading or hearing typical fiction, I don't much care for most pre-written fiction, including fantasy, and especially including canned RPG adventures.  There comes a point where it all seems so arbitrary and whimsical at the author's imagination.  The only storytelling so far in RPGs I've enjoyed are in <a different game> which is also a roguelike, and shows up in my list of games, and has the word waz in it...  But the stories in Folk Tale won't be generated at run-time randomly -- they will be the canned type, and that makes the game feel a bit grindy after a while.  I can already anticipate getting tired of it.---- Putin Jokes ----This always makes me a bit nervous.  Then again I am paranoid.  Then again, paranoid might have good reasons.  Nonetheless, it makes me a bit nervous.  But Gamesfoundry is based in England, so maybe there's nothing to worry about:  http://www.gamesfoundry.com/about/developer/---- Overall -----I found this on sale at a token discount, and checked Steam price charts at some other website which showed the game's price doesn't move much.  It's a fair price, especially considering the long games and the modding capabilities, and if you really love RPGs, this might be just right for you too.			"

It has been an enjoyable experience and I look forward to it's true release in 2016. I was unsure how much I was going to enjoy this game as the reviews are mostly negative... But then again all of those complain about the two year early access, and have two or less hours into the game.. Which is essentially the tutorial and learning the basics.It's an interesting game with a lot of varying dynamics and I look forward to the finished product that fixes all the minor glitches/inconsistancies during the play :)Enjoy!

								I just got the game regardless of Poor or not so good reviews, and I am one to say I will be MY own JUGE of a game, but reviews help me diside what I may or may not buy.In this case there has been a lot of Bad statements on this game for many folks, as well a a fair share of Good ones.Now I know peeps can say what they whant in most cases about games with no worries to the general public, But I would say I was hopefull for yet another good game that would help me Enjoy my little game time I have these days and with as little cost I have to spend on games. This game DID NOT DISAPOINT ME!Now Peeps can take what I say along with others and make up there OWN damm Mind! Or they can follow there gut feeling like I did and Diside on there own EH!As a little history from me to anoyone reading this here is my Gaming history in short,- I was 4 years Old when I got Intelivision and been playing games since..I am now 40 years old and a Gamer Dad!I have seen good games and bad games, Old Games and New Games, I have played FPS, MMORPG, MMO, RPG, Action, ETC. Now keeping that said in mind I can honestly say that this game reminds me of AOE, Pharo, Roma, Cesar & Others of that nature. I have always injoyed my Stratagy Games and RPG most of all and this game Is absolutly FUn and Injoyable to me because it follows them very close.Now that said, this game does need a lot of tweeking to become something GREAT and yes It will take YEARS to become just that.The DEV team work there Buts off to get this game to us and in hopes to be be proud to say they made a game that is worth buying and playing as well, lets face it WE WHANT TO PLAY GAMES!So From me to the DEVS please keep working hard and DON'T Give Up or Give in to little Pills that need to feed on negative crap! We all know you guys work very hard and try your best to give us what we all disire.Just one note, Fix Bugs before placing in new content as that is a Major Problem for many games out there today in there Completed state!As for all you gamers out there, Ither pay a small fee and I do mean small as in $25 or less is small. $60 or more for a new Xbox, playstation games are just nuts and they show us Crap most often than not, hell we all know that I and you have payed big on some games expecting this MOST OSOME game and turn out to be nothing more than GALMMER CRAP!We have become graphic spoiled and whant our $ worth. I know this because as I said I have been gamming for over 30+ years. So  when I say a Gamne is good take my advice and FOLLOW Your GAM|ING GUT and reserch the game before you buy it!, not follow some no name internet players advice! Judge a game based on what you like and how you like it but remember as Gamers we ask a lot but see nothing of the hard work put into it!DEVS keep chin up and GROW SOME Balls and tell players what you are willing to do and what you are not. A Great Story line in a Game Always sells and Never Disapoints. Stick to your GUNS and gammers will SUPORT YOU!Gamers Pull the Suther out of your♥♥♥♥♥and GIVE DEVS some Damm respect And learn to Make up your own damm Mind, DO some fliping reserch before you buy anything!Cheers all!

It is addictively fun even in its current state. This is one of those games I'm not just ""gambling"" on as an early access purchase. I'm proud to help support it.			"

								I've been burned by early access games before (looking at you, Doublefine) but I still don't regret buying Folk Tale.  Yes, it's been in EA for a very long time, but the devs are active and communicative and there are regular updates.  What's already there is still impressive and has a great cartoony-fantasy feel to it.  Progress is steady and it's fun to watch how the game evolves.  If you're on the fence, put it on your watch list, don't be scared by the negative reviews, and keep an eye on the updates until you're ready to try it.  I think this is going to be one of my favourite games once it's completed. "

								Well, not bad with what they've got so far. Pretty diverse selection of buildings and needs, plays sort of like the Settlers. They have, however, gone several significant changes in mechanics and city building over time (the tutorial itself is different than the rest), and a major negative at the moment is no saving sandbox worlds. Overall, needs polish and some core features like the campaign and saves implemented before you could consider it a game.I'd say wait for now and buy it when on sale for the potential it's got.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm really enjoying this game. I noticed it ages ago, so when it went on sale a few days ago, I took the plunge despite the mixed reviews. I'm glad I did. I can see Folk Tale becoming one of my all-time favorites. I've played city builders since early Caesar, and plenty of RPGs. The art is cute and really crisp. I love the look of my village, and the various looks of the upgraded buildings (only gotten to level 2 so far, though). I feel like I've barely scratched the surface, and am looking forward to getting into the RPG aspects more.I know it's not finished, but I have my own list of things I would love to see improved sooner rather than later:-- Labor management needs fine-tuning. There needs to be an easy way to list all the villagers, and see who is working where, so you can spread out the workforce the way you want it when there's a population downturn. Plus, It's virtually impossible to find your peasant. Yes, you can click on any building an see him or her on the left, as the lone unemployed person, but the Find button doesn't work for this person. Also, who is living in which houses? (Less critical, but could be fun.)-- The odd language choices confuse me. Yes, ""on nom nom"" is a cutesy way of saying ""eat"", but it looks like gibberish on the screen. Worse is ""very work, much happy"" which appears under every character's mini portrait in the building menu. Very weird -- it made me think the game was being made by non-English speakers, but the studio is based in London. King's English, people! Another suggestion: lose the ""some"" in the activity status -- because ""retrieving some bolt of cotton"" is grammatically incorrect and bugs.-- The buttons around an individual's portrait are confusing. What is the brain-like thing that has a dotted green line around it? I didn't see it mentioned in the Tutorial. Add the job title to these mini portraits -- they now appear only if you click on an individual's inventory. That's really tedious. I want to click on a person and see their job title immediately. -- It would be nice to be able to cycle through your citizens so you could quickly put extra armor and whatnot on them. Also, I'm tired of seeing the same guy's face, even for the women. He's not even cute.-- When a villager is sick, a green cloud appears around him or her, but there's nothing in their personal information that says they're infected (or what with, which would be a nice detail).-- Any chance of a time fast forward? That green expansion bar moves really slowly, even after you've corrected an error. It takes a long time for the changes to take effect. This is normal for city-building games, but most of those have pauses and fast fowards.-- I can't figure out a good way to use my troops. There's no real patrol function, since they don't respond to attacks unless you tell them to. I tried posting them on the borders -- that helped some, but they still seem pretty ineffective. Also, it's not clear (to me yet) how you can have both melee and rangers in the same barracks. Seems to be an either/or? I admit I haven't fully researched this -- I hope a future Tutorial will delve into town defense.-- I found some villagers doing tasks unrelated to their jobs? (Like harvesting carrots when they're a fisherman.) Is this intended?-- The resources totals at the top don't seem to go past 1000 -- even the town gold. I know I had more than 1000 coins, I just collected more taxes, but the number never changed. I'm not sure if I got credit for the money or not. I assume it's a bug and not a real cap. For another resource, iron bars, the inventory pane showed more than 1000, but the top bar didn't.-- After playing for awhile, and using the inventory, items show up as white boxes.-- What does the woodcutter do once all the trees are cut down? Supposedly I got some tree seeds, but I have no idea how to use them.-- I wish there were scenarios, ones that gradually increase in difficulty, like in Tropico or Caesar IV. And more building options (as in variety of buildings).I'm very excited by all the possibilities with this game. I hope it all comes to pass -- the city-building genre needs some great new titles.

								Still pretty early in the development process, but enough to have fun with.  I have spent about 8 hours on the beginner map, which still leaves me the medium and hard maps to play with.  I think it is worth the money and am excited to see the finished product.As of May 7th, 2015 you can expect to play as one race (human) and do sandbox city building activities, with some exploration thrown in.  Most of the RPG elements are still in development.			"

								I feel this game is in the right path, but so far there are many frustrating things. Maybe I'm missing something that I should know, but for instance the cottage is only giving me new workers when I save the game and reload it and after some minutes a huge army of weird creatures invades my village and kills everyone because I didn't have time to build any defenses. I'll recommend it because those Mixed reviews could destroy this project and I feel that the potential in it is huge. Please keep on the hard work!!			"

								I decided to ignore the negative reviews and bought the game while it was on sale.  So far, after the early may 2015 patch, I think it shows quite a bit of promise.  It's been stable, the graphics are plenty good for the type of game, and at this point, there's a reasonable diversity of buildings.There's several things that should be added (or, if they exist, pointed out where they are): - there needs to be a list of villagers so you can easily see how many of each kind there are, select individuals, etc.- soldiers don't seem to have a patrol ability.  Maybe that's not implemented yet?I'd say at this point, it's looking pretty decent.  If they can keep building on what they have, I think that they'll have a pretty decent game when it's done.			"

Early Access Review
								Written for 0.3.0Fair warning now, it is early access and as the game is of this writing its little more than a watered down version of the settlers series. That being said the developers do seem to consistently produce updates and have grand dreams of what the game will be, how they intend to be different from the settlers series is not terribly clear.Would i recommend buying it. Yes so long as you know what you are getting is far from a complete product.There is zero single player campaign and 3 sandbox maps of different difficulty.I am running Win 8 and only once have had a crash, aside from that the game has run flawlessly for me on max settings. There are major balance issues at hand and little to do once you have a established city. But the potential is there and thus far the developers seem  to be chugging along.			"

Early Access Review
 It's everything you could have asked for from a city builder strategy AND simulation game!     As a huge fan of both RTS and simulation games, city builders have always captured my attention. I've played Cities:Skylines, Age of Empires series and Sim City. Some are focused on battles and conquering the opponents, whereas some are purely simulation games to the point you feel like you are sitting and thinking in your ivory tower. However, Folk Tale makes you a part of the city you are building for.PROS:+ Your citizens' happiness and needs are not just there to be taken care of. You have to act carefully, make sure they keep a balanced diet, have clothes, and of course, have a job! Your citizens are not just workers like many other RTS games, they go through a lot of hardships of a training to become a lumberjack, baker or miner. And no, you can't demand a baker to chop some woods. Please don't force them to do stuff they don't want to, it'll break their heart.+ Micromanagement is almost absent from the game so far. Not sure how that would turn out in advanced levels.You don't have to click on hundreds of people give each of them a specific task, but you can still do it if you want to.+ Economy and needs are the strategical part, yet the action never goes down. It doesn't necessarily mean there are non stop conflicts and battles, they might be. But even there isn't a single soldier on the horizon, just managing and bettering your city is enough to keep you interested. I never liked turn-based games like Civilization, so if you are like me on this matter, the chances are you are going to like the experience.CONS (and missing features): Since it's still in early access, I'd assume they'd add them sooner or later, and so far the improvement is promising. - Being unable to add people to the selecting. For example, you would expect CTRL+left click to add other units to the current selection of units. Tried other combinations, but haven't found one.- Being unable to select all units that are the same in an area. Double clicking on a lumberjack will not give you all the lumberjack or workers ready to your command.- Personally, I wished for a bit better textured and meshed graphics, the only thing that's not appealing at first glance is the looks. The more you progress your city the better it looks, but the graphics could have been better to get that ""I did this!"" feeling. To be more precise, the issue is about the grass while the buildings and characters have much better looks compared to pixelated look on the ground. Also, it's hard to see at night, maybe we could get an option for that or even torches and lanterns or something.- There's no achievements or trading cards yet. I'm eagerly waiting for them!- You can't drag the windows within the game. Sometimes resulting in not seeing what you are looting.Updated the review after a couple more sessions.			"

								This game has truly come a long way since it first launched and since I first bought it. I know this is going to be an excellent game when it is done. It had gone from a test of the game engine basically up to the status it is now which is much more immersive. Fans of city builders and rpg adventure would do well to buy this game and join in influencing how you want to see the game develop. You can even create your own maps. When this game is completed you are going to be kicking yourself and wondering why you didn't get it for that cheaper price earlier on. Sure plenty of people have been burned with games that were early access and never saw completion, however, this Dev team is dedicated to what they are doing and come out with regular updates and fixes to the existing game. (Written around alpha 16) Keep in mind that it is still in Early Access. So if you are looking for a lot of playability immediatley, you won't get that right now. But a lot of recent updates to the game are culminating into what will be a large increase in playability and content. I am truly more excited for this game then any Triple A title or any other game for that matter. (Alpha 22.3) (0.3.2.3)			"

								I do really like this game and I see that it has come along way.It is like banished but a lot deeper. There are still quite a lot of actions that have buttons but not active yet. looking at all the options they give you but are not currently available its obvious that the creators intend to do a lot more with this game and it makes me really hopeful. That being said, it does still have a lot of glitches like sometimes certain fields are not active until you sell them and rebuild them and the barracks wont let you research anything so they cant improve for combat. When you click on a villager, it shows you their picture but no matter who you are looking at, the icon is a bald man. I can only play so far until i cant really progress any farther since so much is unfinished but i do really like this game and i hope the developers continue working on it so it can be even better. If you like banished then you will like this game.			"

The devs are very responsive and continually working on the game, so you know your feedback is being listened to and incorporated.I wouldn't recommend paying $29 for it, I got it during the 40% of sale and even then was apprehensive about bying an early access game with  mixed reviews.  However it's been worth the $20 or so I paid.  Can't say with certainty that it's worth $29 though, sorry!If you're looking for a full on campaign to play through with more features then you can shake a stick at then you might want to go play the new Anno game while you wait for this one to be finished.  Otherwise get in there, get invovled and help make it into something really special. "

Early Access Review
								This game has a lot of potential in the way of sorytelling, visual theme, and developer interaction. Unfortunately, it is still very far from obtaining the gem they wish to create, and could possibly take too long. From what I've gathered, the focus of the game is currently being shifted toward a less scripted sandbox mechanic as proposed by overwhelming popular majority(I think). Also, the amount of features required to give this game any replayability is quite daunting for a team of this size, and as a result they will be facing a very long roadmap. In any case, I always have support for dedicated developers, and I hope they will continue to hold costumer feedback in the highest regards. For these reasons I have personally invested in their vision, and will be an active contributor if development continues. I would expect others to understand that you will not be paying for a very long period of play, but it could possibly become an engaging and extensive game in a couple painstaking years. If you don't want to throw money at the situation like i have, then at least keep an eye on it for a sale of some kind, or an update that really seals this economy pinch they're in. -Thanks for reading!

								If you enjoy sandbox style games then this is showing promise.The resource gathering, harvesting and building is presented very well. With the cartoonish graphics, audio and weather / atmospheric effects adding to the game play.  Sitting somewhere in between Settlers7 and Banished.If you enjoy story driven content, then you need to wait and see.  At the moment, there is less story content than there has been previously. (Which was the main reason for my purchase).  More has been promised (see further posts).---- original review ----Game has completely changed direction from what was first offered.  Purchased years ago on early access for a promise of a fun and interesting story.  This has now been totally removed and the game changed into 100% sandbox.  Its now a micro management nightmare, with a clunky GUI and a slow camera.After 2 years in early access there seemingly no end in sight with no clear vision from the developers.---- "

								Folk Tale is a village management game which combines a sandbox “Stronghold” style settlement management system with a story driven scenario manager. The game is in early access. The basic settlement management system works now and there is 5 maps to play on. Pros- It's beautiful graphics create a lovely atmosphere- It's  fun to play now. I have had about 18 hours of play out of Alpha 20. Alpha 21 came out yesterday (roughly a month after alpha 20) so I will see how play I can get from that.- It has some intriguing build tools for making both maps and scenarios. - Being part of the development process itself is quite fun. Games Foundry goes out of its way to keep the community informed about progress.- The village mechanics with tiered buildings, villager experience, a village tech tree are great (although still in the process of being adding to and balanced).- The concept is a good one, and basic way it is being implemented is far sighted. They have designed mechanics for village simulation, character progression,  and story mode. They have made editors to create maps and scenarios. They reworked their game concept to based on a sandbox simulation (which I get the feeling was not the original plan) and did this successfully. They have been doing this for 2 years and just keep at it… this game will be finished and be an impressive beast at the end.Cons- The game has been developed in full view on early access for most of its life. This gives the impression of a ""slow"" development pace. If this bothers you then hang onto your money for now...- It's still unfinished - More summary information is needed on the village simulation side to make the user experience less cumbersome. Sometimes is hard to keep track of all the things that are going on (alpha 20).- Combat control also is a bit hit and miss at this stage (alpha 20).In conclusion, if you like the idea of early access games, enjoy being included in the development progress and are patient enough to wait around for 2-3 years for a finished product to appear then I strongly recommend this game. I liked this game enough to buy an extra copy from my wife... I notice she has already run up 4 hours on it in the first evening...			"

								I just bought the game on May 5th, 2015 so I have not played a lot yet. I will update when I put more time in, but so far I enjoy the game. Lets keep in mind I bought it even though there are mixed reviews. It is an early access game that has been early access for a long time, but so are many other games I currently play. To me that isn't a deal breaker so long as there have been updates made.----------------------------------------------------It reminds me of Banished, but adds another layer to your townspeople that was lacking. I like that I can research new armor to equip onto each person and learn new ways to make my farming or mining more successful. It feels like I have many more options to customize my town how I want. Plus there is even combat and looting!I was confused at first how I was supposed to find anyone in my town when I needed lets say my Hunter. Reading reviews this was a major concern to others as well. After a little while I did figure out a simple way in locating anyone that is assigned to a building. Just go to that building and it will list your workers with a little button that selects them. Not the easiest way ever. This isn't something pointed out to you in the tutorial either, so I am guessing there is plenty more that I will have to discover for myself.Even still I like the look of the game and the music as well. The voices used are pretty solid, but don't vary a ton.I am looking forward to future updates and playing the game more myself to get a better feel for it!			"

I'd want the action to remove or add trees from an area, This way I can build thing with in a more secluded area. Path ways would be nice and stronger units would help a lot since one swords man couldn't take on a wolf. I never know when I am been attacked, so a notifaction would be nice. The one major thing that need to happen in the next update, would be to make a save. It's needed if someone is going to enjoy this game.			"

Although you can't save your game, right now, it's still great to play every once in a while. In Folk Tale, you build your village, gather food and resources, fight loads of mosters and gather items for your own villagers (they can use any weapons/armors you may find). Hope this encouraged you to bye this :D			"

								This game is great work in progress, but it is just that; a work in progress. There are a few bugs and AI whacks, but all in all what we have now is the foundation of something great. The devs keep us informed about additional work, and things like that. This game is fun to play, even in its current early-access state. Buying it will give you plenty of time to enjoy growing a village into a thriving city, and a whole bunch of laughs. Personally i love the little jokes, memes, and funny behavior. Not only that, but there is an editor where you can design your own maps to be used and buildings and props for the maps as well. Do a solid for a fellow steam member and buy this game, not only to enjoy playing but to fund the efforts to grow this gameinto something even better. Keep up the good fight devs, you are doing great!(maybe consider re-doing the building placement boundaries? my village seems to grow so fast with only a few buildings that have to be placed on flat land)			"

Hate whatever this sandbox never getting complete almost game they have now. This game gave Early Access games cancer. I have not bought a single EA game since this. And wont.			"

								20 months and it's still barely playable. Maybe if we give them another 100 months this will be a full game.Editing for future possible players: The game is still pretty much♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's been 28 months now since I bought it and there still has been barely any progress on the overall themes of the game. Yeah, you can make a decent village now, but aside from that... There isn't much more. Still not even remotely worth the asking price.32 months after purchase. Game seems to finally be making progress in a good direction. Hopefully will be decently playable in another 20 months.			"

								If you are unsure about buying this game, then put it in your wishlist till you buy it because the finished product is 100% worth it, i can already tell. It's not only funny but i find my self already spending hours on it and when im not on it, i'm thinking about it!Some problems I have found is that its a little choppy on my laptop but i'll still play it! haha it did crash however, not sure if thats a problem with my computer or the game. One thing however that I would like to see is the prices of how much it costs to make a person into a monk or a farmer, I had to guess at how much gold I needed to use. But keep in mind that this game is still in being made and being fixed so all these problems do fair is to be expected, Also my little minner dudes dont mine so that kinda sucks but i'll figure it out. (In the sandbox mode)But over all I really like the game and I recommend it to anyone who likes to play games where you build citys and control your little peoples. I plan on playing it for awhile. can't wait for more updates!			"

								I regret buying this in early access, and would advise others not to do so.It has the potential to be a good game. The Devs seem to listen to the community, but they are slow to build this and should really have waited longer before letting others see it. I mean, it originally was opened up with a long tutorial that you couldn't even save.Wait until it's properly finished, then read the post-launch reviews before buying this game.Personally, my money is on this ending as one of those unfinished buggy games that earns the devs a small income from people who don't read reviews.

I'm very interested to see how this game will evolve.There are a few issues right now. My main problem is that there isn't enough information to view in the game: like what villagers are doing what.

Similarly, I equipped some armour onto a few villegars, and it was just sort of ""well, good luck, guys!"" Because, as far I can tell, there's no way to ever find those villegars again, other to randomly click on every individual person in the town to see what they're wearing. I hope to see more ways to view information in this game, because the new concepts here are neat; but as the town grows, the game becomes a little unweildly. Quite a fun game though.			"

								I have only played half way through the tutorial, but this reminds me very much of Warcraft or Banished.  The interface is pretty decent, but the controls leave me wanting to scream at late 90's programmers for the non intuitive way the screen is controlled (this is just a learning curve, but it would be nice to rotate where your mouse is located instead of at the middle bottom of the screen).Overall it seems like this will be a great game once it is complete and well worth the time to play currently.

								This game is in early access, but for how far I've seen it come since I first started playing it until now, I know this will be a PC classic. Same as Age of Empires, or Rise of Nations. There is clearly a spin on it, a different approach, that obviously still needs some tweaking and other additions. Really great new engine and concept, to an age old genre. I do recommend this game if you enjoy a unique twist on city developement/RTS games, with enough familiarity that you don't feel lost.			"

								I have fallen in love with this game. I have only recently bought it for myself, but I have already been asking friends to try as well. It is so vibrant and full of potential! From the beginning of the game it has a sense of humor, and slightly reminds of Fable somehow. The city building aspect of the game is hands on, and you really need to keep an eye on everything, while trying to defend your city. The Heroes and Soldiers you can train can be customized, while only a few cosmetic things change, their stats can be boosted which really REALLY helps. I could go on for ages about all these amazing features, but to sum it up. If you are interested, it is an amazing game and I cannot wait for the final product. I tip my hat to the Games Foundry. Amazing work guys!			"

								Playing this game is like playing a Warcraft III map that is WAY bigger with a lot more depth and things to do with both RPG character advancement and city building/managing. If that sounds like something you always wanted then you are like me, and I highly recommend you buy the game and support the devs.			"

								I have only played half way through the tutorial, but this reminds me very much of Warcraft or Banished.  The interface is pretty decent, but the controls leave me wanting to scream at late 90's programmers for the non intuitive way the screen is controlled (this is just a learning curve, but it would be nice to rotate where your mouse is located instead of at the middle bottom of the screen).Overall it seems like this will be a great game once it is complete and well worth the time to play currently.

								After playing a bit, my reaction goes like this:At first, I was WTF!  I had a lot of trouble figuring out some of the most basic concepts - like how to get more people in my town.  And once I figured the basics out, I was WTF!   Spiders.And so I decided to give it another go with my new information, I was WTF! This level was a cakewalk once I killed some random guy and picked up his uberOP weapon which allowed my character to pretty much singlehandedly kill everything else on the map.And then I was... WTF! Because I couldn't tell if there was more to do on the map or not - I had uncovered all of the fog of war and killed everything that I could.a. Starting resources should include some food.  Get rid of some of that stone and just start with 100 each of wood, stone, ore, carrots, bread, and fish.   b. Add some kind of patrol command for the various troops.  c. My town is being attacked? Great!  How about telling me where?   All of that said, the only real ""complaint"" I have is that the camera feels very sluggish when being moved.  All of my other comments were either documentation or balance issues because it's early access.    I definitely want to see the game developed further and would like for it to one day have a fully fleshed out campaign.			"

Early Access Review
								I got this game back when it first was released as an early access and I will admit that the progress has been very slow and I stopped playing it for a while. I came back and so many things were different but the way it has gone has been a major improvement to what it was before. If they released the early access where the game is now they would not have so much of a mixed review.  Well now into the pros and cons:Pros - Not every faction is an enemy - Easy construction system - Make your own maps - The appearanceCons - No tutorial (they used to have one for the old system) - Little confusing to get startedSuggestions - A random map generator would be amazing for it - A better way for villagers to come (something like a birth system)I am looking forward to see how this game develops over time because it has so much potential I just wish they would make it a little bit faster.

They have now fixed some of the things I'm missing before. like, Better balance on the firewood, Plantiable trees, Upgrades and recipes (With some limitations, it is, STILL a beta after all). When it comes to playability there are only a few maps, no Assignments/Qests or Story.... yet. However, you can modify the maps (The program to do this with, is to me a little strange / unusual and annoying xD ) Current situation 5/10Possibilities in the future 9/10Again.... Beta			"

								From other reviews, I see that this game has been in development for quite some time, but I just got it after the newest update. This game is obviously unfinished, and not all features work yet; none the less,I have greatly enjoyed playing it so far. The graphics are cute, and I like all the little snippets that people say when I order them about. Equipping items is not working all the way, and this makes fighting all about mobbing the enemies that are sitting around the map.I would recommend this game, but really impatient people might want to wait until it has been updated a few more times.

								I'm blown away by this game, it's been a long long time since I brought a game off steam and when I saw this one I thought on yeah looks good, but when I started playing I was ingrossed from the beginning the tutorial is outstanding, helps even the dumbest of people through the game and the options are limitless, combat is awesome, had a little play around with it.One thing, I don't understand is how people can say this is a bad game, sure you got your opinion but coming from someone who gave up buying games on steam cause nothing good ever got released, this is what I've been looking for, for years.So if you're fooled by early access, don't be this one is worth it. Who cares if it aint got a campaign, just go play in the sandbox for a couple hours easy as. (thumbs up) "

Early Access Review
								The Concept is a lot like Empire.  You build using settlers and huts to increase settlers.  I like the medieval twist using Kobalds and quests (Though I have yet to be able to do any quests.)  graphics are pretty cool, nothing great. Some big issues thus far though. 1:  The adviser who says you need more bread or meat or whatever, never stops once it starts and repeats every second.  There needs to be a way to turn that off.  2: You need to VASTLY improve the skill levels to match each accordingly.  Right now even on training level it is nearly impossible to learn or improve your village.  That's ridiculous.  Training level shouldn't need advisors beyond that of the actual training and frankly shouldn't have any worries at all as training level should strictly be a learning level ONLY..  You should be able to build anything and you should never lose settlers.  The next level, the beginners equivelent should only be slightly harder, needing a timy bit of food and maybe losing settlers only after having no food for like 30 minutes or something.  Then tweak the higher levels accordingly.    3:  When you send a Villager to do something they dance around at the spot for a few minutes before doing anything, wasting valuable time you have to gather resources and build things.  Overall the concept is pretty cool and has the potential to be a pretty decent hit but much work needed yet before it's really playable for any length of time.			"

								I haven't played much prior to the current patch 0.3.0.0 because I was have graphic issues. That seems to have been resolved. This game has real potential to be challenging and enjoyable; appealing to a broad audience. There are only 2 items I would like to see: 1. A better way to see and select villagers that are idle. 2. A way to rotate the camera to see the lay of the land from different angles; not just rotating buildings before construction. If these already exists I haven't discovered it yet, but I'll keep looking.With that said, I'm really enjoying playing Folk Tale and appreciate the hard work that is going into the project. I believe the end result will be great.--  I found that I could ""tab"" through a group of villagers. That does make it easier to equip the townsfolk, but I would like a better interface for that. -- I didn't work with the ""v"" camera control enough before I made the comment on rotation. That works just fine and it does make it easier for placement of buildings.			"

								I agree with most of the statements of this game when it first came out 2 years ago. I played it for a while until I gave up due to bugs. Tired playing it this week and found that the game seems to be worse. Like most other players i bought the game due to the visual effects and the promise that it had. But now the developers seem to have canned the game because they got their money out of it for an unfinished product so what do they care if they finish the game. Since this game I have not bought a single Early Access Game because I found that most other games out there never really have a final release they just remain unfinished or don't live up to their promise. To be honest wish these developers would face charges for fraud advertisement.			"

								At first I was reluctant to buy this game, but I decided it was worth the shot. It was a winning bet. This is a great ""Settlers"" style builder. I think the fact that there is no campaign mode might be a plus, given the past history of Empire Building games. I run the game in a five year old rig, Windows 7 64bit, it rums quite smoothly so far on maximum performance, however I don't know if that will be the case when the city becomes more populated. The downside is that many things are still not implemented, the upside is that the game is worth waiting for them. I just hope those devs are GETTING BUSY BABY! Input: I would like to see some decorations added to the game. As it is it doesn't much resemble a village, so give us pavements, paths, fences, signposts, a doghouse, flowerpots and the like. That would make this game absolutely superb. Also, please, PRETTY PLEASE change the female settler icon to, well, a female settler.			"

								Imagine if Banished and Warcraft 3 had a love child, it was so beautiful and they both swore to love and take care of it. Then they took one look at it, threw up all over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, andsent it to The Wall, to serve out the rest of its digusting, crap life, plagued by the ""free-folk,"" White Walkers, and the knowledge that they will never have hair as great as Jon Snow.I have rarely ever given a game a thumbs down. I usually find some sort of saving grace in a game. I purchased this quite some time ago, I attempted to play it and the tutorial was so dry and uninspiring so I gave up on it. Fast-forward a few months later I really get the urge to play this game. I re-install it, and decide to opt out of the tutorial and dive into the game. It's good at being simple enough to not need to really look at instructions or a guide/tutorial. However the game is borderline TOO SIMPLISTIC. Half the items you click on say: ""THIS HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET."" The other half, that do work are filled with so many bugs that you want to cry.There are barely any sound or visual cues, the game doesn't do a good job in telling you when your town is under attack, there is one sound cue ""YOUR BASE IS UNDER ATTACK."" However it only happens after somebody pretty much already dies. Visually many of the creatures are so tiny that even when you watch your town, you have not a clue that there's a god damn spider killing people.My Windmill was glitched out the♥♥♥♥♥ It rendered 3 townsmen as ""ghosts,"" as in they were there, not clickable, but weren't farming. The tier 1/3 walls make no sense, there's no cost on them, yet they do take resources and I calculated how much it would be for the wall, but when I built one section it refused to let me build any other walls on the entire map. I tried everything to fix this. This game may have potential, if it were 2008. The whole concept seemed cool, but the developer's take on it is so dated. To re-address my previous point, they combined two great games. The RPG elements of Warcraft 3, and the town building experience of Banished, but they somehow managed to only take the awful parts of both games, making this probably the worst experience I've ever had playing a ""city builder."" This game is quite awful. I have not met a single person that played this game and actually enjoyed it. Yes, I know what you're thinking I only have 1hour on this game. I usually hold judgement of a game until I either beat story mode, or have at least 10 hours in the game. This is a very huge exception just because I am uninstalling and never playing this horrid game again.Overall I would give this game a 3/10. This is the lowest I have EVER given ANY game. All in all they tried something out, they had a great concept that was butchered with awful interactions. Your ""main character"" in the game, the dude that explores and beats people is underpowered, he comes with a healer who sometimes refuses to leave him, and other times runs around the other side of the map because I guess they stopped liking each other. Half the buildings make no sense, some don't even work properly (the bakery), yet you are told your villagers DEMAND it. This game is just so incomplete, broken, and left such a sour taste in my mouth, I cannot justify it getting a better review from me in this lifetime unless they fix all the bugs and make it playable. Even then I don't think they would get anything more than a ""meh"" from me.  "

Early Access Review
								Clearly I haven't played this game a ton, but I would like to share my very initial impressions of this game before I come back later on to write a more cohesive and holistic review.First, I'd like to say that I've always loved sandbox games. As a fairly creative person, I'm able to enjoy them for hours on end without losing stamina. If sandbox games aren't for you, you might not want to play the game in its current state. That said, the minimal amount of time I've spent in-game has been positively GREAT. You know that feeling you get when a game just... gets you? That's the feeling I get with this game. There's a certain nostalgia that comes with quaint village sims like this, and I for one am a huge fan.I'm gonna stop here, since I can't really justify much more of a review on 0.4 hours of play time, but I will say that if you're a fantasy-head, enjoy RTS games, and prefer a somewhat relaxed if strategically oriented playstyle, you will enjoy this game.EDIT AFTER A COUPLE MORE HOURS OF GAME PLAY --As I suspected, additional play time has presented a few caveats you might like to know about before you purchase the early access version of this game. The game runs well, and has enough depth to allow the user to explore with a decently sized military regiment if they expand their land enough, but the game is INCREDIBLY unstructured after the tutorial. Eventually you get into a rythm where you don't really //need// to expand, all of your resources are generating at a solid enough rate, your villagers have access to medicine, clothing, food entertainment, and life is peachy. You've positioned guards around the town so that rogue spiders really aren't an issue, and the game just gets... quiet. Sure, you can opt to venture forth with your armed militia, but this provides little more than additional resources, and on rare occasion an item or two that might make ONE (not all) of your militia men a little bit stronger. I'll reiterate that this game is great. It has a great vision, shows promise, and is fun to play, but I do agree with others when they say that the game needs more direction. Like I said, it's all too easy to fall into a position where there's absolutely no tangible reason to expand.			"

								From other reviews, I see that this game has been in development for quite some time, but I just got it after the newest update. This game is obviously unfinished, and not all features work yet; none the less,I have greatly enjoyed playing it so far. The graphics are cute, and I like all the little snippets that people say when I order them about. Equipping items is not working all the way, and this makes fighting all about mobbing the enemies that are sitting around the map.I would recommend this game, but really impatient people might want to wait until it has been updated a few more times.

								The randomness of this game is...epic to say the least. I love every aspect of this game so far and hopefully once it is fully completed and released it will be my new favorite game. The way you can build up a city and have to defend it and yet also make sure everyone is fed, happy, healthy, and even warm makes it amazing. I want more...so much more.			"

								I haven't played much prior to the current patch 0.3.0.0 because I was have graphic issues. That seems to have been resolved. This game has real potential to be challenging and enjoyable; appealing to a broad audience. There are only 2 items I would like to see: 1. A better way to see and select villagers that are idle. 2. A way to rotate the camera to see the lay of the land from different angles; not just rotating buildings before construction. If these already exists I haven't discovered it yet, but I'll keep looking.With that said, I'm really enjoying playing Folk Tale and appreciate the hard work that is going into the project. I believe the end result will be great.--  I found that I could ""tab"" through a group of villagers. That does make it easier to equip the townsfolk, but I would like a better interface for that. -- I didn't work with the ""v"" camera control enough before I made the comment on rotation. That works just fine and it does make it easier for placement of buildings.			"

								this is my first review i've writen for any game, while the game is a blast in sandbox mode, I haven't played any other mode so far, I don't have any issues with the game, I cannot complain about it at all, the ONLY negative thing I can say is I guess is, lack of content and contiued play in sandbox mode, once you get your village to level 3 there is really nothing else to do but start a new game, but this is not an MMO its more a RTS than anything, so it's to be expected. this game in my hoest opinion is a cross between Stronghold and warcraft... stronghold play style with warcraft graphics with even more.. hope this helps anyone interested in buying it, I recomend it truly.

								Fun, and has alot of potential. Not really sure what people where expecting, but if this becomes what it wants to become, it will be awesome. Very similar to The Settlers. True that the rts is slightly lacking currently, its more just having the better equiped guys who just kill everything taking little to no damage. Some few bugs, here and there. Selling your storehouse effectively makes gold dissapear from the game, making many things now impossible. Keeping everyone happy is nearly impossible, as goods take a while to get around.All in all, fun game, but would probably wait a bit.			"

								This game deserves a much higher score than it has. Also I might add that ALL the comments about the game not changing much is Rubbish. This game is the perfect example, like Star Citizen, of developers consitantly listening and iterating to the community and leveraging new funds to expand the game to something much greater than it was. They have just gotten to the tail end of actually developing the engine technology and will be building the RPG content and story. I highly recomend this game for I support their vission, which they have done nothing but prove they are consistantly achieving and moving towards through frequent updates. They also stream several times a week and interact with the community often.			"

								Picked it up on a sale. Love the idea. Thus far I played through the tutorial map. I like where its headed, very much.  Worth the current price, probably worth full price. I'll update my review after more play.EDIT:Played most of the morning. I see great potential here. Currently it really needs some interfaces for things like:Idle citizenCycle through your populationAssign default gear for a professionA market cart that can be moved or multiples of to make multiple food points around your city instead of the butcher or a stock pile or a bakery.A way to find other designs, maybe its there but I researched swords and got a goblin sword... and thats all I can make for swords.Some planning tool like, clear this area which would send the appropriate professions to remove rock/wood/ore/whatever from an area so you can build without just destroying it. Also I noticed a crazy thing at the tailor... they had made way more basic cloths than my population and most of the town was just hanging around buying them up as fast as they could be made instead of working. Seamed odd. Military research does not seam to work.Where are the heros? As I said like where its going, foundation seams good, however some quality of life things to reduce fatigue of highly repetitive tasks like ... giving your population armor/weapons everytime one goes off and attacks a spider then dies. Worth $15 for sure.			"

								Great gift for your future grandchildren, so they too can enjoy the alpha version of Folk Tale, which it will surely still be in.All kidding aside, this game has been plagued by terrible design decisions, throughout its entire EA process. (and I bought this in July '14).Way too many genres being mashed up here and none of them are done particularly well.And somehow, this game went from being ""single player fantasy village builder RPG"" into a RTS/ARPG... with no pause?I just can't get behind this game.  After over 2 years of development, this game is still a giant, unsorted mess.  I bought a sandbox village builder rpg... 2 years later, i have a campaign-oriented RTS with dated graphics.  Whatever this game is trying to be (at this point, i no longer care) there are games out there, that do each part of this mess, ten times better.  This game forces one type of gamer, to endure a mountain of crap, just to enjoy the parts they bought the game for.For example, I absolutely hate RTS games. I LOVE city/village builders.  When I bought this, there was no mention of RTS gameplay and when I played it, there was not much of a hint to that.  Yet, that is now what we have here.  On top of that, even if I bought it FOR the RTS aspect, they won't put a pause in this SINGLE PLAYER game.  (zero people on the planet, want their STRATEGY GAME to not have a pause).  So they essentially turned their RTS game, that nobody asked for, into a even more unasked for ARPG/RTS. - UPDATE - Pause has been added.I wish the devs luck and I am happy some people are enjoying it, for me however, even when it is released, I have no desire to take the time to even install and try it again unless things change.Do your own research though, this may be for you.  Utilize the refund system and try it if you are on the fence, there are clearly many people who enjoy it.In closing, I have one positive to mention... the devs are very nice and have pretty good communication with the community.  Although this is one of, if not the longest game in EA, never have i ever felt it was abandoned. ( i DID feel the updates were few and far between for a while but that seems to be a thing of the past)			"

								I agree with most of the statements of this game when it first came out 2 years ago. I played it for a while until I gave up due to bugs. Tired playing it this week and found that the game seems to be worse. Like most other players i bought the game due to the visual effects and the promise that it had. But now the developers seem to have canned the game because they got their money out of it for an unfinished product so what do they care if they finish the game. Since this game I have not bought a single Early Access Game because I found that most other games out there never really have a final release they just remain unfinished or don't live up to their promise. To be honest wish these developers would face charges for fraud advertisement.			"

								At first I was reluctant to buy this game, but I decided it was worth the shot. It was a winning bet. This is a great ""Settlers"" style builder. I think the fact that there is no campaign mode might be a plus, given the past history of Empire Building games. I run the game in a five year old rig, Windows 7 64bit, it rums quite smoothly so far on maximum performance, however I don't know if that will be the case when the city becomes more populated. The downside is that many things are still not implemented, the upside is that the game is worth waiting for them. I just hope those devs are GETTING BUSY BABY! Input: I would like to see some decorations added to the game. As it is it doesn't much resemble a village, so give us pavements, paths, fences, signposts, a doghouse, flowerpots and the like. That would make this game absolutely superb. Also, please, PRETTY PLEASE change the female settler icon to, well, a female settler.			"

								I wish i hadn't paid money for this.and I really do not like leaving bad reviews for all the hard work people put into gamesIt had lots of things i love but grew to hate this oh so quicklyi loved stronghold, many 3rd person clickies, kingdom management and put them together for joy you say?... oh noyour hardened peasants are pathetic, warm, well fed and protected would have kept many of the medieval peasants happy not in this, if they are not wearing a brand new t shirt and have a pint in their hands they will jump ship at the first opportunity.. and not just a general malaise unhappiness seriously kicking the dog and throwing the toys out of their pram unhappy.this started the downward spiral, the adventure type missions pigeon hole a champion character in to an instance, slow and clumsy and far too easyI know all too well this is an EAG and things need to be ironed out but they have started on a very unsatisfying gaming experience which means it i really has a ton of work to doEquipment should be taken automatically by the peasants when available unless you state otherwise.Indicators for what and who is available for work, and peasants while not doing anything form around a single pointwall building broken into towers and wallswhen you group by ctrl and number camera to flick to groupenemy spawn is just annoyingviewing distance is far too smallunhappiness in village goes from manageable to everyone has left in secondsinventory does not need to show so much wood etc a store bar at the top is good enoughmarket place is a wtf is going on experience you can and cant buy certain things?i cannot put my finger on it but this is should be a good game but it really isn't "

								so basicly its over 3 years in to production. and its moving slowly, if your lucky enough to get it to load and have managd to get the experimental version then you will find a game that is bugged and only allows an hour or so of play before finishing everything and then your just in a simple building game thats far from complete or good. time will tell on this one. honestly wait another 3 years and hope its finnished by then.

								I haven't played much prior to the current patch 0.3.0.0 because I was have graphic issues. That seems to have been resolved. This game has real potential to be challenging and enjoyable; appealing to a broad audience. There are only 2 items I would like to see: 1. A better way to see and select villagers that are idle. 2. A way to rotate the camera to see the lay of the land from different angles; not just rotating buildings before construction. If these already exists I haven't discovered it yet, but I'll keep looking.With that said, I'm really enjoying playing Folk Tale and appreciate the hard work that is going into the project. I believe the end result will be great.--  I found that I could ""tab"" through a group of villagers. That does make it easier to equip the townsfolk, but I would like a better interface for that. -- I didn't work with the ""v"" camera control enough before I made the comment on rotation. That works just fine and it does make it easier for placement of buildings.			"

So that's a plus.I am glad that there are so many indie games available and would never want to go back to the time when EA did not mean Early Access, it meant Electronic Arts.  And Electronic Arts was slow to fix, if not fix at  any of their games at all.So I am glad I am supporting an Indie game developer makes games that are not stifled by a publisher like EA			"

								I've played through the campaign to where I hit a problem right at the end, but that's to be expected in a beta/alpha mode.The game is intersting and fun.  I like it.  One has to take it with a garin of salt though as it's an unfinished work.  I appreciate wherr it's going and what it's trying to do.  If you will be overly frustrated with features that are not yet implemented or some balance issues that are not ironed out yet, just wait for it to get further along before you buy it.  But you SHOULD buy it because it's a nice piece of work.I see a lot of folks making a big deal out of demanding that the devs add battle pausing.  To the point of claiming the game belongs to the players and not the developers.  I'll just toss in my opinion here...  are you ready?  Poppycock.  The game belongs to the devs.  They can do whatever the dratted well please to do.  You don't like it?  Don't play it.  You get one vote and one vote only, in economics it's call the dollar vote.The battles can be a bit challenging and I can certainly see where someone is thinking ""But if I could just fire off every ability for every character at once I'd be able to win!!!!!""    Sadly this is a false assumption.  The game just needs some additional balancing, to where what you CAN get done is ENOUGH to get you through. But that's a bit further down the road in the cycle where they get into the fine balancing. In the meantime, stop trying to dictate what they develope based on your one little viewpoint.  If you've ever spent years of your live slaving away over making one game in a small team, send them a nice letter explaining your viewpoint, I'm sure they will appreciate it.  Otherwise accept that you don't understand every factor in what you are asking for.  Don't assume that just suddenly ADDING pausing after the game engine is essentially written is all that easy.  Depending on their queueing and methodology that could be a highly complex change that theratens to break many deep and intrinsically complex aspects of the code.  I can see a lot of love and sweat went into this by a small team and you just need to give them some time to work things out. Anyways.  Two thumbs up for making something I found enjoyable.  Can't wait to see where it's going and try it out again in a few months.			"

								I have put some time into this game and I want to recommend it now but I can't yet.  I would like to clarify that it has alot of promise however and this review can easily change!  If your interested in funding the developer on its progress and don't mind that the game is not completed yet then please do support by purchasing.  If your looking to progress through the entire story arc you won't make it very far as it is not completed.This Review is based on experimental build (v5) I like:-Building structures to meet resource and happiness requirements-Assigning workers-Upgrades, Research, Items Oh My!-Microing Heros Abilities and Stats-FIghting stuff-Optional tactical pause (Like FTL)It has a warcraft RTS kinda game feel which is not bad IMOWhy I don't Recommend:It is not finished.  The game is incomplete, bugs, and lacks UI optimizations as well as (IMO) some needed RTS features such as select all military units or the ability to hot key buildings to quickly zoom to your base.  The development team is very active on the forums however and the game is making good progress in development in my short time here.Overall this game looks like it will be amazing!  I have high hope that the developers will flesh this game out and it will turn into something special.  Untill then I'd say move along and follow this games progress.  As long as this team does not pull a ""space base DF-9"" move on us I believe it will be a great RTS single player game during the final stage of development in the future.			"

								It's possible this could come close to the awesomeness of Warcraft 3, if not the same epic lore.More features which are cool like weather's impact on citizens needing firewood, need for food (happiness or they leave your village), heros, leveling of heros, items, and more.Sandbox mode is pretty cool as well, where you build a town in one of three different areas (i think gold mine, swamp ?, and wheat field area-ish).They seem to be sticking with the game dev and adding more cool stuff.  Happily suprised to see more updates as it felt quiet a few years ago.Think this game could be a great buy, and hope they keep developing.			"

								Pleasantly good game. A very good mix of city building and diablo-style dungeon crawling. The combat could be further refined, as the AI is competent but you would like to see more capacity for managing different roles among your party. I did find a frustration with the constant marauding during campaign mode, a day/night cycle will likely go without challenge, and due to the creatures scaling faster than the xp of your heroes, the lowly vermin start to ravage your town. Something to tune this down, allow for better early defenses (ai for guards, making the guards even somewhat self-sufficient), or some other solution would be appreciated. Overall a good time, reasonable graphics on 4k w/ ultra settings, and cheeky humor make for a fun distraction. 8/10, worth full price, must buy if its on sale.			"

								I highly recommend this game, with that said I do not have much play time. I tend to hop on for the minimal amount to check updates and see whats new. I don't want to burn out prior to release like rust. When i first started the game it was a true alpha game in the sense that the menu was clunky and commands were unresponsive etc. Today the game plays smooth as butter. The menu's are smooth and easily accessed. It has a settlers 6 feel to it that I have missed for a long time. This game has a very bright future.The biggest thing with the development of any early access title is developer communication and patches. The patches for this game are consistent and worthwhile. There is a roadmap on there site showing which direction they are headed in and whats going to be in each patch. I am also impressed to see the developer actually posting in the forums and responding to questions etc when he has the time. This is one of the few titles that will be completed in early access and I am proud to have supported it in some way. If you like city managing/developing you won't be disappointed. There is alot of things still coming to the game and I could not be more excited. Anyhow, I highly recommend this game to everyone. "

SLAY THOSE BASTEREDS THAT TOOK OUR // ""TOAST""! ... and get your wife back too, right?Still in devolpment and got no goal in terms of what to do ingame. When it possably get AI enemys with own town or atleast can progress like you just like age of empires and might and magic series (battle vs another faction AI not in for the moment).Pros- Many small details that is worth noticing! (do make you get the feeling for your town)- Well fitting artwork- Good animations- Good varity of units enemies (more to come maybe going into 10+? creatures, ingame there is 3 factions 2 more too come I belive that is right?)- Do need to think where to place building strategic (depends on the map creater if bad design then played bad thats how this game would work, a good map = a good exp!)Cons- Tutorial outdated (going to be reworked later on)- Buildings/res is not balanced or working as it should? (buildings when building it is not right as of yet or timing and res amount is way off for now going to be balanced later on)- Battles is not fully there yet (no Heros or many other things that is going into the game)- Save/load (do not fully work at the moment going to be implemented ofc)- Leveling up dosen't work at the moment- Stats/ablities isnt ready yet (Coming next update?)- Only Tier 1 is in fuction (tier 2 and 3 is somewhat ready but not as of yet)- Pathfinding not allways that cind with you..Now its more about doing the awsome tutorial a thousend times :PHavent seen how they are going to make us care about the peasnt and towns folk yet..Atleast the devs are advancing this game and looks like they want to complete it with love in their hearts :) Leveling up works but skills after leveling up do not work (like more health to unit or damage and such).No workable combat spells or attack abilitys (exept few prev build stuff just added in for fun).So there is a long road to actuly get to say if I like the game or not but this far I have loved the game in how they update and were they go with this.Editor is basic and creating maps by placeing tileset here and there not as advanced like hammer or have the same freedom (scripts, adjustments to a unit/object),and  maybe adding script or changeable numbers like health, damage on obejects like when you want a giant to have more health then a normal enemy (used scale tool on enemy but no change in health and no change in damage).

								I've been following ""Folk Tale"" over the last few years and slowly but surely, it's been making progress.  Gone is the scripted story and static building placement...instead, you now have a relatively free-form light village builder.  It reminds me a bit of ""Banished"", but with a few differences.  For one, it's not as harsh.  You can also loot enemies in the environment and equip things on your villagers (in addition to individually leveling them up). Combat is a bit bugged right now...that is, enemies will retreat and auto-restore their health to full making them hard to kill.  With that said, I'm enjoying the direction this game is taking.  It's important to stress what I said earlier about the game taking a while to develop...this isn't your ""three months in Early Access then done"" deal.  It entered Early Access sometime in 2013 and won't be done till 2016 (per the game's Steam store page).  Those seeking instant gratification and fast/regular updates may want to wait a while.  I'd recommend it for those who enjoy ""Banished"" or ""Hearthlands"", though keep in mind that the resource chains aren't nearly as complex (at least at the moment).

								I am pretty sure this game will never finish... I bought it on EArelease and could not stay longer then 6h in it... The game started very diffrent from what I can play now. Feels like centurys waiting for an update. At the beginning it had a good idea to it but until now it feels dull for me. This is one of the games where you will learn not to buy any EarlyAccess games because you will mostliky get ripped offThis is MY opinion on this product.			"

Early Access Review
								So I've been watching this game on my wishlist for... about 3 years now. Since it's still in Early access... in it's 3rd year on steam... that says a little something, but I digress. When it finally went on sale this year, I picked it up to play it finally.Now, this game is pretty fun, and I do recommend it.. if you have patience, it does have faults.It kind of doesn't know what type of game it wants to be... on the one hand it's got this cool kinda city builder thing going on, and on the other it's got this dungeon crawler stuff... That sounds interesting, right? Well.. yes and no, it's a little clunky.It also still has bugs, two that I've had in the last hr or so of playing. During a boss fight one of my characters became charmed, and when he was released from it.. he was 14 levels higher and had 999999 hp or something like that. At another point I ran from a battle and two of my heroes died... and the game tried to pull a ""Your character will revive in 4079:59 (68 real life hours)."" I restarted from an earlier save and lost some progress because of it. Also I discovered pretty late into the campaign that the world map can be used as a teleporter. If it ever tells you this, I don't know, but I wasted wayy to much time playing errand boy running from one dungeon area to the next repeatedly, and was annoyed when I figured it out.Either way... Was this game worth 3 years waiting for a sale to get? I'd say yes, it's not worth the current full price in my opinion. It's not really even worth the price on sale unfortunately. Edit: After thinking on it a little more, I do think this game will be ok in the future, but I don't recommend buying it right now.			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this game two years ago thinking at the time that it would be a pretty cool game. Since then I've checked in and re-played it every few months hoping it would get better and improve over time but it's just been a let down. Hugely disappointing. Feels like a game that doesn't have it's chit together and will never deliver something that is really worth playing.August 14, 2016 EDIT:I've since played for 10 hours and made some notes during and after. Bit long, sorry.Folk Tale has come a long way since I tried it about a year ago. I was disappointed back then as it went from a game having a fun if brief tutorial/campaign section to taking a huge step backwards towards being completely unplayable. It was upsetting to think that something that had been so promising had become yet another Steam early-access failure.This time around I've enjoyed the village building aspect immensely and am happy the game has retained the sense of humour that made me buy it in the first place. The combat however is a huge turn off. I found myself getting frustrated with buggy controls and overpowered waves of bandits, spiders and cow people while trying to get a fledgling village up and off the ground. Don't get me wrong, I'm very fond of developing and redeveloping a settlement but what's the point of pouring resources into repairing/rebuilding vital buildings when a few minutes later everything gets destroyed again? This is particularly annoying when villagers get upset and start leaving- your productions chains grind to a halt and everything crumbles to bits. Conscripted villagers aren't much better than their peasant counterparts either and don't do much in the way of defense.I've had fun for the most part in the ten or so hours but found myself getting progressively more and more frustrated with the combat. I go from happily plonking down buildings to trying to fight off spiders/bandits with a small platoon of guards and Heroes and it's a complete mess. Heroes are far too weak- Sir Gregor is supposed to be a tank and yet he dies in a couple of hits. He's got all the skills for tanking but even when I used console commands to equip and level him and Quixl they were still absolute pansies. Trying to use Hero skills is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and it's infuriating trying to move him and other units around with the mouse in combat while being unable to use skills bound to keys. They simply do not work and this absolutely needs to be fixed. Combat should be fun and fluid, not like wading through knee high muck.Admittedly as a result of clunky, unmanagable combat I haven't played very far into the campaign- I was more interested in building up a self-sustaining village before gearing up to go and quest. The questline feels so entirely separate from what goes on in the village map and with combat the way it is at present I simply don't want to go and do any of it. I did some for a bit but it's simply not fun and it feels uninteresting.Combat is depressingly awful and I'd throw a warm dog turd at it if it was a person to express my displeasure but the city-building aspects of Folk Tale are it's redeeming feature and what really makes this game incredibly fun. At the moment it does feels like the game is trying to do too much and really isn't doing it well. I'm almost tempted to say ditch the quest bits because they're so boring and cumbersome it's mortifying but removing those would make this purely a city-building simulator (albeit a rather fun one).Folk Tale has made significant progress over the last year in development and it really shows. However even with all the improvements that have been made so far combat absolutely needs to be fixed or it will kill the potential success of this game. If Folk Tale was purely a city-building game right now I'd zealously recommend it to all my friends despite being in early-access/development, but because it's not and because the combat is terrible I cannot recommend it as it is at present.I am optimistic though. What I've seen so far has shown that Folk Tale can be a success if given more work and more time. One of the biggest problems it has right now though is that the game has a reputation as being yet another failed early-access game stuck in perpetual development hell. I believe that this will gradually improve given the work that the team has put in, particularly in paying attention to feedback from the community. Plenty of developers say they listen to their fans, but for many of them it's just lip service. The contrast between a year ago and now is night and day- I went into this ten hour Folk Tale binge with very low expectations and about thirty minutes in I actually went to Google to see if the entire development team had been changed. That's how different it felt and how great an improvement had been made. Thank you for taking the time to contact me on Steam. I'm a bit burned out from playing Folk Tale right now but I'm looking forward to checking back in a couple of months and seeing how things have improved.------When using a skill (bound to key) Hero is unselected. Have to reselect Hero again before being able to use another skill. Very disruptive, breaks the flow of gameplay. Tested a few times and this happens both in the tutorial and the campaign. A few times it worked properly but most of the time it did not.-Doesn't appear to be an option to hide/minimize the quest pane. No dedicated quest log? Odd, would like to be able to hide the quest pane as it blocks the expanded inventory + character windows.-Inventory sorting? There used to be an option for this early on but it seems to have been removed.-Roads or toggleable grid system to help with keeping the placement of buildings neat would be nice. Building placement is messy and disorganized. Terrain is also inconsistent on where you can place structures and where you can't. Why the hell does a small rock in the way keep me from building a house there? I like making my village neat and tidy.-When speaking to npcs I have to move mouse up and down to click continue, speech options, etc. Space bar works fine for linear speech options but it would be nice to be able to press 1, 2, 3 etc when there are multiple speech options. Minor preference.- In the workers tab for buildings I'd like to be able to use mouse wheel to scroll through list of trainable peasants. Not a big fan of the click up and down, doesn't feel very fluid.-Would be nice to have a pause button that works while you pan around the map and a fast forward option. Was surprised that this is not a feature.-Moving around the map feels slow (especially as you can't zoom out very far) and could be helped along with some keys you could bind to various locations (ie zoom to town center, farming area, etc). Banished has a good example of this where you can custom bind locations to keys. Makes moving around the map much more convenient.-Custom keybindings do not persist and have to be reassigned for each new game. Building rotation keys cannot be reassigned. Keybindings tab says they are, but they seemed glued to [ and ]. Haven't tried all of the keybindings but they definitely are an issue at present (ie Hero skills).-Enemies destroy buildings entirely- would be nice if they reduced them back down to an empty frame or ruin. It's unrealistic- buildings that get bombed/burned/etc don't just magically disappear- but my actual beef is having to place everything all over again (especially when this game isn't big on being neat and organized) which is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ particularly when you've got unrelenting waves of enemies who apparently really despise your village architecture.-Have restarted the campaign 6 times so far.  My biggest complaint is combat is terrible and that characters are WAY too squishy to withstand the waves of spiders and bandits early game. Ridiculously squishy. Combat is very clunky and feels cumbersome.			"

								This game has a lot to offer for those who like Warcraft3, or Spellforce. The mix of Heroes plus base building is a nice mix.That being said, this game a long way to go. The Heroes a not ballanced well, and the AI needs some work. The game feels very much in Alpha with a boat load of missing features and abilities. I would like to see: Smarter AI with heroes, Villiagers able to have skills (especially the soldiers), better crafting in the blacksmiths that give the heroes something to equip, and general MORE TO DO.TLDR:Good game. LOTS of potential.Not complete, missing a lot of features and ballance issues.			"

								I've had this for a while, and although I don't play it too often (I think the time played counter was reset with a big version change), whenever I do play I always have a good time. It's changed quite a lot in the time that I've had it, and although progress is quite slow, each update makes the game more robust technically, and more interesting to play. It's a bit like old-skool Settlers, but with a colourful, chunky Warcraft-like feel to the graphics. The VO work is professional and very well done, and the script is much better than average too. I suspect some of the unhappy reviews are from people who have followed it for a long time and are dissappointed by the speed of the updates, or the fact that it's more of a city-builder/RTS/RPG hybrid, but taken on its own merits, it's solid fun, and quite engrossing too.

The original plan for this game was clearly trashed and the developers adapted a cookiecutter sandbox idea.  It's been done 10,000 times before so why not one more?  Tired idea for a tired genre.  The graphics are also years behind.  I know this is an indie game but no one needs a 2/10  early 2000's town builder.  Do not buy.  Your money can serve you better elsewhere.			"

Early Access Review
								So many unnecessary bad reviews!!! This is not just a game but a game within game creation software!!! It is almost unfair to call it a game. I swore to myself after so many abandon ware or early access quiters or whatever kind of crap game rip off that comes along i was not going to ""buy"" another game. Most of the bad reviews mainly discuss the 2 years in early access. Yes i agree that 2 years is a little long for early access but... the producer is small and METICULOUS so deserves a little slack. o.k. i did not buy this game 2 years ago so maybe my frustration level is not as high as someone who did; but all you have to do is mess around with this ""system/game/what have you"" and you will see the potential this title has. I look at it like this; if you have a game that allows modding or level development you have a virtual unlimited game. Add to this that mod levels are often better than the developers. Look what the world has given us with the Bethesda products! Skyrim is 5 years old and is still relevant in any current game of the year discussion. This title has not reached that level but it has the possibility. As far as updates to this game?? After i promised to not ""buy"" any other games i started to keep an eye on this one. I started in January and by May there were significant additions and changes to this title so that i decided to break my decision and purchase this game.  I am not sorry i did...btw i have significantly more time in this title than is illustrated.			"

								To say the least, This is not the same game that was originally released in early access. Indeed, still early access, but nearly no resemblance to the turd nugget that it once was. THIS game, that you will get if you download today, has some great potential. It's clever and, in some areas, already polished. I hope the developers continue down this path, I'm quite excited to see how it turns out. Definitely worth looking at if you are interested in an old timey city builder with some serious RPG slants. There are a lot of negative comments on this game, but mainly due to the crap sandwich this game use to be. If you look at recent reviews, you'll see that the reviews have come nearly as far as this game in the right direction. In conclusion, This is a pretty great game that was pretty bad when it first came out. So give it another chance or a first chance, you be glad you did.			"

I did some for a bit but it's simply not fun and it feels uninteresting.Combat is depressingly awful and I'd throw a warm dog turd at it if it was a person to express my displeasure but the city-building aspects of Folk Tale are it's redeeming feature and what really makes this game incredibly fun. At the moment it does feels like the game is trying to do too much and really isn't doing it well. I'm almost tempted to say ditch the quest bits because they're so boring and cumbersome it's mortifying but removing those would make this purely a city-building simulator (albeit a rather fun one).Folk Tale has made significant progress over the last year in development and it really shows. However even with all the improvements that have been made so far combat absolutely needs to be fixed or it will kill the potential success of this game. If Folk Tale was purely a city-building game right now I'd zealously recommend it to all my friends despite being in early-access/development, but because it's not and because the combat is terrible I cannot recommend it as it is at present.I am optimistic though. What I've seen so far has shown that Folk Tale can be a success if given more work and more time. One of the biggest problems it has right now though is that the game has a reputation as being yet another failed early-access game stuck in perpetual development hell. I believe that this will gradually improve given the work that the team has put in, particularly in paying attention to feedback from the community. Plenty of developers say they listen to their fans, but for many of them it's just lip service. The contrast between a year ago and now is night and day- I went into this ten hour Folk Tale binge with very low expectations and about thirty minutes in I actually went to Google to see if the entire development team had been changed. That's how different it felt and how great an improvement had been made. Thank you for taking the time to contact me on Steam. I'm a bit burned out from playing Folk Tale right now but I'm looking forward to checking back in a couple of months and seeing how things have improved.------When using a skill (bound to key) Hero is unselected. Have to reselect Hero again before being able to use another skill. Very disruptive, breaks the flow of gameplay. Tested a few times and this happens both in the tutorial and the campaign. A few times it worked properly but most of the time it did not.-Doesn't appear to be an option to hide/minimize the quest pane. No dedicated quest log? Odd, would like to be able to hide the quest pane as it blocks the expanded inventory + character windows.-Inventory sorting? There used to be an option for this early on but it seems to have been removed.-Roads or toggleable grid system to help with keeping the placement of buildings neat would be nice. Building placement is messy and disorganized. Terrain is also inconsistent on where you can place structures and where you can't. Why the hell does a small rock in the way keep me from building a house there? I like making my village neat and tidy.-When speaking to npcs I have to move mouse up and down to click continue, speech options, etc. Space bar works fine for linear speech options but it would be nice to be able to press 1, 2, 3 etc when there are multiple speech options. Minor preference.- In the workers tab for buildings I'd like to be able to use mouse wheel to scroll through list of trainable peasants. Not a big fan of the click up and down, doesn't feel very fluid.-Would be nice to have a pause button that works while you pan around the map and a fast forward option. Was surprised that this is not a feature.-Moving around the map feels slow (especially as you can't zoom out very far) and could be helped along with some keys you could bind to various locations (ie zoom to town center, farming area, etc). Banished has a good example of this where you can custom bind locations to keys. Makes moving around the map much more convenient.-Custom keybindings do not persist and have to be reassigned for each new game. Building rotation keys cannot be reassigned. Keybindings tab says they are, but they seemed glued to [ and ]. Haven't tried all of the keybindings but they definitely are an issue at present (ie Hero skills).-Enemies destroy buildings entirely- would be nice if they reduced them back down to an empty frame or ruin. It's unrealistic- buildings that get bombed/burned/etc don't just magically disappear- but my actual beef is having to place everything all over again (especially when this game isn't big on being neat and organized) which is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ particularly when you've got unrelenting waves of enemies who apparently really despise your village architecture.-Have restarted the campaign 6 times so far.  My biggest complaint is combat is terrible and that characters are WAY too squishy to withstand the waves of spiders and bandits early game. Ridiculously squishy. Combat is very clunky and feels cumbersome.			"

It is playable and most of all it is a lot of fun.Plays differently to most RTS town builders available right now, this one has more of an RPG feel with nice quests and hero interaction.This game is and was definitely worth my time.I just want to say a BIG thank you to the developers for all the hard work they have done on this title. It has came a long way and I look forward to playing the finished game. "

								Folk Tale has changed a lot since my first review, so I decided to give it another chance.Whilst I didn't exactly fall in love, I feel quite strongly that the game has a lot of promise. It's very, very good-looking, has a great soundtrack, and an appealing UI. Playing it is very soothing - it's very smooth to play, and I reallllly enjoy the graphic style. It reminds me a lot of The Settlers series. I'm really surprised to find an alpha indie game looking this good. Folk Tale still has some way to go, with plenty of stuff still to implement, but it's definitely worth looking at if you're into this type of game. Everything that is implemented so far looks professional and I came away with the feeling like the game is now being developed by competent people. If they can make the gameplay and complexity to the same standard as the art direction, then this will be a great game.			"

								I bought this program when you very first had early access, I am impressed with the work that has been put into this game.  It is refreshing to see a game company that cares more about the player base than the bottom dollar. I am very glad I helped this game with my contribution. I think as it stands it is a fun game and I like the direction that it is going. The level editor gives us the option for endless amounts of content, not to mention it has a campaign mode as well as a sandbox mode. REMEMBER IT IS EARLY ACCESS AND ANYTHING WORTH HAVING IN LIFE, IS WORTH WAITING FOR!!!			"

								I've been following ""Folk Tale"" over the last few years and slowly but surely, it's been making progress.  Gone is the scripted story and static building placement...instead, you now have a relatively free-form light village builder.  It reminds me a bit of ""Banished"", but with a few differences.  For one, it's not as harsh.  You can also loot enemies in the environment and equip things on your villagers (in addition to individually leveling them up). Combat is a bit bugged right now...that is, enemies will retreat and auto-restore their health to full making them hard to kill.  With that said, I'm enjoying the direction this game is taking.  It's important to stress what I said earlier about the game taking a while to develop...this isn't your ""three months in Early Access then done"" deal.  It entered Early Access sometime in 2013 and won't be done till 2016 (per the game's Steam store page).  Those seeking instant gratification and fast/regular updates may want to wait a while.  I'd recommend it for those who enjoy ""Banished"" or ""Hearthlands"", though keep in mind that the resource chains aren't nearly as complex (at least at the moment).

								So many unnecessary bad reviews!!! This is not just a game but a game within game creation software!!! It is almost unfair to call it a game. I swore to myself after so many abandon ware or early access quiters or whatever kind of crap game rip off that comes along i was not going to ""buy"" another game. Most of the bad reviews mainly discuss the 2 years in early access. Yes i agree that 2 years is a little long for early access but... the producer is small and METICULOUS so deserves a little slack. o.k. i did not buy this game 2 years ago so maybe my frustration level is not as high as someone who did; but all you have to do is mess around with this ""system/game/what have you"" and you will see the potential this title has. I look at it like this; if you have a game that allows modding or level development you have a virtual unlimited game. Add to this that mod levels are often better than the developers. Look what the world has given us with the Bethesda products! Skyrim is 5 years old and is still relevant in any current game of the year discussion. This title has not reached that level but it has the possibility. As far as updates to this game?? After i promised to not ""buy"" any other games i started to keep an eye on this one. I started in January and by May there were significant additions and changes to this title so that i decided to break my decision and purchase this game.  I am not sorry i did...btw i have significantly more time in this title than is illustrated.			"

								10/10 The best spider attack simulator ever produced. They really get their money's worth on the voice actor who said ""Marauders are ransacking your village"" which roughly translates to ""A spider too strong to be fought by anything you have is killing all 100 of your villagers and there is nothing an army could do to stop it"" and this happens every 30 seconds or so once you have about that many villagers...In all seriousness the game could be amazing but is a waste of time and money until the game is finished.

								I was hesitant to buy another Early Access game, but I'm glad I got this one. Although you can tell it is far from finished, what is available in terms of gameplay is enjoyable. So far this is a sandbox village builder with a little army building/combat. The presence of good voice acting and polished graphics/UI is something I have missed with indie games and makes it feel like a quality project in the works. I really like being able to zoom in up close and watch the villagers go about their lives. Your military villagers have inventories and take upgraded gear and weapons, and I look forward to seeing that fully implemented.Micromanaging resource production is neat, though on the easy map not really necessary as there is no challenge to keeping up resources. At this time there are 3 maps to play in sandbox mode and they are not randomly generated yet. That will be a nice feature to see.As far as drawbacks, it's too early to start critiquing. If I had to come up with a gripe it would be that the game can feel a little slow and it would be nice to have a hotkey to speed things up occasionally rather than tweaking it in settings. I also could not sit through the tutorial, but after skipping to sandbox it didn't take long to figure everything out with trial and error.I am excited to see where this game goes and the activity and responsiveness of the devs gives me hope that this could end up a really fun game at completion.

Early Access Review
								Ok definitely a good game. Actually it’s a phenomenal game! Some people complain about it being in alpha for a bit too long. Personally Idc, I'd rather they took t heir time to polish it than release it early and have it be incomplete. Before you read all the way through though, Ive only played the game for a few hours, and haven’t beaten any of the maps yet, so this review comes from limited experience and knowledge.The Good:-It’s fun and challenging, especially after you've progressed past your basic buildings (woodcutter, stonecutter and a food source) -Challenging, but not too challenging.♥♥♥♥♥♥wanders into your town to cause a bit of havoc and stretch your resources. But you don’t have Beholders and Owlbears coming into town to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up with lasers from their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on a regular basis. They took most of my favorite things from Age of Empires, and combined it with my favorite things from Banished (also a good game, check it out) and then threw in a pinch of Skyrim/Oblivion and Stronghold 2. The result is amazing. You can't just turtle-up and mass an army of foot soldiers to steam roll from one end of the map to the other like you can in AoE. However it’s not as stupidly infuriatingly wonderfully hard as Banished is.-It has the added bonus of being actually able to create soldiers (unlike Banished), and gives you enemies that you can go fight and loot. But by no means do you have to. If you like, you can just focus on the drinking of ale, the smoking of pipe weed, and finding a love of gardening.-If you do decide to go out and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up, it’s a challenge. The♥♥♥♥♥♥you fight keeps, proportionally, 1 step above you. So you have to actually engage in your combat. Most games allow you to step on spiders and kill mice and call it experience. Folk Tale does not.-Individuality of the peasants. Now 9 out of 10 times this doesn’t actually matter. The 1/10 of the time it does is in the army. You can, after you've killed something, loot it for gear and treasure! So ♥♥♥♥ing neat, cause with that gear, you can equip Joe the manure shoveling leper, with the Mithril Great sword of ♥♥♥♥off and the Diamond Chest plate of Not In My House ♥♥♥♥♥, and then make Joe the savior of the land, riding valiantly on the monstrous size of his own♥♥♥♥♥♥which he presumably discovered after finding out he was such a badass and could slay demons with his own♥♥♥♥♥♥and a can-do attitude. Each peasant can be leveled up uniquely and it’s ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. You can either take the equipment or divide it out between your forces, making a well-rounded security force that is to be reckoned with. Or pour all of your resources into one hulking behemoth that could fight and beat Zeus, god of gods.-Visually pleasing to look at-Audio is likewise pleasing (kind of reminiscent of LOTR [which is the best series of movies ever made by mankind])-There's a great variety of building to be placed and they all do different things.-Enemies get more difficult to beat the further you venture from your starting point.♥♥♥♥♥♥gets crazy yo'.The Bad:Actually I don’t like 'bad' cause really this game is a gem in the making. So we’re going to say the Mediocre.The Mediocre:-The Elasticity leaves something to be desired                This is one big category cause every problem I have comes back to this blanket criticism. What I mean is that       the game doesn’t flow as smoothly as it could have. 1.	Buildings= There's a variety of buildings, which is good yes, but I feel some of them could be condensed. For instance I had run out of clothes and my villagers began to complain as their nips were starting to fall off from frostbite. Tight. Places Cotton field. Good. Places Tailor. Good, clothes will start to be produced. Wrong. Turns out you also had to place a “Weavers Emporium”. So my warehouse had stockpiled like 50 stocks of weaved cotton, that I then had to go into overtime to catch up on both rewarding and lashing the weavers to get them to work as fast as possible. It just seems to me, that since the only thing you use cotton for is clothes, it seemed kinda silly that you needed 3 ♥♥♥♥ing building to make one product. Placing, monitoring and upkeeping and extra building took away from the flow of the game.2.	Your army/security force (4 people isn’t really an army). I have no problem with the small size, in fact I prefer it, it emphasizes tactics over brute strength. I have a slight issue with the equipping of your soldiers. If there was an ‘equip all’ button, that’d be fantastic. Having to click on the guardsmen, open their inventory, open your inventory. Click boots, move boots, click mail, move mail, click gloves, move gloves, click coif, move coif, then do that 3 to 7 more times is more than a lot tedious and it takes away from the game. Like♥♥♥♥♥♥I got wolves eating Jim the peasant and ♥♥♥♥ing the stonecutters just caught fire I gotta take care of this but noooo first I gotta do this painfully slow process.3.	Researching Tech is a pain. It has a AoE feel of spending resource to research new tech, which is legit. Don’t fix what’s not broke right? Well you can go ahead and buy as many upgrades as you can afford at once, the problem is that once one is done, it won’t bounce to the second one. Say you research Chisels, hammers and masonry. Once Chisels is done, it’ll stop there, till you re-click the building, go to the tech tab and select the next tech to research. It leads to a lot of needles bouncing form building to building to check and recheck what tech is at what progress in what building then bouncing back to select the next tech to research even though you’ve already purchased it. Long story, anyway. It would be nice if, once you’ve bought a tech, it got automatically researched in the order they were purchased.4.	Assigning peasants a job. This one has two in one. So 1.1 you build a building, tight. Assign 3 peasants to chop wood so you can leave your last one to keep foraging berries. Then later, when you have more peasants you go back to the building, assign a 4th peasant. Jim the farmer dies from a goblin attack, go to building and take 1 woodcutter and unassign him. Go to farm, assign new farmer. Now this doesn’t sound TOO annoying and honestly it’s not. This is my smallest beef with Folk tale. It’s nearly remedied by the ability to check a box on each building titles “auto-assign” which automatically makes sure the building is full of workers if able. You do however, have to go to each building and check the box off. Otherwise no luck. It’s be nice if the box was automatically set to autoassign or you could go to the options menu and make it so. Another (preferred) solution would be to do what “Banished” and have an entire menu that shows all the jobs, how many workers could be there, and how many workers are there currently. It accommodates the fast pace of “Banished” where the east section of your village can just die from a surprise earthquake. I think it would do well here In Folk tale to.1.2 This, logically, should be my smallest beef, but it’s not. I like knowing where my peasants are. Like, in Aoe, you have a button to select all inactive peasants, in Stronghold they gather around the fire. In Folk Tale, I’ve got no ♥♥♥♥in’ clue where they are. And that bothers me immensely, as Im more than slightly anal-retentive and I like to specifically assign individuals to certain jobs. When I have to find four free peasants to turn into herbalists by scouring every nook and cranny of my town, its slightly annoying. Anyway. That’s all. Sorry for the long post but I do really love this game already and wanted to offer every thought I had on the matter. As of now, I give it a solid 8.5/10. With some improvements to the flow and elasticity of the game I’d easily and happily give it a 10/10. "

Early Access Review
Folk Tale ReviewFolk Tale is a game that combines elements from a wide spectrum of genres including RTS, citybuilder, simulation, and RPG in order to bring gamers a totally new and unique experience. The game is still in Early Access and it already has an incredible history. I first began tracking this game during its successful Greenlight campaign. It reminded me of a modern take on The Settlers series but I was hesitant to jump on board until I could see whether it would follow the same path as so many of its predecessors or perhaps it would offer us something new. And it has.When Folk Tale originally applied for Greenlight status on Steam, it was planned to be a typical RTS citybuilder simulation with a full-length player campaign. And while many of the features had yet to be fleshed out, the core game structure was already in place. In order to give themselves the greatest chance of funding success, the game developers at Game Foundry decided to ask the Steam Community what they wanted to see in this game and an eventual Community Poll determined that most wanted to see Folk Tale as a sandbox game. I can't recall any other time when a game's development was halted mid-stream and completely shifted in a different direction based on our opinions. But here we are. The team from Game Foundry strapped in and accepted the challenge. This has lead to some timely delays in the game's production and the developers have unfairly caught a lot of criticism for not releasing a finished product yet. Keep in mind, this is the game we decided on and they are doing their best to give us what we asked for even though it added a lot more work for them.  There are still a ton of cool features they plan on adding to this game and they are very active in its production, providing constant updates and weekly progress blogs to keep us informed every step of the way. The game is already in a stable, playable state though. So getting the game now is not a bad idea. And, because the developers are so open and active with the Community, you could possibly help shape part of the game's future.But what can you expect from Folk Tale right now? For starters, the graphics for this type of game are very rich and full of vivid detail. There is a fully-rotational 3D camera that operates smoothly and easily. The user interface is in place and functional, although many of the mouseover tooltips are still missing. Its not too difficult to figure out what each button does though. A majority of the sound effects and voiceovers are now finished. Most all of the buildings and economic/resource elements are in place and functioning properly. Multiple maps are available for play and editor tools have been included already so the Steam Community can already begin working on their own custom additions. The mobs of creatures have been released into the wild and will offer a bit of a challenge during your otherwise tranquil building experience. Loot and treasures can be gathered after defeating enemy threats, which can be used to equip your villagers and troops with better armor and such. A lot of research and upgrades have been added to the game already, but even more is on the way.Many of the planned features are still being developed though. Building upgrades have not been implemented as of yet. Eventually, heroes will be added into the mix but are not available at this time. The villagers and troops have abilities and skill points to be distributed as they gain experience, but currently this feature is not working. All of the villagers still share the same facial image in the user interface when selected. Other units are expected to be added in the future as well (wizards, for example). And since changing from a story-driven campaign to a sandbox style of play, there is no longer a tutorial to get players started. I believe one will be added fairly soon, and if not, I strongly urge the game developers to consider including one in order to familiarize new players with the basic concepts of the game. While I thoroughly enjoy the game already, it is quite clear that there is still a lot of work to be done. If you're one of those players who are only interested in finished products then you might be waiting on Folk Tale for a while.The Good:=======+  Rich and highly detailed graphics+  Quality sound and voice acting+  Fully-rotating 3D camera w/smooth controls+  Variety of buildings and research+  Well-designed economy and resource structure+  Extremely mod-friendly w/editting tools included+  Varying difficulty to offer greater challenge+  Save game feature implemented and working+  Friendly and active game developersThe Bad:======-  No tutorial included-  No skirmish options or goal-oriented features-  While stable, there are still a few bugs-  Mouseover tooltips only half-complete-  Many features still not implemented or under developmentFinal Thoughts:===========Folk Tale is still a long way from completion, but is highly enjoyable already. The team at Game Foundry laid out plans for a game that will offer a multitude of exciting features and they continue to work diligently trying to make it a reality. If they continue down this path then Folk Tale is sure to be a strong candidate for GOTY (whenever its fully released). For those who enjoy real-time citybuilding simulations, I'd encourage you to go ahead and buy the game now since its fully playable. Those who are impatient and only want to experience finished products should add the game to your Wishlist and wait for completion or else you will most likely have a negative experience given the game's currently un-finished form.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

								This game is not very good as it stands. However with a few tweeks it could be pretty good. For example, you need to completly due away with the whole rationing model and rework it entirely. It doesn't really make sense. I have about 1000 peices fo firewood and my town still shows in red. Then I lose people, and then it just cascades from there and I keep losing more and more people until the game is no longer playable at all and I have to start over. Seems rather unstable for a game that has been being work on for years. That is just one example of what needs to change.			"

								So I deleted my first review because it was a year old. Read what I just wrote... A YEAR OLD! Do not waste your money on this game at this time. The game is at 45% complete in 15 months. At this pace it will be almost 3 years before completed. Yes, there are others who will argue that the the game is in beta and that they do a very nice job writing and providing updates about every idea and concept they have. If they spent half the time coding as they do explaining what the final product will be the game would be finished. These are rookies, period! They are using our money to attempt to create a game that I will admit has an interesting concept and fresh approach.  That being said, ideas and concepts does not make a playable enjoyable game. If they do finish this project the game will be one that I play but they do not need anyone else's money until they show more value for the money some of us already spent. 15 months to reach 45% Are you kidding me?

Build up your town, gather all the things, upgrade your buildings, train your peasants and build a bordello next to a monastery, simply because you can! (Plus, monks make some crazy mead...)Even with this being Early Access, I haven't experienced any bugs and have only had a small inconvenience or two, which is less than some of the AAA titles I have played in the past.

Early Access Review
								Overall I had fun playing this game. I don't buy early access based on future promises, and it has enough to offer right now for you to enjoy the game. I think if you enjoy citybuilders its got enough for 15-20 hours of play, and the RPG elements make it unique from other entries in the genre.Having said that, there are definitely some areas I'd love to see improved so that I can come back and play this game some more. A citybuilder and an RPG - This is what makes the game unique. But I would have liked to see some difficulty sliders for each portion of the game. I prefer city builders, and doing the RPG part of the game was honestly a chore. I would have liked a difficulty slider that made the RPG part much easier, and the city builder part a little more challenging.  Level scaling Leveling is a core part of the game. Villagers get better, heroes get better, and monsters get better. But the monster levelling can get pretty annoying, once I had levelled up my heroes to level 6 the monsters had gotten almost too difficult for my troops to take on. I had to rush my heroes around to every little combat event. Until this is fixed I'd like a way to turn off combat level scalling altogether on the village map (for everything except heroes), or don't include the heroes in the monster levelling calculations. To fix it long term I think there should be some kind of training building that slowly adds experience to your lowest levelled troops up to the level of your highest levelled troops. I also think there should be a global ticker that says what the monster level is, and clearly shows what effect you are having on it. I think what effects the monster level should be the size of your city and the amount of loot available in it. So if monsters successfully break your defense and destroy your buildings they would fall down to an easier level. This would also force larger cities to invest more in defense.  Building synergies Right now all of the buildings are very independant, they have their own research paths, and they don't really have any effects on the buildings around them. I think the city-building aspects of this game would be greatly improved if each building also provided some synergistic benefits to nearby buildings. Some of the synergies I'd like to see: Cottage provides bonus to worker productivity of nearby buildings. Since villagers no longer need to walk around to provide for their needs, forcing players to keep the cottage closer could simulate the benefits of having their home close to their workplace.  Sawmill and hunting lodge next to each other. Animals like the tree cover so maybe provide a benefit to animal spawning near a sawmill Towers that are garrisoned will increase the range of nearby buildings. Walls near a gatehouse are strengthened Blacksmith provides small productivity bonus when next to any building that it could provide tools for. Town improvementsIt would be good to get a building that can serve as a research center for general improvements to all buildings. Like a town hall, maybe the supply wagon serves as the first level of the town hall. The town hall would have research available for lower fire chances, increased health of buildings, increased productivity of workers, starting level of new workers, improve xp gains for soldiers/workers, etc. This building could also serve as a lock on tier improvements, like it has to be tier two before other buildings can be tier two. It would be neat if this building replaced the lamppost for fast travel. Maybe this building would also provide a special minor-hero unit 'the mayor' he could level up like other characters. He would be able to cast productivity enhancements on nearby buildings, if ""killed"" he would lose 10% experience but also hide out in the town hall for 2 minutes while he recoveres. RTS improvements -  Rally flags for military buildings. I found it easy to create a choke point where new monsters would go and I would just leave a bunch of my soldiers there. It would be nice if military buildings could create rally flags so new soldiers would automatically go to the spot. Also there need to be a way in the barracks to auto create arbalists or city guards, right now it will default to auto-creating spearmen who are the weakest.  Patrols. I want to be able to assign military units to patrol a certain area. Formation behavior. If I tell a large military group to go to a location, I don't want the cavalry charging in ahead without support from arbalists.That is a long list of suggestions. I don't think they are all absolutely necessary, but they would all be nice to have. If I find out any of these features have been added in the future I will try to ammend my post to reflect those changes with  Strikethrough text  "

								So...People have said it already. I'll say it again. But instead of retyping this, I want you to imagine the following two scenarios:You decide to make a cake. That's pretty simple - add some dough, and some sweet stuff, and you've got a cake. Right. Well, what kind of cake do you want to make? Chocolate? Vanilla? Who knows? Depends on who will be eating it, right? Right? Well, let's go ask those people. But wait! We can make a bigger cake! A better cake! A cake that everyone will love! So we will now have a chocolate / vanilla / starwberry / cheese / ice cream cake baked in a god damn oven but the chilled in a freeze and oh god we really don't know what we any more other than making everyone happy so here is a big pile of burnt cake, melted ice cream, mouldy cheesecake andf you can dig through it and try to find something you like.Welcome to Folk Tale. This game started witha  tons of promise. It has since veered of course...and I'm not sure what this game is going to wind up being. I voted for it on Greenlight, I was really excited for it when it came out on Early Access and did something almost as dumb as sticking my gentleman's sausage in a drawer and slamming it fully♥♥♥♥♥♥ I believed that the developers would stick to their original vision and deliver the game they said they set out to make.Ahahaha. Aha. Aaaahahaha. Yeah. Nope.This game is one of the many reasons why I no longer buy into Early Access - I've seen them do this exact kind of thing too many times, which is a shame. I love this style of game. I've player Settlers since Settlers two, I've played the Anno series, Sim City series - any kind of management / city buidling game, I really look forward to. It is an underserved market, and Folk Tale had the potential to be really cool. But then, the devs threw their vision out the window to try to appease to everyone (I mean, sandbox games are the hip thing now, right? Right?! Everyone loves sandbox! So hip! So cool! Like beards and old bicycles and plaid...yeah.)Basically, this is going nowhere. It has been in Early Access for ""A Very Long Time"". I really don't know what's going to come out of it, but I can't recommend anyone buy this until it's done and released - at which point, you might at least have a chance at knowing what you're buying.F*@*!* Early Access.

								This seems to be a very promising game.  I played it about a year ago and it was a different game, so I was surprised when decided to try it again the other day.  It's now a sandbox city builder with a pending campaign mode.  I checked out the forums today and the devs seem to be pretty active in answering questions and giving updates, which is awesome.  I'm a big fan of old city builders like Caesar 3, Zeus, & Pharaoh, and I enjoyed Banished a lot, but found it kind of boring after the first couple hours.  If the campaign and future quests turn out like they're planned, Folk Tale should be a great game.  I've played a couple sandbox maps and I've enjoyed it.  I'm very much looking forward to future updates!			"

								Sandbox mode Campaign review. Word of advice - wait for the full release - the Early Access is just pure frustration. The Campaing can be finished in literally 1h if not less, and is just to put it simply, incomplete in so many ways. A lot of the functionality is not implemented yet, while some of it is there but not very innovative.I want to like this game but cannot in the current state. Feel like I spent €17 on a product that is less than 25% complete - I'm sorry to say but I feel cheated by this EA - it should be called VERY Early Access.I hope to change my mind upon the full release.

								If you like building along with tactical defense and RPG this is the game for you. In campaign mode you will need to build palasades ASAP to block raiding spiders. Building a single palasade on the other side of bridges saves resources early on. Then you can stage your heroes by the main spawn outside your village until you have the resources to build a full length fence there. Add a market so you can unlock spider bounties in your research. Now you will have lots of gold for research. Building a blacksmith and researching halberds and xbows will get you the city guards and crosbowmen you need. Stage the crossbow guys on gate house facing a known spider spawn and watch them crank the gold and xp for you. You can add towers to either side of the gatehouse as you see fit. If you get bored of building take out your heroes for adventure and exploring. Research,adventure and building. For me this game is amazing. Even my slower Dell Inspiron 660 with 6gb of ram can handle this game okay. Using the experimental build runs a bit slower and sometimes it sits at 92% for about 1 min then its fine. Cant wait to see what they add next. Marathon gaming sessions may occur so they should add a warning about how addictive this game is LOL :)			"

								Wow, I'm pretty surprised at all the hate this game gets. Is it perfect...no, but overall I find it fun. Sure the development has taken awhile, however it's been updated fairly regularly to add new parts to the game. It's certainly not a dead project for the devs, and I see that as a positive for the future. I'll pop in every couple months and play through a game mostly for the RTS side of things. The dungeon crawling bit is just a cherry on the top for me. I'd recommend this title to anyone that enjoys building their little settlement into a village, all while fending off the invaders that inevitably try and take the comforts your villagers enjoy.Overall it's been worth my 20 bucks. 8/10, would buy again.

								Folktale’s elegance is noted in its simplicity. By, only being an RTS, RPG, Village Builder, and World Editor; with accompanied feature such as character progression, multi-tier crafter and building, dynamic worlds, a wide verity of units and heroes, and lastly accompanied by a multi-pathway questing system, which utilises all the functionality of the very powerful Workbench tool, Folktale takes the modest and humble themes of traditional game development and innovates to point where a new genre of gaming is created.	Created with the Unity engine, GamesFoundry have created a game, which occupies a niche of its own. Folktale’s RTS gameplay is common to its contemporaries; accordingly, the new or aged gamer will find the left mouse and right mouse button clicking an easy mechanism to grasps. Classically there are units to counter units, units to tank, units to heal, and units to shoot or be shot at. Heroes too, will find a suitable place in the players armies, filling a diverse roll based on which and what stats the player has chosen, perhaps electing the hero to focus on their DPS, or their PTSD if the war wages for a little longer than necessary. Sometimes, maybe, war is not the only way to peace. In fact war for peace is an oxymoron. Or is it? It is.  	However before sending your lovely villages to war for that plus 10% increase in wood production, perhaps the player would first like to contemplate the mechanics of the game’s village building. Unique only to its self, Folktale’s village management requires the constant attention of the play; for, lest the play grows lax in the exploration of Folktale’s many regions, caves, dragon’s lair and sepulchre like dungeons, the player might find that goblins, or kobolds, or yetis, or tall wooden things with weird pulsating fungi erupting from what one would mistake as their head, are coming to set fire, steal and kill your, lovely, lovely villagers. Certainly these villagers are the example of sophistication. Surly the player will never once more find people with tastes so refined, as they would find here, in this game. Surly.  	In short Folktale is a beguiling game, forming a flawless compilation of game mechanics and visuals, the development team have created for the player the perfect complement for an afternoon of luxurious gaming. So why not now, before the sun sets on another day of wasted opportunity. “Do not the valent find the days of weary, home, hearth and Folktale calling their names”…ISH…			"

								I definetly have to recommend this game, i got it at the very early stages and i had to say that the game itself was decent it was humorus with the lack of toast in the game.... I stopped playing the game for awhile but when i had come back to Folk Tale i saw that the game had developed from just an easy building tutorial game into something really exciting. The game mechanics have gotten updated and made the game more challenging and the amount of buildings and how the economic system in the game have become make the game just that more interesting reminding me of a stronghold mixed with age of empires online feel as the game uses the same popularity scale as stronghold but has the ransacking destruction of age of empires online when your villages are big enough and you go questing. The tundra and swamp maps are pretty challenging if you dont understand the game at first because of the lack of resources or even the amount of orcs coming at you all at once. Overall this game is a very fun game, very humorous and has tons of potential and i cannot wait until the game is completed! One thing i hope for is a added multiplayer option where you can build and compete against your friends in a rival trade town.			"

								This is the first review I have ever written, and I was compelled to write it to make sure people who are interested in this game feel confident in supporting it despite the (currently) mixed reviews.I thoroughly enjoyed the tutorial when I first purchased this game, but as the devs focused on the sandbox mode I was hesistant to give it much of a go.  Most of the negative reviews are people who weren't happy with this decision, as I initally was.  After spending some time in sandbox mode, I can see that this game is still going to be something unique and intersting.  With the sandbox genre getting beat to death by developers over the last few years, Folk Tale is a breath of fresh air and a fascinating perspective on the genre.The resource gathering is challenging but understandable and logical.  The sense of humor is on point but not over-the-top.  The RPG elements of crafting, equipping, and experience for the villagers are unlike any other game I have played.  While only having spent 3 hours playing as of writing this game, each time I return to it I am greeted by improvements and new and fun mechanics to learn.Despite how interesting and intriguing the game itself is, the main point I wanted to make in writing this review is that this game will make you feel rewarded for supporting the developers in Early Access.  They are accessible, focused, responsive, and provide a great sense of involvement and community in the developing of this game.  Early Access can be messy, it can be fun, but it the case of Folk Tale, participating in Early Access is as much of an adventure as the game is.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.			"

								If I could get a refund on my purchase I would. I honestly wouldn't mind the 2 year early access wait if I hadn't gotten my expectations flung in the garbage. I bought this game when it had a story mode and quest lines, now it is a very ambiguous sandbox that has lost all enjoyment. Anticipation turn into betrayal.Folk Tale taught me never to buy Early Access againEDIT:So it has now been another year since I wrote the original review. Folk Tale is still in early Access but leaps and bounds have been made to get it on the right track. Not sure if new leadership in the project or not but it is starting to come together, still not the game that was promised when I originally bought it, but neither is my marriage. I still can not recommend at this point because with the sporadity of the changes who knows what it will be in another year. Do not purchase this game until it is out of early access. When it is, I will assess it and happily change my review to a roaring success if it deserves it.			"

								""Review is after Rant. Spaced appart and marked clearly""So I was responding a to  a4440a's review and steam said my post was to long, what I was going to post:""I have no issue that they askedd for positive feedback. They even said in the request that if you feel that the game does deserve the negative feedback it's been getting that it's on them. But requesting the people who do enjoy it to have their voices heard is not wrong. People are WAY more likely to post things when they feel negatively about something than when they feel positive. As a person who works in retail we ask for customer feedback to know how we did andd to see that we made a persons experience enjoyable. So few people actually give positive feedback for anything and there post looks no different then when a clerk asks for feedback about the service. And more than 98% of people don't give feeddback if not asked. I know this because 2% is our goal and we rarely hit it with asking.Also the Dev's seem to be pretty good at responding to every review. So the dev team is clearly still active. Even coming back to this review after they had responded when a new patch came out. That's fantastic service. ""It should be noted one of his/her main issues was that they had asked for the fans and people who were enjoying the game to give feedback. They didn't force anyone to. They merely, and quite frankly very politely, asked people to give feedback. Yet he/she, like many others, made it seems like a horrible thing that they had done. like they had enroached on their freedoms and it was unethical and immoral. infact a few posts stated it was immoral. . . SERIOUSLY????And it made me realise ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is that people have been treating this game and dev's like dirt. This game is someone's and like a group of someone's dream. They may not get patches out as fast as some other dev's but they also haven't abbandoned it like SO many early access games before them. I've been watching this game and sure it's taking a while but they are working on it. It is looking good slowly but surely. They're working hard a doing a damn fine job. If you really don't think so then why not try writing some lines of code to fix the issues you are having with the game yourself and submit it to then, and wait to see what conflicts it causes in the code. Then A) you could see just how long it takes to actually write the code and B) how it almost always creates more errors that will need fixing. And hey if you do a great job maybe they could use you or you could make your own game, who knows. You don't that's for sure, not till you try.to wrap up keep it up guys/gals ignore the haters and the nay sayers. The doom talkers and the ones who act holier than thou. They aren't making a game they aren't dealing with crap you are and they are just being plain old rude. As promised (key dramatic drum beat) BUM BUM BUM (Thank you band, I'd be lost without you) REVIEW TIME!!!!!!!!So been watching this game for a while, and as horrible as this may sound at first I ask you to hear it out, I even pirated this game when it had that short story with the monastery/temple thing in the snow with if memory serves were-wolves? I don't really condone piracy flat out but clearly not against it. It's a grey area for me. I believe in supportive piracy. Demo's don't really exist any more and the few that do are tailored to be as appeasing as possible which sometimes ends up being NOTHING like the game in question. So I coined the term supportive piracy, in which is you like what it was you pirated you go out of your way to support them by buying the program, movie or whatever and or donating too them the amount. Because if you support them they will make more of the things you like, and not go bankrupt. Rules for supportive piracy is if you find yourself playing it for the full story line and enjoying it. . . SUPORT ITFind your self playing it for more than 5 hours?. . . SUPPORT ITWhen back to play more after the first week you DL'd it. . . SUPPORT ITAny one of those equalls a support even if say you only played for an hour the first week then a week and a half (or longer) later you go back and play again. Yea that counts. Sorry rant. . .As I was saying I had pirated the game. It was lacking in content, and was over fairly shortly. But it had promise, still does.so I followed it on steam and added it to my wish list so I'd know if it went on sale. It did and my buddy gifted it to me, before I was ready to buy it and after I asked for a diff game.But I decided to try it out again it had been a while, a LOT had changed graphics are way better and the interaction with your citizens is really cool. the voice acting is fun and enjoyable and has that classic british. . . smart ace to it. Is there more to be done? Sure but it's coming along very nicely and i'm excited to see what they do. It's also going a diff way then I originally hoped it would but that's not surprising I have yet to find the game style I have envisioned in my noggin. As someone else had said it's a bit like banished but simpler. And not just in difficulty but also in concept. However also has different features, that being the exploring RPG elements that make the simpler city building aspect fit. I don't think the hard ships and deep intricacies that banished has would work well while you're out leading your troops in battle.All in all I'd say the game is very enjoyable For those wondering about the game concept in my nogginI guess the closest thing it would be is a castle/city builder. But builder is wrong word. . . more like upgrader. You take on the role of the person/thing/higher power? in charge. You don't control the movements of anyone (like in banished). You control what get's upgraded where funds go, perhaps the blacksmith which allows him to upgrade his furnace, or higher on additional help. Funds into captain of the guard so he can reinforce the walls with more guards or the barracks for having an army. You can also decide if certain upgrades need to be researched or if an attack is coming to call the citizens in behind the walls. As time goes on and the city grows outer walls would be made, your army goes out and secures roads from bandits. if you declare war your generals and armies attack but how and when they choose. your only concern is uprgrading the castle, city and such.

								My biggest issue right now is that lack of a save feature for sandbox mode. I know it's coming in the future, so I'll just wait it out. Since the tutorial is clearly different from the what seems to be the final form of the game, it's hard to say for certain what the game will be like. I can say, without a doubt, I enjoyed the tutorial thoroughly and believe wholeheartedly that when the game is finished, it will be amazing.			"

If you enjoy village/city builders this is really one to watch.  "

								Personally, I never check out Reviews on games submitted to Steam simply because I don't care to read negative comments or the ones that  feel more like rants to me. It's the game, not the player's opinions that makes me want to try it out. So I just go to You Tube to look for videos showing a players 'first-run' of games to see if anything might interest me. And that's just what happened for me when I found a 'Let's Try' You Tube video by VertigoTeaparty for Folk Tale. I was so excited about the city building theme blended with RPG elements I didn't hesitate to come here and buy it. I've been waiting for something like this for years and am so happy to be playing it now, bugs and all.If you're interested in this game remember it's still an Alpha game, it's still growing and constantly changing just like any small child. They both comes into the world all new, still growing and changing until they're full grown. It can take a long time, but it can be very rewarding to watch and experience the process along the way. I really enjoy this game and being a small part of it's growth by sharing any constructive feedback when I find what might seem like little odd bits and bobs. Maybe it's because I'm a Mom of 2 grown children and know what it's like to feel the pride and joy of watching something I had an important hand in helping them grow into mature adults, and how it can sometimes hurt when someone doesn't like what you've created just because it's young and not yet fully grown. In all, I really want Folk Tale to keep on growing  into a full fledged game that will be played and enjoyed by others looking for a unique gem of a game that I think this will turn out to be.			"

								I bought this game this morning.  I've played for about 9 hours so far.  I maxed out everything in my village and have killed just about everything on the map.  It seems when you chop down trees you have to replant with seeds.  So far the only way I found to obtain seeds is to kill monsters.  Eventually the monsters no longer respawn and then you can't find any more seeds.  So you wind up running out of firewood, and your villagers declare that your village sucks (literally) and start to leave.  I was unable to find a way to reverse the mass exodus, and became frustrated.  I really want to like this game, and I hope eventually I will when the devs finish with it.  Right now it just seems there's no way to sustain a permanent village in sandbox mode, and that's unfortunate.  I am going to give this game a thumbs up regardless in hopes that things will change soon.  Its worth the $15 I paid for it on sale.  I wouldn't pay much more than that though.			"

								Good Concept, excellent models and graphics, however lacks many things and has a few bugs, needs more balance. After i reach about 35 - 40 population things go haywire, stocks run low on everything no matter how much i supply, and if i manage to get stocks under control no matter how much I have stored i contantly get a flow of ""running out of so-and-so, villagers need this, villagers need that"" etc. A functioning supply chain for everything needed is difficult, as once you get enough villagers to work the proper amount of buildings for the supplies needed, there arent enough in each building to properly supply the amount of villagers total (I.e. 30 villagers total split between the many buildings sucha as farms, fishery, iron and stone mines, weavers and bakers and hunters and woodcutters, but with only 4 in each building they are unable to supply the amount needed for the population as a whole. Too few villagers with too high of demand split between too high of a variety of buildings, making it near impossible to have a steady supply chain.UI could use some improvement as well, need to go through many menus and options to do simple tasks for certain things like hire and fire workers from certain buildings, can't scroll through the list of available villagers to employ but have to choose from top three, when attempting to send your villagers to attack threats its difficult to select the threat nd not accidentally send your villagers to simply run past them to where you clicked, notices disspear to quickly for you to read what they are for, and there is a button up top to go to settings but not menu, being forced to hit the esc key in order to quit the game which is only minor but an annoyance.With improved functionality this can be a great game but as it is right now, hardly playable to past 30 or so villagers.

								So I read alot of, don't be fooled by the bad reviews, reviews and thought it sounded fun and I would give it a try and I though it seemed decent til I realized it's no where near done if you like playing with editors and building your own stuff you will love it. if you want to play a game choose something else the campaign is super short, SUPER short. So I focused on my town and grew it pretty quick then grew it some more now it's to laggy to do much of anything tried turning down all the setting still stayed super laggy tried to find away to turn off the little numbers floating up every where could not find it any where though doesn't really matter who laggy it's become because there's pretty much no where left to build anything. I played the sandbox it's sandbox mode there's no real goal you just kill everything yo ucan find and build another city til it becomes to laggy again. like I said if you really like building you're own stuff the editor is pretty awesome and you'll probably love it but if you're looking for a game to play look else where.

If you want a storyline, well you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck for getting this when it was first put out over two years ago as an Early Access.

Nice job for both you and Project Zomboid ^^Finished tutorial, even that was fun. What i want in future?- A long story mode.- An open, huge world (maybe in distant future?).- Dynamic weather system (sorry if there is not in tutorial).- Co-op? That would be amazing.

								Folk Tale is shaping up to be a very good game. The developer responds to posts on the forums, regular weekly and monthly updates on the progress of the game, a breakdown of what they are currently working on, and next weeks tasks.The game is regulary updated, the developer asks for feedback on the the lastest patches, and responds to any issues discovered.The game is great, you get to build a township, fight the local beasts and enemies, now we are strating to get dungeon crawling as well. Recent patches have allowed you to build your township, pacify the area, then travel to the next area and build another township etc. You can send your heroes back and forth between sheets now.There is a inbuilt editor to design your own sheets and campaigns, there have been some really impressive buildings posted on the forum, and community made sheets/maps are starting to take off.The game is worth the price in my opinion, I am look forward to the next patch each time.

								Folk Tale is a fun city builder that puts you in the role of creating a town in order to help the citizens of the countryside recover after being exploited by bandits. You set off on your journey as you build lumber mills and stone works to collect the necessary resources for further your construction. Firewood, food, clothing, mead and many others resources are just a few of the things your citizens will want as you progress to a higher Culture rating. Your culture rating will determine the current needs of your people and when they will ask for the next set of items to keep them happy and working, fail to anticipate there needs could spell doom for your town, but be ever watchful as there are enemies all about just wanting for their time to take your city down. A RPG style of hero leveling allows for your characters to grow with you as you explore and build your way to victory.Pros:-	The beautiful graphics and music pulls you into the game and adds that immersion feeling as you delve ever deeper.-	The story is both well written and quite humorous at times, allowing you to grow a bond for the characters you control and care what happens to them as you make choices that will change the story line.-	The multiple choices you are presented with that can change the story from one play through to the next allow for the replay value to be quite high and very enjoyable.-	The controls of the game are quite easy to manage and allow for a very close view of your towns people or a high up god like view of your entire village.-	A simple at first building technique that opens up and becomes much more detailed as your understanding of the game grows, allowing for novice and expert players alike to find something here they can enjoy.Cons:     -	The game is still in early access so you are bound to find a bug or two from time to time. This isn’t so much a con as it is just a fact and often times doesn’t even factor into taking any of enjoyment away that’s to be had in the game.In conclusion, Folk Tale is a fun city builder that will take you through a journey you won’t soon forget, hours of fun building your cities will make your time here both enjoyable for those who like combat and for those who don’t. 4 out of 5.

Early Access Review
								The game starts up well enough, even looks mighty impressive. However, there are some simple things to note even after over three years of early access. First of all, not everything is completed with in this game, ie, upgrades, units, buildings, quests, and such. The basics/core elements of game play with this game are not finished yet. Secondly, the story /quest line is no where near finished yet. The first bit is complete, and after three years seems to be bug free other than some loading issues on occasion when transitioning. The second quest/chapter is however riddled with bugs currently. From random allies attacking you to quests which cannot be completed due to a freezing in timers. Thirdly, in order to survive you will have to spend hours upon hours just setting up your village and nothing else. This is mostly in part due to the slow resource gain in comparrison to upgrade costs and villager demand. Resource gain is very slow and upgrade cost, even the beginning ones, is very expensive. Don't even think you will have any village defences until you have at least devoted four to six hours of play just building up your village.I really belive that this game has potential, but it's going to be a while before it is any where near complete. I would reccomend giving it a try if you are into beta's/alpha's and like to bug test things. But, as far as it being a playable game at this point, I am going to have to say it's a no go.			"

								Folk tale is a fantasy RPG village builder, where you expand your village of peasant thriving market town, while  recruiting heroes, warriors and other worker to protect agents the evil.The game has a unique design, characters and is open for expanding, aswell for tax rating. The crafting system is a little bit annoying since it takes alot of your time. The sound of this game is really good, aswell for acting. But it's too ""childish"". The tutorial part gives a really good understanding about the dynamics about this game and how it should be running. Animations seems great, aswell for their running. It's looks funny. The controls of workers is great since you can pick anyone, and move him around or mark more at the same time. They do have looting inventory each of them. Upgrading buildings / expanding seems fine, but doesn't give as much profit or something like ""5% building speed"", since we have to buy additional upgrading seperated. - Which means, one skill at a time. So you can't make any ""process three"". The only negative thing i found about this game, is that there isn't any multiplayer. It would be a bit fun to play co-op or agens each other.Here is my old demo:

								Standard neat idea game, has room to be really cool. Assuming that keep supporting the game, they don't pull a Godus and change everything, the game feels like it can be a lot of fun. Updates tend to be small but regular (like that a lot). If they keep the current pace, game should be complete in 2-3 years which for all the future content feel, is aggressive in my mind.			"

								I recommend more buildings. It feels way too similar to the standard Banished buildings. What about playing other factions and seeing how their builds are? Their way of society? Different heroes? Other races? Humans are too plain cause it's all the same. More military and civilian structures would be nice.Aside from that, the idea for the game is a 10/10.I'll continue to edit the review as more things are updated to the game.Things found...1. When Willow stuns Gregory, his animation stops. O.02. Skirmish mode for hunters? They die too easily. 3. Resources for leather are very limited in beginning. Wolves and deer don't respawn as much to even collect their fur; to build the structure for clothing in time; before peasents begin leaving.4. (Fixed) During Tutorial, when the dialog comes up, camera and selection is disabled until player finishes dialog. This hinders doing things one step at a time during the tutorial for the speed of learners.			"

								I waffled on getting this game because of the mixed reviews, but then it went on sale, and I read some of the more recent reviews, and I bought in.TLDR; BEST DECISION.

I got as far as possible in it and am looking supremely forward to more content being added, more dungeons and more campaigns.			"

Early Access Review
								When I first got this game in Early Access, I was intrigued. Not a lot was implemented, but I wanted to see where the game would go. After letting it sit for a while, I decided to pick it back up, and I've been pleasently surprised with how far the game has come. There's still a lot to be implemented, but this is a fun game overall. The graphics are good and the economy is fairly well balanced. The crafting system as of this review is still fairly basic, but both it and the building upgrade systems add depth. The music is quite nice and certainly adds to the experience. My one knock against the game so far is that the military units you can recruit are weak and, even with some in game improvements (armor and weapons), they do not stack up well to your opponents. So, while it's still very much a work in progress, it's a very playable, enjoyable work in progress.			"

								This game is super fun! they blend several genres into one soo well. im not a huge fan on city builder RTS games but this game blends RPG elements into the mix and i love it! The project lead has weekly streams to give overview of new features, answer player's questions, and give sneak peaks at future features curently in development and direction they are going.The community involvment the developers take is unheard of in AAA titles and will even scrap a feature if players have issues with it. they have a clear timeline for future features and will look into any recomendations that the community gives if it has enough support and makes sence. the graphics are realy good kinda inbetween WoW and TES Skyrim, The animations are smooth and high quality. the camera contols take a bit to master at first but becomes easer the more you use them. the main gameplay has a slight learning curve to master with enimy atacks and exploration. the map designer is amazing  its easy to pick up and learn and the ability to make any landscape you want and play on the map is the best. the turrain is tile based not mesh so you cant fine tune certain aspects but the developers have included ALOT of tiles for many map features and have incuded props to add extra feartures you can add by hand.So I would recommend this game to anyone interested in the concept of a RPG-RTS game and would recomend watching the streams and go to the forums if your unsure, but you wont regret it.

								My first few hours on Folk tale is fun and disturbed at the same time. Tutorial is always what I go first and it left me with a bad impression with ""Bob and a mouse."" I need a straight forward tutorial, not that I hate the fact that the devs spent time making a story instead of a plain tutorial, but i just want to get into the game asap. So I kindda hate lengthy tutorial filled with texts, I had to read every words because I don't want to miss anything. Combat system is soso. I had a question with decisive victory skill though, it only deal 3 to 6 dmg even to a low health enemy when normal attack deal 20+ dmg. And if any heroes encounter combat anywhere on the main map, it said village is under attack. I read through review and comments, i saw someone said villagers will flee the battle when their health below 50% but that ain't happened in my case. Villagers fought to their death. And for the last thing to mention, I want an adjustable mini map, or a better one. I know you have UI scaling but I just only want a bigger mini map alone, everything else stay the same. I just bought Age of mythology a few days ago and its mini map work better than folk tale.Don't be mistaken, I don't hate this game. It looks like fun and has a good concept. But it still needs lots of work to make it shine. I will recommend only if I love it, but Folk tale is not there yet, just a good prospect with lots of potential.			"

								It's actually pretty awesome. Unlike some games that are alike this function to some degree as a realistic village. You can't just spam units because you can only support the population of your town which makes it far more realistic than some other RTS games. The game is just really limited. The campaign is alot of running between two places to talk to someone, but the gameplay overall provides enough to keep you busy. In addition, the sandbox mode needs some work. It includes the same people as the campaign but no one is good or bad, you have to kill everything on the map for some reason, no one is your ally. And sandbox is very limiting because after you annihilate your opposition with your one soldier, there's nothing else to do. No one attacks or anything. But overall, I love the economy system of managing a village and is why I recommend this game.			"

								I know this game much more than my play time :)I am following them since first IndieDB post.The game idea, concept and gameplay is really nice. I found no bugs so far and I really want to support the developers. Some may say that it is in development for a very long time, but that what happens when you build something with the community and their feedback. It is great.PROS- Concept works, the idea of having a village, grow it and use your characters is really nice- Graphics are nice and it fits the game humor- Easy learning at the beginning, but when your village gets big, know where to use your villagersCONS- Particles and combat FX are poor at the moment- Camera movement looks ""clunky"" sometimes- More shortcuts and control like similar strategy games would be betterAll in all, I still see potential and the game is working... small bugs happen but, in my case, nothing that breaks my game.

								It's good.  Just know that it's not done but it's the game you want, and since they are active dev's, I'd say pls buy XD and help the dev's make this even better.That being said, low content, got through it all very quickly.  Wish it were more, feel unsatisfied.... I really should change this to a negative review :PP.S.Where's my money?!!			"

								I initially held off on Folk Tale due to the mixed reviews of it in 'early' early access.Today, Folk Tale is a great game that combines the best features of games like Settlers and Banished with the lite ARPGs like Fate and Torchlight.I highly recommend it if you're into both genres.			"

If the editor can come through, which is looking pretty good already, then high replay value.  Hoping the Devs stay with it and stay on target.  I recommend giving it a chance.			"

								I bought this game awhile back and it doesn't really seem like anything has been done with it.  I keep seeing where they've done updates and I've checked it out fairly regularly.  The game just doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  There are a lot of aspects to this game that would make it a good game, however it seems like the devs have any real interest in working on them.  In the past year about the only thing they've really added was a save feature.  Just stay away from this mess.  I have a feeling this game will never get out of early access.  After playing this game again I have decided to change my review to possitive.  A lot has been fixed in the game, and it's made an astonishing turn around.  There a still a few bugs, and things which have yet to be put into the game, but unlike before it looks like this game is going places.			"

								I played about 5 hours of this game straight through and felt as though I had a decent handle on the mechanics. I cannot, in good conscience, give this game a thumbs up at this time. The graphics and rendering were great, considering that it is an Early Access title. As always, a statement like that comes with some caveats.  This game has potential, however, it is essentially a Warcraft 3 map, with a world-map feature--- minus the ""War"" part of ""Warcraft"".It is a working title, and I expereinced no major bugs, crashes or hangups during my experience. Based on lack of content and replayability, I stand by my thumbs down.			"

Early Access Review
								Still has a lot of potential as a mix of city/village building and ARPG.Good graphics and such, good mechanics and concepts, close to being very fun.  Played it through a bit of the campaign - so some of the items below I may not have seen yet.City building - relatively simplistic.   Tough to precisely place buildings, planting of saplings to keep trees going can obscure items/people.  Inherently I think I want roads, but goes against the current concept of just plopping buildings down.   I don't know why but I find it annoying to not be able to group things together easily like I want.   Might just be needing to work from the starting village and starting from a blank field may be better.  Anyway, personal preferences while it all 'works'.Action - Like the idea, concepts, etc.   Still feels cumbersome to control units and use abilities.   Can hotkey unit groupings to number keys, but can also use number keys to assign skills.   Missing something with the multiple heroes and abilities - think it needs a tab to next character in the group.Itemization is tough so far, but think I'm early enough that it may change.  I've found the 3rd hero and killed the dragon but only have 3 uncommon items so far.   Would be very useful if the non-equip able items greyed out when changing hero selection.   Alternatively let anyone wear anything with stat requirements.Stats are underwhelming.   Leveling up is underwhelming.Think it would be much better to be able to pick your starting hero and skill them up yourself.  Still keep it simple, but give some level of customization.I'll play it a bit more and then maybe wait for the next update.1/12/17 update:Experimental build update helped quite a bit - pause, better balance.  Also played the sandbox mode, liked that quite a bit.   Odd mechanic to start over on a new map though - doesn't seem like you really need to do anything since heroes don't need upkeep.   So, really - what's the point of building a town other than maybe crafting?    Still missing something - played a couple hours a few times now and I want to explore the map, so that's good.   Think there should be more/better encounters.   I don't care about stats/RPG aspect that much, think that should be tweaked.  Maybe extend the # of levels and add skill adds/increases.    Itemization is meh still.   I got 4 rare items!  They're all worker equipment :(  Haven't built a single military unit yet.  Haven't felt the need.No real challenge to building a good economy, unless you forget to build the distribution building like i did a few times.Wish I'd gotten it on sale, but not that sad if they keep up with the updates.

								Great game. Build your city and play a party of heroes, like only few other games out there. In your city, you'll research, collect and work on resourses, recruit, equip items, even do some crafting and build defense turrets and so on. Furthermore, in campaign mode, you can find a somewhat rich and somewhat long history, in which heroes will join your party while you interact with their original tribes. There's also a sandbox mode available to explore. And, although it's in alpha, there's a tutorial.Since the game isn't finished, there's still work to do, like implementing turrents and more heroes on sandbox mode, balancing/limiting respawns of monsters around city, balancing the army's strength so it can be more useful, maybe adding some more depth to the strategy/citybuilding dimension of the game, implementing a hotbar for better use of heroes' skills, adding a pause option etc.The game has been in alpha for too long and there's still work to do. But I can understand that: I think the game is so far great and there's originality in it.			"

								I like how much this game reminds me of the original fable.  It is almost like the fable we never got but this is in it's own league (RTS). early access, early access, early access....zzzzz why the good ones not the first ones down the tube,  I wholeheartedly recommned this game for 3 simple reasonsIt remembers it is a game and not some repetitive AAA shelf trophy with a new shiny graphic here or there, it brings excitement to it updates and it is quite playable in its state right now with only growth in sight.its another welldeserving title!Mostly though that I'm a fan of bundling genres and settings togethers across multiple styles of play abilities and this one ties it into a story like ark with a nice little ribbon to be savagely cut with murderous weapons.  I can't wait to see what the finished product has to offer.			"

								Pros: +This game runs really well for an Early Access title+The developers are involved and active. Impressive lot. +The RPG and Strategy elements work so so so well together+It is definitely a unique game. It has it all, from crafting, research and resources management to dungeon exploration and RPG elements+An excellent sound track. +It looks pretty! + It will scratch that settlers itch you all have ;) Cons:- I wish the production chains were longer and a bit more complex. They are not too simple, but just not quite as complicated as I am use to from playing anno and other games. - The maps (even in sandbox mode) are a bit too small for my liking. This has to change... Over all it is very very fun.			"

Early Access Review
								Not one for leaving reviews, however after 6 hours today I have to say for an early access game it's great... yes there's bugs and a few aspects of the game that needs improving; but I expect that for any early access, so I can ignore them and look at the bigger picture.StoryTwo sides to choose from the outset story wise, so a welcoming replay value I am sure.  But for me it’s the wit in the writing; it’s great and refreshing for a game not taking itself seriously. I like and a few laughs while playing today. The tutorial was entertaining as well.... And I have to say that for an RPG game not being over the top with Dialog and no side quests (some games can over do it with side quests), it works and I feel the town building aspect works well to fill the void.GraphicsOk for someone with a 980TI I am all about the visuals, however I like the graphics. Simple yet detailed at the same time. Hats off to the games artist, “I like your style”. It is a good looking game. Game playSo the RPG aspect is fun, but i will say that I am all for the town building game play... its great and if you like Banished, Black & White etc. This game is for you. Learning how to play, the tutorial for once doesn’t spoon feed you and its refreshing once again to explore how to really play the game which I miss to be honest from games today... Only aspect i have found is missing is class selection of town folk for example, selecting all the soldiers rather than drawing a box hoping you get the soldiers to protect your town and you send half of the village into war by mistake. But if that’s my only concern with this EARLY ACCESS game then I will stand by my opinion. Its great, it’s refreshing, it’s a beautiful artistic game, great wit & narrative and its beyond addictive (6 hours straight). I will say though, you need to like RGPs and town builders games to enjoy this... both elements work hand in hand therefore if you are not a keen RPG’er than you won’t enjoy the game. But thumbs up from me and looking forward after work tomorrow to sit down and have a play!  "

								I am leaving the information below because it is releveant.  Understand that this Developer is ACTIVE and cares about the community and the product being put out.This alone changes the review dramatically in a positive way.  It was a gem of a game to begin with and now it is becoming a really interesting shining example of a wonderful indie title.Is it taking time?  Yes.Is it worth it?  Wholeheartedly yes.If you are into this genre, you will get enjoyment from just how charming this game is.Simon, you are awesome.  Keep up  the fantastic work please!---------EDIT:  The game crashes a ****Tonne in Campaign. - Crashed when I clicked on thew Western twin waterfalls.- Crached in the Glades.- Crashed trying to get out of the Robbers Den or whatever that is called.When it crashes it is the variety that freezes your entire machine.  It has crashed so consistently that I just gave up playing it.  Keep in mind I really was enjoying it, so this will really sour some fans.  It is like finding a Gem and someone slapping it out of your hand.Please take time to read the positives though, and keep an eye out.  If the updates solve this, it will be a really fun title.Running OSX El Capitan 10.11.32.8 Ghz Intel i512 GB RamATI Radeon HD 5750 Original Review:I have watched this game develop for a long time now.  Over a year and a half now.Even though it takes time, it is at the point where you can really see and enjoy it for the gem it is and is going to become.Just my take.  So far it is well thought out and a lot of fun to play.  :)			"

But now since I dont have trails and now to me it looks ugly without them so I do suggest a way to make trails and kind of like in Banished, it speeds up villagers!

								So far, this title has been well worth the sale price.It's a nice combination of RTS city building and RPG adventuring.  Great graphics and I like the humor element.  I've felt that the game has very high immersion potential.Some minor complaints would include the lack of good camera controls.  It is difficult to quickly change camera angles when your characters get into a fight which limits your ability to control individual actions for your characters.  The result is that pretty much every fight turns into one big Mongolian Cluster Click.  It would be great if the game engine used some kind of standard click and drag method to change camera views, like so many other games use.  Also, there's no way that I've seen to center the camera view on the characters, so when you get involved with the city management, it's easy to lose track of where your characters are and it can take a few minutes to locate them.  Some way to auto-center the camera view on them would be great, or even if their symbol on the overview map was a little different from the rest of the villagers that would be a big help.Overall this is a really good game, though.  I'm having a very good time with it and can't wait to see future developments.			"

								So far ive been playing for about 5 hours, messing around in sandbox mode and i really like the idea and concept of this game. I see a lot of people are mad about not being able to pause mid game while still being able to issue orders but i havent found a need for it whatsoever. Its essentially an RTS but with a balanced focus on city building and combat and the combat is fun with the addition of the heroes you command. You dont feel rushed to much when playing on medium difficulty but i havent played on any other difficulty. If i had to compare this game to another game on steam i would say its very similar to Banished but with combat. Im really excited to see where it goes and i hope the Devs continue working on it.

Early Access Review
								Note to Developers---This has been an amazing Journey watching development of this game for the past two years. I bought into this game because I enjoyed the concept of what Games Foundry wanted the game to be.  Since the past two years there have been plenty of additional content added that was not anticipated and at the same time some content has sadly left. These changes do not diminish the dream that was two years ago, but development continued to adapted and has now given great depth to what is currently and what will be a great game.I admit that I do not play each update, but with how well they keep the interested community informed, I don't have to play to know whats going on. With each Twitch broadcast I can speak about development and ask question if I have any. I can review Game Foundrys website(Which I do more often) and look at the road map and read the patch notes. These things are a huge asset to me and I can't wait to see when the game enters a more complete state. Please keep heart and know there are people that look forward to seeing your dream come to light. Well done lads.----- End----Org. Review----I don't rate games very often because I never want to spend the time or because the game really isn't worth a review from me. In the case of this game, I feel its necessary to to at least give this game a thumbs up and say a thing or two as to why.   Too many people gave this game a thumbs down because the game is incomplete and taking a little longer to make then some of you out there may be comfortable with. Giving a thumbs down for that reason is ridiculous and juvenile. This game is nothing short of an accomplishment for Games Foundry, even in its infancy this game continues to deliver. You'll find updates in their store page, Twitch video updates and detailed information on what each update consist of on their website. The ""I want it now Daddy"" mentality wont get you anywhere with this game if were going to get what Games Foundry as in store for us.  Also its not even in BETA! They're still making the dang game! So Shut it with all the complain about how the game isn't even playable. Nuff said.  As this isn't really a review about the game I guess I should add a little something about the game. Simply put, I'm optimistic and excited to see the final product.			"

Early Access Review
								Its been 1 year since I last wrote a review of this game.  At the time I was very angry about a lot of things.  first being the fact that shortly after backing it.  I found myself un-able to play it at all.  Last week after the patch 0.3 I got my first crack at actually playing the game and walking thru the in game tutorial.   I was shock!  Finally I could understand and play the game with easy.  No more broken basic needs.  Or at least I didn't encounter any.  Last year I would not recommend this game to anyone.  For fear of losing a friend.  The game was so flustrating.  Most of the common stuff was broken or not even there at all.   Today I found it playable and while I think the game progression is rather slow.  I am happy to say its been worth the wait.   I feel a lot of folks will not know what to do with this game though.  Do you play it like warcraft 3 build a economy and conqueer X enemy?  Not so much.  Its more on the lines of Banish I think.  Like a sim settlement builder type of thing.  In the near future that will probably change with heros, and dungeons coming in to play.   I would recommend this on 2 things.  First they dev's have a monthly blog supporting the up comming ideals and fixs, and second its fun to play.  Don't take my word on it.  Get out there and give it a try!  Write your own view and claim the New world for your villagers!  Woohoo!			"

								Looks nice, description nice, they do know their marketing. But they cant work...If i remember correctly this game was one of the first early access games, i bought it almost instantly. Maybe this is my first steam game, iwas drunk or something ;D No one knew back then what`s EA, if i knew i wouldnt have bought it... thats like 3 years from now...Seriously, its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ great that they release weekly updates, but its easy to do weekly updates, if you dont do anything else, than write a line of code and then next week you delete it...Please dont buy it, so they can stop working on it, I hate downloading it every six months.

								Really enjoying the game so far! It's sort of a cross between Warcraft 3, Age of Empires 2 and Civilisation. Maybe even a little bit of Diablo in there too. I've only played the campaign so far but I'm hooked.On the one hand, you are busy building things to keep your people happy and get a nice little city going and on the other, you are taking your heros off on well scripted and engaging adventures. It feels like a full and solid world and so far I have felt really immersed.Being early access, the game is not without its faults (spider attacks come thick and fast and your peasants and early army can't do much about it - you have to call your heros back to town to deal with them. Also tooltips could do with being a little more in depth) but it is definately a solid base from which to move forward and refine. For such a small dev team (only five of them I think), the game at the moment is something they should be really proud of and I hope they keep evolving it as time goes on (keep up the great work guys!).If you are thinking of buying it and enjoyed the games I mentioned above, definately give it a go.

								Fix this. What the heck. I can't even play the tutorial and you’re supposed to be at 44 percent finished. Ridiculous. LoL. That part there is just so bad. Until this is fixed, I can't recommend this. I can't even complete the very first two steps of the tutorial. Wow, what happened to playing the game before releasing? Seriously, you can't expect us to waste our money on nonsense. Please play your game and fix every bug that you can find as you come across them. Don't just sweep them under the rug and have us, the saps, come find them. That’s what we are when we know you haven't even play tested this yourself. I’m done. This is my review because I couldn't even get past the tutorial as of 4/27/2014.			"

								Yesterday i bought this promising game, but i regret spending my money on something which is merely a demo. Other people have described the flaws in detail, like no upgrade options, no research and a buggy menu with hollow buttons.I really hope that the devs are not going to abandon this project and use the money the launch a whole different game, since patches are slow. Only consider buying this DEMO if you believe in supporting a nice idea for a citybuild/RPG game. My advice: DON'T BUY IT, THE GAME IS NOT FINISHED BY FAR. You'll feel sorry like i do after only 9 hours of buggy gameplay for $25.			"

								A very good game, was released a little early even for experimental. But it is coming along great. One thing about getting in early is that you may heve something to offer to the game. Many ideas and fixes have come from players that opted into the game very early. If you opt fpr experimental games you should have enough common sence to know there will be bugs and limited game play.			"

								I think its great, mixing settlers with rpg ,  i did prefer, when the tutorial was part of the campaign, not a separate module so to speak, and with it being apart of the main game, at the end of basic tutorial you can add advanced tutorial option or begin main campaign option, and start the village bully scene, this way, you can atleast tutorial upto having a minimal economy , and barracks before you start getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillaged by the bullies and the spiders nest just near the the starting point, what happens is, a village walks past collecting berrys, aggros the 2 queens and her little  minions, and its game over. fun ended. other then that brilliant game. worthy purchase.

								If you ever wanted to take a city building sim to the next level and actually have a hand in the individual lives of it's occupants, Folk Tale actually delivers. Folk Tale came across my screen one day and I was very impressed by it's intended scope so I immediately purchased it in early access. It's been a year since then and I can honestly say this game has come a long way. It's an incredibly ambitious game. No other city sim comes close to the complexity of strategy and rpg elements as Folk Tale in my opinion. It's beautifully rich in detail in respect to both graphics and game play. It fills a depth nitche that was absolutely missing in Banished. Having each individual in your village have a character sheet and equipment can feel a little overwhelming at first, but once you become familiar with how the game is played it's much easier to manage. I can honestly say I never expected this game to get here. It's worth every penny and then some. If you like city builder and rpgs you HAVE to give this a try. There is truly nothing else like it. While it's still a ways out from completion, the potential for greatness is OBVIOUS! :)			"

								Since this is during a sale, I feel it's the perfect time to state my opinions on this game.Don't get it. It's more Early Access trash, is never coming out, and is still in what I would rather call a Pre-Alpha than Alpha two years in. Booted it up multiple times offline, never any real changes.The community for this game is disgustingly delusional, their defense force downvotes any negative reviews, and go so far to say that any critics of the insanely slow dev time are A. Trolls or B. (And this one requires some actual mental gymnastics) that the accounts were stolen by hackers to put bad reviews on the game from accounts that had owned it.If the lack of development isn't going to put you off the game? Check the discussion wall. See what the people who DO like this game are like. Then run away.			"

								I purchased this game quite a while ago, before the switch to the current Sandbox version. I liked it then and I like it now. I was looking for a city builder - with something more, and that's what I have gotten. My husband is a Skyrim fan, but I wanted something lighter; I am a casual player, and for me this is it. I also play Banished, but enjoy the humor and missions of Folk Tale.Yes, development is taking a long time. I play for a while, complete what is new, then I will go on and play something else for a while. When I remember and come back around, suprise - there is always something new. Last time I played turrets and walls had been disabled, this time there are new walls, gates, etc - and they work. And now there is fire - which I hate because it makes me look like a crazy person to my kids as I am yelling at the computer screen for the villagers to put the fire out! I do miss the giant snails, though.Over all I like this game, I understand why some are upset in the length of time development is taking, I guess I'm just not as bothered by that.			"

								While I was playing the tutorial, i exit the mine before the boss fight, i can't re-enter the mine to finish the tutorial (first bug).After you completed the tutorial it says you can now exit the tutorial. The developer should have just end the tutorial after the final dialogue (bad implementation)I can't seem to find a way to delete my save game other than going into save game folder itself from Windows. Upon researching for more Folk Tale content on the net and youtube, there's literally no content at all. The developer did not do any publicity for their game or they already gave up the game? Yes there's minor patch here and there on their dev blog but I feel the developer already gave up on the game they did not even update their own content on the website. Early access since 2013.

Early Access Review
								ive been playing this style of game for a long time favorites such as black and white, warcraft and starcraft. This game is excellent honestly. It's one of the only games if not the only currently that continues this style of gaming. Warcraft was excellent because you got to be attached to you're favorite hero and level them up plus gear them. It felt fun and was a blast building a town to boot. Black and white is one of my favorites simply because the city building is so much fun. I love to grow the town and either become a utopia or turn into a fortress for war. This game continues on these charactistics. And to be honest does a pretty damn good job conisdering how large of a project this really is. There is far more in depth tools to ultlize and work with as you expand and conqure. However, this game truely needs to be tweaked around the balancing of AI, and looting. I mean it's pretty crap. You can run around a enemy in a circle and heal then rengage and win. The loot is always crap or it is for sir g. No good loot for fellow heros you pick up on the way AT ALL. So annoying. Tired of gearing my settlers with all the♥♥♥♥♥♥i get because my heros get nothing. The other A.I needs to become a living AI. not this dungeon stuff we are seeing. I want to see a town expanding and pressuring us to either progress and fight, or ally and work for. It can be done just needs something. Farming spiders, crabs, and other wild life is only so fun for so long. Id like to feel challenged with more decisions that lead to other results and not only one path dialogs. There are 4 options you choose everyone you want besides the answer, and it always makes you refer to what the game wants you to pick. Why even include the dialog then? -Noted Bugs-Weapons do not scale damage proporely on villagers and heros. -Repeated loot drops with no variations. -Dialog audio shutting off around End of Act I-Rocks, and landscape block buildings from being built in odd ways. -Disengage and re-engage do not reset enemies, this results in auto health regen for heros and not mobs. -Market does not provide needed resourses for posion potions, and upgraaded variations of health and mana potions. -Inproper seeding of need herbs.As i play more and promote more players to test the game i will update my orginal review.

								ive been playing this style of game for a long time favorites such as black and white, warcraft and starcraft. This game is excellent honestly. It's one of the only games if not the only currently that continues this style of gaming. Warcraft was excellent because you got to be attached to you're favorite hero and level them up plus gear them. It felt fun and was a blast building a town to boot. Black and white is one of my favorites simply because the city building is so much fun. I love to grow the town and either become a utopia or turn into a fortress for war.

								This games has gone on leaps and bounds since i first played it. It has developed into more than just a city builder with some interesting character for you to use. The voice acting is good, however it’s not on every one, but they will probably add that in later. There is a new story mode which is a mice change if your board of creating huge villages with little cause except build massive awesome villages. It looks very promising for the future. I especially like the look of the ""visual modding tools"" It looks like in the future we might be able to have even more freedom with the game. I’m looking forward to it.			"

								TL:DR Games like this are the reason people don't trust Early-Access games...This game... I bought this game well over a year ago because it sounded like it had the potential to become one of my favorites. Fast forward to now and it is pretty much unrecognizable compared to what it was suppose to be. This game had a lot of potential but the devs either got lazy, got their money and stopped caring, just plain out lied to get early access purchases, or all of the above.			"

								Stop taking your time. I have had this game since you was able to buy the game, I played it and by god i LOVED what i saw and it's potential, and couldnt wait to see the end product but realised that wouldnt be for a year. One year on you decided you would atleast have sandbox mode ready and able then move on to career mode, ok great, you still had a overall 'Very Positive' User review at that point, its now been what almost 4 years or more and you've had a HUGE boost in income to help pay the busy lil' workers, good feedback from the player base, yet still your dragging your heels using the excuse of ""We want to do this right"" which to start with was ok, but now we know it to just be code for ""Were just gonna keep telling you BS because we have no good resaon as to why we can't be bothered"", and now you have a Mixed User rating with over 770 reveiws if you have bothered to look lately, quickly becoming a rating of Very Poor, and then soon your gold mine will dry up and at which point you will be stuck trying to fill the promise of a great game with no income because no one else will be buying your game. There is soooo much more I could say but i think you get the point of what I am trying to say, and you only have to look at the reviews to see that I am right. It would be a shame to see this game go to waste because someone else or some other Company was able to take your concept and get a product out there for people to play a version of your game, and then you would be left in the dust with nothing but an alpha game shelved to show for your troubles.

								You know what once it is completely finished, then it won't be a bad game based on the sandbox mode. Tutorial needs some serious work doing to it there isn't an option to do what the half the tutorial menu asks you and a menu to exit the game would help to start with. Very slow too and no idea where the villagers keep appearing from. But ultimately I do look forward to playing it once it has been fully developed. It has kind of a Settlers vibe, which I quite like and I would say making the building slightly smaller would be an advantage. I don't see this as being a multi-person, online game just single player, missions type of game.			"

								I bought this game a while ago and played a fair few hours on the Sandbox mode. I have to say that while sometimes gameplay can be buggy it's an absolute gem. The development team have done a wonderful job of mixing a civil builder with RPG elements, you'll actually give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about your town/villagers and heroes. So far I've started let's playing the campaign on my youtube channel, thecoope550, and I love it. The humour is there, the story elements are there too. The only downside I've got with the game is that I haven't worked out how to build roads in the campaign mode yet, but I'm sure I will at some point. The economy system is clever, and follows a logical path for example you can't make pies without meat and flour it's not too difficult to pick up but at the same time if you don't do things in a sensible and logical order then you're peasents will leave and you'll end up♥♥♥♥♥♥creek without a paddle. In short it's the best £15 I've spent and the game isn't even finished yet. If they even put in a multiplayer system where you choose either a hero or to lead a town it'll truely be somthing spectacular. I've still got to test out the world editor but it's on my to-do list! Thanks for reading!			"

								I bought this game back in June of 2013. Immedietaly after buying it I regretted it. That version of the game was bad. Now, fast forward to March of 2016. I decided to download it again after having not touching it for almost 3 years, due to the new screenshots I saw on the store page. I have been playing it for about 2 hours now and wow have they improved this game. The combination of village building, equipment to be found and equipped on everybody (villagers too), and dungeon exploration with your heroes is great! It reminds me of the early Settlers games, or the old game Knights and Merchants.Pros: Nice graphicsFully customizable charactersFree building, build where ever is the best spot for the buildingDungeon/Cave exploration is a good break from the normal gather/buildCons:It took them three years to get where they are now, so progress is a little slow, but it is thereWhen all is said and done, I would say to grab a copy of this. If you are worried about the price then just wait until there is a sale to see if it goes on sale on Steam. Otherwise I still think it is worth the price in its current state.			"

Early Access Review
								At first in alpha, it's not going to be good. Not bug reporting I could see as the first openning page showed it was in Alpha. But no bug reporter in the game as far I saw; or no comment section about how to make the game better. Which would be nice. First time I played didn't played nesscially play correctly, and taxed my people. Second time went much better; food and resources are your primany starting assets. Of course if you can review my second game of it. I did much better and improved after about 40 minutes of playtime. I acctually liked the game more than then many in the genre. Graphics silmiar to World of Warcraft, yet that was some 10 years ago. Cartoonish yes. My kids could learn a lot about how much would it take a long long time ago to build an empire or a village. Although very boring if you don't use your hero to explore. Which I liked. To gain food from the start; it helps gives something to do while your people work. BUT DON'T FORGET ABOUT THEM, haha. Some werid things with how the game is played. I didn't like how I ""techicnally"" took over a an old builiding that looked like a mine. I personally think; there should be more like as it appered to be a mine. Which I could used. A of now in my second game, so far I got an extra pheasent. I like how easy access the game is. Very easy for kids to understand and think. ""Well, If I save enough wood and stone, I could get...""  All builings mostly unlocked and yes, there are builinding options. One thing that would be exciting after playing for just 40 minutes; Is how deep the game could actually go. I played on easy. Normally I start games playing Hard. But have learned to play easy first to make it simple to go from easy to hard; then to medium and crush medium. But getting an exrta pheasent. Very Very usefull. I'm thinking of adding in another cottage just to see if gets more pheasents. Because they can work from the lumbermill or whatver it's called or the stone mason which give more resources. I also saw that the woodcutter's plant tree's. Yet, my fishwoman caught loads of fish and then would have to travel. So it's a game about location, location, location. Because if I do get exrta pheasents, which come by their own accord. Then it would be useful to have them pick ujp surranding exrta picking up things; food, wood, and stone. Yet again 40 minutes in Alpha 25 or 26 and I love it. Very rare for me to play a game and still want to play more of it, normally after I play I ponder how to play correctly. Almost like an addiction to video games to me again; coming back. Normally I'll play a few hours and then ponder and analize how I played. But this game is different it draws you in. Especially if your into RPG's villiage, city buildiers from an older time. Which I prefer. Tropico 5 is a very complicated game compared to this. This lays everything out for you. May take 3-4 times to get the hang of it. BUT PLAY EASY. And dev's don't speed up. Even it takes a couple or LESS years, haha. Take your time, Take you time; Good game I would pay $50-60 for. Which is very rare for me. But 24.99 for Alpha. A little steep. 19.99 would have been better. Remeber one comment box and you'll get a whole lot of advice, or bug reporter. Also remeber stick to your roots about those comments some mjean, some harsh; some useful; some actually from other players' who made the game with you. TO ALL DEVOPLERS DON'T DO EVERYTHING THEY WANT YOU TO DO OR IT MESS UP THE WHOLE GAME.			"

								I bought this game back in June of 2013. Immedietaly after buying it I regretted it. That version of the game was bad. Now, fast forward to March of 2016. I decided to download it again after having not touching it for almost 3 years, due to the new screenshots I saw on the store page. I have been playing it for about 2 hours now and wow have they improved this game. The combination of village building, equipment to be found and equipped on everybody (villagers too), and dungeon exploration with your heroes is great! It reminds me of the early Settlers games, or the old game Knights and Merchants.Pros: Nice graphicsFully customizable charactersFree building, build where ever is the best spot for the buildingDungeon/Cave exploration is a good break from the normal gather/buildCons:It took them three years to get where they are now, so progress is a little slow, but it is thereWhen all is said and done, I would say to grab a copy of this. If you are worried about the price then just wait until there is a sale to see if it goes on sale on Steam. Otherwise I still think it is worth the price in its current state.			"

								New reviewI'm back again with a new review as I've jumped into the game after a few months since I've last played, I'm impressed that the game have gotten quite a few updates there is tutorial now but the game still is a long way until it is finish...unfortunately...I like the concept but when I first looked into this game I thought that the game was going to be big! as far as map size that we can have a flourishing big city and other human AI cities to interact and trade with while fending off and embarking on quest to kill zombie, and monsters...but yet this game is still in development and I hope that the developer see the need to improve and widen the spectrum of mapsize and indept quest line to keep us busy. Other than this you guys are doing good.I am ready to discuss of ideas and such if you want to have me in on your discussion not sure if I'll be able to give much.The game still feels like it's in it's early stage yet so...buy on your own risk.

								Love this game so far!  Beautiful graphics, fairly intuitive GUI (takes a little getting used to, then it's second nature).  Would love to see an addition of a way to scroll back through system messages.  Currently, the controls setup is that panning is controled via keyboard and zooming is controled by mousewheel.  Would be nicer if those were reversed.  Also, the hero's controls are a bit clumbsy... would be nice to be able to set his actions to the number bar on the keyboard.  Click/Point takes away some of the immersiveness.  I'm really enjoying this game overall.  I've played through the tutorial, and tried out the sandbox a bit... currently running through the campaign.  Keep up the good work!  Looking forward to updates.			"

								The Short- very good hybrid of RTS / RPG / Dungeon Crawler / Roguelike  The Long- I bought this game a while back, I think over 2 years ago? When I did it was still in beta and was actually bad; just a bear-bones tutorial with no save feature. I don't remember if Steam had the Refund thing at the time but honestly..if they did I may have refunded. I'm glad I didn't.    I decided on a whim to reinstall after reading dev updates. So far I am very pleased.    The devs have really broke the mold on Folktale- there is quirky graphics, humor ( plenty of that), RTS fighting, city-building and management...and....dungeon crawling.    You have ""heros"" that do the actual dungeons, and man these folks are quirky with a big ""Q"". The fighting can get a tad crazy at times as there is no pause feature ( mores the pity; at the time of this writing the Devs have said there will not ever be) but you can, however, just hit ESC if you need a break.    I still think a pause feature, just for dungeons, would have been a good idea. Your peasant population will actually gang up on enemies and are very effective ( and funny; scroll ALL THE WAY down during a fight for some funny dialogue)    The game is still in early release, and I hope the devs can keep up the good work.         1 / 1/ 2017  Rivscore-  86 / 100			"

								Idea is nice, but at this state of the game is just bad, especially the storyline ""missions"", looks DEV lack resources to fully implement the ideas they have and instead they add tiny bit of unpolished and useless parts (i.e. the ""stats"" for characters, there's no choice really, no motivation to ever pick anything else than main stat, so why this is even there).

It has a lot of options for upgrades to your buildings (and there are lots of building types), fantastic rpg combat/dungeon crawling, and a sense that your actions do matter. For EA it's a nice preview of what's to come, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the videos/screen shots. I personally believe this has a lot of potential, and I look forward to future patches and eventually a 1.0 release!!!			"

Good humor.Very Straight forward game play.Great mix of RTS/loot. (nothing else like this in its space)Workshop content.Love the crafting and equipment which for each town person (GREAT IDEA)Cons Death is too punishing (lossing 25% exp each time sucks think everquest punishing)The town game gets hard very quickly when you are just playing through the story (feels unbalanced how quickly you will be facing common enemies which feel like boss battles)Spiders are too agressive for settling into your village.RARE Loot does not happen often (37 hours in and nothing as of yet maybe I need to play longer)Lots of research needs to be finished.Would prefer to see heroes ablities along the bottom of the screen not in the corner.Overall 8/10  "

								I like this game. I like the combination of mediavel/fantasy village builder and micromanagement together with RPG dungeon crawler. On the other side I have few comments:1) It needs better micromanagement of heroes and their skills. I am missing pause-give orders-unpause or time slowing button.2) Allow directing of ""friendly"" spells through character icon (portrait) without need to search and click them directly3) There is no auto-sort button for ""general"" inventory.  Some tweeking should be fine.Nothing more. I am very entertained and happy with Folks TaleMaybe just one more thing: There is bug in this moment. Maybe not bug, just laziness of herbalists who dont want to gather water which is needed for potion brewing.			"

								I purchased this game around the time it first went into early access here on steam and fell in love with it. From then till now It's really great to see how much work and honest effort into this game. You can really tell the dev's love what their making you comes across  so clearly with how attentive they are with updates and ways to keep players up to date on what their doing. I'm sure we've all seen many games on here over the years with a lot of promise and see them vanish. It's wonderful to see that this team is still working incredibaly hard. If your on the fence about buying the game. I suggest you do, this isnt another greenlit money stink. These guys are doing work.			"

								I've been watching this game for a long while and finally decided to puchase for play. Nice demo vid, but most things don't work/exist. impementing any kind of army with descent stats not capable, no defensive buildings, which is okay so far as the enemy A.I. is too low to matter, but predators will decimate your population just as well. tough keeping the people happy once the town is large enough, because like the army a lot of things don't work. It would be key to be able to upgrade significant structures... All in all it looks good but fails to perform. It doesn't seem to be going anywhere, and this is too bad. the game is much like a modern version of warcraft with a differant face on it, more plesant and wider in scope, if it ever gets out of second gear (of a five speed), i'm not holding my breath at this stage...Maybe i could recommend the game if i saw some major improvement, but not yet...

								Just impossible to enjoy this game. Before you know it people leave the town for one reason or another. I am not sure why 25 peolpe need hundreds of cloths, hundreds of food, equal amount of fire wood and so on. On top of it you have the spiders, the impossible enemy that cannot be killed (the queen) and which kill the people. The hero, instead of winning experience from being killed, loses big time. You simply have to stay alive to be able to go up one level. You cannot progress for the life of me. Even in sandbox the game is frustrating. It could have been a great game, but it lacks common snese.			"

It may be taking forever to get here but the active response and constant improvement are something to behold. If you don't buy it for the gameplay, buy it to experience what a dedicated team of game creators can do. The idea of this game is a unique experience and my criticisms minor.

Now and then you will be attacked by things in the wild or other races. Graphically its like League of legends and you get one hero who's health and mana bar are very similar to league of legends. You can go off and do side quests with your hero which are a lot of fun and the hero has boosts that can be used. I reccommend the game, I have had a lot of fun so far.			"

								Half a year ago when I bought this game it looked, smelled and felt like a home-run. However, in the past half year the game has only really seen minor bug-fixes and a save function being added, which leaves me fearing that this game will never go beyond the alpha stage.If you love a good sim game with a bit of rpg thrown in the mix, keep an eye on Folk Tale. It might become the next great sim-game. However, as of now I would not recommend this game. For me it has thus far been 17€ to play 3 hours of bugged tutorial.			"

								This game has a LOT of potential, how ever right now its riddled with bugs and glitches. One of the most easy to fix bugs is the way that your workers will just bug out in buildings and not work, this means you get low on rescources very very quickly. This game has been in development for a while now and i would not reccomend buying it until its fully released. CUrretnly theres about 2 hours of actually playing time and then you have nothing to do. Dont spend your money on this game until it is full released or at least out of early access.			"

								I've had this game sitting in my Steam game list for about a year. I wanted to wait until it got a little deeper into development. I feel as though I can really give this a proper review now however. (Note my hours are not correct by any means. I actually have around 30 hours) The game can be compared to games such as The Settlers. I've always liked City Building games such as this, but they always lacked a flair of life, and they tended to have over complex mechanics for late game that made it more of a chore than a game, and really killed the fun. Even though those games aren't particularly hard, the ""jump through 5 hoop resources to get what you want"" just isn't that fun to me. Take Settlers 5 for instance. Why do certain soldiers need extra good food? Doesn't make sense to me outside of ""throw something in to make it more difficult and extend the gameplay"". City Building: Folk Tale as of right now. Does not do that. Food of any type is used to feed any villager. Pubs, etc increase happiness. Simple. Of course there is still balancing to be done in terms of needs, but this game isn't focused just on ""get x resource to get x unit"" like other city builders. Hence why the ""City Building"" and sustaining can be more simple. The real meat of the game is around this bone structure. This doesn't mean there aren't chains of course. You need wheat and water to make bread, meat to make meat pies, and the like, however there aren't any requirements or units which require these foods to unlock or use. Buildings will eventually be able to be upgraded, research can be done in every building to increase the towns prosperity and increase production. Walls, Towers and gates can be built just about anywhere except on sheer cliffs (straight vertical) As I said though. This is simply the bone of the game, the meat is in the rest. The RPG SideThis is where this game will be shining the most. The town building is cute, fun, and immersive, and this just adds the cherry ontop. Each NPC can be given items and equipment. You can build armor and weapons at the blacksmith and give each of your soldiers individual equipment, rings, boots, etc. Give your Captain a special helmet to make him stand out etc. The Peasants and normal workers also can be done doing the same. They will fight if need be, and can be given orders. Or they'll do what they need to do for whatever job you gave them, and go about their daily lives. The beasts, monsters, and such also live their own lives. They will expand and grow. They will make new dens, and increase the area where they wander. They will eventually if left unchecked butt heads with you if you don't keep the outskirts of your town in check.  ----------------------------------------------There are MANY things to come in Folk Tale, including: Interiors for buildings, New Area's. Linked Maps, Dungeons to send heroes and adventurers, Dungeons to clear out with your soldiers, New Buildings, and much more that will add depth and immersion. Last but definetly not least. The developers are excellent at listening to the community, responding to the community, and letting us know what they are doing and focusing on. They have laid out the road map for the game, and all the features they wish to impliment, and when they will be implimenting them, and so far they have kept to that road map perfectly. If you're interested in games such as this. The risk of this being another fail start game is extremely low, with no chance of the developers going dark with no word.  "

								I'm not going to bash the negative reviewers because a few of them actually made sense and weren't just zero bombing.I for one, actually enjoyed this game. Even though it has been in my in for two years, I still like to come back to it from time to time to see what’s changed. As some of the negatives have said, there hasn’t been any ground breaking patches to where it jumps the game close to release, but hey, the devs are active and not giving up on their game, which is rare considering I've seen a few games go from amazing, to abandoned in less than a year or two.  So in some way, I can agree with the negative reviewers saying there hasn’t been a lot, because hey, I would like to see more too, but we aren't dealing with EA here.Now what I can't agree on is the negatives saying ""I wasted my money on this game"", ""Before you say ""Early Access Game"" save your money it's not worth it."". I'm just going to say it...it's an Early Access Game. A lot of games aren’t worth their prices, for example, Call of Duty being 100bucks for a full game...not worth it, but some may think it is. And for the ""I wasted my money"" people, you ""wasted 25 bucks""...that’s 3 hours of work. Also, it is an Early Access Game meaning you are choosing to pay the price of the game to aid in the development of the game. Honestly, now a days, EAGs and Kickstarters alike are a gamble because you never know if the devs will abandon it or not. So what do you do? Just make a decision, do you want to see this game become complete? Or can you live without it. If you are truly a gamer, you want to see a game you are interested in succeed and you won’t give up on it because it is taking a while. To put it in perspective, World of Warcraft took more than 5 years to develop...and it was developed with an already established gaming company with a huge dev team. So 2 years of a game with probably 1/6th of the staff isn’t bad for where the game is. You just have to look at it from a different angle.All in all, I agree and disagree with the Reviewers but I still will recommend this game, especially since it's on sale atm, because of the dedication on the dev team alone and the fact that I'm a gamer and I want to see games blossom!Do what you want, but remember, you are helping DEVELOPE a game, you are not buying a complete game. It will take time for it to be finished, are you ready for the long haul? "

								After having my opinion shrouded by the forum moderators a couple of times and by the fanatic community it self, I've decided to voice my opinion here. This game is far from ready. Having bought this game within the first couple of weeks of its release I am appalled by the lack of progress and content that has been added to this game. Being released over 16 months ago and having little to none progress to show for it, I feel like I've been utterly ripped off. The game is not ready and is a long way to go before completion. The dev state that this game is 46% playable in its current state, a state which is missing a core component of its gamely. Sandbox mode. The only update I've seen happen in the last year is a slummy map and character editor being added to the games content. A feature which is utterly useless considering you cannot play the game at all. The only feature which you are able to access is the tutorial mode which has a buggy save system. The idea for this game is rather good, which was one of the main reasons which compelled me to buy this title in the first place. Even though I am fully aware that this game is an INDIE title in the ALPHA stage, I am utterly appalled by the lack of progress and at the same time amazed by how well the developers are doing. Constantly updating their blogs and making new videos and moderating the forums. Maybe if they spend less time on the forum and editing their blogss and videos and more time on the game, we would see some progress. Do not buy -A			"

Early Access Review
								I was watching this game before it went on sale for early access. I was excited about the witty humor and really looking forward to a great adventure. When it was available to purchase for early access I decided to pick it up. Some time after purchasing it however they switched gears and changed from campaign to sandbox. I do not play any of my builder type games in sandbox, I play through the campaign and that is it. Unfortunately this is going to be one of those games in my library that won't get dusted off. I have periodically checking to see how the progress is going. It seems to be slow, however if your looking for a sandbox game this might be a good one once they get it all polished up. Unfortunately it's not for me anymore.			"

								With a game that has show no improvment since it came makes me wish i did not wast my money on it, At the start of the game i thought it would be fun but no it was very slow, it felt like i was playing a half♥♥♥♥♥version of age of empires, with saying that i did like the way it was heading but now i just played it again today and now they want you to make your own map. does that make any since at all it is not are job to make the maps it is the ""Developers"" if they do not work on this game faster the hole project might as well just shut it's self down because no one is going to play it.

Early Access Review
								A long, long time ago...A knight set foot into a village which was attacked by bandits, business as usual it seemed.So the knight draw his sword and drove the thieves out.The village folk cheered at first, but were afraid that the thieves might return.The knight listened to the worried people and decided to stay, just in case.That wasn't the end of the story.The mayor asked the knight to help him rebuild the village, an unusual task for a knight, but you get your quests where you get them.The knight built houses for the people, woodcutters' homes, mines etc. People seemed to be happy, praised the Holy Toast, went on their business and raised a mug of mead every now and then.That sounds easy in the beginning, but the knight noticed, that some of the townfolk acted erratic.Fields were standing in full bloom, but nobody was harvesting them for a while, people were more interested in filling their bellies than honest work.That changed for the better after a while. A LONG while.At one point the knight realized this quest might take forever, so he went down on his knees and prayed to the Holy Toast for guidance.And the Holy Toast answered ""Don't give up yet, the powers in control will not let you down, be patient.""And the knight asked ""How much longer ?""The Toast replied ""Haven't you seen them doing their work ? Haven't you noticed the change for the better ?""The knight nodded.The Toast went on ""Don't get me wrong, child, though they are the ones in control, but they are only a few. You... and your quest were not forgotten."" A pause ""And they know they sent you on your quest too early, far too early""The knight remained silent, so the Toast went on.""Don't you like it here ? The people are hard working but cheerful. Granted they have an immense appetite, but still""The knight nodded again.The Toast continued ""And from what I can see, you keep yourself busy as well, bandits, wolves and even finding new friends along the way, what an illustrious bunch you have there""The knight got up from his knees and kicked some dirt ""I know you're right, I will try to keep my patience, thank you Holy Toast""The Holy Toast smiled, or at least it seemed like it, you can never be sure with toast.""Your patience will be rewarded, child, just don't give up hope"" and with an uncharacteric pop the Toast vanished into thin air.------To cut a long story short:This game is in EA forever. The devs acknowledge they went into EA far too early, but there is still a LOT of communication going on between the team and the players.Still, what is in the game is fantastic, if you are looking for something to scratch your Settlers or Spellforce itch.It is well served with humor and a good graphic.The progress dev-wise is slow, yes, but they listen. As mentioned above there are improvements made to the villagers behaviour which resulted from the exchange between the programmers and the audience.I enjoy what I have seen so far.A recommendation from me, yes, but only for people that can be patient and let the devs do their work.

Early Access Review
								TLDR not worth the price, large scope slow updates, half finished implementations22/01/2016 UpdateIf its any indication I brought a game called Crashlands and  played that the same amount of hours in a week that I have played this game in 3 years and that comes down to playable content, there is just not enough in this game. No updates still in the same condition as months ago. So much promised content but nothing works when implemented the scope for this game has just grown out of proportion.Always hopefully and after so long in EA I figured surely by now they would have some semblemence of a nearly complete game. Unfortunately this is not the case. While that have added in a small questline, the issue is that it is very small and also buggy. Buttons still don't work.Progress on this game is so slow, the developers seem to spend more time writing long blogs about the changes they are making vs actually working on the game. Not worth the price.Update 28/3/15 after leaving this game for up to 6 months i figured the devs would have had time to flesh it out a bit. Sadly it is still fill of broken features, now there all these shiny new buttons that dont actutally work.The game has a small amount of playable content but with no real direction and alot of the features still not working it gets boring pretty quick.  Very slow development. I would still not recommend.Previous review from about June 2014:At first glance this game looked really enjoyable the tutorial was fun and and interesting with a little bit of everything.you got to start building a town and learn what the different buildings did, you got to make an army and go on a action filled adventure killing all sorts of monsters. The tutorial introduced a game I thought I could really get into.Sadly the actual game is nothing like the tutorial. Currently there is only a broken sandbox mode, half the buttons don't work, the controls are different to the ones you use in the tutorial so you have to learn what the new ones are. With the majority of the building and character controls, even menus not working the sandbox mode is very limited.The tutorial is misleading and suggests the game is something it is not. The development is slow and all around sandbox.Not worth the price.			"

This game has made no proggress in a year, they keep saying they will create the sandbox mode but theyv been saying that since the beggining and nothing has changed.in my opinion they have already given up but are leaving it up because people still seem to be buying it.

Early Access Review
								I have had this since the Early Release Edition and I finally got to see the end results of waiting. First the Pro's: Easy to learn reminds me alot of Age Of Empires where you collect resources. Reminds me of Colonization where settlers come over when you are doing good:) I went and tried the tutorial and it helped me with 90% of the game.  You can assign any inactive to any job & you can change them up.Now the Con's You really have no way of knowing how many peasants are inactive until you want to build and there is no way you can call them over to any 1 spot where you can assign them tasks. Also you really can't tell how your research is going accept that it tells you when you are done. Unlike Civ series where it tells you how many turns left to get to your ending reseach.Over all it feels like Civ series but on a smaller scale. With a little more work it could be a Fun  game without the frustration you may feel from time to time. Is it worth the asking price maybe. Depends how you like the Civ Series:)Overall I would give the game a 8 out of 10. Nothing more then that though at this time:)			"

								I like this game and i think it has great potential to become a great city building game. Its a mix of Age of Empires and Banished. There just need to be improvments to the barracks building to be able to train more soilders with one barracks building. Also, it needs more maps or map options, more building types. Though while playing there seems to be a lot of room for add ons, just not released yet. I can't wait to see what comes! "

								So far its a great game. I love the city-building mixed with the battles. I wish that the heroes leveled up at the same rate as the opponents. Its a bummer when you make it to far in the game and then your heroes are to weak to make any damage towards the opponents. Hopefully this bug will be fixed in one of the coming updates.			"

								I honestly don't know what i expected, I read a couple of posts and knew i should have turned away but thought i'd give it a chance.Your basic sand box game here with a couple of RPG elements, It's a shame to see they turned away from the campaign as i feel this game needed some kind of objective system to keep me generally interested. The whole build it, expand it, improve it and get bored and destroy it all genre is well over done and didn't really needed another title to the list (Let alone an incomplete one). What happened to the days of RTS games!The community that seem to follow this game are a good bunch and the devs seem to be posting dev blogs now and again so will keep my eyes on this game and hope that it gets finished.Would i recommend this game? No - The sandbox is their go to and i feel there isn't enough currently in game for the price tag. (Yeah it's alpha blah blah blah)			"

								(UPDATED REVIEW)Still in early access and it's not a Blizzard game? Got this 4 years ago, didn't work then, tried it again years later. Not much improved. Keeping an eye on it. even flowers can grow from turds.Jan 2017 ^^I wanted to like this game, building, strat, survival. Those type of games fill up my library of games.and years ago I was excited.... YEARS AGO. 2 years later,has it improved? Yes, is it worth buying. Not for me. Over 2 years and only 3 hours and even a new computer. Still waste of time. Steam just added a new refund policy and what do you know, the game has been in my collection for too long. Step up to the plate and give those of us who hate your game a refund and take it off the market until its finished.(Review as of May 2015 )(REVIEW WHEN I FIRST GOT IT)I couldn't get past anything worth of value and kept trying, in the end errors, no communication from the company I purchased this from and no refund ( trust me this would be my 1 life refund if it was possible ). It's better to avoid this title until it comes out and you can see it on ""Lets Play"" or Twitch. Then make the call if that money spent on this is worth it or not.			"

Early Access Review
								Folk Tale has been one early access game that at the moment I can say is really how all early access games should be made. The communication between the developer and the community is fantastic to say the least, probably the best I've seen yet. The game itself goes through regular substantial updates that actually add real content to the game (surprising I know). Even though right now the game has plenty of content to play and enjoy, especially with the recent 3.0 update, every update moves the game forward to being better and better. The game is great now and I honestly cannot wait until it's finished and is an amazing game!*Edit* And to all the reviewers stating that ""this isn't the game they bought 2 years ago"" or that ""I thought it would be a story but they took that all out for nothing"", these developers (unlike many in early access) actually put forward a choice to their community. They set up a survey for everyone to take to get their input on the direction the game should follow http://blog.gamesfoundry.com/2014/05/folk-tale-player-satisfaction-survey.html and really listened to those who were playing the game. SO all these people complaining here, this wasn't the devs who suddenly felt the need to take out your favorite part of the game, it was the community saying it wanted more sandbox and village management over story. How can you blame video game developers for wanting to please the people who actually play their video game?			"

								Bought the game some time ago, had fun for almost an hour. But the state of the game wasn't really playable at that time. Just a few things to build and test out. I thought to myself ""maybe they should at least make the fundamental playable before adding content and fix stuff"" but I saw what the developer tried to achieve. So, I'm hoping this game doesn't go the same way most early access games went and ""release"" a mere beta for full price. The reason I give it a thumbs up is because the devs them self said, that's their fault if the game didn't impress. That's more than you hear from most AAA-developers with paid PR-guys.			"

								This game has an incredible concept. I'd definitly reccomend this game after it has released the sandbox mode, for right now it's just the tutorial missions. This game has beautiful graphics, a sense of humor, and easy to follow gameplay that anyone can enjoy. If you've got the extra cash, buy it now to support the deveoper if you're interested in Folk Tale.-------------------------------------------When I first bought Folk Tale, I had high-hopes for it. But after having it for many months, and seeing no progress at all, I'm changing my review to not-reccomended. The only gamplay is currently the tutorial, and it feels as if the developer is working on everything else but the promised Sandbox mode.Don't spend your money yet, for I'm starting to believe this game is walking in the path of  ""Cube World""			"

								So they fixed the balance a bit. Still the land is small and the buildings are huge. The hunters rarely hunt which makes it difficult to get a tailor shop up (you can if you hunt mobs, but the loot is out of whack (no leather on 4 wolves out of 5 and the armor/weapons you can craft are the same given to the villagers and heroes at the beginning..so what is the point of crafting). The villager will steal and there is no information on why or how to stop it (just slapped in game with out any clue to the reason behind it). I did enjoy some of the balancing and for a short time enjoyed the game until I got annoyed with the things I mentioned above.I do not like getting a threat by the developer about reviews that are not postive. It is in the forums. I paid for this game. I tried to help and still the game has many issues and not completed after a long time. I am more angry about what the dev posted about reviews than anything. Not all negative reviews are trash, they have valid concerns. So, this stays negative and I suggest my friends stay away or stay away until game is completed.			"

The dev team are very active and reply back to all questions asked. Even a huge debate about a pause button. Yes it is still EA but they have regular updates, and the community that follow this game send in regular reports to help out the dev team. So for me its a big thumbs up for this game :)			"

								Having purchased more than a few Early Access games i can say that Folk Tale is among the best Early Access games, with surprisingly high quality of content, good stability and few bugs. It receives steady updates with improvements to existing features and addition of new features. This has been the case since the very first release which was basically a demo, after which development was essentially started from scratch.  Many EA games are said to have ""potential"" - which is usually said in contrast to a myriad of problems that those games have. Although Folk Tale is obviously far from perfect simply because it is not yet finished, this game does not just have potential, it also is of high quality and very much looks like it will deliver.

Early Access Review
								Folk Tale is a game where you build a Village and have Heros go into Dungeons and find epic loot for you to take Home and be used by your Village. I bought this game a week ago and saw what I have to saw, I saw everything it had to offer. The Campaign, the Sandbox. All was boring. I even tried to subscribe to workshop mods but when I try to load a few, I crash instantly. Don't get me wrong, the concept of Folk Tale is amazing. I like it where it's like Diablo but you can build a Huge City while your Heros go into Dungeons and find loot. Building in this game is quite similar to the game Banished. However, the game is mostly aimed at City Building. But it doesn't have that feel, you should have more buildings that your Colony actually needs. The game just doesn't have that challenge. Like for example, just put down one wood cutter and in a few hours of gameplay you should have 3.0k Wooden logs and 3.0k Fire wood. Literally, that's how easy the game can be while you wait for things to get produced. The combat in this game is fairly decent, however there is still some flaws. Your Hero can easily get overpowered by a Spider Queen. Literally, they should not. Spider Queens are common and should be weaker than your Heros, they will also attack your Village as well, killing most or all of your Villagers in a second. I also HATE the fact that automated defenses you put in *e.g Turrets* have a limit to how many can be placed. The limit should not exist, Engineers should be able to place as much Turrets and traps as you want. They don't maintence or give ammo to them, so why bother give them a limit? One other issue is that your Villagers will consume resources fast. Faster than you can produce most of the time. Literally, it tooked me three hours to find out how to make more basic clothes than what will be produced in the future. Oh, almost forgot. If you are unlucky, Spider invaders or others will kill your Villagers that have important jobs. Your Villagers should flee from incoming enemies, not retaliate. They should just let them destroy their buildings, who cares? They should shout out for help so nearby City watchers and other combat units will hear and approach who said help. This is the reason why your Villagers die so quickly and all of your Cities needs are easily overused. Now, the AI. The AI is terrible in this game. When there is literally trillions of friendlies attacking a enemy. Your Hero will not attack and just walk away if the enemy attempts to walk closer for a attack. Their special abilties work, however they will not attack regulary, rendering them useless. This also happens to other friendly NPCs and your Villagers. Now, my final problem. Not a lot of players may not like just sending your Heros to Dungeons and other areas. You should be able to claim Dungeons, for example. Make it your mining facility, or JUST plain another Village there. You should also be able to send Combat Villagers with your Heros. I hate sending only my Heros. I would love to see if my Combat Villagers will follow my Heros, even to Dungeons and other areas. In conclusion, I never write bad reviews but this one deserves one. I do however blame the Developers for not adding those simple features, it's just common sense, why not add those I just said. I certaintly hope the Developers will see this review and fix bugs and add new features in I just addressed, then I will change my review to positive. For now, don't buy this game. The Developers haven't been adding good features for a while and they deserve a review that addresses this issue. Do not buy this game, it's not worth your money for now.			"

								The developers of this game can suck my♥♥♥♥♥for the disappointment that was this game. Bought this for my dad on the off chance that it'd be an enjoyable game for the both of us and between us we have about 50ish hours in the game, content updates have been god awful, and the game has failed to meet any and all expectations.Yes, I know it's Early Access, but that doesn't excuse it being garbage.

								As of this moment in time if you're skeptical or looking to buy this title, save your money. The $25 price tag is hard to justify with the less than satisfying amount of content and pace at which it is developed and the gameplay itself is hardly satisfying. Also feel I should mention the ridiculous in game stigmas about the outside world are completely innopropriate.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is not worth it right now, if I could do it over I would not bought into this game. I don't have a problem with how slow the updates are coming out, for me I voted on this game when it was in green lit I liked the vision they had and that's the game I wanted to play. So as soon as it was released I got it. My problem with the game is this is not the game I bought, their vision has changed alot since green lit, mostly because the community wanted the game changed to a sand box game. That's not what this game was going to be, they where going to add a sand box game play maybe at the end of devlopment, now that's all the games about this is not what I paid for. Getting community opinions is one thing & making minor changes is ok I am all for that, but changing the game in the ways that they have changed is not fair to the people who bought into the origanal vision of this game. In time this may be a great game if it's the kind of game you want to play, for me I will have to wait and see. I would wait until it is alot more developed before invisting in this game, who know's what other changes are in store for the future.Ok I did what Games Foundry asked me to do in the comments. I gave the game another try. Even putting my previous grips aside about them making it a sandbox game first and taking away the story and choices your where going to have to make, I gave it a go.After spending a couple of hours playing it, I still cant recommend this game. Yes they have added more to the game then just a tutorial. As an RTS you have very little control of the game. You have no lists I cant tell who is doing what and who is doing nothing. I dont even have a way to click and bring all of my gaurds together at one point. In a game like this I need to click on list so I can oversee everything not just click on random buildings to get info for it. The way people move around to do stuff you lose track of who is where and finding them can get faustrating. Just like I want to click on something and bring all none working peasants to a single place so I can look over their stats and decide what to do with them and that cant be done easily if at all.The game world looks nice and the game runs smooth graphics are nice. For me graphics dont mean much I dont care about eyecandy if I have a good playable game that is fun. Right now it is a good looking game with no real game play and clunky controls without any real way to manage your town.Sorry I still cant recommend the game and it has nothing to do with the fact it aint the game a bought when it was released. I tried to give it a fair shake anyway and as it stands it still needs alot of work and the player needs to have alot more control of everything.			"

								This game has been released on early access for over a year and a half and it barely has enough functionality to be considered a level editor.  The tutorial seemed like it had promise and the videos seemed cool.  Until you play it and realize every single scene in the video is in the first hour of gameplay.  Then you get to sandbox mode.  A couple buildings and tier 1 units, and of course no storyline, because its sandbox mode. It is missing a lot of basic functionality, the controls are clunky and sensitive, there is very little guidance toward what needs to be done and with the small selection of units it takes a couple hours to play through the entire content available.  Which sums up to a level editor with some basic testing ability.  The early access terms say that it is intended for games a few months from completion so devs can get some help to clear that final hurdle.  This is more like a kickstarter where they haven't done much of anything and want you to pay them to work on it anyway.  I saw this game summer of 2013 and figured I'd wait and see how it progresses, and over a year later I decided to give it a shot.  I cringe to think of what was available last year and I cringe even further to think of the damage this does to the early access program.  I would say you shoud buy this game if you want to support early access, but that won't apply for another two years.  Once the devs get this game to be within 6 months of a decent release, then I would support that statement.  For now I would say stay away until at least 2016.  By then it may be in a beta quality state closing on nearly released.  My prediction is that they jumped the gun on their release on steam, will work on it until the initial profits run out, then release a heartfelt statement on why its the communities fault they cant continue development.  Oh yeah, and I only played a few hours before writing this review because thats the amount of time it took to cover all of the content, and the game became nonresponsive and crashed.  So there's that.  On a final note, if this was one guy working between shifts and on weekends I would be much less critical.  For a full development team working full time, on a commitment to build a product they got people to pay for up front, this is unacceptable progress.			"

								I haven't started this game in decades but it sits there everytime I browse through my library. Everytime I cant decide what to play I give this thing a glance, but I dont have the courage to start it. Because I dont wanna know how horrible or boring it is by now. I dont wanna confirm my deepest fears. This game has taught me that Early Access is exactly like South Park describes crowdfounding in the amazing episode ""Go Fund Yourself"". But Im looking forward to playing the full game when my retirement starts.			"

								I have had this game for a while now and tend to dip in and out of it, generally when the large public update is applied. The game is fun to play and has massively improved over the months since I have had it. The developer is really engaged with the community and is really shaping the game well. Yes it has been in early access for a long time, however good progress is being made, this was not helped by a major change in course. Roadmap is updated all the time and both the campaign and the sandbox are really playable now. Throughout the game there is a dry sense of humour and I must say I can't wait to pay it when it is complete.			"

								I only bought in to the Early Access recently, i missed some of the earlier complaints so i can only speak of the game as it is right now, not how it was 12 months ago.I have to say Folk Tale is looking good. The game is already playable and in the few months i have had it there have been 3 updates, each bringing more options and flesh to the basic engine. This is happening even as the Devs are adding Editing Options and Systems to ease modding.The game as it stands is already playable to a similar degree as say 'Banished' (build your community and survive) but obviously the intention is to go much further and it is by no means polished enough for release as it is. It will be at least another year in Development i would assume.As an Early Access is it doing what it is supposed to do; with regular updates, input from the community and system evolution.If you understand the core concept behind Early Access then it is a recomended 'buy' - if not, 'wait' but put it on your Wish List.

								Last half year the team behind Folk Tale did do a lot improvements to the game. A half year ago i strongly would not recommend this game. I still don't recommend the game, but that is couse of my dislike of Early Access game, of the 6 Early Access games that i bought 2 where playable, 4 where not and in the end only one had real progress. But back to this game. I think the state of this game is in early Beta now, unlike a half year ago when i was in Alpha (only one heavy scripted scenario). The game it self really has potential and the team behind it realy do there work in informing the community. But the team has still a lot to do, not only for the game but also the usability of the game like the UI is sometimes difficult to see what a building does and the control of villagers is a bit a mess (select villager, select building, order villager to do job, this should be select villager, right click building to do job). I really miss the crafting chains, the crafting chains now are really short.I think the game as it is now is only worth €10 (unlike the €17 sold on steam), when they are close to finishing the game I think the worth of the game can be €20-€25.As the game is now i would give the game a 5. A half year a go it would be a 2. So i hope that i can give them a 6 or 7 next half year.			"

I got a second hero unit but only one can be selected at a time and the UI only let's you use the abilities of one character at a time which is poor for an RTS game.I equipped all my units with new items from the mine then everyone left the village and took my items with them!I got 3 new guards and 3 new villagers but no sooner had I assigned them all jobs and equipped them all again and made sure they were happy, they all decided to leave again at once!Looks like this game is still not ready for release unfortunately.

								It reminds me of warcraft 3 and the guild.I can't recommend it right now. It's kinda a watered down guild 2.... playing it makes me want to play the guild 2. So for that reason, I really can't recommend, BUT... if you want a less complicated guild2 like game, this is for you. Very easy to pick up and play. It does have some more modification features to it and is much less daunting than most other city builders. Feels kinda like a mobile game though. If they could incorporate cross platform gaming, get this on mobile devices, and connect the steam workshop to that it would be great Judging by other reviews dev is nearly dead, and there was some UI issues that kinda made me uninterested from the start. Overall, you'll probably want to avoid this unless you're looking for a real simple city builder with minor rpg and customization elements to it.*So, devs are not dead.			"

								Folk Tale has the potential to be a great game, but it's been an early release for more than a year, begging the question on when, precisely, Games Foundry intends to finish it.  Despite the monthly patches at this point Folk Tale is boring. There is little challenge to it and the one, limited quest that was included in the game was removed during the last patch. It's pure sandbox now, which wouldn't be a problem if it was at all interesting. It's not. What may be worse, however, is Games Foundry's attitude toward customer satisfaction; any criticism or question about when the game will be complete is met with veiled threats that mixed reviews may hamper game completion (despite earlier claims that early release sales have provided enough funds to finish Folk Tale). One gamer was even chided to ""focus on the positive"" when he questioned when the game will be completed. Doesn't make me want to give them my money. Or recommend anyone else do so.			"

								Nice little game - I love strategic fantasy games, though I would say this is more tactical than strategic.You control a small number of heroes, to defend your growing town and also to go complete quests, including delving into dungeons and fighting groups of monsters and eventually boss monsters.At the same time, you're improving on your town, managing resources such as food production, training town guards and equipping them. There's a really neat mechanic here, that the hero equipment and the town guard equipment can be moved around, so your heroes can come back from a dungeon with a bunch of loot and use some of it to equip the town guards better. Nice!Currently limited content, as they're still working on it, but there are regular updates and the devs are constantly communicating with the playerbase.			"

								Text book boring. The description and comparisons to other games are atrocious and misleading. This game is a bad warcraft 3 clone (sans map design, production value on heroes, existence of any units at all and even an AI opponent) a slightly upgraded version of warcraft base building (there are some mild production chains and the resources are a bit more Age of Empire like).There is some boring trite dialogue that would humor a 12 year old or someone who finds humor in a rousing ""ouch my nutts!"" rendition. The hero character designs are brutally text book. There is a campaign that couldn't drag on any slower and a horrible sandbox experiance awaiting those who don't want to plumb there way through some tired hack story with unintresting tropes.Also, you can't pause... because reasons...I am guessing the developer hasn't stopped eating PB&Js with the crust cut off since childhood. This game lacks character, depth and design.The only credit I will give is he doesn't seem to give up on it and is charging 20 bucks for it. And it is a whole lot of boring for 20 bucks.			"

								I didn't have much time to play this game. But what from the little time i spent with it it looks promising. Reminds me a lot of old strategy games like WC3 and sorts. Updates come out pretty regular on the experimental branch. So if the Developer keeps up with the Updates and the good work i think this game has potential.			"

								Oh how the mighty have fallen.Ever since I played the ""tutorial"" part of the game, which is a sort of linear guide through the basics of the game whilst at the same time you get some sort of storyline/questline going, I have been anticipating the sandbox mode. However, when the Sandbox mode came around I was disappointed beyond expectations! It was such a god damn mess that I haven't played it since.All in all tho', It might one day be a great game, but I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends.			"

								Bought this game because the game says it's similar to Banished and Warcraft 3. It's not. Totally not, and that's very disappointing for me, because I was going in expecting it to be similar to those games. I played this game for a bit, decided it was clunky and not fun, and stopped playing and forgot about it. I tried to get a refund and Steam said no, so I'm stuck with this boring $20 game. Not happy.			"

								Super sloppy game play. You would think this game was in early alpha. The hero mechanics are so bad that they make this game unplayable. Trying to fight with multiple heroes is a joke. Switching between heroes and spells in the middle of battle is so terrible it ruins the game. This game has so much potential but after three years of tweeks I would expect a much more polished game. The heroes need an autocast feature. It's so frustrating trying to click on a hero click on the spell you want then click on the monster, by the time you get that all done your team is dead.			"

								What can I say about this intresting game? For one it is a very fun game. It does need obvious work and more content. Mostly on mob respawns, more areas, more crafting, more weapons, armor, and gear to craft at the blacksmith and tailoring to equip onto the heroes, workers, and villiagers. A woodworker/poleturner crafter is needed too. To make staves, wands, spears, and bows. Id for sure like to see lots more dungeons and each map vastly expanded to make the game a more enjoyable campaign and sandbox adventure. This game has so much potential and so much more it could have in it. Elves and Dwarves seem to be missing. Would be intresting to see more hero choices as well. Like a Warrior Hero that uses 2 handed weapons and one that uses two one-hander weapons. Plus more options and hero abilities would be nice. I look forward to many improvements to this game as it progresses.			"

								Please do not buy this game you are literally throwing your money down the drain, I want a refund for purchasing this game and an apology from the team who have created this what could potentially be a good game and left it TOTALLY incomplete. The missions lead nowhere, the buildings are incomplete, and eventually you get to a point, rather quickly I might add, where your peasants are cold drunks and you cannot provide them with enough MEAD or CLOTHES to make them happy and everyone leaves the village. It is complete RUBBISH this game should not even be on sale because it is SO incomplete I wouldnt even call this a demo!!! For $30 that ive spent on this i feel complete buyers remorse, I am going to uninstall this game and never play it again. TO THE DEV TEAM: You guys should be ashamed for this game and STEALING everyones hard earned money. Again if you spend money on this game you are a fool and have wasted money that could be spent on a game that other DEV teams take pride in and actually complete.GG			"

								Updating my review since this guy did actually decided to develop this game a little. So I'll eat crow and take back what I said about it being abandonware, but that's about all the praise I can offer. Its being called sandbox but what its really mounting up to be is an objectiveless RTS game. Something along the lines of stronghold only you will question why you're playing it 10-15 minutes in. The maps available so far are just too restrictive to call it a city building game as well. Its not a matter of building what you want where you want. Its more like building where you can and should as though it were an age of empires match only there is no real opponent to defeat. There is a map editor but its daunting enough to use that you might as well learn how to use a game engine and make your own game at that point.You can max cap your economy in like 5 minutes where you're making gold faster than you could ever spend it. Yeah that might get tweaked in the future but that won't make the economy feel any more meaningful, not even on a pet rock level as it is in banished. You can level your military units but there isn't much point in it since there is no real progression or challenge. I only found 1 map that spawns invading enemies with any kind of regularity and even then higher level units don't really benefit you. Unit routing is terrible. Camera controls are also intolerably slow and don't work with the minimap.Sure, you can say that things will change or be added in the future. Lets say all of that is true and wonderful changes and additions come. That would still mean this game might be fun to play 6 years from now as I've mentioned previously at the rate its going.P.S. It says I have 20 hours in it but the vast majority of that was leaving the game run sort of as a screen saver since you can leave a game run for 20 days or more and your village will be doing the same exact thing it was when you left.

								Initial Review:In Short: Don’t waste your money.Why do I have so little time in this game...?it's buggy and crashes on me every load, wish I could get my money back, but I will make a note of the development team and never give them money again, so over early access.Updated review after developer asked me to revisit the game:I've sunk 4-5 hours more into this game (some of it was offline), I am playing the campaign.The game doesn't crash on start anymore, but now I am at the meat of the game, or lack thereof, you would think during eons in early access there would be a little more finesse in the game.But no, the game has so many hiccups I can't get into it.If the developer would want a list, contact me again. I went into the first dungeon: On the first door my character got stuck in an invisible barrier, made me realize this is why you don't support early access.After more than a year and a half from my initial review, they are still trying to sort out bugs???Might be playable when Half-Life 3 comes out.Disgruntled buyer			"

								I've owned this game for a LONG time.  It was my first EA game and I've been dying to play it but I've been waiting for launch so I can get the full experience in one go.Lately the game has received a LOT of negative reviews because of how long it's been in EA (though games like Kenshi have been in EA just as long and don't see the negative reviews because of it).  I decided to fire it up today as the game is very far into development and is getting close to release, WOW... WHAT... A... GAME!!!  So far, this game is a perfect 10, I'm having sooooo much fun in it and if I didn't have to go to work tomorrow, I'd probably play it through the night.  Can't wait to pick it up again tomorrow and the best part of it is... I'm still on the tutorial!I seriously don't understand the negative reviews, this game is everything we've ever wanted from an RTS / RPG combo and has definitely been worth the wait.10/10, will buy again... and again... and again... and again...

								To charge $25 for this game is completely outrageous.I really, really wanted to give this game a shot, but when compared to other early access titles, this game falls dramatically short of what should be acceptable. After doing some research, it seems that this was an early access title before there were standards on what was considered OK.It's a real shame that it took me just more than 2 hours to discover just what sort of poor shape this game was really in after years in development, given the refund policy. Any fan of early-access games on Steam would do well to steer clear of this one. I was pulled in by reviewers that stated things like, ""The developer really cares, and really listens.""That does seem to be the case, but the results after X years in development speak for themselves. A developer telling me that I have a good idea is not what I wasted my money on. I wasted my money on what I can best describe as an ""Early Access Idea.""			"

As time passes you think to yourself ""Hey maybe there is something new,"" but when you load it up all you see is the tutorial sitting there mocking you for even getting your hopes up.

								So, right now, I can't recommend this game. It looks lovely, it's got the kernal of a great idea, it has lots of potential, and a lot of talent has gone into the making of it. But, it's a mile away from being playable. The tutorial has bugs, and crashed before i got to the end of it. The sandbox mode is pointless due to no enemies, no costs and no consequences.But...it could be a very good game. I hope and recommend the developers stick at it, and hope they get it right, because I want to play it when they do.UPDATE: 18 months later...So, firstly, I really appreciate the developers replying to the review, that's a rare thing. It took me a while to get round to giving the game another try. My first impressions were things had made a big leap forward, I wondered was it close to a finished game already?However, I would now argue that the story mode has a couple of hours of gameplay before you complete the quests (which there are about three of). There's still potential in the game, it's still a wierd hybrid of settlers and an RPG, with a playable hero and the ability to build your village.However, as the RPG is short, and the village building still seems frustrating (it follows an ""expand till your villagers desert you as you can't keep them happy, then watch new villagers arrive once it's shrunk to a sutainable level, and repat"" pattern).I will come back again in another 6 months & see what's progressed. The positive still remains the high level of quality, in the artwork & other elements, and the continued development. It's not a cynical money grab, but I still can't recommend it, other than to those who wish to throw some money the developers way to see what happens next.			"

Early Access Review
								While the potential of this game looks promising, no major changes have taken place for over a year. The creators of the game cry for more money yet have made little progress still as of this date. I also believe that they ""cook the books"" on the publication of surveys, delineating very little unsatisfaction. It is a shame because they started with a promising game but for some unreasonable explainations cannot complete what they start with. My suggestion is that while it looks tempting to buy do not. You might die of old age before some significant development comes to fruition.			"

								is it just me.......or does it feel like this game is quickly turning into a Banished clone??? I mean ....initially it started off with a build that only contained a tutorial that involved some dungeon crawling and stuff but now there's a sandbox mode that lets you build your buildings almost ANYWHERE where each building has an area of effect of sorts. Seems a lot like Banished now than it did before....but hey....maybe i'm wrong.......it's been a long time since this game went came out in early access and honestly........nothing's really making me go ZOMG I MUST PLAY THIS even though i paid for it :/the one and only game i've gone early access with......i just hope it gets FINISHED one day.

								Game is horrible.  I wasted money on this before it was complete.  Waited a year.  Now it appears to be done and they fixed none of the major issues.  Slow, boring, annoying interface.  just trying to train a villager as a certain type of worker takes numerous clicks.  Per the game instructions you select a peasant and then right click on a building to train them.  However, when you click on the building if you aren't in the exact right spot, it deselects the peasant.  You have to then find that peasant or another (they wander off), go back and try again (and most likely click on wrong spot again as there appears to be no indicator where to click).  Just bad all around.  FYI, this is first and only review I've ever left.  It was so bad, it drove me to post.			"

								I wish I could get my money back. Had this ""game"" for over a year and little to no progress on it. I think that an early access game should have a deadline on steam. If the devs dont meet that deadline - ALL the preorders get refunded, even if it means fining the company claiming to be working on it. Just sayin'....this is rediculous.UPDATE: Okay, so a YEAR later and still nothing. This game is a constant reminder to never trust Early Access BS on Steam. >_> Terrible form.			"

								Unfortunately I cant recommend this game. I know my playtime is low but honestly i did not enjoy the time I spent playing the game (It also crashed twice). Also i have heard its been in early access for just about forever, maybe once (If) its completed pick the game up. The price is also quite high for how much content there actually is in this game.

								Games Foundry  [developer] Posted: 31 Dec, 2015 @ 5:19pmHi,It's true we have been in Early Access for a good while now, longer than I would have liked. It's also true that with hindsight, we launched too early, and that the change to support sandbox cost us a year of redevelopment.But we're still here working hard, and as committed as ever. A few months back increased from monthly patches to almost weekly in the new experimental build:http://steamcommunity.com/app/224440/discussions/0/541906348034355622/I'm sorry you feel development is taking too long. I can empathize. But all I can do is keep the team focused and push on to delivering a great game.Hopefully as development progresses we can win back your support, and in time turn this into a thumbs up review.Have a great new year.SimonProject Lead, Folk Tale			"

								I hopped on board this project as soon as it was available and though I am unimpressed with its progress I place the blame not on the developers but upon the community, the majority of which asked that they give us sandbox tools before an actual game.I've resisted leaving a review but it has come to my attention that bad reviews are jeopardizing the future of the game's development.So I want to plead with those who share my disappointment to find other avenues of expressing it. The forums are a great place to air your beef. Leaving bad reviews in an effort to dissuade others from purchase is only shooting yourself and everyone else in the foot.			"

Early Access Review
								[IMPORTANT, READ.]Before i continue on, i have to say that i've been targetted, attacked and Harassed, including disrespected by the Developement team due to my opinions and mine alone. So therefore, i have uninstalled, refunded and sending a complaint to Steam regarding the matter of unfair censorship. I'll just do this since i have a right, like all people, to our entitled views and opinions as long as they don't go against national laws, this, is not and they are in the wrong.[IMPORTANT, READ]So, let's begin.Folk Tale is a game where you build, construct and erect a village of happy people and heroes, where you'll be able to manage the city you make and send your guards and Heroes out to fight for your land.From what i've read from the description of said game, it's been compared to many major franchises, this, i do not believe and is an attempt to grab attention, after all... this is how companies trick you. Gameplay/GraphicsGemplay is very... clunky, a tad off, if not to say, and the graphics are alright for modern-time made game... but Westwood has done it better and i'll have to admit that the Westwood franchise is something they need to draw inspiration from.Issues With my Game:The only issue i encountered was the framerate dying faster than the wrong-people losing confidence on the Jeremy Kyle Show, and i use that term very fixed on. So i had to just refund the game and ship it back off to the company that is so similar to another one that has had a bad concept of money.. Uber Entertainment.So i've uninstalled and refunded, the Developement team are disrespectful, and so i've no reason to be friends with a developement team who only care for money. Uber Entertainment did the same, and they're now a dying company, it'll inevitably happen to this one.Reasons why Westwood is a better game to play than this:-It had a short, but successfull alpha/beta/testing period.-It spans many games of the franchise, from the Western American Frontiers to the Classic Knights and Kings.-It's mechanics are more simple and the graphics are decent for it's creation of when it was made-The developement team never did censor or attack people who had bad opinions, instead truly listened in and took that to their hearts.-They are not Uber Entertainment or the company that made this game. Not in desires, that is.So here is what another following attack on me was:""you have been banned from Folk Tale DiscussionsYou have been banned from Folk Tale Discussions by a Folk Tale developer for your post in ""Thinking of buying this"": I prefer the Westwod games, so i just refunded and put my review up, got attacked minutes after by dev harassment. I took it down and now reposted it, no trouble so far. I'll just keep doing that incase they copy Uber Ent who made that Planetary Annihilation and decide to attack reviews for no reason. As a community we have rights to hold our opinions, not to be attacked unfairly. i said i don't want their help because i've left the game, then i'm instantly on their attack list. If i get banned for this, then it just supports my claim and just how wrong they are in such strict censorship IDENTICAL to Uber Entertainment.Ban Reason: Don't delete dev replies to reviews when they are trying to support you, then try to necro raise old negative threads. Goodbye.Please review the Discussions Rules and Guidelines.This is a permanent ban.""So all-in-all, i have little to say to this game, it does not need, or even worthy of a description that will say to what goods are in it because there are none. Get a Westwood game from Big Fish Games, they're way better. [NOTICE TO ALL WHO WISH TO POST OR COMMENT]I'll be deleting all form of comments to disagree to this, call me hypocrite but i'll simply say this: If you can't take it in, don't give it back.In other words, if the Devs/Community can't take back in with being censored, then they shouldn't censor others then, should they?P.S: This review stands to be my opinion and belief, hating, negative-attacking or in any form of communication to disagree with me is merely the act of a fool's errand, for it's my opinion, my life, and i'll use it as i deem fit.

Early Access Review
								Updated review - After almost 4 years of waiting (and still waiting) for what looked like a promising city builder/strategy/rpg game it has been morphed into something that is simply not all that fun for me. I had huge hopes for this game, I so wanted it to succeed but it seems to have failed miserably. They have come too far away from what it was originally supposed to be for me to really like this. Good points - The graphics are nice and the enviroment looks pretty. There is some great humour interjected into it and I love the voice acting. World builder is good. You can build your own world and play around with it. There is modding support. Updates are regular. The devs keep you informed.Bad points - Taking way too long to finish. It isn't what was originally advertised. I can't really get anywhere my hero is overpowered way too easily. There isn't enough functionality, sandbox mode gets boring too quickly. It gets stale as there isn't enough to do, I can't see that there will ever be enough to keep you entertained to be honest. The city building side just isn't enough and the rpg element isn't fun. Updates, even though they are regular, don't really fix many bugs or what is fundamentally wrong. The devs can be childish.If you are into this sort of game then I recommend trying it. Who knows you might like it, it may be just the game for you. But for me its not what I was looking for. I try to like it, I really do. But I am really starting to believe that I have paid £14.99 for a game which is no longer much like the game I originally paid for.			"

								I gave the game another try after a few months. There has been some good progress and they seem to be going in the right direction.Combat has been improved a lot since I last had a look. This was the most noticable improvement.Sandbox works as expected, there are a few features missing. But overall works quite well.Starting out fresh was a little hard at first and I had to restart a few times. This was due to villagers leaving without their needs being met. I think there might need to be a rebalance here. I ended up with a town of around 300 villagers.Campaign looked promising and had some nice voice acting. This is where most people should start out as it is basically a tutorial. Sandbox does not have a tutorial.stuff that I would like to see:* Retink Research, possibly move to a tech tree that has items unlocked when certain building criteria are met?* Balance on carrots (I ran out of these but had 3000 bread)* Workers seem to go to random warehouses, instead of the closest.* I ran out of iron a lot, but this was balanced with buying it from the market and building remote blacksmiths.* Maybe increase the limit of workers for mines/quarries?* Possibly look at adding a better heating element, like coal? * Add some sort of mechanic to increase walkspeed of workers via shoes or roads?* I was running out of pies quickly as well, due to a lack of meat. Maybe add livestock as a farm type?Keep up the good work.			"

Now they attack the first target, and remain idle until they get attacked, even if they are sorrounded by enemies and their friends are being slaughtered... What?Why is this game becoming more like a sad, though colourfull, rippoff of settlers? It had so much interesting when they started 3 years ago... Why did they walk down this path?

Early Access Review
								This game is still highly in development and used to be absolutely terrible, but the developers have in the past 2 years have been extremely dedicated to working on the game. Originally this game was pitched as more like a survival game with and old timey fantasy village that you had to build, grow, and defend. Now the game still has those features and more. With the addition of Ser Gregory, a much diffrent unit from the rest of the villagers, it is now much easier to defend and expand your village. I used to try playing this game and expanding and building a happy little village, and then wolves would attack in the first 5 minutes and all my villagers were so weak they would all die and it would be game over. After 5 minutes...Ser Gregory fixed all that and is really like the super hero of the village. He is so unique in the game that he stands out but feels like he has been in the game this whole time. The developers has really wrapped the game's functionality and even campaign around Ser Gregory's existance. This game has gone from a sad excuse as a strategy survival simulator to a pretty promising game that could potentially make a lot of fans, if it ever is finished that is.Now the game keeps crashing on me but I've been able to dabble. There is no reason for it to crash on me but it is, even on clean install and verified integrity.2 Suggestions: Make SerGregory's field of vision wider than the other villagers. He is supposed to be the main star and problem solver of the game and when I use him to scout out areas and kill enemies it's made much more tedius because of that small field of vision revealing the fog of war. I have to run down narrow pathways 2 or 3 times to reveal it all and it wont even be a thick enough pathway to fit the smallest building in the game and that is very tedious.And also the editor needs a lot of work I think. For example I just want to build a nice large area to build a fancy village and then make the outer rims of the maps a little more fancy maybe, but all you give us to use are very odd shapped and small blocks. Either the editor needs to be made more user friendly by a large margin or you need to give us better blocks or materials to work with so that map creation can be a more common thing.Keep up the good work and hopefully the game will stop crashing on me! :)OLD: Great concept, but the development is way too slow. Feels like it really never will be a finished game and that the developers arent taking it seriously. Each update barely does a thing and it's almost a joke at this point. Hopefully they finish soon because nobody payed money for a game that will never get finishedEdit: You start out with basically no ingots, which you need to make a windmill to train farmers to get any food, and villagers are starving to death by the time you can train a farmer, not to mention you have to focus on food and even on easy mod wolves and♥♥♥♥♥♥run in and since you have only 4 villagers they just kill them (just 2 wolves) and end the game. And when that doesnt happen the game crashes if you zoom out too far and start scrolling. The game may have more content but functionality hasn't been fixed for in game play and the resource system needs tweeked majorly			"

Early Access Review
								Folk tale has been on early access for about 4 years at the time of writing but the game had a semi playable campaign from day 1 which was pretty dam funny. However the devs listened to feedback and completely changed the game so the game I purchased 4 years ago, is not the game I have today. Fortunately I still like it, but thats not always been the case when this happens to early access games. Changing an entire games design based on feedback only ends well if the devs dont take 4 years to finish a game and I warned them of this 3 years ago when the massive changes started. Its always wiser to stick to an achievable goal and work your way up, not aim far higher than you can reach too soon in a companies life. The best games started small and got bigger as the companies that made them grew from game to game. Todays early access devs seem to be trying to go from zero to hero in a single early access release and thats just never going to happen. Its a recipe for failure. I get the impression that Folk Tales Dev team is a realatively small developement team trying to make a treble AAA game and not without some success. But all artists have to learn when to call a product finised and move on. However, there are some things that are wrong with this game that should be fixed before that happens. 1) Having a settlement replace settlers based on happiness is a little shallow, it needs to be more interesting than that. The current system means a simple fire can pretty much ruin a settlement unless the player notices he has to empty all the advanced buildings to to ensure the basic ones are fully manned in order to recover. This means they player is playing the system, not the game. A better idea would be a formula that controls how fast settlers come to the settlement, based on what is in the settlement jobs, empty houses and then gets modified by other factors such as happiness, number of soldiers, about of spare food etc.  This will stop new players games ending with the first settlement fire happiness drops off and nobody wants to come to the village, it just means recruitment takes a lot longer than if the settlement was working correctly. 2) The campaign quest line is not as much fun as the original release of this game on early access, there is a lot of back and forth to the same locations. A lot of Quest giver speaks, and that enables a bad guy model that you must to kill in the same location you just came from. Not good quest writing and I specialise in quest mods, having writen 40+ large quest mods and I can tell you now, go there fight this, is generic and boring from a player perspective. Players like a story that matters, it does not have to be complicated, it does not have to offer lots of multiple choices, though they do like that too. It just has to be interesting and for most it has to be fully voice acted. Voice acting tends to generate a lot of negative comments, even when its done well because players have different opinions on accents and other such things. That said, its absence is always noticed and takes away from the game. The voice work I heard in this game has so far been pretty good for a game of this type. I have liked it so far. Folk Tales early releases understood this, it was interesting, it was funny but during the huge change in game design, that good aspect of the game was lost and I think it should be brought back, bring back the chavie goblins and camp wizards. They made the game IMO.The game it self is fairly simple with some solid game play, looking at it as a 50 year old gamer that saw how small companies because the size of EA making games like this. I think the devs should get this finished quickly, and start making a sequel to hold improvements. This is good business, it means people like me will ""if"" we like the sound of the sequel buy another game from the devs. Each sequel would mean a step forward for the game, which is has it should be. Many developers have used this to keep updating the same game and they have in my opinion made some of the best games this way.Instead we are locked in an endless cycle of developement here that shows very slow improvements over a long period of time. A risk all on 1 product approach.Would I recommend the product ?Well let me put it this way, if I say I recommend you wait until its finished, your never going to see the game but if I say yes I recommend it, your going to be playing a game with some kinks that still need to be worked out as explained above. So would I recommend it... Honestly, yes, as long as you know this is an endless developement cycle and dont buy it and wait for the game to be finished as I started to do. The games not a bad game, the devs are not bad devs, its just taking a VERY LONG time to make.Remember its only £15, and its pretty good for the price, though my £1 per hour of game play =s games worth means I have not actually gotten my money out of it yet but then again, I have been waiting for the finished game.... and waiting.... and waiting.... and waiting....

								(Updated at the end)Though ""Review"" is probably the wrong way to go about this, I'll opine on my thoughts from what I've seen so far.  Having only played the tutorial area mode. (I need to try the recent updates with the partially complete sandbox/builder)  I honestly do see the potential in the game, and I like the idea of where the devs are going with it. Whether or not it ends up being successful depends on what features make it into the final product, and how well those features actually mesh. Right now, there's not enough to go on to really make a ""yes get it, or no, stay away"" kind of decision. It is very much ""wait and see how it develops"" at this juncture.In it's current state, I cannot recommend it. But, I would say, do keep an eye on it, and see where it goes. If you're looking for a near-complete playable game experience, stay away. But yeah, the final product could very well be worth waiting for. I am glad to have bought the early access to help support the developers.UPDATE: Nov. 28th, 2016Okay, so, I've given the game a fair amount of time to continue development, and recently came back to give the game another shot, and see what is new. I've only looked at sandbox mode so far, but I do like what I see. Keep in mind, the last time I looked at the game was when it was in its infancy as a tech demo that showed a concept.That said, development has been pretty slow, but I don't really care about development time frames as just about anything can happen in the early stages to severely delay a project. Given the pacing, I think you can expect this game to be in development for some time, but I think at this point the devs are making pretty steady progress.So, do I recommend giving the game a try in it's current state? I do, but with the caveat that I feel the price is just a tad high at $20, and it is still very early access. But maybe my opinion is wrong since I haven't looked at the campaign mode yet, and it sounds like they've fleshed out quite a bit of the first part of the campaign.  Though it was totally unlike Folk Tale, I think Starbound was similarly priced when it was in Early Access, and I did not regret jumping on board with that game. Nor do I regret paying to support the devs with this game.So far in Folk Tale's sandbox, there was a little bit of learning curve, but I did jump right in and skip any tutorials. I was able to figure things out as I went without too much problem. So far, the building construction and placement mechanics have been pretty easy to work with. (I haven't built any walls yet, but all in good time) Everything there seemed pretty straightforward to me. Combat with troops and the hero is pretty straightforward. I haven't really had any ""interesting"" situations to really test unit AI yet, but as long as they're not dumb as bricks like some RTS games, I think it will turn out okay.By ""interesting"" situations, I'm thinking of scenarios where enemy units might try to ambush my group of soldiers, or have situations where they try to distract while a second squad tries to flank, or trying to pincer or trap us in a place with little maneuverability. AI is important when it comes to RTS based combat, and having an AI that responds well to various situations is very important. Maybe there will be some of that in the end product, I don't know, and I haven't really kept tabs on the dev discussions along the way. I'm not really expecting a hardcore RTS experience given the flavor of this game, but it would be nice to see some amount of complexity in combat situations, or in raids on your structures, or in dungeons.But yeah, give the game a try, put an hour or so in, and if you can't stand where the progress is right now, refund, and maybe give it another several months to a year.

								I love this game, but I wish it got updated more often.But that isn't all! I also hope that eventually you can set routes for the city watch and spearmen/cavalry, since they just stand where you last left them, staring blankly into a random direction as everything in the village gets mauled by damn spider queens yet again!I love the latest building aspect and style, but the storyline feels worse than what I saw originally. Back then your peasants were running from their lord because they couldn't eat toast. Done, simple, explains why you're there and why you care about the village. Now a hero saves a village and builds it up because the mayor has found a new love for sitting down and refuses to move his fat♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's no reason for you to care about the village besides as an excuse for building up and the eventual spider queen swarm.4/5 for village construction. Yes, it's a village, not a city. Though eventually you may turn it into a bastion of hope against the spider swarms.3/5 for the combat. Hero combat is decent, you have abilities and level them up, plus new gear. But other than that, that's it. No leveling up your guards, no patrolling your guards around so they stop staring into the distance thinking of toast or the inevitable spiders, and no easy way of locating your guards unless I'm blind.1/5 for story. I genuinely don't know why I, the hero, am here. Did I take a fancy to the mayor's daughter? did I want to try running a village and eventually move up to a military garrison? Or was it because building is fun and the story needs to be vaguely there when you aren't dying to spiders?overall: 2.5/5. SPIDERS!!!			"

								Things have changed a great deal since I first reviewed this game. Any lacking features in the original are long since remedied. The game plays extremely well. Even the tutorial is thorough and humorous. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this game in it's current state.			"

								I'm going to come back and try this game out after it's updated a bit more.Edit: I've played it after some updates, and it appears to be getting to be a bit more playable. Perhaps I shouldn't have been so critical of it being in the early stages it was at. However, I do feel that when I'm attacked when I'm out with my hero, that it doesn't say my village is being attack when it's not.			"

								while i would recomend this game to others i do have a complaint, my crashes after more then an hour booting me back to the desktop when i tried to reload to crashed again, this is my only complaint though, i will say that your tutorial is quite entertaining, and could even be considered the start of the town you play in during the campain. also i have a bit of a nit pick, the spider queens are a bit too quick to spawn, and it could make your life difficult if you need to fight some bandits of wildlife anywhere near a spider nest.
