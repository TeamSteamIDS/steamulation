												☺ Interesting mix of tower defence and puzzle mechanics.☺ Cute and colourful art style suitable for any age.☺ Easy to learn and play but still challenging to perfect levels.☹ Limited replayability.☹ Starts off very easy.Go Home Dinosaurs! is a lovely game that I can heartily recommend for fans of tower defence games, regardless of age. You take the role of a lil' gopher as he coordinates his friends to defend their BBQ from hungry dinosaurs. Tower placement is enhanced as each tower has a specific shape and size, requiring you to plan ahead and maximise space with optimal positioning. As the dinosaurs head towards your delicious steaks (or carrots, if you'd prefer!) you're tasked with collecting additional coconuts to create more towers or can even provide support and get involved in the defence itself.A little undercooked but still tasty and filling.

												Incredibly boring Tower Defense game...Go home dinosaurs is casual strategy game with some elements from Tetris. It has cute graphics, nice sound effects. Very polished game without any bugs. There is only one big problem - gameplay is boring. I will try to explain.- There are only 5 towers and 5 units in the first 20 levels. - The look of the levels is always the same. Only the road changes direction. There is always 1 road. Mobs go through themselves one by one from the point A to the point B. Every level...- There are no upgrades between levels. Actually, there is nothing between levels except new skins for main character- There are no difficulty levels. The only one is very very easy.- There are no types of damage/armor, no numerals of health and damage. There is no strategy. It's just another casual clicker gameI was forced by myself to reach World Two. I was hoping to see something new. I was wrong.There were same 1 road levels with another skin (it was a desert. WoW!). I wasted an hour of my life by playing this game.I think, people who never played TD games and children could find this game interesting.I can't recommend this game for anybody to buy even on a sale!

												Genre: Tower DefenseIt's a tower defense game in which you play a marmot and fight against dinosaurs. The dinosaurs try to steal your barbecue, so you have to defend it. The game has a nice childish comic style. It is perfect for kids. For grown-ups it's easy, but i still had some fun with it.Positive:+ nice comicstyle graphics+ lots of levels+ the game is not taking itself serious+ perfect for children and youngsters+ levels don't take too much timeNegative:- too easy- not much to do after clearing the campaignI had my fun with the game just chilling and playing one level at a time. For hardcore fans it has too little to offer.Fun gameplay: ca. 10 hoursAchievements:Type: GrindDifficulty: EasyTime needed: Medium			"

												It's fun while it lasts, but there is really not much left to do once you complete the three worlds besides unlocking cosmetic items and getting a 100% score for each level. The mechanics are solid, the gameplay is challenging, and the art and sound design are very cute.Go Home Dinosaurs is okay.			"

												Okay, I just beat the game so it's time for a review. This is one of my favorite genres - Tower Defense. But also extremely actiony which is normally not my cup of tea. At first, I had a love/hate relationship with the game. It's fun but you really have to be on the ball. Each level is made up of grid squares and each weapon or defensive machine you place on the field has a set number of squares it takes up AND a set shape. You can rotate these but often you'll find there's just no room for what you want to whoop dinos with. You really need to place things strategically and as quickly as possible. It took me a bit to get the hang of rotating things and getting them on the field promptly. And also deciding what I should choose to fill those limited grid squares. However, once I got the hang of it, I couldn't stop playing. It's actually not a complex game - it just takes a bit of practice. And making sure that all 3 of your steaks survive a level is often quite a challenge! I don't believe this game is worth 10 bucks but if you find it on sale and you're a tower defense fan, I recommend it.			"

												I've never been the kind of gamer to sit down and plan out with the Tower Defense genre. If you think along the same lines, don't stop reading and don't ignore this title. Go Home Dinosaurs! is probably one of the most rewarding games available on Steam and probably one of the best titles to start out with the genre. It has a variety of difficult angles, challening corners, and heart-pounding timing to save your BBQ from threatening Dinos! If the storyline sounds totally ridiculous, just wait until you put a DJ booth down and destroy a dozen Compy via the power of your record scratching. It's supposed to be ridiculous, and loves to point that out about itself! It's a perfect little title to pass the time or bring yourself into a genre you've never thought you'd have the patience for. It has its challenges, but it wouldn't be fun otherwise! Here's your chance to go back in time and send those Dinos home! I highly recommend Go Home Dinosaurs! whatever type of gamer you are.			"

If you like tower defense games, dinosaurs, steaks and other fun things then you'll probably like this a lot.  There are some great puzzle aspects to it and the graphics were really nice looking too.  I definitely recommend this one!			"

												I'm gonna level with you for a moment: I've never had a steak. Growing up with a vegetarian for a mother it was never on the menu, and for whatever reason I've never gone out of my way to eat one now I'm feeding myself. What I gather though is people go a little crazy for them, gophers too for that matter. So you can probably empathize with them when a group of dinosaurs show up to crash their barbecue, leaving no choice but to wage an all out war on the intruders trying to snatch up their lunch.Go Home Dinosaurs is then the chronicle of their grand struggle, playing out in the form of a cute and colorful tower defense game. If hearing that makes you groan as you remember the dozens of other TD games already in your library, I can relate, but to its credit GHD does a pretty good job of making itself stand apart (in both good and bad ways). The most obvious of these is its charming aesthetic, full of bobblehead characters bouncing around spouting off silly one liners as they proclaim their undying love for grilled cow.It also switches up the traditional way in which towers are selected and built, having you first choose cards for each of your towers, which come in various shapes and sizes requiring more forethought in how you plan to position them. This is cool in that it makes each stage feel like a bit of a puzzle, with the towers being the missing pieces you have to try and squeeze in correctly, but it also takes out a large amount of the strategy found in more traditional TD games. Because levels are so tightly wound, it also feels as if there is already a predesignated layout and you are simply trying to figure out what that is. This might not be readily apparent during the first few levels of the game, but pretty soon the difficulty takes a huge spike upwards and makes it almost a requirement to use a select few towers that were seemingly handpicked for a given level.I was also disappointed with how shallow the mechanics are, with no leveling system for towers, or even the ability to remove towers after you've placed them. Being able to only place a very small number of towers and having to pick them all from the start also created more than a few frustrating moments when I completely ran out or chose more towers than I'd have any hope of placing, as it's difficult to judge any of this before you actually play a level for yourself.All the same Go Home Dinosaurs is certainly enjoyable, largely thanks to how adorable it is. If you are looking for a deep and strategic tower defense game, you aren't going to find it here, but what you will is a bunch of ridiculous anthropomorphic gophers cracking jokes and making pop culture references as bands of dinos poor out of caves with the sort of stupid expressions you'd expect from steak obsessed reptiles. If that sounds amusing to you don't hesitate to pick the game up, but if your already shuddering at the thought of their squeaky voices I'd steer clear.			"

												Your objective is to protect your steaks at all costs from several types of dinosaurs and send them home once and for all. Go Home Dinosaurs! is a simple tower defense game with 3 different worlds. Each world has around 20 levels with different paths and while some of them might prove a challenge it’s all up about finding a decent strategy in order to complete the level. As you advance in the game you will unlock different cards that gives you other types of defenses, some are used to slow down the dinos while others can put them at the starting point or even make them smaller and therefore, weaker. The game is pretty much violence free and the bright colours are inviting if you want to play this game side by side with a younger player. In order to promote their own creativity and their decision making skills. The strategy in which tools to choose as well finding the best alternative when spending your coconuts to buy more allies can be a good incentive to play and there’s a decent amount of levels and hours to be spent specially considering the low price (if discounted). By the end of each world you will have a final Boss. Each boss is bigger and while slow, he doesn’t stop. Right before your enemies reach your precious steaks you have two sets of dinomite (eh!) that will prevent them from reaching them, however you will lose one steak. If you no longer have this final defense with you it’s game over and in the final bosses this won’t stop them. I finished all the levels while repeating some of them for a perfect level (or because I was failing them) in around 10 hours and I had a fun time with the game. I believe it’s a good choice to play between those heavy AAA titles or just for a quick-short distraction.			"

												I really enjoy a good tower defence game, and Go Home Dinosaurs! gives you a solid tower defence experience. What I enjoyed even more is the cute art style which this game presents. The adorable one liners which come from the dinosaurs are beautiful!You control what appears to be some sort of ferret that throws rocks at dinosaurs, as well as building the towers along the dinosaurs routed path. There is almost zero opportunities for replay-ability but there is a real solid single player experience here. Yes you can go back through each stage to get three stars, but really, what's the point when all you get is an achievement.Still I really enjoyed it, and definitely one for fans of the genre.			"

												Meh I beat this but it has very little depth. Console port, shallow recycled tower defense mechanic stolen mainly from PVZ but 3D instead of left-to-right. No actual hotkeys that I can figure out. No fast forward. Dinosaurs are cute and the game has cute attitude, at least. For 2 dollars I can't complain, which is the only reason I recommend it. For 2 dollars it's worth it IF you like tower defense games AND you want to see a pink female Triceratops named Tina wearing winter snow booties whilst skipping through the snow. If this describes you then for 2 dollars you might check it out.PS: I must also mention that the entire game premise of ""defending your steak BBQ from dinosaurs that are invading your picnic like gigantic ants"" has a Vegetarian Mode involving carrots. The lack of Tofu Steaks highly annoys me, but the fact that it still has steaks on the loading screen is -unforgivable-. INTERNET PETITION RDY GO KTHX I DEMAND A REFUND			"

Surprisingly funA puzzle/Tower defense kind of game.Im not the biggest fan of the Tower Defense but this game made me more interested about the genre.The biggest difference, is that theres a strategy going in into a level, rather then after, which makes it more of a casual experience and therefore something that leaves me less anxious. I dont need to move units around or upgrade them, or even worry of what its going on the other side of the map.Here, the strategy rellies on analizing the space, see what units fit and how effective will they be against the shown enemy tipes. Stages are small and rather short and the maximum number of Cards/units is never higher than 10.The only issue is that a game like this, clearly made for a young audience, ends up being rather short when it does not increase the difficulty from level to level. So short so, that even after going for the achievements i'm still left with a lot of grinding left to do to reach ""Send 10,000 Dinos home""In sum, i enjoy the most important things about this game, the mechanics are great, i like the flow of the game, i like how it looks...but Dammit, those Voices are really aggravating!

												What a fun tower defense game! Nothing groundbreaking mechanically but being forced to plan your tower placement before the level begins is a unique challenge and the different shapes of the towers is the real source of the fun for me. It's definitley easy for the first dozen levels and some of the voice work can be grating after the 30th time. Don't be afraid to snag this game for yourself or any young children who like games like Plants Vs Zombies or Kingdom Rush.			"

As far as Tower Defense games go, it doesn't have much depth, but the game makes up for it with challenging levels that require you to refine your strategy on some of the harder levels.Overall, I'd say, for $2.50 you can't go wrong buying this game.

												It does not take itself seriously, and it is rather fun. The humor is hit and miss, but i get the feeling it may be aiming for a younger audience. Unlike most TD this one is perfectly suited for childrens as there is no real violence or even gore. The games otherwise play well with a decent choice of towers and the rare mechanic of controlling a main character who also count as a mobile tower on it's own, a bit like Anomaly. If you are a big TD fan it's worth a try at least, but do expect a simpler friendly game.-Lost			"

												Go Home Dinosaurs is an action/tower defense game with puzzle and card game elements. You unlock various towers as you progress through the levels in the form of cards, and before every new level, must choose a set of cards from your collection for use within the level.Each card (tower) requires resources, which are coconuts and they spawn at random times throughout the level, meaning that you are constantly watching for the next coconut tree in order to gather resources so you can place your towers.The ""action"" element comes from not only having to click coconuts, but clearing boulders and knocking down snowmen on some levels to make room for towers, and all while trying to get your squirrel into position to do damage when it's not collecting resources/clearing terrain as your main character also functions as a mobile tower.It's not a traditional tower defense game, it requires much more hands on and faster reactions than most. There's no planning in advance, the dinosaurs travel along predetermined paths, so there's also a puzzle element regarding which tower cards to choose to be most effective on any particular level. It's well presented cartoon graphic style and sound effects are enjoyable.The only negative I have is that even though I love tower defense games, this was a little too much action and not enough strategy. If you like TD games, I advise watching some gameplay videos on youtube before you make a purchase as it might not be what you are expecting.			"

												I really really enjoyed this game.As far as it goes, its a good 3D tower defense that works up for it's cutesy style with challenging levels (if you want to get fully complete! Also boss battles!)So yeah==========Start with the obvious:+Cutesy graphics+Customizable characters (dont want to play this boy/girl gopher? Play a ninja one instead, or a chef! etc)+Purchase 'towers' and 'character skins and buffs' with coconuts that appear around the map+Challenge if you want all 3 stars per level; some levels I had to redo on hours to get them+Bosses can be a bit difficult+Vegan friendly mode, you can purchase an option to play with carrots instead of steaks in the game's shop (in-game currency, not real money).+Characters take up space, and the whole map is a grid, so some characters wont fit if you don't think about it first, that aspect was neat! You can put them anywhere.+Cheap and long, i have 6 hours in kingdom rush with all stars on levelsthis game took me wayyy longer than that, and i still havent finished the last level yet.+It has a lot of cute animations, and each dinosaur is animated/has different move speeds. Theres also winter levels with snowy hats and scarves, some models are the same but have different clothing, so it's individually cute! ------------Cons?I had some issues with sound, but sometimes I think its just my pc!Overall this game was REALLLYY enjoyable and can be challenging for adults too, (I'm 23) and I recommend totally!

												This tower defense game will remind you of «Plants vs. Zombies» while playing and of «Angry Birds» while watching short ""movies"". Sometimes it's fun and thoughtful, but there are some demerits that spoil everything.Many levels are just too easy, especially at the beginning, where more than an hour you will feel yourself a king. A bored one. Sometimes you may use the same tactics for 5 levels in a row without feeling yourself uncomfortable.The worst thing is that achievement called «Go Home Dinosaurs», which says you must vanquish 10.000 enemies. It's like saying ""hey, man, don't you want to complete this game twice?""It's still nice, but could have been much better.64 out of 100.			"

Your must arrange and allocate your defense towers in proper location like Tetris, a famous puzzle game. That is funny. I say it suitable to kids doesn't mean it is simple. On the contrary, some levels are quite challenging. But apart from that, this game lacks replayability once you gain perfectly 3 steaks in all the levels. It have neither endless mode like Orcs Must die 2! nor limited sources and towers like Defense Grid. But its art style is cute. You even can purchase carrot in game to substitute for default steak as the reward for completing a level. What a thoughtful and sweet design! I guess kids like steak more than carrot though.			"

												Solid puzzle/TD game. Towers are all shaped differently and each level is designed in ways to make the player figure out how to place the towers in the limited spaces. There's a couple of active elements to the game as well, you have a main character who can attack enemies in a small aoe around him (an extremley useful tactic if you're going for 3 stars on each level) and collect coconuts, which are the resource for the game.I have two issues with the game - One, it's a bit too easy. I three starred every level with little difficulty.  Two, there's very little dinosaur variety. Asides from bosses and one or so regular enemy, the only differences between the enemies are their HP and speed, which is quite disappointing when compared to other TDs. Despite that, it's an enjoyable game, and if you're fan of games like Plants VS Zombies it's worth checking out at the very least.			"

												Baby's first tower defense. Not bad, mind you, but rather underwhelming.The game has a couple of clever ideas and mechanics, but in the end it's laughably easy and has little to no replay value whatsoever, aside from perhaps getting all the achievements (which are mostly focused on grind, rather than skill).The overall artstyle is cutesy and child-friendly, full of obscure references, clearly made with both kids and adults in mind. But the latter will get annoyed by it rather quickly, mostly due to repetitive sound assets. Same goes for the music, which is so terribly bland that you'll most likely end up muting it.As for the gameplay, the puzzle-like ""tower"" placing seems like a decent idea at first, but sadly most of them are essentially worthless, while others are used reguarly throughout the game, making most of the levels rather tedious and boring.It's a game you can safely give your kid to play. Other than that it can be relaxing, but you'd better get it either at a high discount or for a mobile device.			"

												Yes, I bought the game for the cards... but I did check the reviews first. And I was not disappointed. Reminds me very much of a casual tower defense like Plants vs Zombies, except the focus is instead on not just choosing defenses that would suit the enemy, but also the playfield as well. Unlike PvZ, the layout of each level is very different, and to position your defenses is somewhat like tetris in that each one has a specific shape, and you can build around the shapes to form the perfect defense. I'd definitely recommend this game to fans of PvZ. It feels similar, yet its very different in playstyle, and I feel it's more challenging.			"

												Go Home Dinosaurs! is a cute little defense tower game. It's challenging. But it's not frustrating. You can decide how hard it is by choosing your weapons and goals. So there will be no point where you get stuck. Unless you really want to achieve something. But you could move on. Later you can reach that goal more easily with stronger weapons. It's a solid and nicely balanced game. If you try to achieve everything you will get a decent playing time.			"

												Fairly easy basic tower defense game. You place defenses that each take certain shapes and try to stop all the dinos all moving on the same path before they get to your barbeque,. There is about ten different enemies, only one of which has a variety within the type, so most of the time an enemy of certain kind will behave the usual way - there's no scaling for but one enemy type.Game takes something like 6 hours to complete, but the two last achievements have to be grinded for several hours of more dino rampage. This can be tiresome, but overall the game is decent if you like the tower defense genre.			"

												A tower defense game that seems to be very heavily inspired by Plants vs Zombies. Also, this is one of those hybrid TD games where, in addition to the towers you can build, your character takes direct part in the action and has his own powers. The humor is laid on pretty thick and can get a little repetitive after a while, but overall beat my expectations for what seems like an iOS to PC port.			"

												I thought this was going to be the most childish game ever, but it definitely has a place for the adults.  It's a mix of Tetris and Tower Defense and while there is no leveling up your towers or even selling your towers for that matter, this game comes off as strategic and enjoyable.  I liked it and while it isn't the best tower defense game out there, it is easily worth the cost it is asking for.  If you haven't played this yet, fire it up.  It'll take you 3 hours max to beat and if you are a player who plays in small increments (get a few games in while dinner is on, in-between work, whatever), play this.  It's good.			"

												I definitely like the puzzle aspect added to this tower defense game. The main charm of the game comes from the cute, cartoony graphics and catchy music, added to a steeply increasing difficulty. I hate to compare this game to Plants vs. Zombies, but I felt that this game was definitely more difficult. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the replayability of its competitor. Once you're done with all games and levels, that's that. There aren't any additional puzzles or game modes to play, which means that I was already done after 17 hours with no reason to return (I already went for all 3 steaks/carrots). This could have been a 5/5 if it offered something to return to. The way it is, I would probably give it a 4/5, as it is still very addictive while it lasts.			"

												Charming little tower defense game with less of a resource management scramble, and more of a ""How do I fit my tetris-block shaped tower pieces onto this field to best use the terrain I have available to me?"" puzzle to each stage. Not that one or two still don't come down to juggling reflexes, but so much more goes into the pre-mission planning in this game than you'd expect.Also: don't try to three-steak everything first go, you can bring powerups from later in the game back to earlier levels as you unlock your arsenal. It's so much nicer to try when you have a full deck in your hand composed of crazy super-science than ""I got three gophers with rocks"".			"

												This is a casual tower defense game that you play as squirrels and have to protect the barbeques from dinosaurs.  The game has some nice upgrades as you getting to other places. You can still win the hordes of dinos with wasting of defenders even you could use another type of them who could be more effective. This game is maybe targeted to kids concept wise but also older people can play this game aswell. If you are looking for a simple tower defense game and the childish humor doesnt matter for you then you can buy this game after a price drop it will not cost more than a drink in a bar. Usually i m not playing tower defense games because they are complicated and take time to learn, but this one is definately something that could get to those type of games as a ``beginning drug``. Give it a try.			"

												Cute tower defense, Go Home Dinosaurs! has the basics for this specific kind of game. You have to build towers in order to defeat waves of dinosaurs that are following a path, plus you have access to special powers to help you deal with them. But there is nothing more than that : you cannot upgrade your towers, you cannot not move them (so be carefull while placing them), there is no survival mode ... The only special feature is that you (you are a marmot) can move from a place to an other one freely, so that you can shoot the dinosaurs almost everywhere, even if there is no tower. You will need an empty space in order to do that.It seems that the developers wanted to create a cute and easy game. If you are okay with that, then this game will be fine for you. It is definitely entertaining, and you will have to spend around 10 hours to complete the game (3 worlds, 60 levels total) and unlock all of the achievements (you will need to grind a little bit for the last one, ""Kill 10.000 dinosaurs"").Defend your BBQ!

I had a lot of fun playing through all the levels in this game and finished it after a few weeks of playing it.  You can have a meat or a veggie bbq with your gopher friends.  Dinosaurs seem to want to eat your food so they come in to invade.  You need to figure out the best way to beat them by setting up the board with attacks in hopes that they won't take your food.

												Wow, this is a terrible tower defense game. I bought it for super cheap and, you know, steam cards (!!!) so I figured it wouldn't hurt to try out a new game in one of my favorite genres. Coming into it, I had assumed that it was going to be a little bit cheesy, a little bit boring and probably something better suited for my four year olds to play than me. Fact is, not only is it all those things but it's also just badly managed. To build the towers you're alotted, you literally don't get enough coconuts (yes, you need coconuts to build) until the last dinosaur has pretty much trampled across your defenses. I'm wondering if the developers have every played a TD game before? Everything that is enjoyable about the usual defense gameplay is startlingly absent in this one.I know on Steam there's a general attitude of ""dude, shut up, it only cost $2"" but the fact is, I have a few TD games on my mobile phone that cost less and gave me hours of interesting gameplay.

												[Spoiler-Free Review]Go Home Dinosaurs is yet another me-too tower defense game bringing very little new to the genre. Simply put, it's shovelware, a game that doesn't need to exist, and it gets disgustingly boring after the first 10 minutes (if that).The characters are smug and annoying (borderline obnoxious) critterz who only serve to remind you of your mistake in purchasing this game. I wish I could deactivate it from my account and get my money back, it's probably the worst game I've played on Steam.If I'm missing something here, please, somebody, enlighten me. Why does this game exist if not to exploit us as mindless consumers who only serve to make others money?			"

												This game was definitely designed for a mobile device. I also was probably not this game's intended target market. The style and graphics of the game is more akin towards grade school children who play games on their parents' iPads. If you're a parent, I would recommend this game to your children, it is a tower defense version of plants vs zombies... but replaced with dinosaur!			"

												I thought Go Home Dinosaurs was great. The aesthetic is well done. The strategy is a bit on the light side, but it was competent. Interestingly, your buildings take up different physical sizes and shapes on the map, so you have to piece them together like a puzzle. The strongest buildings obviously take up the most space, but they also tend to be awkward shapes so that you have to use a mix of huge, strong buildings and small, weak buildings. The campaign is about four hours. There's pretty much no replayability.  Definitely a good sale purchase, but perhaps a bit too expensive at full price.			"

												There isn't much for me to add some others have already said about this game.But I'll at least tell why I liked this game.Out of the numerous tower-defence-games, this one certainly is one the most access-able available.It has some features that have been seen some other games too (like resource collection on the map and 2-time-activable-self-defence on ""core"") while also including features that doesn't make this too ""rush-hurry-rush""-type of game (like having a possibility to view the map fully before starting the map itself). A very good feature many newer games are missing is to actually allow players to do mistakes while still keeping all the earned rewards during the gameplay itself (I.E. coins collected during gameplay are automatically stored to your wallet and won't be taken away even if map ends up not being cleared). This especially removes one of the unnecessarily tediousness seen in various other games today.Oh, and yes, you are allowed to mute voice-overs! Extra-points for this option!!			"

												This game is a really cute tower defense game.  Great for a casual gamer especially.  It is not particularlly hard to beat all three worlds (which have about 20 levels each in them I believe) but it is increasingly hard to get three stars in them all.  It gets more and more hectic as you go along.  It's very colorful and has great animation.  This is a great one to pick up on a sale.			"

												Go Home Dinosaurs a tower defense game where you play a gopher having a barbeque where Dinos then invade in an attempt to take your food.Visually the game is bright and has a cartoonish childish look to it that soon grows tiresome to look at. The gameplay here is what kills it. It is incredibly slow to play. Unlike most tower defense games now there is no speed up button to advance gameplay forward at a faster pace. So because of this you are forced to trudge through slow moving enemies advancing forward. You also can not upgrade the towers you do build and are forced to find places to put them since they all take up different amounts of spaces and angles. You also control the main character himself who can go around throwing coconuts at the enemy. The main problem with this game though is just the lack of fun I found myself not having while playing it. Between the slow gameplay and the fact that the game provided little challenge I just found myself growing bored too quickly with not much in game to keep me wanting to advance into the further stages.Overall there are hundreds and thousands of better tower defense games out there one could play. This one is lacking gameplay features and fun factor while being made for a younger crowd. Even on a Steam sale I just can't recommend this.Score :2/10http://apocalypticdemise.com/2015/07/03/go-home-dinosaurs-review/ "

There are loads of different unit types to use and tons of purchaseable powerups as well. This game is a bit more difficult than PvZ, because each level gives you a rating, and getting the best rating on all 60 levels is/will be very hard to do. Bottom line, if you like strategy games, or tower defense games, or dinosaurs, or steam trading cards, it's tough to go wrong with Go Home Dinosaurs!

												A fun little tower defense game, with a funny premise (you are gophers, having a bbq and dinosaurs attack - don't question it).  Many traditional elements (slowing towers, gun towers, meteor type towers, etc), but some fun twists.  You control a gopher who has to collect money (coconuts) to build new towers, but you can also attack, and you can use power ups to enhance your attack.  So it becomes a balance between building towers and spending your money  to give yourself powerups.  60 levels with 3 boss levels.  Pretty fun on sale - def has a 'mobile game' feel - with 3 stars (steaks) to earn for each level.			"

There isn't ""One Way"" to win.  Often there are different strategies of tower placement that will lead to vicotry.  The sound effects are good and don't become irritating level after level.  The same can be said for the music.  I picked this up on sale and am I glad I did.  Now if I could only convince my kids to play that game...			"

It can feel a bit bit grindy if you are getting all the achievements as i have, and once that is done not much replayability. overall a great Tower defence			"

												I love tower defense games, but they often get very formulaic and it can be hard to find genuine innovation. GHD isn't groundbreaking by any means, but the Tetris-like element that demands adaptation to each unique map avoids rote overuse of one or two overpowered towers. Add to the mix a host of charming graphics, campy and hilarious voice acting, and freaking DINOSAURS, and you've got yourself a winning combination.			"

Its amzing how meny referances to flims like 'full metal jacket' and 'aliens' there is. but all of this adds to a quite unique exprince that reminds me of conkers bad fur day but in TD format. Only 1 issue i have is the levels are too short a lot of the time, I think this is a moblie port and it shows with the coins and level length. Still a 8.5/10 from me though. Give it a map pack that adds some long levels (or workshop support) and it will get that 9/10 :)			"

												Neat little mash up of Tower Defense and Tetris. It feels like Plant vs Zombies but has winding lanes. If you can get this for a decent price go for it.			"

												I guess it gets old pretty quickly, and it lacks the upgrade stages of some Tower Defense games like Bloons TD but there are quite a few more itemsand towers to use in the game anyway. It also has an interesting challnege of how different items specifically suit/fit different maps, which brings another interesting element of chalenge to the game (something the game desperately needs more of). Sounds and voices in the game get a bit annoying too, and the game is certainly over priced when not on sale, but I guess it's a fun little toy.			"

												As a parent, my kids found Go Home Dinosaurs on U-tube, after watching lots of otherwise mostly educational dinosaur videos.  If you can get the game on sale, you will get it at $2.50 - then I need 3 copies because I like to vet the games first - then little brother CANNOT miss out on what big brother has.  Anyway this game has been very good value for the kids.""Tower defense"" is the proper name for this type of game - that means stop the baddies reaching your castle/home/nest- or in this case barbecue.  The baddies in this game are cutsie dinosaurs.  The kids earn coins during the game which they can spend in the in-game shop (no real money changes hands) mostly to buy new outfits for their character.  The shop keeper is comic - I was really caught on the back foot when my son asked what moustache wax was - he had heard ""shoppy"" say that that was not for sale!I used to be quite an accomplished Gamer back when everything was coin operated - not so much now.  I disagree with those that say this game is ""easy"" and ""basic"".  It can get quite hard, and my kids did get frustrated at points, retrying the same level (they DO have the choice to just go play another level, which is great).  It was interesting to see strategies emerge - you can let dinosaurs reach your barbie twice - only on the the third time do you lose the level.  One of my sons rigorously defends his barbecue from all-comers.  My other son concentrates on building his defences and only goes all out to defend the barbie on the third time around.Another tower defence game that a lot of kids play is plants versus zombies.  Both games have their merits - and PVZ is certainly a lot more well known.  I would say Go Home Dinosaurs is a lot more parent-acceptable.This game will keep them entertained for hours during those cold winter months (I write this from Australia) until we actually start having real barbecues again.  I recommend it.  PS Parents should play as well - yeah, like you have any free time ... "

												This game is a really cute tower defense game.  Great for a casual gamer especially.  It is not particularlly hard to beat all three worlds (which have about 20 levels each in them I believe) but it is increasingly hard to get three stars in them all.  It gets more and more hectic as you go along.  It's very colorful and has great animation.  This is a great one to pick up on a sale.			"

												I cant really explain this game. Its Fun, cute and a bit of a challenge. The jigsaw elements bring a new flavour to tower defense games. Its amzing how meny referances to flims like 'full metal jacket' and 'aliens' there is. but all of this adds to a quite unique exprince that reminds me of conkers bad fur day but in TD format. Only 1 issue i have is the levels are too short a lot of the time, I think this is a moblie port and it shows with the coins and level length. Still a 8.5/10 from me though. Give it a map pack that adds some long levels (or workshop support) and it will get that 9/10 :)			"

												Go Home Dinosaurs a tower defense game where you play a gopher having a barbeque where Dinos then invade in an attempt to take your food.Visually the game is bright and has a cartoonish childish look to it that soon grows tiresome to look at. The gameplay here is what kills it. It is incredibly slow to play. Unlike most tower defense games now there is no speed up button to advance gameplay forward at a faster pace. So because of this you are forced to trudge through slow moving enemies advancing forward. You also can not upgrade the towers you do build and are forced to find places to put them since they all take up different amounts of spaces and angles. You also control the main character himself who can go around throwing coconuts at the enemy. The main problem with this game though is just the lack of fun I found myself not having while playing it. Between the slow gameplay and the fact that the game provided little challenge I just found myself growing bored too quickly with not much in game to keep me wanting to advance into the further stages.Overall there are hundreds and thousands of better tower defense games out there one could play. This one is lacking gameplay features and fun factor while being made for a younger crowd. Even on a Steam sale I just can't recommend this.Score :2/10http://apocalypticdemise.com/2015/07/03/go-home-dinosaurs-review/ "

												Tower Defense game with not alot of depth. Cheesy oneliners ripped verbatim from 18+ action and drama movies. A bit out of place in a kids Tower Defense-game, no?Still enjoyable on some level.If you wanna get it for teh steam cards, then get it now on the christmas sale for 2 bucks.. dont bother with playing 10 bucks. Go play a flash td game instead then :3			"
