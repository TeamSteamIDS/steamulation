												Bejeweled 3 is probably one of the best Match 3 games available on Steam, or if not, then it's definitely the most complex one. It features various game styles, thus satisfying different gamer personalities. If you like to be under pressure, then there's the Lightning Mode, in which you have a timer that you can be increased by quickly match some special time gems. Diamond mine provides a similar tension: there's a timer too, but in this mode you dig in the stone and sand by matching 3 - 5 gems in order to uncover treasures. However the most stressful game mode is probably Ice Storm - in which you have to fight the climbing columns of ice that quickly threaten to cover the entire board; to prevent this you need to have quick reflexes and a very good perception of the available matches. In order to beat this game mode, I had to switch to mouse and keyboard controls (mouseovering the tile selects it and WASD moves it in the corresponding direction).

On the contrary, for those that like a more relaxed approach, there's the Zen mode - the classic Match 3 in which you can enable/disable different relaxing background effects and positive affirmations. Another relaxed mode, but more suitable for those that have an analytical mind or love to strategically solve a puzzle, is the Butterfly mode, in which some of the gems are transformed into butterflies that automatically move one tile up whenever another match is made; having one of them reach the top of the board ends the game. This implies that you have to plan ahead your moves and optimize the matches so that they contain as many butterflies as possible.

I found Poker mode to be the least attractive of all these modes - you are required to build certain poker hands by having consecutive matches of the same colors. It's a game of chance, since your poker hands highly depend on the randomness of the current tiles.Lastly, there's the Quest mode that contains 40 variations of all these described above: finding a certain number of treasures or freeing a certain number of butterflies, or ticking bombs that need to be matched before the timer wears off etc.The game adapts itself to the game mode you're playing. For example, in Diamond Mine or Ice Storm mode the game will provide you with suitable gems to create matches or 4 or 5 which result in special gems that help clearing up the board faster. In Poker mode you‚Äôre more likely to have gems of the same color grouped together, thus facilitating the process of obtaining good poker hands.All-in-all, this is a good Match 3 game, if you enjoy the style. But it's quite addictive, so it will probably keep you entertained for hours. Even more so, going for 100% achievements requires a lot of time of grinding.More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page "

												Being based on the simple 'Match-3' principle, this game might be considered dull or boring by people who don't like the concept, but for people who do (including yours truly), such games can get really addicting. Ever since I got 4 Elements and beat it, I've been looking for a similar game to fall down to, when I'm not in the mood for anything involving a steep learning curve. I've had my eye on Bejeweled 3 for a while, but paying $20 for it just didn't feel justified. So I waited and waited.... until it was finally 50% off during Steam's autumn sale, and then I snatched it. My greed told me to keep waiting, as I would've loved to pay even less, but I decided to shake off the greed, telling myself that for $10 it was a fair deal.As soon as I started playing, I realized this game was worth every cent of the $10 I paid, if not more. It manages to take this simplistic and supposedly ""dull"" concept of Match-3 and make it as much fun as it can get. It has quite a few game modes, including some with really funny twists (such as the 'Poker' or 'Butterflies' mini-games). I won't keep on rambling, I'll just summerize it - if you like this type of games, Bejeweled 3 is as good as they come. If you're not up to paying $20, wait for it to go on sale or get a coupon or whatever, but either way - make sure you do get it. :)			"

												Very addictive match-3-type casual puzzle game. It's really easy to learn. It has a few modes. My favorite are ""lightning"" and ""ice storm"". It's fun to beat your own high scores and your Steam friend's high scores.Why is it better than other ""match 3"" games?1. It's absolutely responsive. This is very important in game modes that depend on reflexes. If you mess things up, it's always your fault, not because the graphics stutters ;)2. The music is quite cool.3. Really satisfying and entertaining. You get a full game. There are no microtransactions.Very good game to casually waste 10-20 minutes of evening and forget about the world!			"

												The name of the game is most apropos... what can be said of this long running series that seems to be a perennial favorite with everyone that as any passing interest in puzzle games but that it still as addictive as ever?Then again I never really played the older versions so I'll just have to assume that this is truly the pinnacle of the series and with 8 different game modes there's bound to be at least a few that will tickle your fancy if most likely a lot more than that.So if you like puzzle games you got to get yourself a copy of this game sooner or later. If you are afraid of getting hooked all over again then well... staying away might be well advised as well. Still, if you take the plunge then don't beat my high scores or I'll be forced to... RETALIATE!			"

												Long before there was Candy Crush, there was Bejeweled. This is a simple, casual game with a grid that requires you to shift colored jewels and match them into lines of 3 - 5. You can only shift 2 jewels if it will result in a line of 3+ matching colors. Very easy game, but where this game blossoms is all of the mini games / variations of it. Dozens of modes, all centered around making lines. There is classic mode that has you going through levels making lines, lightning rush, which has a very limited time and you need to collect time ups to keep going, diamond mine, where you need to match lines near the bottom rock to destroy the rock and progress further down. Bejeweled poker which every line is like a hand gains you something similar to a card in poker. Butterfly mode has you making lines with jewel butterflies to keep them from reaching the top of the screen where it will be an end of game. There is also a never ending zen mode, which is just like classic only without levels that break the flow of what you have going. Finally, there is an ice breaker mode which forces you to keep up with rising and freezing water. Once a line gets frozen enough its game over.In a way, I prefer Candy Crush, because they have focus on levels, rather than letting you free to pick modes to play. I just feel overwhelmed with all of the choices and just end up playing 'classic' mode for the most part. On a plus side, unlike Candy Crush, there are no micro transactions. You've bought the whole game and need to unlock the modes.Bejeweled 3 has a level system that keeps track of all of your points throughout all of your games and a high score amongst your friends. That seems to be my real driving force to play the game, just to beat my friend's high scores and since every time you play, you start with a random grid of jewels, its got something to do with luck as well as skill.I can recommend the game, but I could recommend it more on the phone. I just feel there are better games I could be playing on my PC than something as simple as this. Tetris sold Gameboys, not  Nintendo Entertainment Systems.			"

												Bejeweled is actually one of my favourite ""classic"" games. It's one of the original Match-3 style games, with everything done right. From different modes, to combos, to the timers, the sounds, the graphics, everything is satisfying and it has none of the gated frustration of most match 3 games have these days, catering to the mobile in-app purchases crowd. Where candy crush makes me want to punch a baby in annoyance, Bejeweled makes me purr with happiness. And trust me, I'm not that easily pleased.I do think this game plays better on a touch screen device, I play it a lot on my iPad, but you can get extremely fast matches for high scores once you're used to the keyboard commands. Mouse clicking makes it kinda hard to beat some of the achievement / score timers but still fun. If you are wondering how to beat some of the achievement challenges and you're using the mouse - switch to keyboard matching. It'll be slower at first but once your fingers and brain catch on it's a LOT faster.If you don't enjoy mindless timewasting match 3 games then you will not enjoy this game - but if you like simple, satisfying puzzles, big combos and lots of challenges, this is one of the best match 3 games I've played - and I've put in hundreds of hours on my iPad that I don't even regret.

												Overview: Match-3 Bejeweld 3 is one of the best match 3 games you will play on Steam. Although I am not the biggest fan of the genre this game has enough creative ideas and game modes to keep the game interesting and fresh. Although the game play is basic, simply moves gems around to create three of the same type, with enough practice you learn that there is some strategy involved. I‚Äôm sure people who love these types of games can spend 100s of hours playing it.			"

Simple but addictiveThis game is for everyoneI usually don't play casual games. I love my singleplayer RPGs, competitive FPSs and Contra like run 'n' guns.But most of all, i love good and fun games.This is what Bejeweled 3 is: A fun game.I don't know what to say about this game...there's 6-7 different gamemodes which is more than enough content for such a game.I love the music! It's beautiful, relaxing and just suits this kind of game. Seriously, the music keeps me hooked!Game looks beautiful and isn't too hard nor too easy. It's relaxing. It's the kind of game you play when you just want to lay back and chill.You can just hop in and do a quick 5 minute match and then quit the game again. You can't do this in most games because you either need to reach another checkpoint or you just couldn't get s**t done in 5 minutes.Be warned tho, the game is very addictive. I thought that my last session was like 15-25 minutes long but turns out that i played this simple game for 1.5h straight. "

Kidding aside, this sequel includes some new modes that keep the game fresh and provide surprising depth. The modes aren't just new skins or cosmetic differences; the strategies needed to succeed in them vary quite a bit, increasing replayability and preventing the game from becoming monotonous.

												Bejeweled 3 is an addictive, match 3 game from PopCap. At its core, Bejeweled is about matching 3 or more gems of the same type. It's this simplicity that helps make it so appealing to casual players while its different play modes, steam leaderboard and acheivements entices more seasoned players. The game has attractive graphics and effective, dynamic music that increases in intensity as your chain matches. Combining randomly generated gem layouts, 8 different play modes, and a leaderboard to compare scores with your steam friends; Bejeweled 3 will have you coming back again and again.			"

												Bejeweled 3 is what they call a 'match 3' game, meaning you need to combine three or more of the same items on the game board, which then disappear, to score points. In this case those items are jewels that come in 7 different colors.You decide how complex you want this basic principle to become by selecting one of the 8 game modes. Some modes are very casual, like 'classic', 'poker' and 'zen'. Others are more intense because they add a timer of some sort to the game board. There is also a 'quest mode' in which you will play all of the game modes in some form, easy versions at first and more difficult with each level. You don't need to finish all of the games of one level in order to play games from the next level, so if there are one or two game modes you don't like, it's no problem to just skip those each time and progress to the next level anyway.In each mode, the game will explain clearly what the objective is and what the specific 'twists' for that game mode are. The background music is quite nice but you can switch it off through the Options menu if you want.There are a lot of Steam Achievements to be had, which adds even more challenges. Some achievements are built up to by simply playing the game, others are specific goals to be reached in one or more of the game modes.I recommend giving Bejeweled 3 a try if you're at least a bit into puzzle games, and even more so if you can get it on sale.

No timers or pressure.Lightning: Exhilarating, heart pounding race against the clock.

The Tragedy of BejeweledI got this with the Origin humble bundle. I decided to play it to waste some time waiting for another game to download. This wizard-sorcerer-magedom destroyed 5 hours in a row of my life.Sit and listen to my tale, for it may save you from eternal damnation.The premise of the quest seemed innocent enough, ""Thou shall combine th' jewels of same purpose and they shalt bequeath onto you the path forward."" Each combination of the arcane jewels would expel a wondrous light that would melt any icy cavern, cut through the webs of a spider ridden forest, or sweep away entire dunes of the driest desert. However, unbeknownst to I, there was one fatal drawback. The lights, the explosions, the lightning ... I-I couldn't stop. These cubes--they called for me.That's when it happened. Two cubes next to each other.I didn't know what to do. My mind argued with itself thinking, ""I can't, I shouldn't, I musn't ... I have to.""My soul couldn't comprehend what happened next.A silhouette of a man stepped out. My eyes, vexed by the colors, attempted to inspect him further. He was short, but intimidating. I remained paralyzed--awestruck--mind racing for an explanation. He paused and revealed a large grin on his face. With a single swipe of his tiny hand everything and its existence around us turned into a bright energy. The divine light displaced electricity in an ear deafening crackle of explosions. His mighty voice, as if emanating from the ground itself boomed ""spectacular.""~~I sit here now, a vessel of an unknown man, petrified by the curse known as Bejeweled. Time is non-existent outside the confines of it's own dimension. Be wary, those who journey the path of the Jewel. Heed my tale as warning, traveler. This pied piper may claim you akin.Oh yeah, did I mention the music is FTL-esque and pretty cool? "

												It has been many years since I had my phase of Bejeweled 3 addiction, and those are fond memories indeed.I'll review Bejeweled 3 here as I remember it.Bejeweled 3 is the amazing sequel and massive improvement to Bejeweled 2 that none of us would have seen coming. Bringing with it surprising, positive innovations while still preserving the option of the great core gameplay of Bejeweled that we have always known and loved. There's not really much to be said about the gameplay other than it's Bejeweled, but better and expanded, taken in brilliant new directions while preserving the old. The presentation of it all brings the experience as a whole to such a greater level than we'd have ever imagined. The new visual splendor is exciting, pumping, and filled with eye-candy while at the same time being beautiful and serene, and most importantly, still conveys the gameplay without obstruction or serious distraction. It is accompanied by magnificent audio design, with the sound effects adding that satisfying edge to each and every move, while being clear and distinctive to give more feedback as to the state of the game and our actions within. with more skilled matches giving more and more satisfying and exciting audio responses. The soundtrack is simply phenomenal, a beautiful collection of tracks by demoscene composer Peter Hajba that both serve to immerse you in the experience of the game while also conveying the mood, ranging from blissful in the Zen soundtracks to heart-racing in the Ice and Lightning modes. Bejeweled 3 is an incredible example of taking a simple, previously lighthearted and arcadey 2D puzzle game with no story, no defined world, no characters, and all that and turning it in to a wholly immersive experience, bringing with it a sense of awe and so many different feelings of either bliss, rage, rage, or hecticness all based around the core swapping-gems gameplay.The only shortcomings that come to mind are generally in regards to aging. The visuals can feel a bit low res now on a big screen or high res display. But that's reallly the only possible criticism here.It was the real Popcap's last game before their tragic acquisition and subsequent adulteration. And what a magnificent note to go out on it was!Rest in peace Popcap Games: 2000 - 2011.Verdict: BUY IT - even at its non-sale price, it will provide massive amounts of value and fun. It makes an excellent addition to every Steam library.			"

												Alot of variety of different variations of match 3 games in here, yet the mechanic is the same, familiar one.  Bought on sale at like $1.25.  Worth it.  If you love match3 then this will be worthwhile at full price too.If you like relaxing and sometimes not relaxing match3, then this will make you happy.			"

												Bejeweled 3 is a Puzzle game.We have a lot of puzzle games on steam.Only I find Bejeweled still one of the best games out there.Game features geweldigde relaxing music.Beautiful backgrounds and beautiful moving visual effects.Very addictive and fun to play for a long time.It is intended to slide stones and so as to make at least a row of three.If you have 4 makes you obtain this special stone for extra bonus points.And you get it done to get there 5 merge even bigger bonus.What makes better part 3 of the other parts?This game gives you many options like classic, zen, lightning, quest and 4 other options.In short, very extensive and there is much to do in the game.And certainly an improvement over the older games.Unfortunately, there is no option for multiplayer only online high score.Hope they can add this once.It's fun, it's addictive I give it a 9/10 score.

												Whether you are looking for a mindless relaxing game, a challenging puzzle, or a strategic race against the clock, this game has a mode for you! The music is great, the narrator sounds epic, and the graphics are gorgeous and shiny. I warn you now, you WILL become addicted to this game.There are four regular modes and four unlockable secret modes.Classic Mode: The matching game we all know and love. Match three or more in a row for points until there are no more available matches. Match four or more to create powerful special gems.Zen Mode: Same as classic, but endless as your moves never run out. There are also additional options you can add for relaxation such as aural tones and breath modulation. I like to play this mode on mute while I listen to a podcast or the news.Ligtning Mode: Race against the clock and get as many points as possible! You can extend your time by matching up the special time gems. Match quickly to get a speed bonus.Quest Mode: Forty puzzles and eleven mini-games all using the various available modes but with a specific objective. Beat the clock, only use so many moves, etc.The Secret Modes: Butterflies, Diamond Mine, Ice Storm, and Poker. I'll let you discover those on your own. Personally my favorite of those is Poker, with Diamond Mine a close second. Now get this game already, and have fun! :)			"

A more comprehensive version from the much loved Bejeweled Express, Bejeweled 3, allows you to play in various modes, earn achievements, and more.

												I didn't think I could ever get into puzzle games until I picked this one up.The Bejeweled franchise is similar to those typical facebook game apps (Candy Crush being a good example), where you must match identical gems next to each other by swapping them across the screen.  However, you can only swap gems that are above, below, and to the left and right of each other.  The game not only challenges your eyesight, but your strategical skills as well.The main game can keep you entertained for a couple hours, though it offers other gamemodes if it feels too repetitive.  Some require you to work under a time limit, destroying gems to accomplish objectives, and more. You'll find that a couple gamemodes may require you to plan ahead while you play on to guarantee your success.Obviously, the game is perfect for casual gamers and competitive players alike.  I am a little disappointed that the main game (Classic mode) usually predetermines your outcome for you.  You can find yourself reaching past level 10+, or even lose at the beginning of level 2 - all because of the gem randomizer.  A ""NO MORE MOVES"" announcement will pop up on the screen, which means...well, there are no more successful gem movements you can make.  This is the only way to get a game over, but it comes out of nowhere and you can't do anything about it.  There may be some kind of strategy to minimize your chances (AKA scoring as many points as possible in single turns to move to the next level), but you are going to lose randomly eventually.Overall it's still worth a buy with the amount of content provided.  The game has an amazing HD polish, complimented by the clear sound effects.  Go ahead and give it a try!			"

												Simple, addictive, light-hearted, fun and yet can at times be oh so frustrating. Bejewelled is  a classic 'while away the time' game, nothing too complicated, can be played at your own pace (unless your in one of the many timer modes), exercises your mind as you try to work out the best fall patterns and  is easy enough to just pick up and play that it becomes a great 5 minute game (followed by the inevitable, just 1 more, just 1 more...). Add to that the fact that its currently in a bundle with 7 other popcap games for just $6 and it just has value for money stamped all the way through it.			"

												I remember playing Bejeweled when it was a pop-up window in the browser, years ago, having to view the ads to play for free.When I saw this on Steam it was pretty much an impulse buy. One of the best games in my inventory.This game is great if you want something quick to jump in and out of. The different modes cover almost every personality/gaming type out there.There is a Zen format which has no timer and you can totally zone out on.  There's also the Diamond Mine experience if you're more of the OCD, hurry up, explosion type of person.A very enthusiastic Thumbs up from me, this game is well worth the cost vs enjoyment factor.For the price you'd be silly not to get it yourself.

												Well, these gems are polished by the real masters. Graphics, music, sound FX (working surprisingly well even on older low-end hardware) - everything is cool, making the game a hot candidate for the ""Test Of Time"" award. The game offers 8 substantially different modes (+minigames), varying from fast action frenzy to very slow tactical calculations before each move.   If you like this type of games, you find it addictive. To reach 100 % achievements requires both well-trained skills and a good portion of luck - and the progress strongly supports ""Just 5 More Minutes"" approach. There are tutorials with advices - I confirm that to make 100 % without cheats and without keyboard is not easy, but can be completed in a reasonable time. WELCOME BACK !			"

												Match-3 puzzle games are kind of my guilty pleasure in gaming.  Games like Bejeweled are really great games to play when you need a break from that unbelievably frustrating mission in whatever other game you're playing at the time.  There's a plethora of game modes that are all equally awesome to play (my favorite are the poker and ice blast game types), and there's even a quest mode of sorts where you can complete challenges.  Is it necessarily a game that is going to attract the long-term attention of ""hardcore"" gamers?  Nope, but it's a great game to play on breaks to clear your head if you're getting annoyed by another game!			"

You have Zen mode for relaxing, Classic mode for people who miss the old game, Lightning mode for a ""time attack"" style of play, quest mode for people who need to be told what to do, and then there's Poker mode for a more ""thinking man's"" game, Ice storm for people who thought Lightning mode was too easy, and ""butterflies"" mode, which unlike Zen mode, you can actually lose, but it still manages to be somewhat relaxing.This is worth playing.

The graphics are nice, the music is fitting and doesn't feel too repetitive, the interface is alright, albeit a bit plain, and is responsive as needed. The game plays smoothly and is fun whether you want to relax for a while (Zen level) or try your reflexes and observation skills in the timed levels. A mode with little more time on the clock in the timed levels so as to play a little more ""relaxed"" in these levels wouldn't hurt but it's enjoyable as it is.Bundled or not.. it's fine! "

												This is Bejeweled 3. In case you haven't realized that, now you know. Go buy this game now.Alright, fine...Bejeweled 3 is the fourth game in the brilliant match-3 puzzler series by Popcap. Yes, this was before King and their copycat ways made them #1 on the mobile industry, and before we got an explosion of lazy, cash grab bejeweled clones on Facebook. Bleh. Alas, we still need to be thankful for the game that not only made others copy from how good it was, but also improved over its previous games in many ways.The gameplay is simple, match 3 gems or more to clear them. Matching 4 or 5 will give you flame gems, hypercubes, and lightning gems, so you'll be able to clear more gems at once later on. While the mechanics are simple, Popcap managed to twist up the rules in fun and exciting ways in their eight different game modes. Classic has you going for high scores, Zen lets you relax and match gems..forever, really, Lightning makes you panic as you try to gain extra time while using the 60 seconds given to score tons of points, the amazing Quest mode that REALLY changes the way you play Bejeweled, and there are so many others.. Well, 4, actually, but they're so deep and compelling, it just leaves me begging for more.Bejeweled 3 is no diamond in the rough either, its visuals are absolutely stunning. Whether it's an explosion from flame gems, a lightning strike for lightning gems, or the beautiful (active) backgrounds while you play the game modes, it's truly pure eyecandy. Speaking of candies, this game has awesome earcandy as well. The music is quite enjoyable and another thing I adore about this game..I honestly can't say more. If you haven't bought this game, I HIGHLY recommend it. While you could play something like Candy Crush and wait a whole 20 or so minutes just to have another go at the levels that almost always end up weaseling money out of you, instead, play what the fools were trying to imitate, but failed to do so. Bejeweled 3. OUO			"

												Bejeweled 3 is a fresh new take on a puzzle classic. It takes the original match 3 formula, and revamps it in a variety of new game modes. The modes are diverse, and range from the action-packed lightning round mode, to the relaxed and soothing zen mode.  Which modes you like and dislike will be based on your own personal taste, but there is something for everyone in this game.The game is cramp-packed with modes and content, so it is well worth the price. If you are a fan of bejeweled, or the match 3 genre in general, this is a must play!			"

												This game is an absolute gem. Had this on PC for the longest time, finally got myself a copy on Steam.There is just many things and mod to play. If you feel like you want to relax and just enjoy yourself while thinking and planning ahead before you make your next move, Zen/Poker/Butterfly are the modes for you.Now if you want something fast pace and challenge yourself with time mode. Lightning/Ice Storm/Diamond Mine is your way to go. My personal favorite has to be Diamond Mine, fast pace, lot of explosion going off.  I saying to myself OMG I was so close to getting to next stage or I could of done so much better after each game, next thing I know I been playing for hours.			"

												This game is an absolute gem. Had this on PC for the longest time, finally got myself a copy on Steam.There is just many things and mod to play. If you feel like you want to relax and just enjoy yourself while thinking and planning ahead before you make your next move, Zen/Poker/Butterfly are the modes for you.Now if you want something fast pace and challenge yourself with time mode. Lightning/Ice Storm/Diamond Mine is your way to go. My personal favorite has to be Diamond Mine, fast pace, lot of explosion going off.  I saying to myself OMG I was so close to getting to next stage or I could of done so much better after each game, next thing I know I been playing for hours.			"

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 23Bejeweled 3Purchase Date: 3/6/2014Match 3 puzzle games have been around a long time, and Bejeweled is one of the older series of these games.  If you ever played that awful Candy Crush Saga, then you can think of Bejeweled as it's much less obnoxious uncle.Bejeweled 3 is a match 3 game first, and not a mobile game, so thankfully it doesn't have a lot of the annoying mechanics that you find in the typical mobile game.  It's not begging you to add friends or buy gems or enticing you to click on a picture of Kate Upton's boobs to download the latest version of Fire Age.  Bejewled 3 gives you a screen full of gems, and it wants you to match 3 of them, and that's as complicated as it gets.In fairness, I should add that this version of Bejewled does come with 8 different game modes.  4 of these you get immediately, and as you progress in each game mode you will unlock an additional game mode.  So it does vary up the gameplay somewhat.  Some of the game modes are timed, while others are more strategic.  It also has a Zen mode where you can just mindlessly match gems as long as you want.So the important question you need to ask yourself is, do you like matching gems?  Because if you like matching gems, then this game is for you.  If you don't like matching gems, then you should stop reading this review and get back to playing Fire Age.			"

												You may think this is a casual game. You'd be dead wrong. Simply put, this game is as epic as they make it. Yeah, Bejeweled 2 is a casual game, but Bejeweled 3 is as epic as a Match 3 game is allowed to be. It also has a better soundtrack that I don't switch out for blink-182 or The Aquabats! or something.			"

												Out of all the nostalgia that old PC games brought me since Windows 98, one that stood out for me was the Bejeweled Deluxe series. Branching from a trillogy to two extensive games such as Bejeweled Twist and Bejeweled Blitz (a more competitve version of Lightning). Which I'd also recommend playing if you own a facebook account. Bejeweled 2 & 3 are probably my most favorite to play to this day. Part of it brings me back to my younger days when I had a computer all to myself for the first time and I explored all the different games my parents installed and the ones that were set up by default when you purchased the operating system. In Bejeweled 2, you saw a massive installment in comparison to the first immediately. You could do puzzles and explore beautifully designed planets all while using your head to solve complex puzzles throughout your journey. Also it introduced us to the amazing use of the Hyper Cube and the Flame gem. The art alone still is breathtaking to look at if you played B2 today. As a fellow artist. I can appreciate the amount of skill and determination these developers put in to create these beautiful and stunning planetary landscapes. Now for Bejeweled 3, a whole new world is brought before you in a whole new environment instead of outer space. You are surrounded in ancient marble remains of lost cities and temples along side with some olden statues of mighty animals. All with beautiful animations if your computer can handle the highest settings. B3 brings back ""Endless"" which has been renamed to ""Zen"" in this version while a bunch more levels to surpass compared to B2. The rest you will have to try out for yourself to see. Lastly, one thing I admire about the Steam version of B3 is that you can compete with your high scores against your fellow Steam friends. Unlike in the original B3, you could only have a sense of competition if more than one person used your computer and liked playing B3 as much as you do. So with that said. I'd give this game a 10/10 for beautiful art, animation, & addictive gameplay!			"

												This is a really fun game with a different mode for ever mood; Classic (match jewels in a line of 3 or more to blow them up), Zen (same as classic but you'll never run out of moves), Lightening (blow up the jewels as fast as possible, you‚Äôll be judges on speed, combos and the difficulty of them) and Quest (restore five items by completing eight minigames tasks per item, e.g. match jewels close to the ground to dig it away an collect five gold before the time is up).The modes also come a secret game each; Poker, Butterflies, Ice Storm and Diamond Mine. These are locked until you've reached a certain level in the various modes and are new exiting variations of Bejeweled (so, Poker is not actual poker). Ice storm is seriously difficult and a must for those who like arm-cramping-speed.The graphics are very good even for today‚Äôs standard (the original game came out in the 90's); the resolutions are normal (800x600), High (1024x768) and Ultra (1920x1200). You can view the game in boxed or full screen - I prefer it in boxed since it makes the graphics crisper.The backgrounds are beautiful and animated - they switch every level..There are both in-game badges and steam achievements to earn with the game - which is really nice. :DThe game provides a lot of versatility and hours of fun - and to great music! I was surprised at how good the soundtrack was and I never get bored of it.Also, about the Zen mode: It is not just soft music, it has a number of features like; instead of the music you can e.g. listen to the rain falling on leaves (there are 6 different ambient sounds to listen to besides the very nice music). You can also enable features like breath modulation - with or without visual indicator. Or why not enable mantras; e.g. positive thinking or self-confidence building (6 to choose from and there is also a ""subliminal"" option for this - which I did not use since, though most mantras were good, some were just hilarious or a bit too narcissistic for me to have subliminally bouncing around my head lol).

												Bejeweled is just a puzzle game, besides being a puzzle game it holds it value in each and every way. Now that I have downtalked the genre for you puzzle haters out there it is time to build up on what is considered an iconic series that has earned its place up with the greats like tetris. Bejeweled is a highly appreciated puzzle game because of the simplicity of its core mechanic, swapping gems. I can already hear you think "" yeah tell me someting i didnt know"". Well it has inspired many clones to be created if that doesn't show potential I don't know what will. But enough over the cheap and expensive rip offs, this game is a great puzzle game, the variations in game modes can be considered completely new games that really show the beauty of the core mechanic, the way the objectives are set allow you ""the player"" to think in strategically different ways, from a relaxed slow paced to super tense  -OH NO- moments. Although I myself am a fan of the puzzle league series it is hard for me to adapt my oh so spoiled  keen eye which had to reconstruct the complete scene in seconds to finding combo's and such in this one move per turn game. If Puzzle league is and RTS I consider this game the TBS opposite of it.			"

												 This is the only game my mom plays on the computer. Sadly, I'm the one that got her hooked on it. It's a game that you play ""casually"" when you tell yourself that you've only got five or 10 minutes to spend on a game......pffft....right. Mark my words, all of the exploding gems, the spinning wild card cubes, and the pace of this game will have you blowing up jewels of all kind for hours. You will not like yourself for it. You will feel dirty, dirty, dirty. But damn is it ever fun...			"

												Great casual game. Not only do you have regular ""classic"" play, there is an assortment of surprisingly creative modes, such as Butterflies and Poker, that get you to think in different ways. Zen mode may be the best stress-relieving game I've ever seen. Plus, there's full support for touchscreens if you happen to have one. If I had to give a criticism, I'd nitpick that the resolution settings are odd; you have only three settings, and they're all different aspect ratios as well as sizes. Definitely pick it up if you're not afraid to let all your [WHE] XXA55BL4ST3RXX420YOLOXX friends know you enjoy playing Bejeweled.			"

												Bejeweled is a naturally derived CNS (central nervous system) stimulant extracted and refined from the Coca plant grown primarily in the Andean region of South America. Bejeweled is typically a white-ish powder with a bitter, numbing taste. It is most often insufflated (snorted), though it can also be injected and used orally. While powder Bejeweled can be smoked to some effect (despite common belief otherwise), it is a very inefficient method of ingestion. Because of the high temperatures present when smoking, powder Bejeweled tends to burn rather than vaporizing. For this reason, freebase Bejeweled, also known as crack, is created from powder Bejeweled for smoking. Freebase Bejeweled vaporizes at smoking temperatures providing more effect with less material, as well as faster onset and a more intense high than powder Bejeweled.It's a dangerous drug. Nicknames include rock, work, hard, iron, cavvy, base, or just crack. It's said to be the most addictive form of Bejeweled there is. It offers a short (but intense high).			"

												This game is a puzzle game type where you must match 3 or 4 or even 5 gems together to blow them up.Game is specified by ""special game combinations"" where you connect 3 gems of a kind they will just blow up. When you connect 4 gems together game will create a ""fire"" gem that blow up all gems around after you use this ""fire"" gem in another 3-4-5 gem combination. You can also combine 5 gems in ""L"" style ... after that game creates an ""row-line"" destroying gem. Which destroys all gems in row and line. You can also combine 5 gems of a kind in one row ... than system creates a ""cube"" gem which can ""destroy"" all gems on field of the same kind (only red, only green, ...).There is also a lot of game styles of the same game ... like ""dont get stuck"", ""beat the time"", ""time trial"", ""endless mode"", ""frozen"" and many more.+ game type+ a lot of different game styles++ gem combinations combos (4/5L/5 row)+++ addicting- game typeGraphics: 3/10Level detail: 2/10Sounds/Music: 3/10Mechanics: 5/10Idea: 7/10Addicting: 9/10Story : 0/10----------------------Verdict: 6/10 (6/10 for addicting)			"

												The worst thing you could do is write this game off as a Bejeweled 2 rehash. Yes, they've incorporated all the features that have made Bejeweled our go-to puzzler this past decade, but it's the new modes, mini-games and strategy that will keep you coming back. It's like PopCap went out of their way to top themselves and make sure that we never fully pay attention to anything ever again.			"

Bejeweled is an easy-to-play game where you simply try to match 3 or more gems of the same color, and this version comes chock full of new game modes, atmospheric music, achievements and unlockables. While it currently comes with a higher price tag than the other versions, it's without a doubt the one to buy if you're new to the franchise, and even those who already own a Bejeweled game may still want to consider getting this game for the abundance of new game modes and other additions.

												This is alot better then Bejeweled on Facebook. This game has it all when it comes to matching up the gems to clear a stage. The sounds are awesome and make it fun to find matches. The gameplay is intriguing with its achievements to be earned. The leaderboards make it an awesome challenge to beat your friends with. The music is fun and doesn't get annoying after long playing. There are so many different modes and challenges in this game that it keeps you coming back for more. There is a relaxation mode were you just endlessly complete the Bejeweled to your hearts content which can be relaxing to play. This game has it all and is great for those people that just want a casual fun game that keeps you coming back. This is perfect for the office or if you just need to get your mind off things for awhile. I have greatly enjoyed this game and if you have ever enjoyed Bejeweled in the past then this is definitely one not to pass up when given the chance. I loved it and I know you will too!			"

												This is the 'de facto' version of bejeweled games to have as it contains a dozen of intuitive game modes centered around the bejeweled look and feel and the modes are generally so well done that you won't use that much time playing the 'classic' bejeweled. Zen mode exists also for kids who like to try their luck with their first games without the harsh difficulty that exists in the classic versionI don't like bejeweled games much. but this one has enough of stuff to do and variety that it will be staying around. There is always someone around the house who will want to play it sooner or later. And it keeps the crappy malware infested bejeweled look-alike games away from your pc as there is now no need to search for something better.			"

The game is very simple mach three or more of the same collor of jewel, and you get points.There is 8 diffrent gamemodes, and you have to unlock 4 of them, by playing the remening 4. The game modes are sometimes very difrent from eachother, and therefore you could say the game has a lot of variation. You can play classic mode where you just keep maching jewels, you can play a mining game where you mach jewels to dig down, you can play a freze game where you have to mach jewels to let the ice stay down and many more challenges and gamemodes.I highly rekomend this game, only becouse of how simple and fun it is, thumps up. 6 out of 10			"

												Diamonds are forever,They are all I need to please me,They can stimulate and tease me,They won't leave in the night,I've no fear that they might desert me.Diamonds are forever,Hold one up and then caress it,Touch it, stroke it and undress it,I can see ev'ry part,Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me.I don't need love,For what good will love do me?Diamonds never lie to me,For when love's gone,They'll lustre on.Diamonds are forever,Sparkling round my little finger.

												After the whole ""Candy Crush"" craze, I remembered that I used to play Bejeweled years ago. Hoping that it would still live up to the nostalgia, I picked it up and I still love the game. The new game modes are awesome (despite the fact that I suck at the poker one). I've spent hours on the Gold Mine mode, and I still want to play more. Easily worth the money.			"

												Its Bejeweled! What more can you want. Hours of fun that will make you forget you were going to be a responsible adult and get things done. To top it off its ""narrated"" by 90's icon himself The Kool-Aid Man!!! Now you know where he went. Kids got too cool for kool-aid. But you are never too cool for Bejeweled. Oh Yeaaah!			"

												I'm not going to lie, I got this game, but the only person who plays it is my mom. She doesn't even have to speak English to understand what's going on and what's the objective. It's simple and entertaining, and when the time comes for her to get a new laptop, this will be the first game I reinstall for her.Visually, it's stunning, too.10/10 would recommend.			"

												Considered to be one of the more challenging puzzle games ever created; Bejeweled 3 always leaves you guessing as to what action to take next. Not to be confused with similarly titled game, 'Bejewed 3', in which you must rotate rabbis to clear them from the screen. Known as the 'thinking man's' puzzle game, actions are complex and require a great deal of thought to put all the pieces (proverbally) together. The controls can also be bewildering for newcomers.

												This is the 'de facto' version of bejeweled games to have as it contains a dozen of intuitive game modes centered around the bejeweled look and feel and the modes are generally so well done that you won't use that much time playing the 'classic' bejeweled. Zen mode exists also for kids who like to try their luck with their first games without the harsh difficulty that exists in the classic versionI don't like bejeweled games much. but this one has enough of stuff to do and variety that it will be staying around. There is always someone around the house who will want to play it sooner or later. And it keeps the crappy malware infested bejeweled look-alike games away from your pc as there is now no need to search for something better.			"

												A fun little game to play when you are boredI have put many hours into this game, and still I can`t fell where all that time went, this game is a time robber, belive me when I tell you that. The game is very simple mach three or more of the same collor of jewel, and you get points.There is 8 diffrent gamemodes, and you have to unlock 4 of them, by playing the remening 4. The game modes are sometimes very difrent from eachother, and therefore you could say the game has a lot of variation. You can play classic mode where you just keep maching jewels, you can play a mining game where you mach jewels to dig down, you can play a freze game where you have to mach jewels to let the ice stay down and many more challenges and gamemodes.I highly rekomend this game, only becouse of how simple and fun it is, thumps up. 6 out of 10			"

Diamond Mine is sooo addicting!), badges to be earned, and a new type of gem, the star gem.  If you liked the first two Bejeweled games, then you'll probably dig this one as well.

												What else can I say? I started to love Bejeweled already back on my PalmOne Tungsten and was delighted when it first showed up on the PC platform. Now it is widely spread over a wast amount of platforms. Do you like games like CandyCrush?Well this is where it all started, everything else are just rip-offs :)Bejeweled 3 has all that fast phase matching against the clock or the more relaxing never ending Zen mode. It is a very addictive puzzle game that will keep you busy for hours...			"

I was, and still am, flabbergasted at how PopCap Games created this amazing narrative that made me laugh, made me cry, and had me sitting on the edge of my seat all throughout.  If you're looking for a casual puzzle game, a heartwarming tale of self discovery, or something to do while watching Netflix at 2 A.M., then Bejeweled 3 is the game for you.			"

												I have played this for entire life, not constantly, but surely.It's a beautifully-made game. and yet very simple and addictive. You have to line up 3 same gems in a row / column to get scores. And as of this third installment, there're new game modes, such as Butterflies, Gold Mining,... and such.I got it for $2.5 during a sale. Bejeweled 1, 2 and Twist are also on Steam, but to be fair, 3 (this one) is enough.Downsides? No, there's none, in my opinion. And of course it's an excellent stress assassin.			"

												A lot of people have knocked on casual gaming in recent times, but this game is definitely one that should be experienced.It's a serene experience. The music sets the mood of the game perfectly, Zen mode is really tranquil (I've used it a few times, recommend it with headphones!), and even though it's a match 3 game, there are a lot of really fun modes on it. Mineral, Quest, and Lightning were my favorites.The only complaint I'd have isn't even a complaint. I just wish Popcap decided to make all the different challenges from Quest into unlockable game modes instead of just a select couple.That said, it's absolutely worth checking out if you can shell down the $5 (or sometimes as low as $1.25!), or if you want a nice collection of Popcap games, there's a bundle on Amazon!

												Whether you've played with Bejeweled Blitz online or played the actual game on an actual console, you should try it. It had already taken me at least 2 months to unlock all the elite badges and some platinums.This is not the same game you played on Facebook. Also, now that you mentioned it, I wanted to get this game to play with on my 3DS, but it broke.			"

												I play a lot of games while I'm watching youtube or netflix or listening to a podcast, and this is the perfect pairing for that. I often get bored while ""just"" watching a video, so this gives me something to do. Bejeweled 3 really hits the spot. There are so many different game modes, so you can play this for hours without getting bored (well, as long as you aren't JUST playing Bejeweled). Match 3 isn't a particularly compelling game genre for me, but it has a solid niche place in my library for this specific purpose.As a stand-alone game: 6/10As a pleasant diversion for the side of my brain that isn't actively involved in watching the youtubes: 10/10			"

												This game is sad, A horrific tale of how you destroy the friendships of the colored gems living in this mystic realm. All I can ask is....Why? Why Mr. Announcer guy why?Are you happy that I ruined the lives of these innocent gems? Hearing their screams of agony while a random value of points float out, making them merge together to form cancerous growths known as hypercubes, flame gems, and star/supernova gems? ARE YOU? The way you comment on the genocide of these gems while new ones fall from the sky and suffer the same fate. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, I'll find you. And when I do, There will be hell to pay. tl;dr ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you best casual puzzle game ever that has like 5000000 clones.			"

												I am sure the Bejeweled series requires no introduction. This is a very good fifth (yes, FIFTH - let's not forget Bejeweled Twist and Blitz) visit to the franchise. A massive eight game modes, all unique in their own right (except Zen, which while it has its own unique ideas, is essentially an endless classic game). For those who have played Bejeweled Blitz, the ability to make moves while jewels are dropping is a welcome (?) return, giving it a faster paced feel.Most of the game modes are pretty much brand new, and I highly recommend buying this. $20? Popcap could sell this for $30 and I'm sure it would still be worth the money for returning fans and new fans alike.			"

												Bejeweled 3 is a fun match 3 game. You might have heard of the series and genre before, so let's skip the basics and go straight to the modes:CLASSICClassic is the most basic mode in the game. Swap gems, match gems, earn points, gain levels, repeat. This process continues until you enter a stalemate (i.e. no possible moves), in which case a booming voice will remind you that you have ""no more moves"", and the game ends.ZENZen is the easiest mode in the game. It's the exact same as classic mode, except the gems enter the board in such a way that there is always at least one possible move for you. The mode was developed with the help of scientists to help players relax.LIGHTNINGThe most popular mode in the game, Lightning is the classic ""don't let the timer stop"" mode, with a twist. A gem with a number on it has a chance of appearing whenever you destroy other gems. If you manage to match that gem, it will be added to a literal 'time capsule', where once the timer reaches zero, the time in the capsule is released, the score multiplier rises, and the game continues for as long as the time that was in the capsule. Repeat this process until when the timer reaches 0 but there is no time in the capsule, in which case the game will end. It's a simple mode with a long explanation.QUESTQuest is a mode which has almost 40 minigames to challenge you to. You start with only 8 minigames unlocked, but once you complete at least 4 of them, another set of 8 minigames will be unlocked, and then once you complete 4 of those, you unlock the third set, and so on. There are 5 sets of minigames, so it isn't that repetitive. Fun fact: this is the only mode in the game with a backstory behind it, but it isn't mentioned in the game.The next modes are secret modes, so unless you've unlocked them all, avoid this section.POKERIn Poker, the board becomes the ultimate poker table as the game becomes more about chance than skill or speed. You're given a hand of 5 blank poker cards. As you make matches, these cards show decals of the gem color matched. The game becomes something out of the movie Inception as now you have to match matches, and better matches give more points. Once all 5 cards have decals on them, the colors are checked, you get your points, and the cards are discarded. There's also skulls in this mode, which I won't bother to explain, but in short, if you get a skull, flip a coin. If heads, keep playing, and if tails, the game ends.ICE STORMIn this mode, columns of ice rise up from the bottom of the board. They won't cover the board, but if they hit the top of the board... something rises on the column, and when that hits the top, the board freezes and it's game over. Your task is to stop the columns from hitting the top of the board by making matches over the columns, but if you've been playing for 7 minutes, a column will race up to the top of the board, ending the game instantly.BUTTERFLIESIn Butterflies, colored butterflies will rise up one space every move. Your task is to prevent these butterflies from reaching the top of the board by matching them with gems their color. It's basically Ice Storm, except the columns move at the speed of you.DIAMOND MINEIn Diamond Mine, the board is a driller, and you drill by destroying the ground to the point where the ground is under the line. The mode has an unconventional way of scoring. Instead of gaining points by destroying gems, you gain points by digging up buried treasure, like gold nuggets, diamonds, and mysterious relics possibly related to Quest mode.This game is really awesome, but it's kinda repetitive, so I give it a 9/10 for being the best match 3 game ever developed.

												This is how you create a match 3 puzzle game.First off, the aesthetics are astounding. The graphics are incredible and the attention to detail is fantastic. Powered up gems flicker and give off light, and the stage transition looks and runs incredibly well even on my terrible Intel Integrated Graphics Card (which chokes on such intensive games such as They Bleed Pixels and Claydunn X2). The music sounds like something out of an RPG or strategy game. The game greets you every time you start it.The basic game mode is straight up match 3 at its purest. No needless microtransactions, no extra powerups to earn, no items to bring down to the bottom, no need to break every single square of the game board. What really makes ther game shine, is the other unique game modes. Poker mode makes it so every match turns into a card. Lightning mode is similar to Bejeweled Blitz. Quest mode has you playing through various unique challenges. The board does not start out with matches. You can also never run out of moves in any mode except in Classic mode. None of these modes really feel too unfair, frustrating, or tedious.The only issues I have with the game is that the Zen Mode is kind of tacked on (because all gamers need random motivational quotes to show up on screen while having on an effect that appearently causes nausea!). The other issue is that the entire game is mostly luck based. Though, that's really a problem with the genre itself.This game is absolutely worth $10. I will never play Candy Crush again.			"

												I feel like I've finished this game (quest mode 100 percent, everything unlocked, etc) and yet I have yet to reach half of my achievements... Seems a bit harsh to me. A game should know when it's done. Other than that, my main issue is that I played Heroes of Hellas before that, and because it's more recent, it's more exciting in every respect. Still, props to the Bejeweled team for starting it all... Wait... Really? No, that was Shariki. So... Props for popularizing it, I guess. But they could certainly use some of the dozen millions they made with it to release a new version with more inventive gameplay, couldn't they..?			"

												I loved this game while I still could play it. However, a very annoying bug appears for a lot of people saying that they cannot enable the 1920x1080 resolution mode, as well as they cannot enable 3D rendering. This, coupled with the fact that whenever I start my game, the bottom half of the game gets the hall-of-mirrors effect, kinda ruins the fun of it. Rest in piece, my sweet prince.			"

												Another solid installment in the classic series. Bejeweled 3 builds on the formula with a polished engine that allows for more varied gameplay, and also presents a wide range of game modes. From the fast-paced timed Lightning, Ice Storm, and Treasure Hunt modes, to the strategic Classic, Butterfly, and Poker modes, to the varied Quest mode, and the relaxed never-lose Zen mode, there's something for to satisfy every type of casual puzzle gamer. Take this over Candy Crush Saga any day.			"

This one may be the answer.Also, the music is polished very well. Lightening and Diamond Mine really makes feel excited, while the rest could make you feel really relax.If you're looking for a relaxing time-killer, or you're just a match 3 fan, this would be your best choice.

There are a few game modes that add extra stuff, or keep it basic.Also the game tries to add combos/sounds/powers which honestly just make it more complicated. Whole fun of bejeweled imo is the simple appearing nature which holds strategy at heart.Basically like normal bejeweled but has some extra stuff that can get annoying at times.I reccomend no, but it's a hit or miss imo, worth a shot but if you can't get into it, dont bother and keep trying.

Bejeweled 3 is a great game as well as distinctly PopCapian - bright colors, pretty 2D graphics, nice sound effects, and of course an awesome OST. For five bucks this one is well worth your money.

												If you're a Bejeweled beginner, here's how it works. Different-colored jewels fill an eight-by-eight board. To wipe them away, you create groups of at least three gems by swapping one gem with one located directly beside, above, or below it. This causes those gems to disappear and the ones above to drop down, allowing for new jewels to appear at the top. Matching four or more gems together creates a special gem that will explode and remove surrounding jewels when it is matched; the more jewels matched, the more powerful the explosion. Matching like-colored gems in a T- or L-shaped pattern creates a Box gem that will zap away all gems of a particular color.			"

												3 out of 10 Bejeweled 3 is a puzzle game where the aim is to match 3 or more like gems.  Some levels require you to perform specific tasks. B3 is similar to Candy Crush and many others although they are mostly for Android. The good: 1. Unlike its main competitors this is not a pay to win game.  You pay once and that gives you access to all content.  However, the competitors are free to play. 2. Some of the quests are interesting.  I liked the poker game and the one where you save butterflies. The bad: 3. Most levels are quite dull and uninteresting.  Others are quite irritating, especially when you go against the clock. 4. Not a bright, colorful or visually exciting as its competitors. The ugly: 5. WTF is with the voice straight out of Mortal Kombat?			"

Steamy, smoking hot jem on jem action in this latest installment of Bejewed. The colour pattern is so artistic you'll feel that it was designed by a French man smoking a cigarete with one hand, and designing the game with the other. The simplistic game style is so easy to pick up, that even your 4 year old nephew... Yeah, that one... Could play this game and have fun with it. CONS!  The game lead me on to believe it would be like huniepop 2.0, but it severly dissapointed both me and my‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•by the disturbing lackage of anime tities.

												This game suffers from the ever frustrating trope of false difficulty. At the time of writing this, I am working on quest mode, and had been working on one particular gold mine level. I had been working on trying to complete this level for well over 4 hours of continuous play, and I STILL have not been able to finish this level. Every time I get up to 7-9 gold pieces, with 45 seconds-1 minute of the minute and a half it gives you, the game traps me in the upper corners of the board with no wat out for ALL of the remaining time, This has happened to me several times in other game modes as well, where I only need one or two more whatevers to finish the level, only to get screwed over for the remainder of time/turns. It's frustrating, it's not fun, and to top it all off, the freaking game forced me into a loss on the ENDLESS game. The game mode that's not supposed to end. Go figure. Screw you bejeweled. But if you enjoy this sort of thing, by all means, buy it.			"

												If you want to relax and kick back and play a non-stressful game, here it is. But you have to play either classic, zen, or poker because quest and lightning mode are just frustrating. But then even classic mode sucks because it ends based on if you have any matches or not. So since running out of matches can be out of your control, its random BS. Butterfly mode is the same way: you have to match a specific gem or a spider eats it. Seems like a lot of this game is based around luck and chance. I would say pass and go with another Popcap game, Plants vs Zombies, if you don't want to be infused with anxiety and agitation by this game. Certain modes might make you rage out and punch through a wall. But if you found hookers and cocaine on the other side, it would be worth breaking your fist over. The game has AWESOME sound and music. 6/10			"

												Bejeweled is legit. Don't let anyone tell you it isn't. 3 is mostly the same thing but it is still fun. Zen mode has a lot of different options to fool around with which is cool cause it is the mode I usually play in. There are a lot of different modes to try out - the normal four with four more you can unlock. Music is nice and backgrounds are well detailed as well. I do wish there were more backgrounds but I might just be greedy at this point.Basically I am Bejeweled Trash.			"

												I am very suprised of this game. I never played games like this before. Simply idea, but lots of modes. Simply gameplay, but very catchy. One idea of gameplay is enhanced many ways in this game. There are various elements so game dont loose attraction. Dont believe to who says this game is only for kids and girls. Graphics style is quite childlike, but this game is interesting anyway. Some modes are relaxing, but other ones need thinkink and a bit of strategy feeling. I am a 32 year old man and play mostly 1st person shooters, RPG, racing or strategy games, but I also enjoy this game and i can really recommend it			"

												The Bejeweled desktop icon is a familiar one that I've found myself doubleclicking on from time to time for years now.  It could never be considered one of my favorite games, as my sessions with it are sometimes forgettable.  With this said, forgettable experiences that help me focus on jewels while my stress melts away is sometimes just what the doctor, if he was a gamer, might order.  I'm not quite too embarrassed to admit that many of these gaming sessions have lasted far longer into the early morning than I figured they would/should.  Take this review as you will.  If you can find Bejeweled 3 on sale, I'd recommend it as a good addition to round out anyone's collection.			"

												Bejeweled 3 is a match 3 styled arcade puzzle game. I got it in a Humble Bundle and played a bit just to see what this game is all about. The gameplay was simple and had a wide variety of game modes to choose from. Paired with the music it was a very relaxing game.Pros:- Lots of game modes- Very clean and easy to use interface- Lots of unlockables and trophiesCons:- It's a phone game brought to the PC. I know bejeweled had more of a PC presence in the past but it just feels dated.I've never really been a fan of this type of game so if I didn't get it for essentially free then I'd never have played it.Game Score: 4/10			"

												I'll be honest, I have never played this game!  My wife on the other hand....It seems like a fun game, although, I wouldnt actually know because since installing it I havent been able to pry my wife away from the computer.  It's like a scene from a David Cronenberg film, where she is slowly becoming fused with the mouse and keyboard.  I'm half expecting to come home from work today and find her with large twinkling jewels for eyes.I remember when we first met.  Those were the days.  I would be playing games and she would be reading a book, something with queens in and stuff, occasionally glancing over and offering words of encouragement.  Ah yes, how I miss those days.I suppose it's my own fault for introducing her to it.  I only have myself to blame.So, given my new found predicament, I have given this home-wrecker of a game the thumbs down of disapproval.  Husbands be warned, dont let your wives play this unless you plan to lose them.Curse you Bejeweled 3.  I hate your sparkly guts!!!			"

												An enjoyable ""classic"" game with some nice updated features.Lots of different styles and challenges in the various game modes, and it is nice to receive badges and achievements from reaching different milestones in the game.The best part that the classic didn't feature was the ease of starting and stopping in the middle of a game. Without any effort on your part, you can simply close out and when ready have the same game ready and waiting for you to jump back into. This even applies to the various modes, so you could easily swap between several play mode styles if you choose.			"

												It's hard for me not to love any Bejeweled game, even before I start to play them, and Bejeweled 3 definitely didn't let me down there. Though I'm more acquainted with playing on it on a phone or tablet, the transition was rather smooth and enjoyable.I've always enjoyed puzzle-style games, and Bejeweled has to be one of my favorites. I didn't think they could top 2, but they really outdid themselves here. There are 7 modes of this game, plus the extra ""quest"" mode that incorporates more challenging versions of all 7 modes, as well as a few extra for added fun. With unlimited replay, and no two levels the same, it's hard not to waste hours playing this game in one go. Most of the modes/challenges will be familiar to anyone already familiar with Bejeweled game--the lightning blitz, butterflies, the mines, and even the more recent poker. There's also a few that were new to me, such as Ice Storm, a quick-paced game where your goal is to knock down the ice columns by making matches before the ice rises to the top and freezes the whole board.In my opinion, the price is more than worth the game.

												Bejeweled 3 is the Portal of its niche.  And I use that for two reasons:(1)  Like Portal, it takes one schtick - 'match 3' - and finds every possible combination on that to generate minigames and sidequests.  The base mode is mindless fun, while the various other modes run all the way from peaceful zen gaming to time-limited, intensive searching.  Almost every aspect of this game shows that someone at Popcap decided to stop, test, and thnk, making it a smooth, polished experience.  (Polished gemstones...  heh.)(2)  Like Portal, the voice acting is annoying.Heartily reccomended.			"

It's always been one of the better games, and Bejeweled 3 does a sequel justice. It's got 6 (not rubbish) modes and one series of 40 ""do this thing to win"" mini-challenges. For a fairly cheap price, I do recommend it.If you're looking for a casual puzzle game, that is.			"

												Story:  Bejeweled 3 and its amazing story. Ok thats a lie there really is no story. Nothing behind the scenes its just a simple game that is a clone and has been cloned.Appearance: On steam the the screen is vibrant and much easier on the eyes than playing on a mobile. Everything flows smooth and nothing really odd about it. However if you have ever played this on another system you know exactly what you are in for with few if any new bells or whistles.Game play: Gameplay is standard connect three or more of the same color. You switch two ajacent pieces in an attempt to create a link of three or more. The higher the chain the more unusual behavior will be noted. For example if you manage a five straight line you get a special cube. When switched with another cube it destroys all of the color. Music is nice and controls are mouse based.Achievements: The game does include achievements which are all pretty standard. The goal is to create or destroy X amount of a certain blocks. The other half of the achievements include gaining a high enough score in a certain game play. All will be easily attained and as far as I know none are glitched.Bottom Line: I have logged a good amount of time in this game both in steam and in other mediums. The game is easy to pickup and fun to kill an hour or two at a time. I recommend not paying more than a few dollars for this or perhaps as part of a bundle as I did. The game is fun but its not amazing.			"

												The best one of all!  Ya know when a game goes through multiple renditions, (Game, Game 2. Game 3....) and then it reaches it's pinnicle, (i.e. SSX 3) and then it has lots of further versions that are weak versions of that last great game. Pale versions of that amazing title? (Game: The quest for more money..) Well this is THE Peak!  Bejeweld reached this and was AMAZING!  Then they came out with lots of newer titles, (i.e. Bejeweld live, etc) and with few exceptions.. (Bejeweld Twist) they all paled to this or were dumbed down versions of what you find in this.. Unless they redesign it again with amazing content, if your looking for a Gem swapping game, this is worth the money! It certainly gets this succubus' kiss of approval! ^.~			"

												Bejeweled is a classic puzzle game at this point - you've probably played it or at least heard of it.  If you're not sure if you'll like the gameplay try it out online.If you DO like Bejeweled, you'll like the Steam version of Bejeweled 3.  I haven't played the latest version available free online; however, this current version has a lot of really nice features that flesh out the game and make it worth having.For one, the graphical transitions have seriously been kicked up a notch.  In between levels you enter some kind of crazy wormhole thing and watch the gems fly onto the new board.  The audio is also very high quality, with a booming voice that lets you know when you've made an awesome play along with really high-quality ambient noises and music.Speaking of Ambient Noises and Music, Bejeweled 3 contains a Zen Mode (aka Endless) that includes a lot of options and settings utilized as metitation aides.  Breath modulation (breathe in / breathe out, set the speed) with a visual indicator, adjustable ambient sounds (waterfall, crickets, etc.), adjustable mantras that pop up on-screen while you play (subliminal mantras also available), and even binaural beats which are basically low level sound waves that blast into your head while you wear headphones.  There are several selectable options along with explanations on how they're supposed to make you feel / help you meditate along with a big health warning saying basically, ""If you start hallucinating you should probably stop with the Binaural Beats.""  I tried them for awhile and I felt like it was working, my eyes started glossing over while I played.  YMMV.  Reminded me of the random noises at the end of certain Tool songs.In addition to the above mode you've got your Classic gameplay, Poker (match gems to make the best hand), Butterfly (capture certain ""gems""), Lightning, Ice Storm (earn points to keep playing), Quest (complete missions), and Diamond Mine (dig down).Once again, I recommend Bejeweled 3 if you like Bejeweled.  It's well worth grabbing this steam version.			"

												Bejeweled 3 is a very addictive puzzle game. Perhaps as addictive as classic puzzle games like Tetris. The gameplay is very simple and yet it's very fun to play. Bejeweled 3's music really brings you in a kind of trance wherein you forget everything around you. If you already have Bejeweled 2 and/or Puzzle Quest, then Bejeweled 3 is definitely the puzzle game for you!			"

												After playing the newer imitations (Candy Crush Saga, Jewel Mania, any Match 3 game on King...) I find that Bejeweled 3 is still the highest quality game of its kind.  It has many different modes which are all interesting and fun in their own way.  Also, you only have to pay once to play as much as you want!  (Note that in Bejewled combining a Special (4 match or T match) gem and a Multi (5 match) doesn't result in every gem of that color turning into Special.)			"

												I've been playing Bejeweled ever since it's first incarnation.  The simple mechanics of matching the gems is a very engaging experience that works on many levels.  In this version they have expanded vastly by plugging the basic premise into different game modes.  I spend most of my time in classic mode, which too has seen several improvements.  Whether for just a few minutes as a time killer, or for a full gaming session of an hour or two this game still works to keep me occupied.			"

A great distraction with an injection of fun. So many different modes to keep you interested, digging for treatsure, lightning and ice storms as well as a little poker to keep you interested.

												Bejeweled generally ranks just below Tetris in terms of good casual puzzle games, and it's not hard to see why. It's always been one of the better games, and Bejeweled 3 does a sequel justice. It's got 6 (not rubbish) modes and one series of 40 ""do this thing to win"" mini-challenges. For a fairly cheap price, I do recommend it.If you're looking for a casual puzzle game, that is.			"

												I feel bejeweled by this fun puzzle game that presents challenge and pretty graphics.  Bright lights and flashing colors always tend to gain my primative attention.  There are various modes to choose from and achievements to attain.  It's a great way to wake up when used as a whetstone to sharpen one's mind in the early morning.  At the same time, it's simple enough for even the most weary of minds to play.  I recommend Bejeweled 3 to everyone, from your son to your nieces, your baby cousin, heck even great-grand pep can play!			"

												The puzzle game that has men's girlfriends and wives taking over their PC's, Bejewled is something of a gem (intended pun).No, Bejeweled isn't an in-depth game, and no, there isn't any story development, or any characters or plot at all for that matter.  It is strictly a puzzle game, with nothing more than timed modes, zen modes, and some ""quest"" modes with puzzle mini-games to advance in levels.  The game is a simple chain-3 game, just like its predecessors.It's fun, it's pretty cheap, and surprisingly enough, the visuals are really great.I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys these kinds of puzzle games and is looking to burn through some time easily.

Easy to understand, different game modes to mix things up a bit, decent enough graphics, and it's relatively cheap, too.My only real complaint is the audio levels. Even when I have the audio set pretty low, it still feels really loud in my ears. I ended up just lowering the programs volume in the Volume Mixer, but yeah.

												Definitely one of the better puzzle game. It has bright and beautiful graphics, and is a nice and relaxing match three puzzle game. It has catchy music and sound effects. My favorite part was unlocking Butterflies by playing Zen. I think it's worth the price of the game just for Butterflies.			"

												It's amazing how polished and how much fun such a simple game can be.Many people (who may call themselves ""hardcore gamers"") smile at Bejeweled, but I'm saying don't knock it until you've tried it.It's one of those games that you're never done with and never uninstall or you keep reinstalling it.It has a bunch of game modes and the ingame achievements are actually hard to get, instead of requiring you to grind.Seriously, try it.

												I've been playing this game on and off for several years now (only recently bought Steam version) and that's mostly because of Lightning mode. I used to perform really bad under time pressure and playing Lightning is the perfect cure to that. If you want to train your multitasking skills, mouse accuracy and ability to perform under time pressure, there's no better game I've found yet that does that. Definitely worth the price.			"

												When Candy Crush Saga sued The Banner Saga for name infringment and wanted them to change their name, cause The Candy Saga wanted to copy right words like, The. Candy. Crush. Saga.However, Bewjewled which is like the source that these ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Facebook games stole its ideas from. Did not sue, so Bejweled 3 is the good guy in this story. Delete Candy Crush Saga from your life and be a good person, support a game that is not infused with satanic devil powers like Candy Crush, as it is a well known fact that it is evil and that it can give you diabetus and rotten teeth. Bejewled however is like balm for your soul, the music will soothe and relax you. Also, you dont have to pay to overcome challenges, you just have to use your head. Play Bejewled now to help the war effort against dumb games thats messing up the gaming industry and Steam. Im doing my part, are you? Join the war now. Would you like to know more?

I was upset that I couldn't beat my friend's score (just over 300K) in classic mode, so I kept playing until I scored 1.3 million to make sure he would never beat me (take that, Mikasa).

It has beautiful graphics and charming music. Lots of interesting different game modes. I love running it in a window and playing it in between other games.			"

												Not sure why im bothering with this at all really. Its bejewled one of the most famous in its simplicity and solidly designed gameplay puzzle games ever, but still might as well offer my two cents: Its fine.Like stated the gameplay is solid in its addicitveness and simplicity to pick up and play again from time to time, even though nothing that original or truly anything that incredibly memeorable allthough it feels like it knows that. Its just a fun game to play with a alright soundtrack to accompany it very relaxing at times though and simple visuals to go along with it to make a alright puzzle game. Again why did i bother with this?6/10			"

With beautiful background visuals, 4 bonus game modes and many badges to unlock, this game will have you hooked. In Zen mode you can even turn on some interesting features that are pretty sweet. Definitely check it out.‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ			"

												Bejeweled is awesome because the most important controller in Bejeweled isn't your mouse. Or anything involving your hand for that matter. It's your eyes. You look in the right place, gems get swapped, your brain is happy, and you are on top of the world. Look anywhere else, and it will be a place of frustration, rage, and misery, rudely awakening you back to the safety of the real world. This is fun.			"

												I've played the ""lite"" version on Pogo, and I've played various clones on Android, and I finally decided to spring for the PC version on Steam. I'm a fan of PopCap from way back, so it wasn't too hard of a decision. I can already see that this is going onto my list of ""chill out games"", along with Triple Town and Mahjong Towers Eternity. It can be challenging or relaxing (or both), whichever you're in the mood for. So simple, yet so addictive.			"

												The puzzle game that has men's girlfriends and wives taking over their PC's, Bejewled is something of a gem (intended pun).No, Bejeweled isn't an in-depth game, and no, there isn't any story development, or any characters or plot at all for that matter.  It is strictly a puzzle game, with nothing more than timed modes, zen modes, and some ""quest"" modes with puzzle mini-games to advance in levels.  The game is a simple chain-3 game, just like its predecessors.It's fun, it's pretty cheap, and surprisingly enough, the visuals are really great.I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys these kinds of puzzle games and is looking to burn through some time easily.

A few are tough to get, but persistence is key.  Also, if you play it for a few hours before bed, your dreams will freak you the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out...  Butterflies and ice columns everywhere...

												When Candy Crush Saga sued The Banner Saga for name infringment and wanted them to change their name, cause The Candy Saga wanted to copy right words like, The. Candy. Crush. Saga.However, Bewjewled which is like the source that these ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Facebook games stole its ideas from. Did not sue, so Bejweled 3 is the good guy in this story. Delete Candy Crush Saga from your life and be a good person, support a game that is not infused with satanic devil powers like Candy Crush, as it is a well known fact that it is evil and that it can give you diabetus and rotten teeth. Bejewled however is like balm for your soul, the music will soothe and relax you. Also, you dont have to pay to overcome challenges, you just have to use your head. Play Bejewled now to help the war effort against dumb games thats messing up the gaming industry and Steam. Im doing my part, are you? Join the war now. Would you like to know more? Then play the game fool.			"

												Addictive puzzler.When I first loaded up Bejeweled 3 I was thinking to myself ""Here we go again, another puzzle game"". Incredibly, such game had me hooked for 1.5 hours straight and still manages to intice me to play some some more.Gameplay is reminiscent of other puzzle games with a few twists in store. The aim of bejeweled is to match 3 of the same shapes together horizontally or vertically. You do this by swapping two shapes through clicking on one shape and then the other one. Each match removes the row of shapes, earns points and allows other shapes above to drop down. You can improve your score by doing combos (which is matching one shape, causing other shapes to match as well). Should you match a group of 4 or more shapes, the shapes will become charged up. When charged up shapes are matched with the same shapes, they explode, destroying shapes in a area around it and earing extra points.  When you are struggling to find a match, you can click on the 'Hint' button which indicates a shape you can move to form a match. There are various game modes such as a casual (no timer or set objectives), challenges (must meet objectives to pass), endless mode etc.Extra game modes can be unlocked by meeting a set score in previous game modes. With plenty of game modes to play, unlock as well as achievements to gain, there is plenty of replayability available.Music instills a feeling of serenity. Calm music is played, which is great for calming yourself when solving puzzles. Sound effects for matches and explosions are good as well. The announcer who basically shouts comments based on how well you play (number of combos), reminds me of the announcer from Mortal Combat (which is a plus).Graphics are colourful. The 2D graphics are vibrant and eye catching.As with many puzzle games there is no story, which isn't necessary anyway.If you want to play a puzzle game that will have you hooked, you will not be dissapointed with Bejeweled 3.

Then once you've finished all the quests, you have all the badges to try and win.Runs fast and smoothly, crystal clear sound and music, which you have the option to turn up/down/on/off.Interestingly, there is a Zen mode with options to have the sound adjust and messages display to help you focus and relax.

												Good for both blowing off steam during downtime and trying to challenge yourself. I love the different modes available. They have the Zen mode! AND Zen mode allows you to change the music to relaxing noises like various nature ambiances. You can even use binaural (sp?) beats, provided that you have headphones. I haven't tried that yet.I'm not a fan of the timed challenges, so I'm glad that they are balanced out by move limitations. Butterflies is a nice touch. Relaxing with a cute feel. Having a quest line was interesting, and provided variety. Poker is kinda fun.Originally got it as a WildTangent demo, but didn't want to deal with the whole WildCoin stuff. My laptop forced me into Windows 8. Since it links with my Live account, I figured I'd spend the $5 there, but was disappointed to find out that it was only the partial game. Civ 5 forced me into Steam. One thing led to another, and I caught this at the beginning of a sale. Definitely happy to have the full game back.			"

Want frantic-pased action? Try Lightning or Ice Storm. Got time? Handle Classic. Want a touch of strategy? Go for Poker, Diamond Mine or Butterflies.And if you simply want to relax without the looming threat of No More Moves, there's always Zen. But if you want a grab bag of interesting puzzles, there's also the Quest mode.Something for everyone, even if it's just for yourself.			"

However, I won't say it's a good game.If you like to play causal games, and if you REALLY, REALLY do, then this is for you.There are plenty of different modes to play, but it didn't impressed me a lot.But still, this game maintains its original.I recommend it, but not highly.7/10			"

												Not much to say here‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs Bejeweled. Popcap has made Bejeweled one of the staple puzzle games over the years and one can easily see why. The gameplay is very accessible to all players. The game features bright and easy to read visuals as usual with a simple and easy to navigate menu that moves smoothly from screen to screen. There‚Äôs a few different modes to keep you preoccupied, four that you start with and another four that you can unlock easily. I‚Äôm usually not a fan of modes outside of classic in games, but they‚Äôre surprising fun and well done here, especially poke mode. All in all if you‚Äôre a puzzle fan, you probably already heard of or played bejeweled or one of its many inspired predecessor in some form, so I don‚Äôt really need to tell you much as not much has changed, much changes are small and the core gameplay is the same. However if you‚Äôre new to puzzle games, looking for something casual to pass time or even introducing someone to gaming, Bejeweled 3 is a great place to start.  "

												Simply put: this is the game I wish all the other Bejeweled games could have been.Gem SwappingOverall, the gem-swapping engine has been tweaked (or overhauled, I don't know), and it's obvious some serious thought was put into ironing out all the minor frustrations I've had with it. You can swap any gem at almost any time except when they're actively falling down the board. This means you can swap a gem into a falling column of other gems, make swaps while board animations are happening, and in a few other surprising places. It feels very polished (no pun intended).Game ModesPretty much every mode from the first and second games are in there, plus a mode called Lightning that's very much like Bejeweled Blitz (though improved also, with no annoying Facebook tie-in), and a couple other non-timed modes that are seriously challenging and fun.The new non-timed modes include Poker, in which you create ""hands"" of cards by strategically matching gems. Butterflies has insect-gems that swap themselves upward on the board each time the player moves, and the game's over if the spider at the top catches any.Diamond Mine uses gem swaps to dig through dirt in search of treasure; clearing out enough dirt adds a bit of time to the countdown. Ice Storm features rising columns of ice behind the board that is shattered by swapping gems over them; if any columns freeze, the game is over.GraphicsThe graphics this time around are built for HD resolutions, and it makes a surprising difference. Going all the way up to 1080p the art lines were sharp and not distorted. Previous games were limited to specific 4:3 resolutions.The hardware-accelerated effects seem more balanced this time around. In Bejeweled 2, the lighting from the special gems would become so intense you couldn't tell what color any gem around it was anymore. This led to me disabling hardware acceleration entirely, which was a shame since it looked so good otherwise. It's on by default in Bejeweled 3, and the only time I've had difficulty is during other effects from different game modes, which is a huge improvement.It runs at a really smooth framerate on my laptop, but I'm on an Alienware 17 with a decent mobile graphics card. The game drops frames on Butterflies mode when there's a lot going on at once, but is otherwise great. On my wife's laptop (a Sony VAIO from 2010) it's a little less smooth, but still fully playable.OverallI'll be playing this game over other Bejeweled versions from now on. It's got some high replayability due to the various badges. Most have multiple levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) so they're actually fun to try for.			"

												Good for both blowing off steam during downtime and trying to challenge yourself. I love the different modes available. They have the Zen mode! AND Zen mode allows you to change the music to relaxing noises like various nature ambiances. You can even use binaural (sp?) beats, provided that you have headphones. I haven't tried that yet.I'm not a fan of the timed challenges, so I'm glad that they are balanced out by move limitations. Butterflies is a nice touch. Relaxing with a cute feel. Having a quest line was interesting, and provided variety. Poker is kinda fun.Originally got it as a WildTangent demo, but didn't want to deal with the whole WildCoin stuff. My laptop forced me into Windows 8. Since it links with my Live account, I figured I'd spend the $5 there, but was disappointed to find out that it was only the partial game. Civ 5 forced me into Steam. One thing led to another, and I caught this at the beginning of a sale. Definitely happy to have the full game back.			"

												Story:  Bejeweled 3 and its amazing story. Ok thats a lie there really is no story. Nothing behind the scenes its just a simple game that is a clone and has been cloned.Appearance: On steam the the screen is vibrant and much easier on the eyes than playing on a mobile. Everything flows smooth and nothing really odd about it. However if you have ever played this on another system you know exactly what you are in for with few if any new bells or whistles.Game play: Gameplay is standard connect three or more of the same color. You switch two ajacent pieces in an attempt to create a link of three or more. The higher the chain the more unusual behavior will be noted. For example if you manage a five straight line you get a special cube. When switched with another cube it destroys all of the color. Music is nice and controls are mouse based.Achievements: The game does include achievements which are all pretty standard. The goal is to create or destroy X amount of a certain blocks. The other half of the achievements include gaining a high enough score in a certain game play. All will be easily attained and as far as I know none are glitched.Bottom Line: I have logged a good amount of time in this game both in steam and in other mediums. The game is easy to pickup and fun to kill an hour or two at a time. I recommend not paying more than a few dollars for this or perhaps as part of a bundle as I did. The game is fun but its not amazing.			"

												Match-3 is about as basic as games get. Seriously, it's the first type of game most people are tasked with creating in game design school. So you've got to make an exceptional match-3 in order to deserve any praise for the task. The two most praised names in match-3 are Puzzle Quest, renowned for turning match-3 into a remarkably fun RPG, and Bejeweled.The original Bejeweled was far more basic than Puzzle Quest, featuring a basic match-3 until you have no more matches gametype, and a time attack mode. These persisted into Bejeweled 2, which got a little creative on us, adding in a puzzle mode, some secret extra modes to spice things up, and special gems for matching 4 or 5 gems at once. Still not as unique as Puzzle Quest, but getting there.So what sets Bejeweled 3 apart?Two things, really. Game modes, which have evolved immensely from the previous two installments, and presentation. The game plays so smoothly. Matching feels great. Explosions feel great. The sound effects and vocal work both sound great. Everything is easy to figure out and menus are not a pain to navigate. B3 is even pleasant to look at.As for the game modes, the match until you can't match anymore (Classic) and time attack (Lightning) return once again. Endless mode returns from Bejeweled 2 in the form of ""Zen Mode"", which is basically the same exact thing as Endless Mode (no end to the game, play as long and as poorly as you please), only with the addition of a set of gimmicky zen features (such as sound and visuals to help control your breathing, and relaxing background noise of the nature variety). Puzzle Mode is gone, and now replaced with a much cooler Quest Mode. In this mode, you are given five set of eight different missions to complete, which can range from quick snippets of one of the game's hidden modes with set goals, to special gametypes unique to this mode, involving things like uncovering artifacts in sand, balancing the number of red and blue gems matched, and turning the entire playfield gold.I mentioned hidden modes, and yes those are back. Only this time, they're much easier to unlock than in Bejeweled 2, because I guess PopCap realized that keeping people playing longer through added functionality might work better than expecting them to play nearly 300 levels of Endless Mode in order to unlock the basic time attack mode, but with altered scoring.The hidden modes of B3 are much better than B2's offerings, as well. Poker Mode is unlocked through Classic Mode, and kind of... well okay, Poker sort of sucks, really. It would be nicer with a larger board or a gem drop algorithm that's slightly more in your favor. In this mode, you try to complete poker hands by making five matches in a row. As you go, skulls will appear over the next-lowest non-skulled hand in the hand info box to the side. You can clear these skulls off by getting enough points, but if you match a hand with a skull over it, a coin flip determines whether you keep playing or game over. And this is what I'm talking about. It really seems as though they added the coin flip in in lieu of making the game a little more playable. It's fun, but sometimes you just don't get enough good gem drops to make decents hands, for several hands in a row.Butterflies Mode is much more fun, and is unlocked by playing Zen Mode for only a little while. In Butterflies, butterfly gems float up the board one space every time you make a move. If they reach the top and stay there for too long, the board freezes and you lose, but you can clear them by matching them with other gems. Ice Storm has you fighting off continuously rising pillars of ice by matching gems in their columns. Horizontal matches don't lower the pillars much, but can hit multiple at once, whereas vertical matches will only hit one pillar, but will drop it to the bottom of the screen. Special gems have varying results.Diamond Mine is my favorite mode to play. In this one, you have block of dirt on the bottom of the screen, and must clear them by making matches next to them or hitting them with special gems. Clearing all rows above a certain line drops the line down further and adds precious seconds to the timer. As you dig, you'll collect gold and ancient artifacts which will add to your score.Also, there are star gems now. Created for making a horizontal and vertical match with one gem, these take out the entire row AND column that they occupy when matched.The leaderboards are interesting, and took me a little while to figure out. I initially thought they had glitched up. Turns out, your top score is saved as your Steam display name, and all lower scores are saved under your in-game name. None of my friends have played this yet, but I'm willing to assume that only your top score is displayed on your friends' boards, but your own extra scores are there for you to personally see and improve upon.My biggest complaint is simply an issue that comes with the match-3 territory, and that's that sometimes you'll lose for just no good reason at all. This ties into my complaint with Poker Mode. The issue is that sometimes you'll desperately need a thing that just won't drop, or you need to make a match on the opposite side of the board, but the gems seem to only want to fall in a pattern which keeps you on the wrong side and oh look time's up. I would rage if I cared more.If you want match-3 with an adventure and a story, Puzzle Quest is the way to go. If you just want to match gems and maybe do it in some unique and fun ways, then Bejeweled 3 is the best way to do so that I have personally found.			"

												Very useful to fill in empty gaps during days, or if you don't feel like playing anything else. All the different modes give you different options of playing the game, but it all still revolves around the match-3 mechanic that made the original Bejeweled so addictive in the first place. Want frantic-pased action? Try Lightning or Ice Storm. Got time? Handle Classic. Want a touch of strategy? Go for Poker, Diamond Mine or Butterflies.And if you simply want to relax without the looming threat of No More Moves, there's always Zen. But if you want a grab bag of interesting puzzles, there's also the Quest mode.Something for everyone, even if it's just for yourself.			"

												I know this doesn't sound like a positive thing, but this game can reliably put me to sleep almost every time. When I need to wind down, a level or two on Zen mode usually hits the spot. I thoroughly played all the other modes, too. I think I had one game that lasted seven hours. It's simple, but soothing, and doesn't make you dream about it like Tetris eventually will.			"

												It's amazing how polished and how much fun such a simple game can be.Many people (who may call themselves ""hardcore gamers"") smile at Bejeweled, but I'm saying don't knock it until you've tried it.It's one of those games that you're never done with and never uninstall or you keep reinstalling it.It has a bunch of game modes and the ingame achievements are actually hard to get, instead of requiring you to grind.Seriously, try it.

												The puzzle game that has men's girlfriends and wives taking over their PC's, Bejewled is something of a gem (intended pun).No, Bejeweled isn't an in-depth game, and no, there isn't any story development, or any characters or plot at all for that matter.  It is strictly a puzzle game, with nothing more than timed modes, zen modes, and some ""quest"" modes with puzzle mini-games to advance in levels.  The game is a simple chain-3 game, just like its predecessors.It's fun, it's pretty cheap, and surprisingly enough, the visuals are really great.I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys these kinds of puzzle games and is looking to burn through some time easily.

												It's hard for me not to love any Bejeweled game, even before I start to play them, and Bejeweled 3 definitely didn't let me down there. Though I'm more acquainted with playing on it on a phone or tablet, the transition was rather smooth and enjoyable.I've always enjoyed puzzle-style games, and Bejeweled has to be one of my favorites. I didn't think they could top 2, but they really outdid themselves here. There are 7 modes of this game, plus the extra ""quest"" mode that incorporates more challenging versions of all 7 modes, as well as a few extra for added fun. With unlimited replay, and no two levels the same, it's hard not to waste hours playing this game in one go. Most of the modes/challenges will be familiar to anyone already familiar with Bejeweled game--the lightning blitz, butterflies, the mines, and even the more recent poker. There's also a few that were new to me, such as Ice Storm, a quick-paced game where your goal is to knock down the ice columns by making matches before the ice rises to the top and freezes the whole board.In my opinion, the price is more than worth the game.

												The Bejeweled series of games has always been immensely satisfying as a casual game experience and with the improvements made on this latest entry you'll pretty much not need to purchase any of the earlier titles.  B3 looks great with full HD graphics and glittering candy-like jewels and some friendly fantasy art backgrounds.  The music is comforting and the gameplay modes can switch from puzzles to frantic action to (literally) zen relaxation.  The real hook beyond the extremely easy to grasp game mechanics is the sense of reward as the game moves on.  It's very easy to stack up big winning combos and there's a huge amount of satisfaction in pulling off the 4 and 5 in-a-row matches and the amount of fireworks you can set off as a result is gives a big smile inducing shot of addiction.Bejeweled 3 is just plain simple addicting fun.

												Not much to say here‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs Bejeweled. Popcap has made Bejeweled one of the staple puzzle games over the years and one can easily see why. The gameplay is very accessible to all players. The game features bright and easy to read visuals as usual with a simple and easy to navigate menu that moves smoothly from screen to screen. There‚Äôs a few different modes to keep you preoccupied, four that you start with and another four that you can unlock easily. I‚Äôm usually not a fan of modes outside of classic in games, but they‚Äôre surprising fun and well done here, especially poke mode. All in all if you‚Äôre a puzzle fan, you probably already heard of or played bejeweled or one of its many inspired predecessor in some form, so I don‚Äôt really need to tell you much as not much has changed, much changes are small and the core gameplay is the same. However if you‚Äôre new to puzzle games, looking for something casual to pass time or even introducing someone to gaming, Bejeweled 3 is a great place to start.  "

												The best one of all!  Ya know when a game goes through multiple renditions, (Game, Game 2. Game 3....) and then it reaches it's pinnicle, (i.e. SSX 3) and then it has lots of further versions that are weak versions of that last great game. Pale versions of that amazing title? (Game: The quest for more money..) Well this is THE Peak!  Bejeweld reached this and was AMAZING!  Then they came out with lots of newer titles, (i.e. Bejeweld live, etc) and with few exceptions.. (Bejeweld Twist) they all paled to this or were dumbed down versions of what you find in this.. Unless they redesign it again with amazing content, if your looking for a Gem swapping game, this is worth the money! It certainly gets this succubus' kiss of approval! ^.~			"

												Bejeweled generally ranks just below Tetris in terms of good casual puzzle games, and it's not hard to see why. It's always been one of the better games, and Bejeweled 3 does a sequel justice. It's got 6 (not rubbish) modes and one series of 40 ""do this thing to win"" mini-challenges. For a fairly cheap price, I do recommend it.If you're looking for a casual puzzle game, that is.			"

There are various modes to choose from and achievements to attain.  It's a great way to wake up when used as a whetstone to sharpen one's mind in the early morning.  At the same time, it's simple enough for even the most weary of minds to play.  I recommend Bejeweled 3 to everyone, from your son to your nieces, your baby cousin, heck even great-grand pep can play!			"

While I'm waiting for a game of mine to finish installing, I play this game of Bejeweled to pass time. If you want to find a calm way to game, this is good. If you're downloading a different game and playing Bejeweled at the same time, your download speed will not be affected. If you love original games, then get this game and the other Bejeweled games.			"

With excellent aesthetics, intuitive design, and a variety of game modes; I've whiled away quite a few hours on this title. I find the ""Mine"" game mode particularly engrossing. If you want to just blow off some steam and relax, this game will get you what you need. It has some minor selection issues, but nothing that seriously impedes gameplay. I recommend this game.			"

												So what makes Bejeweled Bejeweled? If you've ever played their games, you know there's nothing more satisfying than matching chains of gems and watching them explode dazzingly. Now, you get to have three times the explosion in Bejeweled 3!In the third sequel of Bejeweled, new game modes were added which introduces various mechanics and playstyles. They can range from adrenaline-pumping maps that require your swift reactions, to mind-bending puzzles that puts your gem-matching strategy to the test. Of course, old school bejewelers can still have fun racking up their scores in the original Classic mode. However, if you prefer something more relaxing, the Zen mode features an endless tile map coupled with soothing atmospheric soundtracks.If you're a fan of match-3 games, Bejeweled 3 is undoubtedly a great addition to your game list. If you're curious about the game and looking forward to buy it on a sale, try it out! It's always fun to watch your gem formations explode, whether if you do it with careful planning or with a relentless matching blitz.			"

Just do not expect it to be a quick, short play. You will play at least 2 hours at a time. ;-)			"

												It's amazing how polished and how much fun such a simple game can be.Many people (who may call themselves ""hardcore gamers"") smile at Bejeweled, but I'm saying don't knock it until you've tried it.It's one of those games that you're never done with and never uninstall or you keep reinstalling it.It has a bunch of game modes and the ingame achievements are actually hard to get, instead of requiring you to grind.Seriously, try it.

												This game is very addictive. Be warned. Best to play in short bursts rather than constant, otherwise you'll probably get sick of it quite quickly.This version of Bejeweled gives you not only the classic format to play, but many new varients and even a quest to complete. Then once you've finished all the quests, you have all the badges to try and win.Runs fast and smoothly, crystal clear sound and music, which you have the option to turn up/down/on/off.Interestingly, there is a Zen mode with options to have the sound adjust and messages display to help you focus and relax. Nice.			"

												Simply put: this is the game I wish all the other Bejeweled games could have been.Gem SwappingOverall, the gem-swapping engine has been tweaked (or overhauled, I don't know), and it's obvious some serious thought was put into ironing out all the minor frustrations I've had with it. You can swap any gem at almost any time except when they're actively falling down the board. This means you can swap a gem into a falling column of other gems, make swaps while board animations are happening, and in a few other surprising places. It feels very polished (no pun intended).Game ModesPretty much every mode from the first and second games are in there, plus a mode called Lightning that's very much like Bejeweled Blitz (though improved also, with no annoying Facebook tie-in), and a couple other non-timed modes that are seriously challenging and fun.The new non-timed modes include Poker, in which you create ""hands"" of cards by strategically matching gems. Butterflies has insect-gems that swap themselves upward on the board each time the player moves, and the game's over if the spider at the top catches any.Diamond Mine uses gem swaps to dig through dirt in search of treasure; clearing out enough dirt adds a bit of time to the countdown. Ice Storm features rising columns of ice behind the board that is shattered by swapping gems over them; if any columns freeze, the game is over.GraphicsThe graphics this time around are built for HD resolutions, and it makes a surprising difference. Going all the way up to 1080p the art lines were sharp and not distorted. Previous games were limited to specific 4:3 resolutions.The hardware-accelerated effects seem more balanced this time around. In Bejeweled 2, the lighting from the special gems would become so intense you couldn't tell what color any gem around it was anymore. This led to me disabling hardware acceleration entirely, which was a shame since it looked so good otherwise. It's on by default in Bejeweled 3, and the only time I've had difficulty is during other effects from different game modes, which is a huge improvement.It runs at a really smooth framerate on my laptop, but I'm on an Alienware 17 with a decent mobile graphics card. The game drops frames on Butterflies mode when there's a lot going on at once, but is otherwise great. On my wife's laptop (a Sony VAIO from 2010) it's a little less smooth, but still fully playable.OverallI'll be playing this game over other Bejeweled versions from now on. It's got some high replayability due to the various badges. Most have multiple levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) so they're actually fun to try for.			"

												Good for both blowing off steam during downtime and trying to challenge yourself. I love the different modes available. They have the Zen mode! AND Zen mode allows you to change the music to relaxing noises like various nature ambiances. You can even use binaural (sp?) beats, provided that you have headphones. I haven't tried that yet.I'm not a fan of the timed challenges, so I'm glad that they are balanced out by move limitations. Butterflies is a nice touch. Relaxing with a cute feel. Having a quest line was interesting, and provided variety. Poker is kinda fun.Originally got it as a WildTangent demo, but didn't want to deal with the whole WildCoin stuff. My laptop forced me into Windows 8. Since it links with my Live account, I figured I'd spend the $5 there, but was disappointed to find out that it was only the partial game. Civ 5 forced me into Steam. One thing led to another, and I caught this at the beginning of a sale. Definitely happy to have the full game back.			"

												While I recommend this game, there are a few things I need to mention:1) Yes, Bejeweled can be played elsewhere for cheaper/free. This does not inherently make this a bad game. Achievement support and a centralized location make it desirable to buy it, if you are so inclined. I wanted to add this game to my collection, so I bought it. (This game also goes on sale during major sales if it's too expensive for you.)2) The developer (PopCap) has a history of publishing bad ports of its own games, and most of its games' steam forums have posts asking for help. There are probably some negative reviews of this game solely because of it. The tell-tale sign of an issue is their crash reporting system. What PopCap fails to mention is that there are only a select number of resolutions that the game supports. I normally run on 1280x720 for my setup, but have to switch to 1920x1080 to launch the game, before switching back to my normal display. (Try this before messing with regedit.)For the actual review:It's not a bad game; your classic match-3 game, with several different modes. The main 4 are Classic, Endless, Lightning, and Quest, plus 4 'secret' modes. Players have a rank system, which doesn't seem to do anything, and a badge system that marks your general progress, and counts towards achievements on Steam.I would recommend this game, but more-so when it goes on sale.

												Popcap makes games that are cute and cuddly on the surface, but deep, down inide, they will swallow your soul. In a good way though. Addicting isn't a strong enough word to describe this game.			"

In addition to the classic and zen mode, they've added several action/speed oriented modes, some strategic modes, and a handful of other things in the quest. It's amazing how quickly time can fly when you're playing this...			"

												For what this is, it's actually a pretty fun game.It's the kind of game that helps when you just wanna kill some time for an hour, just zone into something relatively simple to relax for a bit, and maybe put on a podcast or whatever. Easy to understand, different game modes to mix things up a bit, decent enough graphics, and it's relatively cheap, too.My only real complaint is the audio levels. Even when I have the audio set pretty low, it still feels really loud in my ears. I ended up just lowering the programs volume in the Volume Mixer, but yeah. Aside from that, a fun and easy enough game!			"

Anyways, it has bunch of different modes and all are enjoyable. Especially the quests! Those are really entertaining. There is nothing else to say about this besides that it's really worth a try even if you're only a bit into these kind of games!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												While a few of the modes might require a large portion of luck, it doens't stop this from being a great addition to the PopCap series of games. If you had fun with the previous versions of Bejeweled, this iteration will still be familiar to you while providing some refreshing twists to the game.			"

												Bejeweled is a simple matching game. If you don't know what it is, I don't know where you've been for the past 50 years. Maybe not that long. Regardless, if you enjoy simple puzzle games, you'll probably enjoy bejeweled. Bejeweled 3 has a lot of different modes along with plenty of achievements to try to get (if you're an achievement hunter like I am). I love Bejeweled and if you want the best Bejeweled game, B3 is the right choice.			"

												this game is the ""5 minute per one day"" game for me. and now you can see my play time. and that play time will be increased by about 2 times more because of play times in my Origin account. sometimes I spent all holyday to play Bejeweled 3. and that was the best vacance in my whole life probably. Today we can encounter a lots of 3-match games in here Steam or any of the free games. but the real thing is,""the Simple is the Best"", I think.			"

												Bejeweled 3 is a complex and interesting puzzle game, with wonderful graphics and great extras modes (like the Zen mode). It also has interesting features like the wavelengths that are meant to increase mental acuteness, or make you drowsy or other effects. I highly recommend it for puzzle lovers.			"

												For hours of mindless, fast-paced, heart-wrenching gameplay switching gems back and forth and experiencing the complete satisfaction when the sound of a complete set plays through your headphones and penetrating your membranes (blast that, man!) it is like pure BLISS. And you do it over and over and over... and 50 years later you find yourself at a psych ward with tubes in your body because you never ate or drank the whole time and a few more tubes in which .. well..  you can picture the rest of that lovely future yourself. CHOOSE THIS GAME NOW!!			"

												One of the best match 3 games. If you want a challenge, it's there. If you want to relax, the Zen mode is great. Very awesome game to just check out mentally, relax, and match. I've loved Bejeweled since the first one. I have a lot more game time than this, but I guess I used to play a non-Steam version, I don't know. Great game though, definitely worth 5 dolla.			"

												I love this game!  I bought the app for both my phones.  On one I'm  over 677,200,000!  Yes you read that right, MILLION.  And I'm still going. Now if I can only get the one I bought for my computer to work.  Fatal error.  Been sending error reports.  Very excited to play, (hint, hint support).			"
