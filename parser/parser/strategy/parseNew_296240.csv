												Very well made game, highly addicting. I couldn't stop playing until i was done with it :)Cons:- couldn't really play in window mode, because it would crash for me (only one crash in Fullscreen)- well, not really 24+ hours of gameplay. It took me 10 hours to play through and unlock all (ingame) achievements. the only thing i didn't do was complete all Pirate-levels with 5 Stars (because i'm not a big fan of Angry Bird-mechanics)Pros:- although the game crashed a couple of times, no progress was lost- 10 hours of simple fun (totally worth the money, even at full price)- 12 levels of an Angry Bird style Pirate game - addicting unlock system, where you want to procede into higher tiers and unlock more buildings- it starts of very simple and gets alot more complex as you have to handle alot more wares and workers, but it never felt overwhelming- time challenges (optional) where you have to do certain tasks or get a fixed amount of wares (reward is a small bonus and it counts towards an achievement, but you can take all the time you want to finish)What do you have to do in this game?It's all about handling your settlers. There are five different Professions which they will specialise in, depending on what you let them do more often. They will ofcourse work faster when they do a job which they are specialised in (but don't worry you can relearn them later on in the game).On top of that they have 3 Statusbars which will decrease over time and might slow down their workflow alot. There is- Hunger (will decrease over time while they work) - Companionship (will decrease depending if they like their job, are ok with it, or dislike it; to raise it they will interrupt their work and talk to another settler for a while)- Health (some jobs are marked as risky and they will cost life over time; they won't die but need to heal up from time to time at the hospital - which needs herbs, so just like with food you have to watch out that you have enough of it)The buildings are in fixed locations so you have to manage how many workers you declare per building or you need to drag and drop your settlers to fasten up their production rate.You also have to trade your wares for Gold so you can afford more Settlers and upgrades for your buildings.So if you like to build-up, manage economy / workflow and trade - this game is absolutely for you.

												I bought this game with low expectations, but it was cheap, so I took a gamble.  I was most put off by the poor English in store page and such, considering it seems to be a quasi-fantasy game roughly about the English settlement of North America.I was pleasantly surprised.  I started playing it, and I did not stop for 7 hours.  Even now, I only stopped playing because I started falling asleep in my chair.It's a slow-paced, easy-going town-builder in which you grow your ""colony"" from a single building and a few colonists into a bustling village, complete with trade, jobs, building upgrades, and scientific research.  I really appreciated that it never makes you feel anxious about staying on top of things, like the Anno series can sometimes do.  You totally set the pace in this game, so if you're looking for a relaxing play, this could be for you.I was surprised by the quality of the game.  While a few things are a bit off--like the way the colonists perform the exact same animation at the exact same time when they talk to one another--the game shows a lot of polish, overall.  I never felt like my enjoyment of the game was being damaged in any way by a lack of effort or expertise on the part of the game's designers and/or developers.It's a bit like a slimmed down and streamlined Sims meets Farmville meets Anno, without any stressful situations, pushy monetization, or excessive micromanagement.  Overall, I would recommend this game to fans of its genre, though I would not really know what to call it.			"

												TBH - I've picked up that game on Summer sale, quite cheap, thinking - dropped cards (yes, I'm a collector, guilty as charged ;) ) will pay for that anyway even if that is crap. But what do you know - while getting those drops I've actually started playing - and got so hooked it's not even funny!That game stands next to Artist Colony, My Tribe, Gemini Lost, Wandering Willows (well, sort of), and Virtual Villagers (sans starving and otherwise meeting their demise villagers). If you ever played any of that - you will feel right at home from the very start. And yes - I've played all of those (and more).Pluses: really nice appealing art, easy to learn, easy to master, there's no sensitive controls or time limits that you have to meet to progress further in game...Minuses: if you are looking for high-octane action - that game is not for you. If you don't like resource management - that game is not for you. If you don't have patience for micromanaging and otherwise keeping track and ordering around 50 ""loyal subjects"" - you probably will not like it much (but I might be wrong).Now if only they add Steam achievements to that... ;PP.S. It took me 15 hrs to beat from start to finish - no skipping puzzles, no guides or tutorials, but not getting high scores in mini-game either. As for replay value - idk, not much challenge here for me... but still might get back to it some day.			"

												7.5/10+ cude presentation, good animations, good music+ it's a city building/management game and although it is advertised as casual, it presents deeper gameplay mechanics than what you would expect, the balance is good, lots of resources to find and collect, upgrades to do to your buildings and ship, lab tech with new technologies etc. everything is done better in other games of the genre, but they are done just fine here as well+ an interesting mini-game ala angry birds, where you have to fight pirates that may attack your ship or settlement+ some emphasis on your villagers needs ala sims games is welcome and refreshing- low resolution, at least doesnt support 1080p- campaign is continuous and linear, one goal after another in a specific map, so no replayability- no zoom in and out, one zoom level, it would help if there were a zoom out option to manage things easierin conclusion , a casual management game that is done right in almost every aspect and is fun to play			"

												I'm an old-school gamer and I don't like too simple games. This is time management game and I shouldn't like it. But I do. Why? It's not so simple game. Yes, you can't die. There is no way to see ""Game Over"". But still you have to control economy of your growing town. Choose from buying another worker or upgrade one of your buildings. What will improve your economy better? You need to think about it all the time. It's quite addicting.And it ends before you will get bored.VERDICT:Worth playing if you not in the mood to play something really complicated.Like this review?

												The Promised Land is a ridiculously cute little time-management/city-builder that sucks you in and doesn't let go until you beat the game (which looks like it can be done in around 10-12 hrs). It's a really simple casual game but there's a lot going on and it's really enjoyable if you're looking for a relaxing experience that doesn't require a huge amount of concentration.The basic setup is similar to a lot of other games, gather resources, build things, make stuff, sell things, get gold, upgrade buildings, get more workers, etc. There is quite a nice variety of resources and manufactured goods, and a couple dozen buildings at least, each with its own series of upgrades.  There is also a research laboratory that allows you to study half a dozen separate advancements, and those unlock buildings and upgrades in your industries and elsewhere in your colony.The workers will specialize and become more efficient after doing a certain task for a while. I especially like that the workers themselves have preferences, and if you put them in a job they enjoy, they are more productive than if you assign them a task they dislike. I also really enjoy the way that you pick up your workers to move them to tasks, and that they totally react to you doing that. The housing has an interesting puzzle aspect to it. You can upgrade your houses to increase the number of workers you can have, but it requires manipulating rooms in a sort of jigsaw puzzle in order to maximize the number of colonists each building can hold. Finally, there is a mini-game simulating naval combat that basically is Angry Birds with cannons and pirates.			"

												I played this game for 10 hours and unlocked all in-game achievements. Great little casual game if you're looking for something easy to learn and conquer, but there is no replay value. The most important thing I learned that I wish I had known in the beginning - each job has a special color, reflected in the circle with the amount of people working that job.Blue = WorkerGreen = Farmer (includes fishing and shearing)Orange = BuilderPurple = Researcher (includes collecting treasure)Gray = ArtisanAll in all, a great little casual time waster.

												The store page boasted of 24 hour gameplay. I less than half. Seriously. I finished the game in just at 7 hours. No replay ability either. You start, you finish. No ""different Choices"" to try the next time.So your'e probably thinking, ""Totally not worth it!"".I can't agree 100%. As disappointed as I am that it was such a short game, in all fairness, it might take a casual gamer 24 hours. I hardly took any breaks, and this is not my first rodeo. But another reason I am not too upset is...I played for 7 hours straight with hardly a break...I really enjoyed myself!I was surprised to find how much of a blast I was having! I would recomend this to a casual gamer, or some one with short term memory loss. You can enjoy it as much as I did, but  again and again!			"

												The art style is cute, and the game is enjoyable for the first couple of hours. You gradually come to realize that what you thought was the tutorial is actually the entire game. There's only one map, and the game basically takes you step by step through it. You can't fail at anything, and there's no challenge. The entirety of the game you will spend simply waiting for more of a resource to collect so you can build something that will then require you to wait for more of a resource to collect. It's as if someone took the resource management part of Age of Empires and turned it into a game. The end result is there's nothing at all you can do with your resources. If there was a game speed increase, you could finish the entire game in 20 minutes. There's some lurking potential here if some mechanics for challenge were added. I kept hoping the ""game map"" was a shortened tutorial map that would later throw you into a series of more unforgiving islands. Perhaps the developers will later turn this into a full-fledged title with suitable strategy, but I cannot recommend the gameplay that's presented here.			"

												Best 'stand by' game ever.  Great for late nights when you don't need to think,  busy days when you only have a few minutes now and then or challenge yourself to a marathon weekend. I have played it many times.The game it simple yet involved and very involving.  You can run an entire community and even fight pirates.Guidelines are simple and easy to follow.  I have not noticed any glitches.  Best thing is you can set your own pace.I really want a second game in an expanded universe.  The game demands it.			"

												I think this is a fun little game. It is on rails for the most part but it's a nicely designed, fairly slow paced simulation. Graphically appealing despite the lack of video options. I also noticed near the end that the music was still uplifting and not getting old like other game's musical scores do. The sound effects are mostly charming and minimal which helps when these sounds play over and over so many times.The player has the choice to micro-manage for quicker growth, or to sit back and let things happen. Your citizens will perform their assigned tasks without maintenance. The only real choices to make are what order to spend your research or tobuild your buildings in, switching output of specific industries (switching the metal worker between gold and silver output) and specific chores for the individual citizens. Buildings are built in pre-planned spaces, and you do not choose how many of each there will be; there will be only 1 iron mine, 1 kitchen etc. However, there are 3 farm plots that unlock as the game progresses and each is relegated to specific crops.Each citizen has a preffered task and a hated task. The citizen can do any chore you want, but will stay happy if doing their favorite job and lose happiness fast if they are doing their hated job. I also feel that they skill up faster if doing something they like or are trained to do. The only combat whatsoever takes place in an Angry Bird fashion, and can be replayed as much as you wish. So you won't permanently lose any battle. It's a refreshing change of pace actually.I've played through it once and I might try it again. The single playthrough was worth the money. I don't always finish games, even the ones I like, usually because they lose me along the way. This one kept me interested until the end. I didn't feel overwhelmed, and I didn't feel the need to micro-manage to the end. I also was equally comfortable letting it run as I went to the bathroom or got a drink; event result in a pop-up that pauses the game until you click on the screen.For the price, I do recommend this game. I've paid far more for worse.			"

												If you've played The Happy Hereafter, Virtual Villagers, or Gemini Lost, you will feel right at home directing the doings of your little burgeoning colony. There are tons of resources to gather, buildings to build and upgrade, and a good variety of areas to explore. You'll gradually manage more and more colonists with varying abilities as you explore the map and make the most of all the land has to offer, as you quest for the fabled Fountain of Happiness. What surprised me most about the game is an the addition of ""pirate battles,"" which really play more like rounds of Angry Birds. There are 12 of these stages, and they are satisfying and welcome diversions. I could have easily enjoyed many, many more of these battles, but really, the bulk of the game is spent building your colony through gathering and trade.The Promised Land is a much better game that you might think it would be. Yes, it's casual fare, and it's at the top of its class.			"

												Halfway between city builder and time management game on a single (large) map, this little gem is full of details that make its world lively like a Witcher game, endearing and relaxing like a Hero of the Kingdom, amusing like a Hercules, challenging in terms of multitasking the micro-management, but never punishing. It's never too boring, either.Everything is well thought out, there are a few flaws (can't go windowed if your resolution is lower than Full HD, a single crash to desktop, and a few UI/UX issues), but you really, really can't go wrong with this one.If Eastern Europe is planning to win the Cold War with casual gaming, Alawar Entertainment is their best hope to 'recruit' us.

												This game is clicky and a time-waster. There's a mini-game, Angry Birds style, where you ""fight"" pirates. Not much going on there, the new games are few and far between. My ship was attacked by pirates once at the beginning so I was almost looking forward to that- the risk, the danger! But then later I realized how long it would take to recoup resources I was horrified at the idea.  I would *maybe* recommend it to people with young children or perhaps chronic multi-taskers who are in the process of reading a book of some kind. The play is SO unbelievably, painfully, slow. Wait wait wait until you build up enough whatevers. The people move slowly, you can't speed them  up, you can't zoom out to look at large areas. I have gotten 28 villagers and it seems like it took forever. One thing that really irritates me is that it automatically pauses when you alt+tab to try to kill time on social media or something. On top of that, random talk bubbles come up that essentially pause the game until you respond so you can't just let it go while you go make dinner or something. The prompts are constantly coming up to sell something and putting everything you have into that resource to sell larger quantities is time and resource consuming. Fishing is way too slow (even by this game's standards). I have 3 fishers and 1 cook and she constantly runs out of fish.			"

												I brought this game at 75% discount. Totally worth it, finished it in one day.While the game itself isn't complicated and needs a very little planning (you can achieve the final goal even a longer roundabout way). The gameplay is smooth, a bit slower paced at the end (maybe), it mainly depends on your building/research choices (there isn't many, the progressing is linear).I recommend this game for cute character designs, the great BGMs, some hilarious animations with sounds (e.g. male chars eating, alpaca shaving, etc), interesting elements with the gameplay (ship battles, house/room management).If you have a few bucks and love this kind of games get it, or get it at discount time for yourself/friends/children!

												A charming and gentle game. Very little about 'The Promised Land' is in any way challenging, but this doesn't detract from the enjoyment derived from it. It took me about 9 hours to complete, though this is less because the game is hard, and more because it takes time to get anywhere with it.Most puzzles are very straightforward, the pirate ship shooting mini-game is entertaining but simple, as is the housing puzzle game.The premis of the game is equally simple. You're looking for a plot device, in order to get it you must build things, get your colonists to gather resources. Trade those resources, get more resources, explore the island by dropping a colonist on an obstruction and waiting. You can build more things, research things, and pay people to join your settlement. The game is charming and gentle, an enjoyable way to pass the time, but not precisely challenging.			"

												The Promised Land is a really fun casual type of game. This game is perfect if you'd like to relax after a long day at work.There is no pressure and you can't lose so you can do everything at your own pace. If you're searching for a challenging game this is not for you, but if you're looking for a fun and calm experience i can highly recommened it. There are some quests on a time-limit though, which will give you extra resources if you do these within the time-limit. But the quest will also be completed if you don't reach your goal within the time-limit.I've completed the game in  9,5 hours.

												This game is quirky. Similar to your facebook games, but without the need to buy currency. Small map, made even smaller by the locked zoom level. Your view of your colony is very small, and you wind up spending most of your time clicking around the minimap or scrolling the viewfinder. Like most Facebook games, Promised Land becomes a waiting game the farther in you get. Whether you're waiting for research, a particular set of goods, or just the trade ship to return, you will wind up with numerous periods of nothing to do.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, however, when you're just sitting their waiting, you can't click out of the game! This is a MAJOR oversight! If you're going to make players wait on your game speed, do not force them to just watch the game itself. Clicking anywhere outside the game automatically pauses it. Also, the resolution is locked, and can only be toggled between full screen and windowed. Many people on the forums have complained about the full screen resolution, a problem I also experienced. The gameplay itself is fun, but until the other issues are fixed, I would not recommend.			"

												A pretty and pleasant game.  Unlike a lot of city building games this won't frustate you with revolts(after carefully trying to keep everyone happy)  and watching your community burn while you try to figure out what has suddenly gone wrong. It doesn't force you to brutalize and wage war against the native population.  Resources are infinite and you won't have to face plundering a land and laying waste to what drew you to it in the first place.   None of the unpleasantness of real life intrudes but this is very much what I like about it.   It is a casual game in this regard, yet it still has enough depth to keep you interested over the entirety of building the community.   I wish life could be more like this and I have been satisfied by the time I have spent with it.   If getting away from games that try to force a lot of ugliness upon you,  in the name of realism,  appeals then this game is well worth the modest price.			"

												This was an interesting worker management game. Unlike many of the others that involve simply assigning people, collecting resources, and then building, this one has some additional unique features. Most notably, the workers have job likes and dislikes, and they can become skilled in a particular type of trade, such as farmer or miner. They will level up, and become more productive, the longer they do a certain type of task. They can also be sent to school to skill up.To gain money, resources and products can be traded with the mainland via the ship. New workers are also hired from the mainland this way. Specialty items have to be purchased from the mainland. Every now and then, a certain type of item will become more in demand and be worth more. This is when you assign as many workers as possible to collect and/or manufacture to fill the demand. As the game progresses, workers, specialty items, upgrades, etc, will get more expensive, so taking advantage of the demand spike helps raise money faster.As part of the story, there are pirates to be dealt with. This is done by firing a cannonball at their ""boat"" structures. There are a limited number of balls, so they have to be aimed just right in order to cause an optimal toppling to take out multiple pirates. There are a few of these to deal with during the quest, and the final ones can get a little annoying. But, you can retry as much as needed.There isn't any way to die and resources are infinite, so it really is a casual game. As with most Alawar games, it is very aesthetically pleasing with appropriate music and sound effects. I don't think it's worth $6.99 due to the relatively short play time and no real replayability, but it's worth picking up on sale if you just want to relax and not stress about losing.---For more...

												Cute time management game -- took me about 5 hours or so to complete the game. Not much replay value. Nice idea to grab this one on sale. Definitely worth it when on sale. Wish there was an easier way to manage your colonists... clicking through them one at a time gets tedious.			"

												The Promised Land is a colony builder game sporting a huge resource management component.  Players will frequently encounter an odd-ball assortment of arcade mini-games and puzzle challenges. The sound is good.  The game is fun to play and immersive.  The graphics are particularly cute with plenty of humour lavished in some of the animations.  There are many incidental references to stereotypes which are presented in an anecdote and comedy fashion.The player recruits and trains villagers.  Villagers specialise in various gathering and manufacturing professions.  A few villagers need to be dedicated to research to unlock parts of the skill tree.This all sounds simple, but the player needs to focus on each villager to ensure their need for food and socialising is met.  Fail to keep people fed with food and satisfy their need to talk or have company and they will desert their jobs and create a knock-on effect of shortages in food and materials.  Maintaining a happy balance and keeping colonists productive will keep players busy.  Success requires balancing of individual needs with the needs of growing the colony.New buildings and professions become available as the player progresses through the game.  Upgrades to buildings and increased expertise in skills of villagers create a good sense of progression.  Villagers can learn more than one skill either via experience (Doing) or through education (Being taught).  Pay attention to the likes and dislikes of individual colonists to get the best results.Additional areas are unlocked by reaching milestones.  The Promised land succeeds in that positive action is rewarded.  The game is moderately challenging but great fun to play and creates a sense of achievement and accomplishment.  Players also need to be cautious about expanding the colony too fast (or too slow for that matter).Players are able to re-play many of the mini-games to try and improve performance scores.There should be approximately 30 to 50 hours of game play to complete the game.7.8/10			"

												EDIT Oct 16 2016: I decided to play this again and I can't keep it running for any longer than 46 seconds before it returns me to the desktop with a fatal error notice. I know I'm not the only one since I checked the forum and there's also a few negative reviews that mention it not running.I don't know what's happened to it in the 2 years since I left my initial review but it seems to be a bit broken now :( Hopefully they can fix it, but keep in mind in the meantime that it may not work for you.This game plays like it wants to be an interactive screensaver, yet I have to admit I really enjoy playing around with it.It's very nicely laid out and very simple to play, you can wander away and leave them to it and not be in danger of any catastrophe occurring.The little peeps have a nice personal touch to them which I like, they all have their own likes and dislikes. I'd like to have seen something done with the 'social' aspect like this, something that fits the tone of the game like logging a best friend for them perhaps based on who they chat to the most, but even a randomly selected one would have been nice, just to add another little personal touch to them.I like to try and make it slightly more challenging by tailoring my colony to the likes and dislikes of each inhabitant, it's not at all challenging but I try lol.This is one of those weird games that is a complete waste of time and yet you don't seem to mind at all.The negatives for me: The pirate mini game. I didn't mind it at first but the longer I play the main game, the less I feel it fits.The people are quite varied in looks and mixed with the likes and dislikes they do feel unique and then there comes a point when you're adding colonists and they start becoming clones of ones you already have and if they have the same job type then they're also wearing the same clothing, and the uniqueness they had is gone *boo hoo*. I don't know if I've just been unlucky with the random choice available via the boat, but I feel if they'd had something very simple like a mix of hair colors for each character type that feeling of uniqueness could have been maintained for much longer.

												Well, that was surprise. What I thought was a couple hours toony casual turned hardcore but entertaining grinder in no time. Wasn't expecting too much at the beginning, seemed (That's SEEMED) simple and didn't think I was gonna last long. 8+ hours later in one sitting I was barely halfway through the building process. This game is certainly worth the time and turned out to be great fun. Only problem I had was the irritating popups of do this or do that or this price has fallen or this price is ghigher let's go trade now!...would have been much better served in a message window, not a popup that halted the game. I found the seemingly continuous side challenges a bit much as well as they interfered with what I was TRYING TO GET DONE...lol Which I guess shows the game is certainly engaging when you do NOT want to be interrupted in your current plans and actions.  All in all it's a pretty nice and surprising little game. Pro-Tips..when you build houses check inside them, there is a maze picture puzzle that allows you to pretty much double the amount of citizens that house will hold. Try to keep your citizens assigned to whatever you started them as, worker, farmer...ect. If they're a woodcutter leave them doing it, artisan at the forge, don't move them. They get better and faster with each star. Likewise there's even more depth in the personality of each citizen, what they enjoy doing, what they hate..which I suppose effects their ""time to each level"" rate? Don't know, but those 2 tips helped me a lot. I look forwardto finally making the higher level goods...though I suppose it will be another 10 hour session to get there..lol.So, give it shot, not a bad game at all and NOT the toony clicker it appears at first.

												I really enjoyed how much of my life was stolen by this seemingly simple game. It made me quite grateful for having the opportunity to see the sun rise many mornings in a row, disallowing myself the chance to sleep in pusuit of pirate golds and aztec treasures, all while becoming immersed in the need to maintain the health, happiness and full tummy's of my randomly gathered colonists.I am still playing, and the aztec gold still alludes me, but i am definately nearing my final goals, i can sense it!The waypointing is great in this game, the A.I. is wonderful, and if you like to be occupied for hours at a time this game is definately for you. Alot of micro-management, and enough time in-between everything to keep planning out your necessities. The map and the expansion process are quite static, but with the way it was put together its like a little story adventure and they could make literally millions of maps for this game, and i think they should :) The save system is great, as you always just pick up where you left off without even having to click save, even after a power outage or three ..... :(Oh and there is even small splashes of a mini-game that i wont spoil for you.Altogether i really feel it is a solid title with solid programming, and i have enjoyed it thoroughly. And its a game that fits all age groups. "

												A very simple economy/city building game.  You get 'X' amount of people to do a bunch of chores, once you've collected enough resources, built the required buildings and accomplished a few tasks you get more people to get more resouces, build buildings and accomplish more tasks.  There isn't exactly a whole lot of depth to it but what is there is fun and entertaining.  Some of the people are better at one task vs another, so you have to make descisions as who to stick where to make the best use of your people.  At the same time you have to manage their hunger and happiness, both of which are accomplished easily enough, but can be a bit of a pain if you haven't been stockpiling enough.  There is a few mini-games and such thrown in to give a bit of variety as well.Not exactly the prettiest looking game, but the art was charming enough and fit the gameplay.The game isn't very long, but is enjoyable enough to warrant a recomendation.

												If you have $5, get it. The premise is very simple - point and click story/management game with some minor background about the new world. Very low learning curve and easy enough interfaces to stop even the most novice of player from getting lost. It's not deep, it's not challenging, and it's certainly not fast paced. What it is is a decent little distraction that doesn't try to be something it's not. For the price, it's completely worth the money.			"

												The Promised land feels very much like a mobile port to PC - but a very good one. The Art style is pleasant to look at, and the gameplay is easy to learn, but not excessively easy. While likely not for hardcore management or Base-Building players, The Promised Land is good for a few hours of casual gameplay at least, though I wouldn't recomend it at the full seven dollar price. Pick it up on sale if you like management or base building games and need something fresh.			"

												I would definitely recommend this little game for anyone who likes casual village/colony building games.  The game is especially perfect for someone who enjoys Facebook games involving building up settlements, as it is similar to one, without the long waiting times and the need for friends.Also contains an “Angry Birds” type mini game, and a few little puzzles.The animations are cute, and although it does not have amazing life-like graphics, they are smooth, and do not strain the eyes.The game would make an ideal gift for someone like me, used to playing Facebook games.  My only one complaint would be that you can’t run it in the background while doing other things, as it pauses itself, and like any game that’s enjoyable you wish it could go on for longer.Definitely, worth getting if you like these types of games, particularly when on sale.

												A nice casual simulation game sort of like Virtual Villagers and The Happy Hereafter. I find this game to be much better than those. You spend less time just waiting for your people to collect resources as you can deal with pirates in the meantime with Angry Birds-esque gameplay. This game also contains a bit of a puzzle component as you add rooms to houses to increase your population cap. It was fun, I rather enjoyed it and I find it well worth the price. I finished the game in ten hours, but I didn't accomplish every achievement to gold level. I agree it has pretty much no replay value, but I do intend to get more of the achievements now, as you can continue playing despite finishing the game.			"

												The Promised Land is a task-driven, casual strategy game that lets the player build a small colony from the ground up. There is no possibility of failure, no death, and no time pressure. Though not particularly challenging, it is still fun to see the colony grow. Clearly there was a lot of attention to detail from the designers. An interesting touch was that the minimap changes in portrait-like fashion as new buildings are added. Apart from the main story, there are mini-games in the form of physics puzzles where the player can use a cannon to shoot wooden structures to knock down pirates. Kids will probably enjoy this part the most.The game is a steal when under $5 dollars. One caution - the natives are depicted in a friendly, cartoonish way, but some may still find their images stereotyped and dated.			"

												I expected nothing of the game when I picked it up for around two bucks in a sale, and yet got a cute and nice city-builder that kept me playing until I was finished with it. It was very addictive in its simplicy. It is not ""Banished"" or any of the other eleborate resource management sims, and much more simplified in gameplay, yet the mechanics are the same, of course. Gain Resource, use resource to build stuff, trade with others to gain money, upgrade your buildings and gear with it etc. You start out with 5 people and the goal is to find ""the spring of happiness"" To do so, you have to build your colony up to 50 people with all buildings purchased and upgraded. Which took me around 16 hours, with all (ingame) gold achievements collected. The comic style of the graphics is rather on the simple side, but fits well to the overall tone of the game. If you like these sort of games and search for something less stressful and punishing in regard of the resource management, you can do no wrong with picking up ""The Promised Land."" Especially when it is dirt-cheap in a sale. I had fun with it, for sure.			"

												Very enjoyable casual game.   The game has a collection which is equivalent to steam achievments and you gradually build your settlement.   You have to optimizing selling things that the old colony doesn't want so that you can process vs. holding onto them for a while so that you can get colony points so that you can get more colonists.  Depending on how much attention to detail you like, you can also optimize your colonist roles but it isn't necessary in order to win.   General game play will get you gold badges in almost all categories without paying much attention to them so there's no need to micromanage. For a few bucks, well worth the cost and you'll find yourself spending the 20 or so hours to finish the game.			"

The game realistically provides 10-12 hours of game play, which is worth the small price tag. There is unfortunately no re-playability as the storyline is very structured and there’s very little scope for personalising the characters or the end outcome of the game. There is also a fun ‘angry bird’s style’ game which can be played alongside the main game.Overall: 4/5. "

												A ship filled with a few villagers arive on a new piece of land. The land looks inhabited at first, and the villagers start building a Warehouse to store there goods. Soon they start collecting rocks and wood. And not much later they even mine iron, silver and gold from the earth caves. They ceate fields and cultivating them to sustain themselves of food. Explore and examine ruins to learn about the mysteries of the people that lived here before. Eventualy they also discover a friendly Native Tribe, and they battle against pirates. Excess goods they load on the ship and sell it for a good profit in the Old World, and maybe bringing back new villager to live (and work) in the New World. ---If you like peacefull, colourfull and cartoon style graphics, and games that invole a little bit of strategy. Then this is most likely a nice game to play. It is not very long however, but it sure is pretty. Currently the price is only €0,62, rediculessly low in my opinion. This game has much to offer, and even the original price of €6,99 is fair in my opinion. Great game about putting your mini villagers to work and see them get busy on starting a whole new village.

												As someone said before, this game is very similar to virtual villagers. However, I feel as though this game is a bit lacking in comparison. It took me 10 hours to complete, but most of the time was just spent dragging the people from their workplace back to the town hall and then back to their work place because that saved so much time. It is addicting, though, and had angry birds-style mini games. Wish there had been more similar types of games within to vary it a bit. Also, towards the end I was just hoarding money because I had nothing else to buy. In general a good game. Not the best, and in my opinion (as someone who loves these games) not really worth all of the hype, but still has a lot to offer. Maybe wait for sales.			"

												I completed the game in just under 10 hours of solid game time and i must say not a second wasted. I was very entertained and loved it the entire time! This game is actually very addicting and fun with its quirky entertaining music and its simple yet detailed gameplay.i think it is a must have, you grow your colony to become amazing! i havnt put the game down since i bought it! worth picking it up if you love games like Age of Empires or anything of that genre because this is an addicting as hell! anybody can get the hang of this game with its easy tutorial right from the start.It will keep you busy for hours trying to keep your colonists happy and keeping up the production in your town! dont let the pictures on steam here fool you, very worthwhile game and has a deeper strategy element then you think. I would give it 8/10..wait, it has lamas, 10/10.			"

												I bought this game on sale and certainly got my $1.94 worth of entertainment out of it.  The strategy mechanics the game is based on suit both players who will let the game run on auto-pilot with infrequent player input and to those who want to micromanage and change orders constantly.  This game feels like it is a prequel to a future, much larger game based on the same strategy mechanics, but hopefully with expanded gameplay functions.  I do really hope these developers do make that game in the near future.  I don't think I would have been dissapointed paying full price for it, but for less than $2, I give it a 9.5/10.  I deducted a half point because I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that there is not a full size version of this game I can buy.  Best micro  game I've played in a long time.			"

												One word review: 8/10 - Lovely! ^_^Premise:You are in charge of an adorable little colony: Grow its population, expand its economy, research new technologies to succeed in your search for a legendary treasure.Gameplay::You Drag and Drop villagers to assign them to tasks which allows them to specialize in areas like Farming. Starting out simple by gathering basic resources and and trade, you soon unlock many more different resources and buildings. Various special offers and challenges require you to adapt your strategy. In addition, a few minigames offer variation.Review:If you are familiar with strategy games and simulations, you won't have any difficulties with to this one. The strongest differences to other games of this genre are its strong linearity and complete lack of frustrating elements. There is no death or failure here; the worst you can do is to make nonideal choices which will cost you time and bonuses, but still allow you to progress. If that happens, it is a little annoying that the trading information bubbles pause the game, but if you play somewhat decently, you won't have to endure any long waiting periods anyway.All in all ""The Promised Land"" is quite casual, but nonetheless rewarding: You bond with the settlers, you enjoy the cute animations, you strategize without creating spreadsheets and simply relax in a pretty environment. Although I initially wanted to write that it doesn't have any replay value, I actually catch myself revisiting this game once or twice a year. While it is too difficult to be played by children on their own, with a helpful parent at their side they can certainly enjoy this game a lot.Oh, and one piece of advice that I haven't found in the otherwise great ingame hints: The colorcoded circles around the number of people working on a task indicate which class specializes on it. For example, a blue circle on the Sugar Canes states that this a job best suited for Workers, while a green circle for the Fluffer Farm suggests that Farmers are best at Shearing.Cons:- Little Replay Value- ~ 10 hours of gameplay- Only Fullscreen, no window mode- No Zoom, though a helpful minimap- Info bubble pauses the gamePros:+ Pretty graphics and cute animations+ Pleasant music+ Villagers have basic personalities+ Nice minigames (Angry Birds style, Housing Puzzle, End Puzzle)+ Efficiency is rewarded, but progress is granted either way+ Absolutely no frustrationConclusion:Get the game, especially on Sale, and you'll happily enjoy ten hours of a mini-vacation :)			"

												This is a great game to play when you want to relax.The music is very calming and the general play style is envolved enough to keep your attention, but the management style doesnt get you micromanging to the point of stress.you can set people to do their jobs and they will do it, level up on thier own, feed, socailize and even go heal on their own or you can manage them to do it when you choose, with who, etcI enjoy playing this game when i can't get to sleep or need to relax it doesn't have much replay value but with no real fast forward controls you can just sit back, relax and watch them do their work while enjoying the chilled out music.

												A short and sweet management simulator game that was worth the sale price. Although, once again my biggest complaint would be there are no steam achievements, only ""in game"" achievements. Also of note there are steam card drops, as I recieved three of the same one. On a lighter note, I was able to sell those for a hefty price and buy other cards to complete a badge I was working on for another game! Win!			"

												*The Promised Land' is a casual city building game that works great of you just want some pet game to play for a day or two. The graphics are colourful and cartoonish, and very much reminds you of the sterotypical kids-games, but in a way that didn't bother me, at least. The colonist models are fairly diverse, and only repeated 2-3 times each among 50 colonists. The gameplay is easy enough to grasp, but has a certain pace to it that kept it interesting - despite a few instances of waiting for enough resources to tick in.The game, however, is also very liniar in the sense that your progression in the game comes from completing a number of quests. These quests do allow some level of ""free"" development through research, but ultimately limits the type of resources you can get, what buildings you can build and so on to the progress of the questline.The buildings are limited to fixed, preset locations, so the freedom to make your colony as you want is more or less non-existentThe 7,3 hours of gameplay I've had is a complete run with every challenge and in-game acheivement on the highest level.All in all I found the game enjoyable to play through, but with little to no replay value. It's probably well suited for people unfamiliar with city-building or management games as a first peak into the genre.			"

												1950s children's guide to colonialism. good white people move in next to strangely incompetent natives who have plenty of gold and silver to trade for things like wool cloth and medicinal herbs. throw in one hella greedy trader and it's basically manifest destiny told through cartoons.depictions of natives are racist as ♥♥♥♥.that being said, it's not particularly long or replayable; there's not a whole lot of strategic decision making about the direction that your colony will go--emphasizing science, for example, won't really help you do much except research your necessary skills faster. it doesn't change the outcome of the game.i played about 7 hours, completed the game, and then uninstalled it; it doesn't have any meaningful replay value for me personally. but it was inexpensive and it's a nice casual game; i enjoyed playing it--i just wish it wasn't quite so heavily stereotypical.

You will like it, if you are looking to play a low intensity city building game (well more like building a small village as the maximum population you can have is 50 people). It took me, 15 hrs to finish this game but for the price, it was a great deal.			"

												An interesting game with quite a few charming elements too it. This quirky light-hearted game caught my attention and held it for hours on end. However, in turn it really wasn't that chalenging or original at the same time, using elements very simmilar to other games of this type.

												Now this is a odd game. If you like a game that can play itself, then go for it! It's very cute (graphic, sounds, music), and it's really, really addictive (You keep getting quests, and before you're done with it, you get a new one...how can you quit!). Depending on how much you let the game play itself you have between 8-10 hours of fun, and those hours will fly by. However I can't help but think if they focused more on the game itself, and less on adding minigames that are way too easy, short and with bad mechanics then this game would be way more awesome. I had a lot of fun, but I can't see myself playing it ever again. You have no choices pretty much, where you build are set, how many you can build are set, places are closed of until you've done this and that. But really, the sound they make when you pick them up make it worh it. Cutest. sound. ever. Casual / braindead gamers only. Ps. It's impossible to not win. If you don't have food, they will find food themself.			"

												I really enjoyed this game.  I played it for hours straight each time I opened it.  It got a bit dull after a while though.  I found myself just leaving it running towards the end so I could complete it.  I couldn't finish the last achievement because I would've had to sit and wait for ages for some things to respawn.  That was partly due to my own poor planning though.Although there were some minor issues with the game (it crashed on me once - no progress lost though), all in all I quite enjoyed it.  It took me about 10 1/2 hours to complete fully other than the one achievement.  I think had I pursued that it would've taken another 1-2 hours but it would've just been sitting and waiting.  I'd say if you're a fan of casual games, this is definitely one worth buying.  It's certainly worth it for how much it costs.			"

												I reccomend this game if you're looking for something very light and can be completed within 10-12 hours.You know the cycle: Hire workers, build infrastructure, sell excess output, hire more workers, build/upgrade infrastructure, etc.  It's a formula that is perhaps best known in association with Farmville and other ""free-to-play"" titles. Since The Promised Land has no microtransactions, it never deliberately inflicts you with the pain associated with the more well known fare. Your workers take time to perform their tasks but they usually finish up by the time you've checked your other spinning plates and come back. The game also throws in a poor man's Angry Birds style mini-game to handle your naval engagements. They're not bad, per se, just bland.Pros: - Everything, including the gameplay, is totally solid and stable. - The game ends at that perfect moment where it's still enjoyable but it's started to go stale. - Excellent controls and UI. It never gets in the way.Cons: - A hint or reminder system would be welcome. Do I train someone to be a worker or a farmer before sending them to collect silk? On that note ""Worker"" could be better named. - A few more character models would've been welcome. The game's population maxes out at 50, but that 50 is composed of like 6 character models? It's like some lost Eugenics colony.I'm picking nits though. It's a fun and breezy little game.			"

												The Promised Land is a very casual little builder and farming game with charming graphics and nice sound.Gameplay is really easy to learn and involves citizen management, choosing what to research, build and what to trade.Your citizens all have things they like to do and things they hate as well as a need for social interraction or something else to make them happy, food and sometimes medicine.Except for what worker goes where, the choices you make are more or less superficial since you can't really fail and the order in which you do things sadly won't matter since the only pressure are a few timed quests and completing them on time only gives you a small coin bonus. Building locations are locked and you can only have one of each.There is almost no replay value unless you missed one of the achievements and want to go again to earn that one.The game offers a few easy to somewhat easy puzzles but except for that, there's very little challenge.It took me about 10 hours to finish while earning all the in-game (not steam) achievements and, although I did enjoy playing it I'll only give it a 2 since that's what it is, fun for an evening.1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

												This is a fun little game that can keep you distracted for a fair amount of time. It's pretty much casual, even though it's really hard to control the eagerness of always advancing to the next stage in order to see what's gonna happen. It's the sort of experience that you can feel free to try without taking the risk of suffering direct threats, as you can choose whenever you want to fight against the pirates (and even then, if you happen to lose, it won't be the end of the world). Anyway, there's not much to expect when it comes to replay value, unless you revisit this game after a very long time. In conclusion, if real life management would be as interesting as what we see on this game, working wouldn't be so stressing.			"

In fact, I thought it was a mobile port before research.The good points are that it's easy to pick up and play; you manage villagers in a fledgling colony collecting resources and expanding.The bad points are that the interface is horrible. Click, drag, click, drag, oh what, you didn't click exactly on the villager?! Too bad, you scroll the map! Time restraints on a few goals further infuriation.That said, I did last long enough to get a complete gold achievement across the board but it really tried my patience to do that.5/10.

												My Rating: 6/10I had a hard time deciding whether to click Yes or No when asked - Do you recommend this game?While The Promised Land is a cute little game and has some fun elements, it becomes quite stale after awhile. I was able to get 2 days of gameplay out of it and I feel like that was worth a couple bucks on sale. But the full price of 6.99 might be a little steep for this title. The only reason I put 2 days into this game is because I was hoping it would get better.Micromanaging your community seems a little tedious, but there are some fun minigames that mix things up a bit.- You play a minigame where you fire cannons at stationary pirates on crates and wooden planks (much like the typical slingshot/cannon games: Angry Birds, World of Goo, Crush the Castle...).- Adding rooms to a house to increase your population is a little bit of a puzzle as you determine which of the limited room pieces fit together to complete the layout of the house (but barely a minigame).I wish this game had enemies that attack the town, forcing me to make repairs and add defences. But the only enemies are the stationary pirates in the minigame that you fire cannons at (only accessible by clicking the cannon defence structure at the top of the map). There is no way to take any damage or suffer any consequences by losing the minigames and you have unlimited retry's to complete them.One thing that gets old pretty fast is the character noises. Everytime you grab characters to move them around town, they make a childish whimper - sometimes happy, sometimes sad.I have not completed the first map, but I am pretty sure it is the only map... I would like to see a snow level, water level, an evil level? Even some additional levels as DLC? (<-- can't believe I said that)Everything in the game is backed by a tutorial, meaning that the entire game is predetermined as it tells you exactly what to do next. I am not sure if it is actually possible to lose.This is where I thought it could get better. Maybe you get a new settlement in a different region where you make descisions yourself without the tutorial? Nope.The music is fair and doesn't get too old until about 6-7 hours in. But I would not buy the soundtrack if one existed.Overall, I would only recommend this game if it were at least 50% off, but only if you want something with a low challenge and you are in the mood for something cute.But for the average gamer, and with so many better choices on Steam, I can't recommend this title at full price.

												I installed the game at 10pm, just to try it out as I was in the mood for a casual city (colony) builder. I finished the game at 9am the next morning! I just couldn't stop playing. That's the best recommendation I can give it.Pros.Graphics are cute and well detailed.The music ranges from good to beautiful.The sound effects suit the style.Extremely casual and relaxing game, no stress or pressure here!Over 10 hours of gameplay for a relatively cheap price.It scratched the ""city builder"" itch.Mini-games keep things fresh.Solid mobile port with no bugs.Simple to learn and understand.Cons.If you like big strategy city building games, you might be disappointed, everything is very basic, but done well.The are no screen resolutions in the options. Windowed or full screen.There's practically no way you can lose. No challenge?I was disappointed when I completed it (I wanted more! ... or is that a pro?)Very little replayability.Overall, there's a research tree, an economy, city building, and resource management but all very simple without a lot of depth and there are mini-games. The game, however, is addictive, keeps you interested and entertained, is extremely well presented, and is value for money. As a casual city builder, it hit all the right buttons. Good job Boolat Games!			"

												I played it, I got hooked, and I finished it. To be honest it's just an incremental game you could find on the web wrapped in pretty graphics. Short play time stretched out by waiting. It was fun to see it come together, but it's not an experience you can't get from building a base in settlers, and the absolute lack of choice reduces this from a game to tedious affair.			"

												Finally finished the game. Not because I wanted to,  but just because i usually finish every game I buy. And god ! I regretted buying this one. Indeed, at first it is catchy, but it slowly becomes plainly awful. What I hated the most about this game is that it is a simulation game but isnt at the same time. Let me explain : In this game, you dont have to do anything, or actually maybe one thing every 10-15 min. Therefore, you dont have to be on the game to play it. Right ? however,  the game wont let you go on internet or do anything else because if you do so, it' ll stop the game! Therefore you have to be on the game... watching ... and thats it.Well, you might say, I can just leave the game open and go upstairs do smt else Hell no ! Because the game keeps on asking you some meaningless questions every 2 min. But how is that a problem you may ask again ? well,  if you dont answer these said questions, it stops the game #again. Conclusion :  If you wanna watch a game and do nothing for 25 hours, this game is for you . However if you happen to have a life and dont necessarily wanna hurt yourself,  dont buy itIt just aint worth the money it costs.			"

												The Promised Land is a very casual little builder and farming game with charming graphics and nice sound.Gameplay is really easy to learn and involves citizen management, choosing what to research, build and what to trade.Your citizens all have things they like to do and things they hate as well as a need for social interraction or something else to make them happy, food and sometimes medicine.Except for what worker goes where, the choices you make are more or less superficial since you can't really fail and the order in which you do things sadly won't matter since the only pressure are a few timed quests and completing them on time only gives you a small coin bonus. Building locations are locked and you can only have one of each.There is almost no replay value unless you missed one of the achievements and want to go again to earn that one.The game offers a few easy to somewhat easy puzzles but except for that, there's very little challenge.It took me about 10 hours to finish while earning all the in-game (not steam) achievements and, although I did enjoy playing it I'll only give it a 2 since that's what it is, fun for an evening.1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

												I like little city building management sims, and figured on sale this was as good as any. While I don't exactly regret it, this wasn't a very well thought out sim. You couldn't let it idle, because it would pause every time you left the game. You couldn't zoom out, which made it much more annoying to see what people were doing. It was also difficult to manage lager numbers of little villagers because they were always scurrying around, and while the game encourages micromanaging that becomes just about impossible late game. (The villager tab does help this a lot, but it's still too hard to keep track of people.) Additionally, it isn't rigorous about unlocking quests -- at one point it unlocked a timed mission for me to harvest a crop I hadn't yet unlocked, which seemed like an oversight (especially when it unlocks with a character asking for the crop because they're so impressed by the ones they've seen).

												The Promised Land is a simple city builder.  I found it to be a relaxing, easy paced game that still had some challenge to it.  It did not make my head hurt trying to beat everything, it was just an enjoyable, relaxing time filler with decent graphics.I liked that I could keep defeating the pirates until I got 5 stars (Angry Birds scenario).  I have to say that I did not consider the pirates set up a natural segway with the flow of the type of game I was playing, but it was not bad, just a different flow.  the only really negative point for me is that once you miss a timed event, you don't get a second chance to make it.  So, I received all gold awards except for completing timed events, it was silver with 13/15 done.  I had not known there were limited timed events or I would have spent more time on them.  I had assumed I would get more as the game moved on, but once you finish the challenges, there is nothing more to do, or build, or design, or create.  You can amass money, research points and all the products, but that is just sitting around watching it do its thing.  Just having the continued challenges would make the game a bit more replayable, or at least longer game play.As for the negative reviews, the only one I could agree with is that you can't zoom out (I kept trying, though!) but I got used to it.  I did get the flashy issue one time that one person compained about.  All i did was close out and restart the game and it disappeared.  Another negative review said it was fun the first time.  I agree, it was fun the first time, but it is not the kind of game you would really play a second time as there are not different strategies you can employ.I completed the game in the 20 hours listed.  I doubt I will play it again, but I bought it on sale and enjoyed the 20 hours I spent on it.  And, on sale, I would recommend it.  Put it on your wishlist and wait for the sale.			"

												If the game had the ability to speed up game-time, or if the ceaseless prompts did not pause the game, I would have no hesitation in recommending this game. It would be a charming little village builder, with almost no replayability.As it cannot speed up game-time and the prompts do pause the game, I cannot recommend this - unless the prospect of sitting in front of your PC for ten hours, doing nothing but watching numbers slowly crawl up, is something that tickles your fancy.

												Ever been stuck home with a hangover and you want to play a game, but just can't bring yourself to do it?  This is your game!  Ever try to force your way through a few dumb episodes in series you're watching and need something to do on the other half of your monitor?  Look no further!  Does grandma call you and tell you about her virtual farm?  At least change the topic with this game.This is a basic resource management game, with no way to fail or die.  You might beat this game in 7 or 8 hours if you really played with optimum efficiency.  On the other hand, were I to train my dog to touch a mouse, he'd probably beat it in his lifetime, too.  The only way to fail is in your own mind, when you realize how inefficient you've been.  It's a casual game, but I nonetheless found it strangely compelling, and even rewarding.You start the game by managing a handful of settlers on an island.  You click a villager and drag him or her on top of a food source.  Poof!  That villager now gathers food.  You do this to other villagers to gather wood and stone.  You slowly gather resources and build (a pre-located) farm.  You manage the farm the same way.  Slowly, you build up a small town.As you grow over this small island, things get a little more complex.  Each settler has a job like and dislike, as well as three basic stats - hunger, social, and injury.  But their stats don't harm them, just make them limp slowly towards a refill station.  If you can match a settler to a job s/he likes, then her/his stats will decrease at a much lower rate than someone who hate's their job.This becomes important in the later game when you might have a bunch of jobs all lined up to create an industry.  For example: one guy cuts sugar cane, the next makes sugar, and a the next drops it off at a kitchen.   Meanwhile, someone grows corn, carries it to a mill and makes flour.  Those two ingredients make a special food.  That's probably the most complex industrial structure in the game - and there is a long lead into learning it.What makes the game compelling?  First and foremost, it is cheap; often less than 2 bucks during any Steam sale.  Secondly, it is a simple game, but rewards the player with little upgrades often enough to keep the momentum.  Thridly, it is bright and colorful, and the settlers have cute little graphics, like an exaggerated 'thumbs up' they use when you help them out (via click and drag) or are placed in a happy job, among others.  And I often get connected to individual settlers unlike other games.  Ex:  I'm likely to remember that Marie likes mining and feel bad when I force her to do something she hates just to keep the colony moving.Fourthly, you can play the game windowed (on Win 10), at a low resolution.  Of course, the game is stuck in widescreen, but you should be able to play the game while having a small video screen up and running on a small part of your screen.Summary:  This is a cute, colorful, but simplistic casual game that involves (pre-planned) city-building with human and resource management.  It's very casual, with no way of death.  It's not hard at all, but it is rewarding.  It can eat away hours for a splt-screener, a grandparent, or someone like me, unemployed.   "

												This is a very casual game... like literally.... I've spent hours just staring at people do their thing, clicking every once in a while to get past a game notification. It's really slow (not in a bad way, just peaceful) and takes hours where you make tweaks here and there but mostly just watch and relax as your people build up inventory and you go for that next upgrade. Seriously, casual. You will not find a more casual game... but you can't afk cuz the pop ups pause the game until you click.Drag and drop mechanics could be better but I really don't think they put that much time into the game overall.If you want something more interactive than an aquarium screensaver while you decompress, you should try this game. Hours will go by and you won't even remember.			"

												My feelings are rather mixed about this game..  It's a game for kids, charming and cartoony but extremely slow.  It is rather short, but when I got a ways in, I was stuck between getting tired of it and wanting to finish the game.  There is no replay value at all.  I started over to see if it plays any differently.  The only difference is the settlers coming over on the boat have apparently random likes and dislikes, which calls for a bit of strategy in assigning them to jobs, taking into account that putting them on a job they dislike really destroys their efficiency.  The tasks sometimes have time limits which vary from easy to impossible to complete on time, but there is no real way to fail the tasks.  Research is so slow that choosing the wrong sequence to learn can easily cost an hour.  Tasks include upgrading the ship to carry more cargo, but it gives no real benefit since I eventually figured on selling only the requested goods, since you have to maximize the profit because the game takes forever anyway.  Bought it for less than two bucks, and I'm glad I didn't spend more, even though time was a greater cost.  I did kinda like it, but not enough to recommend.			"

												I found this game to be fun for a couple of hours, but after that it became mostly a waiting game.  You get enough workers keeping up with essentials like food and medicine, and throw everyone else head-first into the next goal.  Even then, I found myself playing games on my phone to pass the time while I waited for things to complete (tasks get annoying paused by periodic pop-ups from your advisors, so you can't just walk away).  There's no ""fast forward"" mode and no option to spend in-game money on tasks to speed them up.  Now that I've finished it, there's very little replay value.  I would only recommend this if you can pick it up on a dirt-cheap sale.  It reminds me more of a $0.99 mobile game than a $6.99 desktop game.			"

												This is a great little game, and very reminiscent of Virutal Villagers series from 10(?) years ago.  The Promised Land adds some new features like trading, and a pirates Angry Birds mini-game.  The one big change is that The Promised Land isn't a ""virtual"" game where things run even when the game isn't being played.  This aspect of Virtual Villagers caused me some major headaches and caused me to have to restart more than once.In short, it's nice to play after work if you have some time to burn.  The great thing about it is that it is truly a casual game.  Got 15 minutes?  You can play for 15 minutes and quit.  Want to play a marathon session?  Great!  Do it.  Everything will be right as it was when you turned the game off.I've played now for about 7 hours (EDIT:  I won the game at around 11 hours of playtime) and think I'm about 40% of the way through the game (judging by the buildings, upgrades, and research I've got compared to what I could have).  The one ding I have against it is that I'm starting to get to the middle of the game where you don't have a lot to do except set it to autopilot as you wait for the research points needed for a new tech, or the materials needed for the next building.But definitely worth a full price purchase of $7.  Even better if you get it on sale!			"

												I consider this to be one of the most addictive games I've ever played!A pleasant adventure with a different way of approaching genres like farming, city building, puzzle, angry birds and...Sims!It's about reaching the other side of the land by unlocking different areas and upgrading & unlocking your buildings, while keeping your workers healthy, well-fed and happy.CONS: - Industrial buildings cannot craft more than one item, so you have to change everytime the product which is being made, even if you have allocated 10 workers to that building;            - The sad workers are looking for conversation with the nearest worker instead of looking for a worker with low happiness;           - This game MUST have a bigger map (or more maps)PROS: Everything else!Conclusion: You must have this game but beware of its addictiveness!

												I bought this game during a sale AND in a bundle, so extremely cheap. Then other games got in the way and forgot about it for a while. When I eventually installed it without re-reading its description, I was expecting a typical time/resource management like the rest in the bundle.What a pleasant surprise it was to find that it was a city builder, as I love those! Granted, it's not a city but a colony, but the game has more depth than what I expected. Every inhabitant has a preferred task and a task she/he hates, and it's quite fun to concile ""personal"" preferences with the resources you need to progress. The first moments spent working in a task ""locks"" the inhabitant into that role (up until you build the school, that is) so you might want to keep that little one away from an undesired profession until he/she gains his/her first star (after that, she/he will just be bad at doing things not from her/his profession). Personally I think one Builder and 2 Scientists are enough for the entire game.There are a few timed quests, but they're extremely easy to do without re-allocating too many people. The rest you can take as much time as you need to complete. And there's the pirates mini-game (basically Angry Birds with pirates), which I didn't enjoy as much as the main game.But the main game, well... I enjoyed it so much, that as soon as I beat it I started a new game. And I'll most likely play it again in a few months. It's relaxing and fun, and for less than half a buck it was most likely the best purchase I've made in years.			"

												The game could be good, but there are 2 huge minuses:1) There is no speed up setting. The gameplay is slow and strict, so you must just wait often. Its getting boring very soon.2) The game pauses if you use Alt+Tab. So i can't increase the speed of the game and i can't to do other things while my peasants are working. The game forces me to just wait and watch. I don't think that these are the things that i like in games. Meanwhile, other things in the game are made good.I can't recommend this game because it's boring.			"

												It has you glued for a while addictively. Enjoyable flow in graphics although I seemed to attract an annoying sound loop every few minutes. Good trading and safe family fun and you can replay with a different profile if necessary. Auto saving without notification is a plus if you want to escape.Good easy puzzles here and there as you progress. I built up a lot of goods but towards the end I was hampered with the income cap  of 99,999 and could only trade on the advised goods or waste out the income, no expansion on stockpiles then, so that was a downer. Not bad for a couple of bucks though for a casual time passer.			"

Pros: Simple Game Mechanics.Soothing Background Music.Clear End Goal Objective from start.Doesn't require full attention.Can use steam overlay without the game pausing.Able to surf the web with steam overlay or do other productive things around the house.Alert sounds to tell you when the game needs your attention.Addictive.Get to watch something grow and evolve right before your eyes.Excellent money spent/gameplay ratio. Cons: Can't leave the game unattended for to long Trade merchant pauses the game to tell you about new deals and you need to click off of it to unpause the game.Can't change resolution.Can't zoom out to see the entire map.Wish the island was bigger.Would turn all the gingers into a team of scientist again / 7 "

Getting resources, making things, specialised workers getting experience levels, selling goods, making tools - it's a game that asks you to think a bit - in a relaxed no-big-deal way.  Timed quests come up, which are hard to lose and won't make much difference if you fail.It total it took me 11 hours to finish the game according to Steam, although I may have had the game on pause for 1-2 of those hours.

												It's a cute little game. It's not the regular sim city game, where you choose what to build, when and where. You get little tasks along the way, and as you progress more and more buildings open up. When you decide to build something, it already has a place in the map upfront. No other maps or other scenarios, so the major con for this is zero replayability. It's just the same. But for a small cost, this is fun and cartoonish. Mechanics for controlling the toons is easy and well made, the AI works well, and it has a tiny mini game inside similar to angry birds.If you want a casual sim builder, to relax with and pass the time, this is perfect. This is not intended for hardcore sim lovers. "

												I picked this up on sale for very little so keep that in mind. This is a pretty short game but fun for a while.Things to keep in mind when considering. * Very little replay value, but if you get it cheap that's not an issue really.* It's cute and everything is clear on screen though it would be nice to have a zoom out option.* the ship Mini-game is fun, even if it is a direct re-skin of other physics based siege games like angry birds but simplified.* Little to no real strategy, this is a very very easy game making it perfect for a new gamer or a child. Not for someone looking for a hard core Turn based Strategy or deep story. * the ending is almost non existent which is a shame but the game itself isn't setting you up to expect one.* In game achievements add to the gameplay value but it would be nice for them to be steam achievements also. * Has trading cards if that's sometihng that sways you. 3/5 stars regular game rating but considering it's a casual & kid friendly game i'll give it 4/5.Pick it up on sale / for your kid & it's well worth it.

												As with what others have said, the game does not work on Mac (or at least my Mac, OS X 10.11/2.9 GHz i5/Retina/8GB RAM), but it is a fun game for the price when on sale - just don't buy it if you don't have a Windows (or have a Mac that fits the specs exactly).However, the game itself is pretty fun (although slightly repetitive), and quirky and charming in a relatively cartoon and childish way. I recommend you get it on sale if possible, but if you are looking for a calming time-waster that you can spend 10 hours or more on, this is a possible choice.			"

It even has a mini game in it similar to Angry Birds, which can be comparatively fun if the waiting game becomes too much for you. It has practically no replay value, but it's still fun enough to play.			"

												A great game for the price.Gives you about 10 hours of awesome gameplay. After it, you have to throw it away though (or gift it).			"

												Fun lil game, very simple.  Parts get a bit tiring but over all worth it for a few hours.  Played through to end, about 8 hours, can probably do in half that if you micro manage more			"

												The Promised Land is cute and fun, despite it being incredibly slow paced. Expanding your production chains and tweaking their efficiency is rewarding and not too much hassle. I'm not sure whether I will finish this game, but I have enjoyed it so far. I'd recommend it, especially when it's on sale.			"

												I got this on sale for $0.62, which all things considered seems a fair price! This is a short, casual, very slow paced game with, as far as I can tell, no way to actually lose. It's more or less a resource management game with some simple mini game elements. I maxed out all of the in game (there are no Steam) achievements and completed the game in a bit less than 11 hours of total time playing.Is it worth full price? No. Is it fun? Moderately. On sale for $0.62 and with cards you can sell? Absolutely worth it!			"

												Game is nice, but i think you need to do all the jobs ( missions ) that have a timer on time.I didn't do all the timer jobs perfect, and now so didn't get the Fluffer Food.You need the Fluffer Food to build the Fluffer Farm.Have all buildings fully upgraded, all research done,  10k gold and can not finish the game because of that Fluffer Food item.

												From your phone to your desktop another cheap casual from the folks at Steam. Come one come all as you push your little minions around the map making them slave for your digital desires. Feed them house them give them ""social interaction (we know what THAT is) and your colony will grow to the giaganntic  size of eight. Find the treasures staring you right in you face. And don't forget kids, Cheat Engine works even on mindless fluff like this. Go get 'em.			"

												The Promised Land is a casual management game. You order your workers to gather and mine various resources, and then you use them to gradually build new things, unlock new areas of the map, and complete quests. It is vary similar to the Virtual Villagers games.The game is casual, to be sure, in that there is no real challenge or risks. But I got a lot of satisfaction from building up my city, and the game didn't require too much intense gameplay. It was a nice, relaxing game of simple pleasures. If you are looking for a management/building game where you don't have to agonize over decisions or stress out about optimizing everything, this may be a good game for you.			"

												This is a casual game.  Probably originally built on mobile and ported over. If you can get it for under $5, do it. It's fun for a few hours until you beat.			"

												The Promised Land is a nice simulation/construction game in with you have to expand your civilization until you find a secret place. The nicest thing about this game is the system of professions. You have to assign workers for their duties trying to match the abilities of the worker with the job in order to maintain the production and the happiness of everyone.Nice little game for kill some time.

												I enjoyed this game, very casual, easy mechanics, a simple version of something like rise of nations. Exactly what I was looking for. I wish there was a way to sort the workers easier, or re name them, but you get used to them.			"
