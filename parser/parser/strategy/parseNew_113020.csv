												Alone, with friends or with complete strangers, monaco is by far one of the best coop games i've ever played. If you don't mind  feeling the adrenaline pumping to your brains the first few missions you're given, you'll find that Monaco: what's yours is mine is much deeper than just heists  organized by french pixelized criminals and cheesy french lines randomly tossed by guards emailing their parents about how they finally got a good job (not) chasing you. It's about not dying; it's about cleaning a level, to see how far you can go for a bunch of lousy coins. When you finally avoided all the lasers, the guards, the dogs, the chopper; when you've asserted your domination over the rich and glorious city-state of Monaco, all you got to do now is to play the levels again and again to ultimately clean out Identity without alarming the guards once.Allez mon vieux, t'as rien a faire ici!Now with Zombies, boobytraps and Bazookas:                                                               CERVEAU!

												Monaco truly is a game for anyone and everyone. It is simple enough to pick up and immediately understand how things work, while at the same time offers the complexity to have multiple players spend a few minutes sitting still, devising a self-titled ""Best Plan Ever"" complete with tracing the plan on the screen with fingers, saying “Ready? GO!”, only to see it backfire in seconds.The easy learning curve, the variety of characters, the sprawling levels, and the lovely sound and art all combine to make an extremely appealing and replayable game. Monaco offers a new and unique kind of chaotic co-op stealth gameplay, resulting in a work of indie art worth stealing.			"

												You know those games where everything is perfect? The music is awesome, the play feels great, there's a bunch of variety and it never gets old because every time you play a level again you try doing something different that changes the whole thing?Yeah, me neither. Or at least I didn't until I tried this game.The game revolves around... Well, it differs between levels. Sometimes you're making a heist, sometimes you're rescuing someone, and sometimes you're simply getting the f--k out of there.The game is well balanced with multiple characters, each with different pros and cons. One of my personal favorites, the pickpocket, has a little pet monkey that follows him and gets coins for him. See that coin just out of reach because you'd trigger an alarm to get it? Let monkey Hector get it.Then there's, say, the cleaner. See a guard blocking your way? He can just sneak up on him and put him to sleep with good ol' clorophorm.Then there's a locksmith, that, you guessed it, picks locks, safes, ATMs, everything twice to three times as fast as everyone else.Then there's a looko-- you get the point.The music also plays a part, mostly because it's 1- Dynamic and 2-Wonderful.Seriously, you can just see some of the music in this game by going in this link: http://austinwintory.bandcamp.com/album/monaco-gentlemans-private-collection-bundleThis music was made by the same guy who made the music to Journey. And we all know how wonderful that turned out.The game also has a full fledged workshop with a level editor that, while awkward at first, has literally every single thing in the actual game. See something in game? You can do it in the editor too. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's the same editor they used to make the levels in the game.But don't be fooled by it's cartoonish graphics, because under that pixelated looking exterior, is a whole story full of drama, plot twists, foreshadowing... And you can play the piano. Yes, that's right, you can play on a f--king piano. With friends. There's even an achievement for doing so.My point is, what are you doing still reading this? Seriously, this is a huge wall of text. Unless you skipped straight to the end. Either way, stop reading this, and go buy the game. Now. I want more friends to play with me, because, you know. The more the merrier!			"

												Imagine if old GTA games, Chip's Challenge, and Oceans 11 all stumbled into a blender owned by a Lego man.Boy what a mess that would be. Thankfully, Monaco is 'not' a mess, but rather, a stealth heist game in which you and up to three other thieves band together to plunder the money of a variety of facilities in and around Monte Carlo, everything ranging from Casinos to Hospitals to High Security Prisons, being represented.The game's two virtues are its deceptive level of gameplay depth, and its humorous design aesthetic. It's the personality hidden behind the neon pixels that at first attracts one to this game--the perplexingly simple yet expressive character designs go along with the frantic piano ragtime and silly french NPC voices, to be extremely memorable. You'll laugh as your little colorful lego thief pees in a toilet, wiggles their hands to hack a PC hollywood style, or hugs a wall and takes deep, ragged breaths after being shot--to the accompaniment of bloodied footprints left in their step. And as your little Mr. Pink dies from that one guard who peaks just inside your hiding place to bop you with a wrench, they explode into a neon pink colored skeleton, and the music thuds to an abrupt halt--only for the music to pick up again where it left off, once your fellow criminals put your guts back in (to the sound of hilarious squishing noises).As for the gameplay, it's definitely the part that keeps you playing Monaco, long after you're familiar with its pretty pixel face. On the one hand, you can be a sneaky, super subtle player who never gets caught, never trips a trap, never fires a shot. It can at first be a difficult process to do so, as you're forced to learn by trial and error (due to the game's sparse tutorial elements) how to remain undetected.On the flip side, however, Monaco, unlike some of its compatriots in the sneak-em-up genre, never trips over the hurdle of forced stealth. You can shoot people down in a bloody Scarface-esque machinegun massacre, lure guards and civilians into side areas off patrol and give them a wrench over the head, 40's femme fatale style, or be a clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, cut the circuit breaker in a particularly well-guarded facility, and just 'camp' the power room subduing guards who come with chloroform, while your (debatably) coordinated teammates do the legwork.In fact, if you're in a hurry, it can sometimes be better just to run aggressively past NPCs, dodging from cover to cover to avoid security agent machinegun fire, or to climb in a vent duct to escape angry attack dogs who are onto your scent, rather than trying to outstealth them. And as a result of this flexibility, at first, it seems like Monaco will be trivially easy to play and win. But Monaco is a stern teacher, and it knows how to steadily ramp up the difficulty to keep you challenged through around thirty-some different, replayable missions. As you go, new classes and items are introduced to the formula, along with new map features like security-trigger handscans, computer viruses, alarm-triggering ATMs that must be busted open for cash, and more. The game is incredibly flexible in its approach, and each class is nuanced enough to be distinct from its brethren. (The one class I am not personally fond of is the Pickpocket, which tends to encourage reckless, self-serving tactics over cooperation, at lower levels of play experience.) However, the classes are not so distinct that they cannot all perform basic functions like opening a safe, or hacking a PC--it's just that some classes do these things more efficiently than others. So there will rarely be a point where you play a mission 'exactly' the same as the last time you played it, as you tackle obstacles in a level best suited to whatever class you are playing at the time.Lastly, there 'is' a story to the game, consisting mostly of text dialogue, but which is filled with humor and an actually relatively intriguing plot, fleshing out the personalities and origins of the thieves you play as. The thieves themselves have some pretty charming tics--the Hacker is constantly making references to PC error codes and computer shorthand terminology, the Gentleman is your 'World's Most Interesting Man', complete with his own little intrigue and espionage plot, the Cleaner is a stoic psychopath who rarely speaks beyond deep heavy breaths, and the Mole has a terse Serbian accent and a Freedom Spoon which he employs with a mixture of bravado and thuggish loyalty.The game does suffer from a poor matchmaking system, which is a bit prone to lag and connectivity issues. Also, the menu options are a bit confusing, and there is one bug with using a controller that prevents mouse usage until your machine is restarted--so if you tend to use a controller for some games, like Gauntlet or Dark Souls, but prefer a mouse and keyboard for Monaco, you may run into complications where your mouse doesn't want to work to aim guns til you pull a soft reset on your OS.All in all, I give Monaco a thumbs up. There are a lot of visual tweaks that could probably make finding your way in the maps a bit easier, the story could use some accompanying visuals (even if just still scenes), and the tutorial aspects of the game are sorely lacking even after a custom tutorial map was added--but the game just has so much complexity and charm, that it's hard not to pick it up from time to time, if you can get past those hiccups long enough to get into the meat of the game.Grab it if you don't have it, and see if you can't wrangle some friends into the heist with you on headsets. At worst, it'll make for an amusing weekend of cartoon criminal hijinx.			"

												Absolutely recommended. I originally got it with the Indie Mega Booth pack, since six games for $20 was a steal. I'd never heard of Monaco before that, and I fell in love almost right away. The soundtrack is great - all jazzy piano that changes intensity depending on if you're sneaking or being chased; the game itself is gorgeous, very colorful but not blinding; some levels can be difficult, but with persistence and planning you can get through it. 10/10 would recommend.

												A game of intrique, mystery and most importantly, teamwork. Monaco is a game that revolves around a gang of criminals who plan a series of heists to escape from jail, and to escape from the suspicion of the law. Throughout the course of the game, players will choose different and unique character classes (mole, locksmith, cleaner, hacker) who utilize special skills (digging through walls, opening safes, knocking people out, diasbling security systems) and a vast array of thieving tools ranging from shotguns to smokebombs in order to perform heists. The game features a unique top-down blueprint perspective that, when a good plan goes through, feels like a scene out of the Oceans 11 series. While the game on single player is enough, it's the multiplayer that truly makes this title worth a purchase. Local Co-op and Online Co-op (these are mutually exclusive in this case) let you have fun with friends and strangers, and friendly strangers around the world. That being said though, multiplayer is also one of the biggest caveats of the monaco experience. Servers can be unreliable at times and the leaderboards seldom update or never record scores, if it all. This can create some frustration since a really fun aspect of Monaco is planning routes and heists and seeing how these strategies stack up against other players. While this game is a personal favorite of mine, I recognize that this type of game isn't for everyone. Very often do I see others online who treat this game more like smash tv than splinter cell and the game punishes you heavily for just running in guns a blazin'. so if you're looking for a typical high speed shooter experience, this isn't going to be your thing.tl;dr This game is about stealing♥♥♥♥♥♥like nobody even knew they took a♥♥♥♥♥♥ You gotta get gud or go home.Pros:+Music is awesome and atmospheric+Gameplay is top notch+Online Multiplayer is enjoyable+Workshop Enabled+If you like games with a story that makes you think, this is greatCons:-Might not be for everybody, which will probably ruin your smooth heist experience-Online leaderboards don't update as often as they should-Servers can be kind of iffy at certain timesThis game is 9 vinegar husbands out of 10			"

												(This game was rated Overwhelmingly positive, I have no idea why it says mixed. Must be bug ;-;)This game is underrated. Very nice design and awesome game play. Never gets boring and is challenging no matter how good you are at the game, you will be learning new things about every time you play!WHY DIS GAME IS GOOD:HUGE REPLAY VALUE: There are 8 classes, many play styles, a workshop, 5 achievements for each level, multiplayer, and 2 game modes. Which makes a combination of 480 ways you can play each level. There are 50+ levels and workshop!!!CHALLENGING:No matter how many hours you have, you will always be learning new tricks and the game never gets boring.SIMPLE CONTROLS :If you want to, you can play this game with only your left hand, that is right! WASD and space bar! It’s so nicely designed and simple, easy to learn but hard to master.GREAT LEARNING CURVE: Perfect level designs, you will never feel like you are stuck on a level but each one is a challenge and a checkpoint to make sure you are ready for the next. None of the levels feel receptive and you learn something new after each level. Very nicely ordered.SOMEONE FOR EVERYONE: There are 8 classes and each has a very unique play style, so even on the same level you can have 8 different experiences when playing.CREATIVITY: You can make your own maps and there are tons of maps on the workshop for you to download. Getting bored of just heists? You can make race maps, death runs, PvP’s. It’s like it’s own g-mod.VERY NICE COMMUNITY: The community has some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. It’s kind of a small community so the older players are very nice and will try to help you in game if you have any questions.TAKE YOUR TIME: Rounds can be long or short depending on weather you go stealthy or do a speed run, so it fits everyone’s play style. If you need to leave soon and want to play something for 10 minutes, this is the game for you. If you want to play for an hour, or half a day, this is still the game for you ;)ADDICTING: You always feel you can play “one more round” and by the time you realize it’s already the next day….STEAM PLATFORM: Very nicely linked to STEAM.  Creating lobbies and inviting friends are super convenient as well as uploading your custom maps.DEVELOPMENT: Runs super smoothly, hardly any bugs. The devs are nice and they are working on a new game atm! Go check it out =w=HIT ON PEOPLE: Simple to add friends with a easy “view steam profile” button. GREAT SOUNDTRACK EDITING: Music is excellent! The rhythm even changes when you are being chased, giving you a clue weather its safe to run or not.EASY TO LEARN: Whole interface and character designs are very nicely done.NEVER GET ENOUGH OF MONACO:The map editor is very simple to pick up and after reading a guide or two you’ll be a pro map maker.GOOD FOR LAPTOPS: Small game file, barely takes up any space for laptop users like me. A game you can play in class or on the go ;)ZOMBIES OR NOT:There is a zombie mode if that’s your fetish ;)MULTIPLAYER: Everyone can only use one class, making you feel dedicated to your role. The maps are designed so you can wander off on your own but also be very useful as a group.WHY THE HECK ARE YOU READING THIS JUST BUY THE DARN GAME!!!IF THIS IS ON SALE AND YOU S T I L L  AREN’T BUYING THEN YOU’D BE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE!!!!! >:D just get it cause diamonds will make you feel better!!

												short, glib review: Benny Hill Skit Simulator 2013 (later patched to become the Superior Sociopath Simulator 2014)Let's be frank here, most of you have this from a Humble Bundle or 20 now. It's a good game, BUT, play it MP. Find a pal or three and co-op the campaign. Push through to the end of the first one* at least, it's around 18 stages. You'll get new thieves as time goes on, experiment, shake up who uses what if you're stuck. It's a great game in this context. Solo, though, it's kind of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥stealth title. I played half of the game alone and it involved more skulking than stealing.It's fun! It just requires pals to really bring out the true chaotic underbelly of the game as someone lingers a second too long and suddenly all the guards are rushing towards one corner of the manor and do you help that guy or do you jack everything you can in the meantime and maybe pick up his corpse later? No honor among thieves, you know.Enjoyed the hell out of it - stopped after campaign #1 because my group finally went ""Yeah, that's a good amount.""* There are 4. Do not let it be said this game didn't get post-release support, the final patch added an entirely new set of missions on top of two entirely redesigned game modes and a crazy amount of Workshop support.

												Greeetings all potential buyers of Monaco!Pull your chairs in, and listen to the sound of my voice:Monaco is a fantastic game. That's the first thing to keep in mind throughout this review. For an Indie game, I am suprised as to how polished and nice looking the game is, with no bugs that I have found or are aware of. The soundtrack is fantastic, and is one of the many things that keeps me coming back to this game. Another great thing about it, is that you can just jump into it and have some fun with it. There is not a lot of tutorial needed to know what you are doing in this game. It is more of a stealth game, than a shooter such as Hotline Miami. Another point that I want to go over, is the Co-Op mode. Although I do not have a lot of experience with this, from what I remember, it was great fun to see how you can help your friends out with completing a mission as fast as possible. You can look at the game as a casual indie game, but you can also get competitive and try for the leaderboards.This game has a lot of depth to it. It does very well at creating atmosphere for the player, and it is a lot of fun to just run around the area to not get spotted. Even though the storyline is a little bit thin, it is not the main selling point of this game. If you want a game that you can just jump in an play with for a good amount of time, and not get bored with it, I highly HIGHLY recommend this title!So go, run, get out your wallet and GET THIS GAME NOW! It has won a multitude of prizes from proffesionals, so don't take my word for it, try reading some other (more proffesional) reviews online, to get convinced of how amazing this game is! "

												This is a well built stealth game, a game genre we are lacking in quality.You have your choice of several characters, each with unique abilities and unique styles to play through the maps.What this game offers is more variability of gameplay. If you're spotted or set off an alarm, you have options. You can try gunning down the enemies, running around corners, sneaking behind a nearby bush or running for a vent. It takes time to get through them though, time the enemy can pummel or shoot you. Unlike other stealth games, a well planned out escape won't necessarily lead to death if you're clever.The difficulty curve is really well done. You're consistently unlocking new content and styles of gameplay with every level, the challenge slowly increasing. If you die, it doesn't feel like such a failure compared to other games because you learn. I actually found it fun to die. While playing co-op, death adds an extra layer of difficulty of: How do I get my teammate back up?The in game dialogue is clever and cheeky. There is strong depth of gameplay here. I even like the basic 2d graphics, it feels uncluttered and consistent compared to other games. The smaller and quality nature of the maps make the game forgiving of failure.The bad would be finding enough people to play the later levels with, the few co-op games that lag, and dying on the later levels after an arduous journey through four levels.I highly recommend the game. I give it a solid 8.5.			"

												I've a strange relation with Monaco. And a strange tale to tell.When the game came out, I didn't believe in it. I was very interested by the concept, but really put out by the graphisms. You see, I hate this game of ""faux retro"" graphic style a lot of people use nowdays to surf on the wave of nostalgia, especially when they could totally make games look better using their technology and talent. So the game at first was no more than a missed opportunity to me.Enter Kotton, a friend of mine, who told me I should really give the game a try. I wasn't convinced. So, as he often does to try to force my hand, he gifted it to me. Game was small, I decided to download it and give it a try.And oh boy, what a gem did I found. Let me get things straight: I WAS WRONG. So very very wrong.Monaco is an awesome game with a very strong ambiance, the graphic style has its own strange blocky charm. It takes a while to get used to it gameplay-wise, but when you do, it's all smooth sailing.The gameplay is extremly solid. Everything happens for a reason and by knowing how things work, you can make the better of them. There is only a limited amount of RNG.The scenario is interesting and to the casual player, Monaco has the big advantage of being extremly funny when things go wrong, turning into a Benny Hill comedy with guards chasing the characters around in a total chaos while the alarms are blaring and everyone tries to scramble for a good hiding spot. To the more result-focused player, the game is also interesting, with a scoring system dependant of both efficiency and speed, a strong speedrunning community, and some pretty challenging maps to boot.Every character has its own specificities, meaning multiplayer is always a treat(in good or bad), and allow a great amount of teamplay.I ended up loving this game so much I gifted it in turn to something else, hoping to share the love, and retablishing balance in the world, as an apology to not believing in it to begin with.Don't exactly expect a top view shooter though, this is not what Monaco is. Monaco is a pure stealth game, and a solid one at that. It does have some shooting, but to a limited extent, and to be used strategically. If you can get it during a sale, you will probably pay it something like 2 euros or so, and at that price, it's pretty much... A steal.			"

												Pretty amazing game all things considered. It's been around for a year now, so the price is lower than release, and I'm sure you can get it for next to nothing from either a Humble Bundle, or waiting on a Steam sale.As you can see from previews, it's a top down sneaking/stealing game. You've got eight characters total, each with their own main ability, and a less noticeable side ability. Example, if going by the preview, the Lookout is the expert at Recon, which means when she's sneaking/stationary, everyone gets red icons on the map indicating where guards/civilians are, even when not in vision.Her secondary power is that she opens ladders/vents 3 times as fast as anyone else. The main power of each class is the draw, but often you'll find the secondary power is incredibly useful as well.There are a rich amount of stories, though given that this game is a year old now, online co-op can be somewhat hit or miss. There are still players, but you might not be able to get a game every time you look. Another frustration is that later missions become really very difficult for a solo player to beat. It's always completely possible, though sometimes it requires some extra work. This really is a game that benefits from co-op.As people have mentioned, getting seen or alerting guards will not be the end of you, and in fact is required sometimes to move guards out of position. That said, later missions in say the 2nd story or the epilogue will punish you quickly for not being stealthy. Finally, for a small little indie title about pixilated thieves, there is actually a pretty good story being told here. It presents itself as story's being told by one of the thieves in a police interview. As such, the 2nd story is the same heists, but completely changed around, and a step up in difficulty as it's another of the crooks recollection of the tale.It's up to you to puzzle out the whole truth of what really happened here. The reveal comes in the final mission of story two, but it's easy to miss what happened if you aren't expecting it.I continue to play this game and highly recommend it for the price it is now (15$, and certainly recommend it on sale)			"

												Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of my favorite games. I just want to start with that. I got this game a couple months ago and I'm hooked. Yeah, it's a little frustrating at times, but only in that sort of ""Aargh I'm not quite good enough for this level!"" way.Monaco is kind of a fun time-waster singleplayer, but where it really shines is multiplayer. It is FANTASTIC, and not just for the sake of completion. It's so much fun to run through the levels, causing chaos, or try to not get spotted at all. Make sure you discuss your plans with other players, but don't be surprised when things fall apart because of an unlucky corner with five guards behind it.The way powers help your friends makes the teamwork element of this game happen so naturally you might not even realize you're doing it at first. The hacker runs through a hallway trailing viruses, and the laser grid in your way just dies. The Mole digs a tunnel, and you escape through it to a nearby shrub. And everyone loves a Lookout. If there's one character who doesn't play well with teams, it's the Pickpocket, whose power is purely self-focused and who tends to hoard all the coins. If everyone's okay with that, by all means, play him. But if you're just browsing for random games online, it's polite to not use the pickpocket.The difficulty wobbles a bit around the start of the second act, but it pretty much goes steadily up from there. And keeps going up. This works to the game's advantage. The difficulty curve gives you enough time to get used to the system, and then slowly works in new elements and characters, and by the time you're dealing with the really hard stuff, you've got at least an idea of what to do. You may not be able to do it on your first try, or even your first ten, but you should be able to understand at least the theory of how the pieces fit together.Replay value? The game has incredible replay value. Not only are there eight characters to play through with, but there's an entire community of fan-made maps to play, and once you've done all the main story, there's even a zombie mode for more violent fun! I've already beaten the main story, and I'm working my way through the stunningly difficult final campain, ""Fin"". I am curious how they might expand the story that I thought was over, but it seems to be a well-written wrap-up.The story is simple, but has a few twists to make it more satisfying. Without spoiling too much, I will say that I would have been satisfied with the game if it had concluded with ""Identity"". The two (much shorter) extra acts were icing on the cake. It's a pretty standard heist plot, with a little bit of ""how we got here"" thrown in, betrayals, and other standard tropes of the genre, but it managed to surprise me in places, which made me very happy. It's not often you get to play a mystery from the villain's perspective and still be surprised.If I'm ambivalent about only one aspect, it would be the artstyle. The sprites are charming, but it's really quite difficut to tell who's who at times, and for colorblind players, this would be completely incomprehensible. Everyone looks like squares, including the enemies. The top-down angle limits the perspective, but the backgrounds do not suffer from the same confusion as the characters. They are gorgeous, elaborate, and the way lighting is used is something I've never seen in another stealth game. In some of the levels, I can even look down through the floor to see bits of the lower areas. The music is amazing, but since the levels can be a bit long, it loops a lot. It's by no means grating, and it spreads the clips out with slow, quiet periods, so it doesn't get stuck in your head too often, but it could have used a little variety. I loved the musical cues for when someone got spotted or an objective was completed, though.All in all, a fantastic game, and one that I'd readily recommend to anyone who likes stealth games, co-op games, or mysteries.Singleplayer: 3/5. A little tedious, but fun and challenging.Multiplayer: 5/5. The game's strongest point. One of the best co-op experiences I've ever had.Art: 3/5. The sprites were limited, but the settings were gorgeous.Sound: 4/5. The music was excellent, and I wish there had been more variety to it. The voices of the characters were delightful, even if I couldn't understand a word of french.Difficulty: 4/5. Quite a challenge, but not so difficult you become disenchanted. You learn and get better noticably over time.Replay: 5/5. Many levels, community-made maps, and excellent multiplayer. The end is just the beginning.			"

												Monaco was an interesting concept and was alright for awhile. The problem is, the game provides a co-op function which it then, through its very design, discourages you from using. There is no way to make any permanent progress on any given level. Any deterrent you use to reduce the number of potential threats (even shooting the guards or exploding them) can be reversed by other guards, and murdering everyone on every map is impractical, if not impossible. This means that ultimately, the best way to beat any map is to remain undetected, but remaining undetected is infinitely easier when playing alone, as cooperative matches often just turn into a smash-and-grab chaotic cluster♥♥♥♥.  At the same time, playing the game alone is almost pathetically easy, and feels hollow. In either case, the concept felt a bit unpolished and there was never a sense, at least not for me, that careful planning and slow, steady progress on a level would reward a player (or group of players) with a superior playing experience, so every level just devolved into ""Grab what you can, die in a bush, and hope someone survives to revive you.""Suffers from the same problem Dungeon Defenders did, in that it provides cooperative play without an incentive to utilize it (indeed in both cases it was almost a hindrance to bring others into the game).Had some fun with it though, probably worth checking out if you're not expecting much and you're just looking for a casual experience to share with a few people. I'd recommend waiting for a sale though.			"

												A simple 'yes' for a recommendation doesn't seem powerful enough for what is, truly, one of the finest experiences of gameplay I've ever seen.Take 1 part heist movie, 1 part crayloa 64-count crayon box, 1 part mad magazine, and 1 part jaw-droppingly gorgeous soundtrack, and you being to get an idea of what the game is. You're a thief - and your job is to Pokemon the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone elses valuables in the city of Monaco. Want to break into rooms quicker? Locksmith. Want to see everything at all times? Lookout. Want to....clean? The Cleaner. This game takes every single heist movie trope, turns it on it's ear, and then wraps it up in the most simple but polished beyond measure gameplay you're likely to find on any platform.Oh, and that's just single player.Multiplayer is even better. You REALLY learn about how your friends that you always planned that incredible heist with would react in that situation, because guess what? Neither one of you think alike, and you're going to be tripping alarms and getting shot by security guards left and right. The best part of this game, however, is Austin Wintory's score. It's simply gorgeous, and makes an already great game my 2014 game of the year.			"

												This review prepares one mentally for Monaco's negative points. It is a great stealth game which I highly recommend but these are some things which you should know before purchasing. I can sing the praises for this game in the voice of a singing skald but that defeats the purpose of a review.-----------------------GraphicsIt is confusing distinguishing what the icons on the map symbolize and the lighting looks like a complete mess. It takes quite awhile (at least 5 hours) just getting fully accustomed to the visuals of the game.DifficultyThe game has a very gentle learning curve that only gets hard toward the end of the second campaign. This can be a problem for some players as there are a lot of hidden mechanics which isn't taught anywhere and you have to figure these things out on your own.For other players, the first half game is extremely easy just brute forcing your way through. Don't be too hasty in shrugging off the game as the difficulty ramps up towards the latter half. There are countless challenging workshop maps too.WorkshopThere are over a hundred good custom maps available in the workshop (if you know where to look), this is the reason the game has a tonne of content for hours of fun. While the editor is great and easy to pick up, the lack of players will mean anything you make is left for dead.Anti-social Hosts (Aka. Why you should not get Monaco)The 'community' is pretty dead and newer players have a tendency to kick strangers out of a lobby even if there are vacancies. Unfortunately, most hosts are unbothered to have these games in private. If you do get the game, it is best to at least have a friend or two to join you. Chaos in a party is what makes Monaco great. There will be more players during the summer sale so grab the game then.Colour-blindnessColour-blind mode doesn't help much and it's a game where colours are used to differentiate things easily. :P-----------------------TL:DRGrab the game if it's on sale, it's a steal stealing stealers stealing money like a monkey, with a monkey.

												Beware people with colorblindness such as myself, when you are playing co-op with others, it almost impossible to tell which character you are playing as, causing many frustrations when you think you are controlling your character but instead trying to control someone else's and the colorblindness mode does slim to nill to actually fix that problem.

												Monaco can be a nice game to casually solo but the real fun comes from running with accomplices. The more thieves racing through the map, getting beaten and shot, the crazier time you will have. Watch your friends die in horrible places, like the center of a heavily populated dance floor. Plan elaborate rescue missions to recover your friend's corpse from within a crowd of dancing NPCs. Get beat up by the guards as you struggle to recover your fallen comrade. Laugh at how miserably you failed.10/10			"

												The level of sneakery in this game is fantastic. You can get through the entire game without being seen, but even if you do get spotted, it's still entertaining running around, ducking into AC vents and evading the security guards. The best part of the gameplay is its simplicity. You have one item, and the character you choose has one special ability. The difficulty curve is actually really well-made. You start in levels with just a handful of guards, and eventually reach sprawling levels with lots of automated security systems and attack dogs and stuff. Amazingly, it works as both a singleplayer and multiplayer experience. It's a lot better in multiplayer, because four people running around knocking people out, setting off alarms, and planting C4 is better than one. But it can stand on its single player experience. There's a level editor and the developers have released a few new content packs for free, so that's pretty cool. If you like heist games and general stealthy sneaky hiding-in-bushes and running around stealing stuff, this game is definitely for you.			"

												Monaco is an excrutiatingly difficult 4-player co-op fast-paced stealth game played from a top-down perspective with many unique characters to play as.While it starts simple, this game becomes progressively more complex and challenging, demanding your crew to have great spatial awareness, a lot of patience, wit, and most importantly, synchronization. Violence is only a countermeasure when there's no other way to solve a dangerous problem (like an alert) and supplies are very limited. Each crewmate can only hold one type of item and stocks of it are only generated by collecting many coins, forcing teams to prioritize coin collection to a certain individual depending on the item and the map being played.Overall, a very fun and addicting game, completely recommended.

Posted: April 25, 2016
												Probably one of the best co-op (local or online) games out there. The stealth mechanics manage to fit well with the generally arcadey feel, as the guards aren't super perceptive, so they can be avoided if you're careful (and sometimes if you aren't!). Stealth playthroughs, especially in singleplayer, are satisfying and tense. However, Monaco is just as fun when you don't try to be stealthy, as you can get into crazy and action-filled situations as you're forced to escape oncoming guards after you trip an alarm or get caught. The AI can be punishing, though, and some enemies, such as shotgun toting Gendarme, are not to be taken lightly. Multiplayer tends to lean towards the more wild approach unless you're working in a two-man crew or everyone is trying to stay on the down-low. You're given the pick of (once you unlock all of them) eight thieves, each with their own unique abilities, all of which are useful. This is another reason why the game shines in multiplayer, because each thief can tackle different situations that others would have trouble with. There's also a good number of equipments which provide the player with some tool that can get help them get the job done, like smoke bombs, shotguns, C4, and EMPs. Monaco has a ton of standard campaign levels with unique settings and good variety, and there's also hundreds of user-made levels, some of which are almost as good as the standard ones. The level editor itself is fairly easy to use once you understand the basics, and there are a couple of really extensive guides on the community page which can help get you started. It's also got a sweet noir style piano soundtrack by Austin Wintory, the guy who made the Journey soundtrack.Now, all of this comes with, as I see it, one major catch. Monaco is a really old game, as far as indie online co-op games go (it seems). There's a way smaller community base than there was a few years ago, so finding players can be a challenge. Because of this, I'd recommend that you find a friend willing to play with you, or try the local co-op. If neither of those work out for you, try and leave a message on the community board asking for players. From what I've seen, there are some people who would be willing to play.			"

												Now, this game is VERY, VERY underrated for no reason. Monaco: What's your's is mine is a game for 1-4 players that put players into the roles of french heisters. Player can choose between 8 characters: Locksmith, Cleaner, Pickpocket, Lookout, Redhead, Mole, Gentleman and Hacker. Each character has it's own abilites, for example, Gentleman can disguise and he is practicly invisible to enemies for some time. Game has a lot levels, and even if you pass them all, you can still download some from workshop, or even make your own (like I did)! Making your own levels is a little hard in the beggining, but believe me, it becomes MUCH easierafter 4-5 minutes. It is a lot of fun to make some joke maps and try to pass impossible maps. Game is best played with your friends or online with other people. Now, we came to the problem of the game. It has dead community. Really, if you try to find a multiplayer match, you will most likely end up disappointed. This game has fallen to this level that people doesn't even know what game are you talking about just because of the dead community. As I said, this game HAS to be filled with players, because it deserves at least that much. Please, all of you, buy this game and help this game rise to the place where it belongs.Game is absolute 10/10, would recommend to anyone.			"

												This game is unique. Strategy and cooperation at its best. Play alone to hone your ninja skills (without the need of flashy graphics or a third dimension) or play with friends where each one of you selects a different, often crucial, role in a heist. The gameplay is simple but adequate while the 8 playable characters offer completely different approaches to the same goal. You can run around take the objective and escape or you can take your time and clear out anything of value. The game's random factors allow replaying, which is always a pro in a game and in-game/steam achievements force you to try new things. The screenshots cannot convey the fact that while playing this game you have no need for more detailed graphics. Like chess what matters are the values of the players and their positions so don't judge it too fast.			"

The presentation of the game is very well done, as every little detail in the visuals of the game makes sense in some terms of either the mechanics or the story of the game. The art style of the game is something new to almost anyone, and the co-op play in Monaco is some of the best there is in the Steam market. Community maps are also being made daily, so the replay value of this game is also top notch. Quite the hidden gem to be discovered by anyone who enjoys uniqueness and creativeness in both presentation and gameplay.			"

Either you shoot your way trough the missions or you try to stay silent to accomplish all your goals. It's all up to you and your team which way you choose. But no matter which route you take you will always have a lot of fun!Teamplay 10/10!			"

												This is sincerely one of my favorite games of all time. It's simple to play, but has room for fantastic strategic thinking and co-op team play. My boyfriend and I have been playing this game fairly consistantly for years. I've spent most of my 35 years playing video games and I've probably never played anything as consistantly as this game. Seriously, cannot recommend it enough.			"

												I played a bit of Monaco with my friends and found it OK. Nothing amazing, but entertaining. It's not easy to understand how things work, and the amount of cooperative actions to be taken is huge. In the end we simply did things randomly all the time, but I'm sure that more dedicated players can extract much more from the gaming experience!			"

 Hours of multiplayer fun If you enjoy playing co-op games with friends, this is a must-have.Even the moments of frustration will bring you closer together. Theres nothing like the feeling of despair after your friend accidentally blows both players up by accident at the end of a complicated level.On a serious note, the game is extremely funny, but also challenging to play. The characters all have unique play-style to them and the soundtrack is excellent. You will not be disappointed.			"

												Hilarious game! great campaign mode - very deep - lots of opportunities to be creative with your heist - plan with friends.  Large levels with many features, laser alarms, sentry guns, guard dogs, pet cats, phone calls etc. Classes are varied and interesting, can be combined in many ways to form unique crews for different ideas on how to go about each heist. Even includes a fun PvP mode to compete with friends - where you steal trophies from the map and from the other players and attempt to flee the level. I expected this game to be fun - but i am so impressed by how much it exceeded my expectations. This is a very polished and well thought out game. If you have friends you game with regularly this is a fantastic game for you guys to enjoy. i highly recommend for those that want to have big laughs with friends over voice comms.			"

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is a top down 2D heist game where you and 3 other optional players play as different characters with each having their own abilities over 2 main story acts and 2 supplement acts. The first two acts have a large amount of levels where the last two supplement acts only have a handful, however they are difficult. The game encourages team work as the later levels become incredibly difficult and requires lots of practice and runs. This is a perfect team game but also plays very differently solo and is still lots of fun hiding from enemies and trying to figure out the best paths to take or how best to utilize your character's ability in the level. The game is lots of fun and becomes hectic and fast paced when you trip an alarm and you're trying to run away from the enemies!			"

												I haven't finished playing it yet, but it's absolutely a fine single-player stealth game with lots of replayability that doesn't give any special advantages to one character like all those other co-op games do. Every character has their own two special advantages (except for the Redhead, whose second ability is crippled from a lack of other players), and you could complete the campaign from start to finish using any of them. So if the single-player is really good and stands up on its own from the co-op for once, why play co-op? Answer: Four players running around having their perfect plan ruined by a difficult or unexpected triviality, running from the guards and trying to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of there without screwing everything up further. This is hilarious, and when the players succeed, it's hilarious and a sight to behold. Also the sound and visual design are pitch perfect as well.			"

												At first I thought this game was all smoke and mirrors when it came to the game play and graphics, but up until I took the time to actually play this game then I realized the potential it has playing yourself or playing online with others. The games premise is to rob places without being detected, which seems simple right? The unique portion is working together as each different player or unit has a specific function. There are 8 different classes to unlock while progressing through the game : the locksmith, the pickpocket, the cleaner, the lookout, the mole, the gentleman, the hacker, the redhead. In order, the locksmith can pick locks a lot faster than anyone, the pickpocket is able to acquire coins from a greater distance and doesn't alert guards or trigger alarms, the cleaner can knock out guards and heal faster, the lookout can see a vast majority of whats going on from great distances, the mole can rip through almost any wall (my favorite characteristic!), the gentleman is able to disguise himself, the hacker can disable alarms and spread viruses into computer systems and finally, the redhead who is able to attract enemies and have them open doors for her while not harming other immediate players. Some of these players come when you first start the game while others have to be unlocked as you progress (nothing wrong with that)! Map designs are also very fluid and challenging. Some parts will seem impossible to get by without a helping hand. There is usually always a way though if you're stuck playing solo.The unique view setting this game provides is the excitement through it's graphics. Although simple in premise, it's very effective in providing a good game play experience (unless you don't like this sort of thing and are bound to stylish 3D graphics). Sounds are absolutely fantastic and as a French speaking individual, it's greatly appreciated. I'm sure those who do not speak French will start picking up a few things as well. The dialogue is okay (I wish they added a bit more) but for the most part it does a good job keeping you on your toes.I would recommend buying it on sale.Indie Rating : 8/10RATING : 7.2/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots : My friend is hacking while I'm breaking down walls There are graphic indicators in game to show where your friends are (notice bottom left) Don't alert the guard don't alert the guard don't alert the guard If you're making holes in the wall, the guards can hear it "

												Extremely satisfying heist game. It's not exactly a fully stealth game, getting found is not the end of the world, you just need to escape and hide. The gameplay alternates between  trying to be stealthy and purposefuly or mistakenly getting discovered while accomplishing some objective. The coop experience is vastly different than the solo experience. The ideal is to have a group of 4 friends and play together.			"

												tl;dr: It's a top-down heist game about collecting shiny things. Maybe get it if you have friends to play with, and both of you are willing to spend a couple hours figuring out mechanics. What is Monaco? Monaco is a game where you control four (supposedly) elite thieves across a complex level in a quest to collect all shiny things. To make things fun, its levels also contains a lot of traps and guards. Some of them will shoot at you with bullets, while another will have explosives in order to try to kill you. In order to deal with that, you can use various items such as bullets and explosives to try to not die. Though you can just sneak past all of them if you just hold shift (but it's slow so only do it when you need to). At the end of the level, the game will look at your timer and add penalty for any shiny things you might've missed before putting you into a leaderboard. Uhm, supposedly? Monaco have this weird inclination to not teach you things you need to know. For example : In the upcoming steam sale, there will be many lobbies. However, most of them will kick you if you try to join because they actually want to play with their friends but they don't know how to make private lobby. There's also the fact that you won't know what's the key to toggle shared view unless you go to the option menu (it's E). Heck, even the stealth is not really explained. Your thief can move right in front of a guard's nose without alerting them or use an atm that is being camped by a guard, but you won't know how to unless you're willing to experiment for a while. Is the multiplayer alive? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I only play pub games roughly once a week, mostly because I rarely find a lobby during weekdays. Maybe you can randomly add people during steam sale? Is the singleplayer fun? Sure, most of my pub games is basically just me playing solo while occassionaly reviving others. The game doesn't have much replay value on solo play unless you're into speedrunning, but there's 40 levels that should keep you entertained for a while.			"

												This game was quite a steal.What? No one on drums? Do I REALLY have to do this? Ugh, screw it. To the review!Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is an indie game released last year. It is stealth and puzzle based, with some action elements in it and a whole lot of teamwork. For the most part, I really enjoy the game. Seeing there's so much to say, I'll say it as best as I can, like I say in pretty much all of my reviews.We'll start off with, hmm... How about visuals. Y'know what they say, ""First is the worst, second is the best, third is the one with the (Treasure, hairy, etc) chest."" So, like that said, ""First is the worst."" Allthough, the graphics aren't all that bad. They just don't compare to the greatness of the rest of the game. It has the retro feel to it. Kinda stale, as lots of indie games do that, but I've seen worse.So, second is the best. I give the gameplay the ""2nd is the best"" award. The gameplay is so, open. You can choose your playstyles and take advantage of that with one of the eight classes to choose from. If you want to run around and knock people out so your teammates can get to the next floor or car, pick the Cleaner. If the place is heavily guarded with lasers and such, pick the Hacker. If you're too lazy to strategize and want to get to the next floor, choose the Mole. There are many secrets to discover, and some of them can actually be quite humorous. So yeah, you can explore the rooms to get all the loot, since there is no time limit. No, I'm not done yet. Did I mention that there was a LEVEL EDITOR? For you creative minds out there (like myself, no, seriously!) you will enjoy the level editor. It is very simple to use. After looking at a guide made by Andy Nguyen, the man that designed most of the levels in Monaco, I was able to learn how to add lasers and such. I discovered that unlike other difficult level editors *cough* Super Meat Boy *cough* I was able to create a level. The only other game that I can think of with a level editor that simple is LittleBigPlanet. If anything, Monaco's level editor is easier to use, and you're talking to an LBP fanboy. Okay, let's continue before I begin to talk about LBP...I'll go to the story next. Although there isn't much of a story, there are pre-dialogues before every mission, so you can get info on what's going on. I thought it was acceptable and a little surprising to see how well done it is. I have low expectations on story, unless it's a huge story based game. I think Monaco's story is interesting. Especially for the Lockpicker's story. But hey, there isn't much else to say.Now, for the audio. Not much to it. Okay, not much to it when talking about the AI. Okay. I take that back. There are lots of awesome sounds in this game. That's it. Fooled you! I didn't talk about the magnificent soundtrack. Monaco's songs are mostly piano songs, but when played in a game like this, it was done in an amazing way. It's not an ""Oh. My. God. Drooling! Drooling! Drooling! Drooling!"" soundtrack, not like Bastion's or FTL's anyway, but I enjoy it. Replayability time. Since I only have a couple hours into the game, I don't know much about replayability. However, I do know it does last you quite some time. You can try and get #1 on the All-Time list for the record times, or you could design more levels. It's up to you. What's funny is that these paragraphs are all small except for gameplay. Well, I'm doing my best to keep this not biased.Now, for the flaws. Don't worry, almost done! Despite Monaco's many, many pros, there are some pretty major flaws that need to be pointed out. Okay, to be honest, it's one major flaw. Ready? The AI in this game is HORRIBLE. And I do mean HORRIBLE. So, I climb up a ladder to hide from guards, but one climbs up, walks right through me, and climbs down without noticing me right IN FRONT OF HIM. Also, I ran away from another group of guards, not far away and still visible, I stay there and wait for the pursuing guards to catch me. What's the problem? Those lazy fatasses decided to go back to their post. There are countless more stories about how big of morons these guards are. Want me to tell you some more? No? That's what I thought. Let's finish this thing.In conclusion, Monaco is an amazing game. Fun, simple gameplay mechanics, neat soundtrack, a surprising story, and pretty impressive replayability, you'll definitely enjoy the game. One of the few gems from last year the I, personally, think should have gotten more praise, despite it already having a couple positive reviews. However, the moron AI makes the game a lot less difficult and lame. If you don't mind bad AI and stale graphics, then you're in for one enfer d'un tour, which means ""hell of a ride"" in French. Graphics: 5/10Gameplay: 9/10Story: 6.5/10Audio: 8.5/10Replayability: 8.5/10.:8.2/10:.+Great gameplay+Good soundtrack+Acceptable story+Great replayability+Missions are open+Simple level editor-Stale visuals-Horrendous AI			"

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine, is another game that falls under the category of ""Not sure what to play? Well why not this?"". I will recommend this game to anyone, and say that it is a game that I should have picked up a lot earlier than I did. It is a fun and neat little indie game that can offer hours of gameplay once you get into it. It is very intuitive and can offer a challenge to almost anyone. I have only played it for about 4 hours, and in that time I only beat the first story-line (it was a very relaxed 4 hours, mind you). The game is very addictive once you start, and you will find more and more difficulty in the various levels as you go on.The biggest downside to this game is that it can be very hard to find a multiplayer game without at least one dumbass who can and will ruin it for others, but once you do find that one team, you can swoop through the entire game no problem in a short time.As for the crew, I found it fun to play more or less each of them, but I did find a few that I favorited over others, due to their playstyle, and I imagine most people will as well.

												The gameplay and story is essentially about 8 characters who are all criminals, looking to steal some stuff. The story is told in conversation snippets before each mission between characters. Visuals are pretty much demonstrated by the screenshots. Design and mechanics are simple, which I like though it may not be to everyone's taste. The characters only have one specific different skill and a hidden secondary skill that makes them all feel different, but not overly so. A nice surprise about the game for me was that I found out a year after owning Monaco that they had updated the maps, providing more/newer content for free with older maps remain playable. Though single player is good, the multiplayer is what makes it great. Maps get notoriously difficult at later stages and very difficult to beat without help. It can get frustrating, but clearing them also feels incredibly rewarding. Keep in mind however it's rare to see open/public lobbies (from what I've seen), so make sure you have friends to play with. Replay value is high when not going solo.I would recommend this game for most people, unless you are completely sure it is not your cup of tea. If it's on sale, it's definitely worth a purchase.			"

-Quick Review-Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine is a 2d stealth game that is played from the top view the whole time. The game is very random in puzzle nature so it’s difficult to plan for whatever you face in the game. You can play between several different campaigns and also play player-based maps.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  The first campaign you are the Locksmith, tell the story of escaping from prison and trying to make it to a new country and leave his past of crime behind him. Unfortunately the temptation of getting additional wealth starts to pull him away from his initial intentions.Additional campaigns tell of a more elaborate story, the second campagn is about the Pickpocket, whom is narrating and telling a different story from the Locksmith. There are two more campagns but I haven’t played those yet, because of the increasing difficulty in the puzzles.(Where are my Ninja stars and places to sneak and hide?  //Goes back to Ninja games)Game Play: In Monaco you can choose between eight different characters, each with their own ability’s to help them get through the various puzzles. There are useful guides to help you understand more about what the characters do.To list the basic starting four characters: the locksmith can picklocks really fast, the Pickpocket has a pet monkey that collects loot, the cleaner knocks people out (when they don’t see him), the lookout can detect enemies that are farther away and out of your line of site.Achievements: The achievements in this game are rather straight forward, but also rather tough. As usual you get several achievements just from beating a few levels, but in the end most of the achievements will require a lot of work to earn. Most can be earned with guides on offline single player. But the rest will requirePrice: Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine costs $14.99, for me that is overpriced, but you could easily get many hours of gaming out of it. If you do get over 20 hours out of the game (and know you love stealth based games and a lot of challenge) it’s probably a fair price.I feel like it’s not fair for me to say that I don’t recommend the game because of the price, I just really didn’t enjoy the game, but it was a good game and I think it’s worth a try… try the free weekend or a demo or something before you purchase it to know for certain if you like this style of game. Conclusion: I really thought this game was interesting, different, unique, and added a great amount of challenge compared to most classical stealth games. But this game would be way more fun to play with friends. Even when I played a few games with strangers I enjoyed the fast paced gameplay.But I really can’t say this game makes it on my top list. I would recommend this game just because I think it deserves a chance, but once again; try it on a free weekend or a demo of some type before you purchase, so you know ahead of time what you’re getting yourself into.

												A splendid game to play with friends, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is a top-down game puzzle-ish co-op game with a simplistic but very pleasing art style. Now, when I say this game is a ""puzzle-ish co-op game"", I say that because it's not quite a puzzle game, as it has elements of action to it, but completing each mission can be seen as a ""puzzle"" of sorts. I'd say it's a stealth game, but it's not entirely that, either: while stealth can make things easier, blitzing through a room and drawing all eyes to you can work occasionally also. The goal of each level is to steal all trophies before exiting via the escape route, with an added side objective of collecting as many coins as you can to get a higher score. The main obstacles in the game are the guards, who, upon seeing you, chase you down and beat you senseless until you either escape their pursuit or die. When the latter happens, you can get revived by your buds, but doing so leaves you vulnerable for a decent amount of time, so caution is necessary. By default, you have no means of combat, leaving avoidance of threats as the best option. However, there are items that allow you to better deal with threats, like smoke bombs, sleeping darts, guns, and explosives (possibly others I may have missed), of which you can have one equipped at a time, and all of which are replenished by collecting the previously mentioned coins throughout the level. In addition to guards, there are other obstacles, though most of them just draw the attention of the guards so they can go about their merciless beatings of your team. To offer a wider array of methods to deal with the various things between you and your loot, the game has a character system in which each character has a special ability unique to them; there is a very nice diversity of character choice, with each character possibly opening up alternative routes to the objectives. For instance, the Hacker can hack into terminals and disable nearby electronics, such as cameras and laser sensors, the Cleaner can knock guards unconscious when behind them, and the Mole can break through (some) walls. The game is certainly a lot less interesting and enjoyable when playing alone, as it's meant to be a co-op game first and foremost. It has a story mode, and I have no strong feelings regarding the story either way, but the levels are very well-done, generally. The game has a built-in level editor and thus aptly is tied to the Steam Workshop, so when you're finished with the campaign, there are plenty of community levels to peruse as well, a fair amount of which are bound to be substantial and enjoyable.In short, fantastic little co-op game that's fun, interesting, and worthwhile. I had a blast playing it, and it's probably one of my favorite little indie games (and by ""indie"", I mean the real definition of indie—that is, self-published and independent of any larger company; sorry, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of that term is killing me) of all time, simply based on how much of a good time I had with it.

												Kind of like a stealth-oriented Hotline Miami, the name of the game in Monaco is to get in, steal an objective, get out, while taking all the dosh along the way. Unlike most stealth games though, Monaco expects you to be caught, and gives you tools to deal with a situation. That's not to say finesse isn't important, since you have to earn additional gear usage.The characters have different abilities and each one has a different way of handling the same level, giving great replayability.Single-player and multi-player also have very different methods of approach.Like all good games, it starts off simple but becomes quite challenging in the end. Getting all of the gold in a level unlocks mirrored, more difficult versions of the levels.The music is a smooth ragtime piano that changes to fit the action. Haven't heard anything like it in other games.Comes with a level editor, and the hours of additional play that entails.I had a ton of fun with this game and I think you will too.			"

												In 2014 an awkward group of Skullgirls players decided to play something else for a change. These nerds promptly went to their games tab and downloaded Monaco. Today, still being terrible at this game, they survive as scrubs of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can voip them, maybe you can hire: The S-Team.

												★★★★★Director Andy Schatz realizes his vision of creating a Slapstick comedy disguised as a David Mamet thriller. Follow the mishaps of a bumbling crew trying to hit it big on the French Riviera. An all star cast includes George Clooney (The Gentleman), Christina Hendricks (The Redhead), John Leguizamo (The Hacker) and Randy Savage (The Cleaner) with many more surprise guests! A multi-layered narrative cleverly unravels the intrigue behind the group as it builds and performs daring heists. Monaco: What's Yours is Mine gives thrill seekers the intense highs and lows they've come to love from their favorite heist movies while appealing to those outside the genre with its lightheartedness. Grab three friends and enjoy seeing the world through the eyes of the four stooges trying to reinact the Zoolander Computer scene. Team Chuckle♥♥♥♥ approved. [Rated R - ∞ Hours]			"

It's rare to play a co-op game where one player can't go solo mode even with other people in the same game, everyone is valuable here. The game quickly puts you into action and explains the mechanics as you go. You get different types of classes to choose from, a dynamic environment and so much damn fun!Just buy it.			"

Takes a little while to figure out all of the mechanics and interpret the icons.  There really is a lot of information thrown at you right away.  Once you get used to the flow of gameplay, it is highly rewarding and makes you feel skilled at the profession you start developing an inclination towards. The variety of characters, the catchy ragtime-like piano music, and fast paced stealth action will get you really into this game!  Grab some friends and steal some stuff in Monaco!			"

Play as one of eight characters - four default - in an effort to sneak to, break into, or run to your prize: the ultimate heist.

												Bottom line, this is Ocean's Eleven: The Game. And that is a hefty recommendation all by itself.Up to four players choose one of 8 crooks, each with a unique specialty. The Locksmith opens doors and safes quickly, the Cleaner neutralizes people when they're not looking. Then the team must work together to pull off heist objectives, or, more challenging, get every available coin.The action takes place in a top-down view. Layered systems of security, from dogs and motion sensitive cameras to civilians that alert nearby guards, must be bypassed or defeated to get in, get rich, and get out.The control scheme is marvelously compact. There is a sneak button and a use-special-item button. There is a button to bring up the HUD and see how much life you have and how many coins remain to be stolen in a level. There is a button for push-to-talk. And there is a control stick. If you want to do something, like unlock a door or hack into a computer, just walk into it.Online co-op feels magical. Even with strangers, you start to move as a team and think together. And if you don't, hilarity ensues as your careful plans go to pot. Can't omit the thoughtful graphics and sound design, but the core gameplay is the meat. It is new, and it is fabulous.A promised map editor will provide endless community content, to be released soon.In short, a must buy that may define 2013.			"

												Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is, quite simply put, one of the most intelligent games released this year. The tightly structured gameplay is fast and fluid, and the colorful cast (quite literally) of playable characters are great. Everything about the game, from its mechanics to its presentation, to its music and its sound, feels original and fresh. Monaco is a game with a strong sense of self, a game that is acutely aware of its own eccentric identity and not afraid to show it, which is precisely what makes it such a strong title.In much the same fashion as Hotline Miami and Fez, the incredible art design shows just how much detail there can be in blocky, pixellated graphics. The music is nothing short of masterful, wearing its ragtime, silent-movie inspiration on its sleeve and being all the better for it. The sound design is phenomenal as well, with the typing of keys on a computer, to the whine and sharp snap of a breaker box, to the strange rumbling murmurs of a revive all contributing to the game's singular and unique personality.The game proves how millions of dollars aren't necessary in creating something fun and original; on the contrary, Monaco is important because it shows how so much can be done with so little. It shows the world that what a game really needs in order to stand out is an identity, something that many mainstream contemporary titles sorely lack. Thanks to the uniqueness and originality that pervades through every aspect of its construction, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of the best, and one of the most important, games released in recent memory. Buy it now if you haven't already.			"

 Monaco is a steal at this priceNot going to go into much detail right now but this game is brilliant. Lovely and fairly unique art style with gameplay and story that manages to both fit in perfectly with the visuals and give it a lot of charm. There's a wide range of characters you an play as with each one having their own unique traits and/or abilities that compliment the level design perfectly. Each gives you an entirely different approach to how you move throughout the levels.In co-op play, only one player can play each character so you have to work out what's best (or the most fun) for the situation and who's playing what. The different characters have great synergy with one another and allow you pull off much more complicated and efficient strategies. This can also lead to the most hectic games you'll see with one mistake causing sheer chaos. Though the single player is great and doesn't suffer from solo play, the co-op is the life of this game and it's where the most replay value will be had.Classic mode allows you to play as originally intended if you don't want to play with the changes in updates and zombie mode makes everything much more dangerous with much more persistent enemies. If you run out of levels to play then there's a level editor and Steam Workshop support to keep the game lasting as long as you want.I've only got 2.5 hours of this game on Steam but I purchased this game for the Xbox 360 on release and I've very much enjoyed what I've played. There's a lot more content in the Steam version, it is 100% the better version of the game and it's worth the full price without a doubt.Grab this game while it's 87% off if you don't own it already. The discount is for both a single copy and the 4 pack. It's a steal at this price and you'll be missing out big time if you don't pick it up.			"

												This game is basically crazy fun. You and up to 3 other friends plan a heist to rob banks, buildings, passports all to escape the country. Despite what you might think, the story is fairly well thought out. The gameplay is top notch, with one catch. In the top down view, the mechanics still work on line of sight. So you might be walking round a corner into the room of heavily armored goons. This catch makes for many historical and hilarious Friday night playthroughs of this game as you will be playing this game for hours on end. I recommend this to anyone who love a good thrill and want to try something different.			"

Playing alone it's more like defusing a bomb slowly and methodically, but in multi (online or local) it becomes (theoretically) this synchronized masterplan where everybody does their bit to pull off the job. In practice you'll screw it up though and get to run around in panic, falling back to even worse plans... ""all right plan E: Ignore everything, just RUN!"" Unique playstyles with different characters and the slight randomization in the levels make this one quite replayable. It's also very comfortable to play with a gamepad.			"

												One of the few Indie games that I can say I enjoyed. Monaco is the perfect mix of Hotline Miami, and Payday. With a simple design, usual heist game plot, this game is easy to grasp, suitable for gamers and non-gamers alike.However, this game has it's fair share of problems. The new October update, is dissapointing. The Origin campaign, whilst giving more info on the characters, feels like the same mission every time. I feel... more cheated out of a good promise, rather than dissapointed. The ""Zonaco"" zombie mode, is, well the same campaign. Only with zombies. So no round based, team oriented survival mode, like I hoped for. Saves us the screamers online, I suppose. + Story is well written, despite it's repetative missions+ Co-Op is tackled well, but the campaign can be played regardless without a partner+ Replayability. I have barely taken a chunk out of this game.+ Story is split into 2 Acts.- The October update. - It's easy to find the quick way around a mission, however the game tackles punishment well.7/10. A fun, well made Indie game.  "

												Monaco is a rare must-have masterpiece that is beautifully crafted by Pocketwatch Games. The game follows the story of 8 crooks utilizing their unique assets and their assortment of weapons as they take back what is theirs. Monaco takes the player on a top down adventure and the path taken, a decision best left to your crooked ways. The art style and soundtrack lend to the game's exceptional theme and sense of class. Choose between single player or cross-platform multiplayer and play on a variety of campaign maps or challenge yourself with user created custom maps from the Steam Workshop. Worthy of note are the several major content updates that were free of charge. In an era where developers nickle and dime their fans, Pocketwatch Games is doing something right. I only wish that they would consider a sequel. Your Steam library may never be complete without this game.			"

												Alone, with your friends or even with random people, this is a game you must play! Monaco was by far one of the best experencias i had this year related to videogames - counitng only to what was relesed this year -. Almost everthing is perfect on this game, from the visuals, OST and the COOP. COOP on this game is the cherry on top of the cake. Monaco has some diversity missions such as, heist, saving someone or get alive from some place. Also contains 3 game modes; Enhanced, Classic and Zombies. Enhanced is shorter, more streamlined maps and will make a better and easy experience. Classic mode that is purist, hard to say. Now to class, some to choose and they are all great. Going to give some examples, The Cleaner, he can put enemies to sleep, is really hand when you find a room full of them. The Mole, funny character to use, he can breaks for almost any room really good to dig shortcut's. I think you got the point that character in Monaco are fun and useful to use. If you ever get bored of doing COOP and SP you have two options; PVP and creation mode. PVP is here you against another player ""fight"" to see who stole the intel first and can escape alive. Very fun game type. The creation mode is here you can make your own levels, case you have a nice imagination you may get feature in Monaco weekly/month workshop levels. Another thing i love in games and i especially love this on in Monaco is the OST, is brilliant, this gentleman Austin Wintory[austinwintory.bandcamp.com] made an awesome job here. The OST is so calm and fits very well in this game. - I advise you hear the full ost on that site - Now that you read my shout review, go buy this game and enjoy it! Totally worth your money! ~ 8/10			"

												A lot of people seem to be of the opinion that Monaco is only fun when played in Co-Op, and while it's true that the game is at its best in those kinds of frantic multiplayer games, I honestly think the single player version shines just as much-- it just feels like a totally different game. Whereas co-op in Monaco is all about laying out plans and watching them go horribly wrong --and the frantic, off-the-cuff attempts to coordinate efforts to salvage the heist-- in single player, its a slower, more calculated and tactical game, where your lone-wolf status makes heists incredibly tense. The heightened difficulty of launching these heists solo is undercut by the fact that you have multiple lives-- you can play as every member of the team in solo, which allows for players to die in an often advantageous way by allowing one's self to switch characters--  but it still brings a unique challenge to each of the masterfully designed levels. Throw in a killer piano soundtrack that lands somewhere between ragtime and vaudeville, an enjoyably executed (if slight) story that uses unreliable narration for clever effect, and a robust map-maker tool with countless community maps (to say nothing of the recently added 'zombie' mode, a word that normally makes me cringe due to the cultural oversaturation of zombies, but nonetheless makes for an enjoyable variation on the standard gameplay), and you have the most fun multiplayer game of the year.At the time I'm writing this, Monaco is $2.99 on a flash sale. I got it for 7.50, and I would've paid full price for it if I realized it would be this fun.			"

												Monaco. As I sit here in my palatial library, peering through my grimoire and other works, I note that I have not extended the pleasure of a review to the unwashed masses. Substantial evidence points to varying activities which have kept me from this world of opinion and unsubstantiated claim and counter-claim but now I return from the dead. Does it matter that Monaco, written by Neil Patrick Harris & Sylvester Stallone, has come out? Is this what has brought about my sudden return from pseudo-retirement? In all likelyhood, it is not. Monaco follows the journey of a band of thieves and crooks through the eponymous city of Monaco, Kentucky. Eugene Onion (Dwayne Johnson) is joined by Ribroast Jones (Ben Kingsley), Shia McBoof (Michael Sheen) and Michael ""Canned"" Meet (Daniel Day Lewis). The band makes their way from heist to heist never stopping to ponder the ""why"" or ""how"" of the entire situation. The Mise-en-scène denotes a chaotic and bizarre existance, punctuated extravagantly through the performance of Whoopi Goldberg as Goldberg.Who's to say whether or not this follow up to the 1923 movie, ""The Man with a Hat on his Head"" will take off, all I can say is that this is a whole new direction for Marvel to take the Batman franchise in.

Cause that is super realistic.Time by time, when you play the game, you unlock characters. Every one of them, has a special abillity.For example:-Lockpicker= He can unlock things very quickly.-The cleaner= He can hit enemies-The Mole= He can crush through wallsAnd many more...So far I played like.. 1-2 hours or less, and I liked the game from the start.Here are the things WHY is this game awesome:-Good Graphics-Awesome Gameplay-Good Physics [movement, actions]-Sounds [Example: When you use a computer, it makes a sound of: ''Writing or typing, on a keyboard''-Addictive Storyline/Gameplay-You can hide in bushes and trees! Lmfao-Great characters-Extermely FunBad things about this game:-None.-Just If you don't like pixely and robbing games.. this isn't for you xDDIt's worth buying, doe I didn't buy, I got it as a gift, But BUY UNTIL THE DAILY DEAL LASTS!!!!!!!!

												Monaco... a game I got and played with friends ages ago but didn't enjoy as much as I wish I could. As much as I thought I'd enjoy it on the outset I found the content of the game itself rather... disappointing. Let me tell you a tale:You watch the trailers, you see the tags (Like ""Stealth"", and ""Heist""), and screenshots and you think to yourself, rightly so - ""ah, this is a stealth game"". You then buy the game, and as you start making your way through the game, solo or with friends, you find that that there are various mechanics that help you sneak past guards and such, and overall the ideas presented from those scenarios and abilities allow for unique ways of approaching your stealth. Then you and your friends notice the leader boards for levels... and see that the top scores... somehow managed to do it in seconds?Here is the problem: You are given all these tools, all these characters with unique designs and abilities, which altogether help to make an interesting apporach to a stealth heist. However, you then realise the following - it is much easy, efficient, and high scoring to simply run through the entire level, alerting everything as you do so, completing the objective and collecting coins and just escaping. Put simply - you are given lots of tools, but none of them are more efficient than just blitzing your way through the level.Hence, the reason why I didn't enjoy it was because it was misleading, not to say that blitzing your way through isn't fun, I kind of enjoyed it, for a while anyway. However I came to and bought this game with the intention of a stealth game. Maybe if the game atleast sort of told you that this was another way to approach then maybe it would've been fine, but with such misleading trailers and unfortunately, good and unique mechanics that are overshadowed by simply running all over the place, makes me glad I was able to refund this game.

												It takes less than 1 map to realize Monaco is a unique indie/strat/action/stealth game lol seriously, monaco may not look flashy or may even make you look away due to its graphics and artwork, but dont be fooled! Monaco is creative, its entertaining, will make you think about your move, will let you pick what class better suits your playstyle and immeadiatly you will understand why it looks the way it does...Like Home, frozen synapse and FTL, Monaco, shows unique features while keeping the indie characteristics we love.It is the simpler yet still awesome version of payday. Different classes, cleaning up banks etc. You can play it online or in lan or alone. Definetly recommend it, not only to indie fans, but to stealth top view fans or strat game fans. Its a simple challenging and rewarding game,  where fun can be extracted within seconds of opening it.			"

												A top-down retro-styled thief 'em up, Monaco has a delightful soundtrack and makes a fun co-op game with the right people. By yourself you may find yourself playing far more cautiously and conservatively, fully exploiting the bag of tricks provided to you, but Monaco is at its most fun with 3 friends played as a hectic anything goes heist.Difficulty curve for solo players may provide quite steep at times, especially the need to 'clear out' levels to advance the more interesting plot (which is well worth exploring right to the end to fully appreciate the whole story), while co-op with randoms is, as expected, a hit-or-miss experience.

Playing online can be irritating sometimes because there are a lot of morons and trolls. Plus, some of the missions are a tad too challenging. Otherwise, Monaco is a very original game that I recommend to anyone who is up for a challenge.			"

Giving you an urge to try again when you die, and lots of pleasure when you succeed.The multiplayer is also very fun. Although finding servers for specific levels can take awhile, I haven't met any here who's especially mean. This game has a great community.Even if you play in singleplayer, this game will provide endless hours of entertainment, although not as chaotic as 4-player co-op. This game is amazing!			"

												This game is very fun and requires team work to complete the missions.There are several classes to choose from. One has the ability to put enemies to sleep for 30-60 seconds if they are not alerted. (sneak up on them). Another can ""charm"" her way into tricking one enemy to help with opening doors, etc. Another can break through walls (great for bypassing doors that are locked, especially double locked doors). Another can hack security systems and outlets to open doors and stuff.At first it looks like a crappy little 2d top view game, but once you get into it, it's much more than that.			"

												Monaco is a stealth heist caper played from a topdown perspective, with a heavy emphasis on line-of-sight and moment-to-moment tactical planning in action. The colours and iconography are bold and lend themselves perfectly to the instant recognition needed as your eyes scan around your character constantly looking for your next move. Levels are fantastically designed and it's currently a joy to play in both single player and multiplayer (where the game really shines).			"

												Monaco is an excellent 4-player co-op game that offers a unique blend of action and puzzle solving. If you're confused by what you're seeing in the store, don't be alarmed. The screenshots and videos don't do this game justice; you have to actually play the game for a bit to get a feeling for what's going on. All that color and chaos comes together nicely when you're playing.Monaco is decent entertainment as a single-player game, but the single-player game is best used to get familiar with each character at your own speed. Where Monaco really shines is when you get 2-4 people together in co-op mode. Different characters' abilities complement each other in surprising ways, and strategies emerge that simply aren't possible in solo play. Figuring out how to combine different characters' abilities to meet the unique challenges that each level presents is half the fun. If you don't have Steam friends to play with, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the Monaco community. This is a group that really likes to cooperate, and is patient with new players. The patient, cooperative play style of Monaco appeals to more mature gamers, and the public community really reflects that.I enthusiastically recommend Monaco. It’s a blast. "

												4/5More fun than a boat full of criminals.Monaco is a hide and stealth type heist game.  There are 8 characters to choose from, all with their own skills.  You spend your time sneaking around guards, hacking computers, opening vaults and stealing assets.Fun story, Lots of levels!  you can even make your own and upload them for others to play.Single player is challanging and fun.  Multi-player can range from ""Epic"" to ""All hell has broken loose"".  If you buy the game, you have to try multi-player at least once. It is so much fun, and has a great voice chat system.There is a Zombie mode as well...Monaco is one of those games I would buy for all of my friends to enjoy.			"

												Summary: Heist simulator 2013Multiplayer: 4Completion: 5 hrsCards: YesCloud: YesWhen you were a kid, were you ever dragged to a social gathering and had nothing fun to do there? Monaco is the game I wish I had when I was growing up and taken to play party games with other people.In Monaco you assemble a team of specialized thieves intent on stealing goods and getting away with it. You have very limited tools to handle opposition, so you must stealth your way to the goods, grab it, and run like hell. It's pretty much as it sounds.The graphics have a rather simplistic look. They're serviceable, though the saturated palette can make it hard to see things, and is sometimes hard on the eyes. Music is also serviceable. It goes for a sort of ragtime feel, like watching a black and white film.Gameplay involves a top-down view of the area, much like looking at a blueprint, with security guards whose attention span could give MGS Genome Soldiers a run for their money. Electronic traps and security cameras also seek to alert your presence, but you can disable these should you find their terminal.If there's one thing Monaco does well, its promote teamwork. The character roles are so different and specialized that the more people you have the better your chances are of pulling this off... provided you work together.If there's one thing I would like to add to the game, it's having AI party members. I can't always get a party of four, and so I would like to have some meatshiel- I mean scapegoa- I mean accomplices to assist me in my solo capers.While Monaco isn't the kind of game I would replay for days on end, it does make a fantastic occasional party game. Sure beats playing most board games. I give Monaco a 7.5/10 Thanks spleeno!			"

												There is honor among thieves in Monaco. That is, until you want what they have. Witness the story of eight skilled criminals as you take part in each step of every heist leading to the thrilling conclusion. Challange yourself to solo play, or take up to a party of four, weaving around sensors and guards in search for the ever longed for rewards on each stage.Each map can be played completely differently every time depending on number of members, classes, and paths taken. Take the ultimate challenge in the alternate storyline and avoid being knocked out.Help your fellow criminals pull off the heist of a lifetime, but remember, when it all comes down to it, what's yours is mine.

												A top-down retro-styled thief 'em up, Monaco has a delightful soundtrack and makes a fun co-op game with the right people. By yourself you may find yourself playing far more cautiously and conservatively, fully exploiting the bag of tricks provided to you, but Monaco is at its most fun with 3 friends played as a hectic anything goes heist.Difficulty curve for solo players may provide quite steep at times, especially the need to 'clear out' levels to advance the more interesting plot (which is well worth exploring right to the end to fully appreciate the whole story), while co-op with randoms is, as expected, a hit-or-miss experience.

												A slick-looking heist simulator! Classes with different abilities! I thought it was going to be really deep, and while I imagine there are depths to be found for players with greater skill than mine, in actual play the game is less about an intricate plan tailored to your character's strengths than it is a madcap scramble to recover after the mission inevitably goes awry. In other words, make sure you play this with a friend or two, and make sure their level of incompetence matches your own.			"

												Great game! Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is one which has had me spending hours at a time beating the crap out of gendarme, smoking the heck out of innocent(but nonetheless annoying) civilians, and pushing about the mangled corpses of security guards. Monaco really allows one to explore different gameplay methods and tactics when it comes to taking on the challenges each level sets for you. Wonderful music from wonderful singers, and the art style never gets boring. Multiplayer is also excellent when playing with friends, the system is very easy to understand and use. Sadly, there are hardly any players to play with via multiplayer. Monaco has also taught me quite some bit of french. J'aime le français!8/10			"

												Break into the building, steal the things, and get out without raising the alarm. Sounds mediocre, right? WRONG. Monaco is a fantastic game, and that fact become clear immediately upon starting up. The gameplay is much like what I just described, but with a style all its own that I cannot say I have ever seen in anything else. It's totally unique, and that style pervades every element of Monaco. The music and artwork truly shine (This is one of the few indie soundtracks that I went out and bought, to bring credence to that fact.)Alone, it's great fun, but the developers had the foresight to add in a multiplayer co-op mode- this instantly pushed a good game to great. The online chaos that may ensue, or the local co-op  madness (If you have spare controllers or keyboards) are nearly reminiscent of the great Nintendo multiplayer experiences of yore. So, if you have the money to spend, get this. You won't regret it.			"

												Superb music, vibrant colors, and superb gameplay makes Monaco one of the best indie games i've played in 2013. Multiple classes, and the ability to play as any of them to clear a level,  adds replayability as you try to beat the clock or clear all the loot on each level. Monaco's multiplayer makes it even greater. The game is hectic as everyone tries to combine their individual skills to complete the game. While it's online multiplayer isn't the liveliest, the local co-op allows your for your friends and families to easily join in the fun. In short, this game is a real gem. "

The music and artwork truly shine (This is one of the few indie soundtracks that I went out and bought, to bring credence to that fact.)Alone, it's great fun, but the developers had the foresight to add in a multiplayer co-op mode- this instantly pushed a good game to great. The online chaos that may ensue, or the local co-op  madness (If you have spare controllers or keyboards) are nearly reminiscent of the great Nintendo multiplayer experiences of yore. So, if you have the money to spend, get this. You won't regret it.			"

												Great game! Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is one which has had me spending hours at a time beating the crap out of gendarme, smoking the heck out of innocent(but nonetheless annoying) civilians, and pushing about the mangled corpses of security guards. Monaco really allows one to explore different gameplay methods and tactics when it comes to taking on the challenges each level sets for you. Wonderful music from wonderful singers, and the art style never gets boring. Multiplayer is also excellent when playing with friends, the system is very easy to understand and use. Sadly, there are hardly any players to play with via multiplayer. Monaco has also taught me quite some bit of french. J'aime le français!8/10			"

												Monaco is a fantastic game whether you play single player or co-op. The levels vary in difficulty and can be challenging, but still fun. The variety in charcaters and their ablities means any type of person can find a character they like. Replay value is high, with leaderboards pushing you to get a top time. A definite buy so go get a 4-pack and play it with some friends. 9.5/10			"

												I was part of the core group of beta testers for this game and even have my name appearing in its credits. I invested dozens of hours into the work-in-progress version of the game and thoroughly enjoyed it. The premise is theft - and you can choose from a handful of different character classes that all possess unique abilities to to pull off a successful theft (the ability to smash through walls, hack into security systems, assassinate guards, pose as guards and more). The game affords for hilarious, whimsical encounters as one progresses through a map collecting treasures that all play into a single narrative or over-arching storyline. If you are a fan of robbery/theft films and games, you'll enjoy Monaco.			"

In that sense, it's a lot like Hotline Miami. The classes all feel different, but you could use any combination and still pull off a mission.The music is PERFECT. Stealth music instantly and seamlessly transitions to chase music the second you're discovered, which is simply a joy from a visceral and gameplay perspective.I could go on about this game forever. Buy it! Highly recommended!!!			"

												Was cool for a while. I put 15 hours into it because over the years I kept reinstalling it and having to redo all the missions. It is fun and not very hard playing alone until you get to a massive difficulty spike in the next to last thief mission where it is strikingly apparant that this game was meant to mainly be a co-op/multiplayer game. In which you won't find anyone to connect to online because it's so old, so either search the forums for someone to play with or have a friend that also has the game. Also, if you do play co-op or mp, voice chat is basically a must. Without voice communication to closely work together, it will be a mess. I mean missions are certainly doable just fine without it but the game is a much, much more fun experience if you can communicate with voice.6/10 okay for a while			"

												Monaco is a great looking artsy game with a great concept and, to a certain extent, this concept works out very well. More in singleplayer than multiplayer. Think of Monaco as a 1-4 player(s) Pacman-like heist game; collect as many coins as you can, grab some loot and then make a run for it. Sounds great, doesn't it ? Yes, as a concept. In reality it could've been so much better. Let me try to explain.First of all, I've been waiting for this game to be released for a long time, and now that it has finally been released I can't help but feel disappointed. Why ? Because in co-op the game is just so damn hectic and it's hard to see your location or any location for that matter. There are no instructions on how to use your character and their abilities properly. You can see why that's distracting when you're playing with other people. Your partners have certain expectations and instead of actually helping you're running around making it look like you know what you're doing. But you actually don't know. People (including yourself) will ragequit because of this. They're unforgiving. Sure, not everyone, but a lot of my games have ended that way. Also, the AI is a bit random from time to time, so there's no right way to finish a level. You need a bit of strategy and also a whole lot of luck. One thing that could instantly make this game better is by simply increasing your field of vision, giving you a better sight while walking around, and giving you more of an idea on what to do next.The single-player mode is thankfully less hectic, but still doesn't really teach you how to use your abilities properly. In single-player you can't get resurrected (obviously) so, instead, you have a certain amount of lives. Die and you can't use that character anymore and this continues until you run out of characters (i.e. lives).Now, on the other hand, Monaco has more than enough content and some missions should take you over 30 minutes to finish. They can certainly be fun while playing with  a group of friends.This little review does make it look like I hate it, but I really don't. I truly like this game, I just wish it was better on certain fronts, or maybe a bit more open to get rid of the chaos entirely. Make sure you give it a spin if you have a group of friends who you can communicate with, that should certainly help.[Rating: 80/100]			"

												Very fun game, alone or with friends. It's simple, yet complex at the same time- And each mission is unique, so you won't feel like you are repeating the same thing over and over again, and with each different class means a different way of finishing the mission! No matter your skill, It gets harder as you go along, so you're guaranteed to face a challenge at some point. As for faults, personally, if any, is going to have to be with Multiplayer. Anybody can join, beginners or advanced, so each time is different. But, it lacks challenge. A team-member can be reckless and set off all the guards and what not, or everyone can go off and do their own thing, and the mission can still be completed, I wish it could be more along the lines of, one wrong move and your entire mission will fail, hence forcing teamwork. Other than that, I'd give the game 4/5 stars.			"

The map designs and workshop ability allows for fun packed gameplay for a long lasting time, and if you get bored... try a different class, most act differently to others as I found of playing as 'The Redhead' rather than my common 'Lookout' class. I really enjoyed the brief period of time I had on here, but overall it was a really fun game to pick up in the sales.			"

This is the overall reason for me being shamwowed by the judges badonka donk after the part time security guards latched me to a subway car and sent me down to the station. Monaco is a fantasmic game about litterally stealing from every place robbers shouldn't be stealing from; Hospitals, Embassies, and even hotels. The creators of this game are hands down the smartest people on this planet, because I would have never thought to rob a hospital for a quick buck. 10/10 would rob again.			"

												Crime through teamwork. The only way to do it efficiently and successfully is to work together and use your abilities. Committing crime has never been so much fun (and safe) as it is in Monaco! Unless you die and then you have to be revived by a teammate if that's possible at the time. Nevertheless, this game is definitely worth it and playing online with others as you craft a strategy is even more enjoyable. Monaco FTW! "

												Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is heck of a fun little game.  It follows the story of four (and later more) bandits on their quest to flee the country.  How?  By doing what they do best, stealing and thievin'.  It has very unique art style, in pixelatted goodness, and uses a top-down view, which allows you for better planning in the heists you will be making.  The game has you select different characters to pull these off.  Each character has its own assets and they are all very unique.  You will need to use their different abilities to collect money and other collectibles and complete a variety of missions.  You can play this game offline or with friends in a four player online co-op game, which is the has its assets and its disadvantages.  Alone you only have the benefits of a single character skill, but you are less likely to be caught, so the way you play really suits your style.  It has a great number of missions in the main campaign, to which is added another campaign of harder difficulty, PvP maps where you can duke it out against others online to see who can collect the most treasure or kill the opponent(s) first, to which are added other levels that explain the origins of the characters through score-attack like levels.  The game can even be played in whole in ""Zombie mode"", where the whole game has not only a zombie skin change, but the characters have different abilities too.  And finally, the integration of custom maps made by the users only make Monaco a potential source of infinite fun.  I highly recommend it.			"

												I bought this game because it was on sale and looked fairly unique, but I wasn't expecting very much. I was wrong. This game is one of the best buys I've made during my time on steam. The trailer's don't necessarily do the graphics justice, which have really clear visuals, and a minimalistic, but aesthetically pleasing neon art style. The soundtrack is also killer, capturing the perfect tone. The gameplay is fantastic, akin to pacman with stealth, guns, and laser-rigged security systems. There is little in the way of tutorial, so you are left to experiment for yourself,but that works well for this for this game, which has you balance careful planning, against quick thinking and resourcefulness for when things go wrong. The plot was also pretty fresh, while nodding to tropes within the heist genre. The game offers a lot of replayability too, as though the single player is fun and carries the game by itself, the multiplayer enables you to play with others to try and try to grab everything and get out as fast as possible. In addition to this, the community is pretty good, and new levels are often being made. Of course, no game is perfect, and if I had to say something, it would be that though the plot was great, it was advanced sparingly from mission to mission. If story is what you look for in a game, this may not be the game for you. Also, although you don't have to collect every coin to ""win"" a mission, if the coins are ignored some missions lose a lot of challenge, especially as on some earlier missions the number of lives you have is fairly generous. However, there are a lot of levels (3 parallel campaigns, with a 4th coming out soon, as well as zombie mode), so this would only bother those exceptionally impatient people who can't wait to unlock the later levels, which are extraordinarily challenging, even if you don't collect the coins!I would definitely give this game a 10/10 as it stands, and am very excited to play the new content which is coming out this year			"

												In short, this game is about Heist. Get in, Rob, Get Out.It's long after I played Monaco with my friends (4 players Co-Op of course, that was a blast!)I decided to give a review, so apologize for any things I may forgot to mention below :By far, Monaco as an Indie game has great, solid, satisfying Coop experience. Team up with four players and break through buildings to sweep all shiny things you see. And four players can wreak havoc entire building, alerting every guards to chase you down. It's all the hilarous things popping out at every moment. One small misstep and the place will turn into chaos.Gameplay, Characters : You are a robber who steal stuffs in the city of Monaco. Like other heist games, this game requires avoiding guards patrolling here and there, stealing things, open doors, and hide in bushes. When played single player, this game have several lives which when the one you chose die, other characters show up to be picked again. So in total there are 8 characters, meaning you have 8 lives to do the single player campaign (Which I will say quite easy to do just a run, but not when doing a perfect one). Multiplayer, this is where the fun comes from. Up to four players, at the same time sneaking into a building filled with psychopath guards (there're psycho doctors too, hope this game doesn't change your perception), lasers, and... if I remember correctly, there are cats and dogs too, meowing and barking to alert the psychos. Four players, I have to admit, is less strategic than single player, if not pre-planned first. One player can cause havoc in one section, while others, panicking by the alerts, cause much more chaos and the whole place is about hit & run till you cut off from the guard's sight or die. And that's where the fun lies, saving your dead friend while being chased and shot by guards.Characters, there are 8 total characters to play with, 4 starting characters each with unique abilities. One can open locks fast, one can seek out guards on the map, one can loot coins automatically, and else. They're fun in their own ways.Controls, Mechanics, AIs : Pretty solid, and simple controls to handle. Only WASD to move and a mouse to aim & shoot the baddies along the way. Weapons are also fun to play with, shotgun can kill multiple enemies, a bomb can blow up a place in certain radius, health kit can restore half of your life upon use, and tranquilizer to make enemies sleep. Mechanics are pretty good and well-thought. You can plan a whole stealthy, sneaky robbery, or do an all-out rampage, taking everything in the path while escaping as soon as possible. AIs are also creative, chasing you down all the way until you die, or you can sneak behind them, leaving question marks along the way.Levels, Difficulties, Maps : Very creative, and the levels are designed in a way that you might be involved in a heist film. Hide into a bush, getting sneaky, turn off the lasers and lights. There are so many things to play with before the robbery happens and the grand escape begins. Difficulty-wise, the pacing is perfect for a heist game. While I did have to retry a few times at the first act, after knowing the mechanics of the AI, the rest of the act is about executing and improving your heist skills.Story : I didn't read the story though, I skipped all the dialogues, so yeah I'll skip this one. But it's quite interesting and easy to pick-up.Music : Loved the theme song, and the Discotheque Rouge (If I'm not wrong) level. Musics are catchy like actual heist movies, and they are French-themed, so they're unique in French ways. Cons : So far haven't found any cons, only that the difficulty curve at the start is probably a bit high (I haven't played any heist games, so that should be counted as a factor too)Tl;dr, get this game with your other 3 friends. Break into buildings, one by one and make chaos all over Monaco! 100% Fun and laughter guaranteed!!			"

												This is a really good game.  It's a top down sneak game with a wide array of characters to choose from.  You play a few levels and it's really easy, and you think ""oh, this'll be an easy 100%.""Wrong.  There are over 30 levels to complete, and about halfway it starts to ramp up the difficulty.  Guards are everywhere, lasers are everywhere, trip lasers are everywhere, and then later all the lasers have shotguns on them (not kidding.)  Towards the end the difficulty is ramped up so high it's just brutal.But it's a good kind of difficulty.  You can't just barrel your way through the game and then get mad when it punishes you.  If you take things slow, plan out your course of action, then even the hardest levels are posssible.8/10There are some sneak elements that're missing but overall a very satisfying game.			"

												Excerpt from the handbook of The Security Professionals Association of Monaco:""Dear future security officer, congratulations on choosing one of today's most exciting career opportunities in the Principality of Monaco. You are about to embark on an adventure unlike any other: guarding the wealth of some of the most powerful and famous people on the planet. Here are some useful guidelines to performing your job at the level of excellence and thoroughness that our customers have come to expect of us:- If you should face the possibility of dealing with an intruder, take a few seconds to make extra sure that it wasn't nothing. It was probably nothing.- If you are absolutely certain that you have spotted an intruder, but then lose track, don't feel too bad, somebody else has probably taken care of it.- If you should suddenly remember being in a firefight and losing sight of intruders mere moments ago - calm down. Go back to your post, and if you should see something again: remember rule #1.- Now for the most important rule: potted plants are sacred and must never be disturbed or looked at.- Do you think you saw somebody walk behind a potted plant? Maybe even four people? Do you think that you could find out for sure if you just, you know, looked at the plant? WELL TOUGH LUCK, DUMBASS, YOU HAD BETTER MADE ABSOLUTELY SURE FIRST SO GO BACK AND DO YOUR DUTY.- Somebody tried to hide behind a potted plant while you were in a firefight and you're absolutely 100% completely sure he is still there? FINE. SHOOT AT THE PLANT. See how you feel about it when we cut your paycheck, vacation and transfer you to guarding the basement toilets for the next 30 years, PLANTKILLER.- Also sacred? VENTS. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT MESS WITH THE VENTS. If an intruder is going inside a vent, DO NOT PURSUE. DO NOT SHOOT AT THE VENT. Do you know how to fix a vent? Cause I sure don't. SO DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING CAUSE ALL OF US TO SUFFOCATE BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PLAY THE HERO.- Finally, if you happen to shoot an intruder, do. not. touch. the. body. You probably didn't attend any biology classes so allow me to break it down for you: dead bodies carry HORRIBLE TERRIBLE DISEASES. Leave them exactly where they drop and return to your station immediately. Somebody better equipped to handle the situation than your plant-killing vent-shooting♥♥♥♥♥is surely going to come and take care of it. We have found that bodies have a tendency to disappear more quickly when left unattended.With these simple guidelines you should have a blast in your new job! In light of recent unexpected mortality spikes we hope that you understand that we had to revoke all life insurance policies for new employees.""[[On a more serious note, if you have a bunch of friends to play then Monaco is a funny, challenging and surprisingly complex co-op heist game, featuring a nice soundtrack and multiple free expansions.]]			"

												This is a game that truly shines in the co-op multiplayer, especially while playing locally or on a LAN. Each level in this game starts out as Ocean's Eleven, but can quickly turn into Boondock Saints.  Success depends upon a combination of coordination and improvisation, as well as clever use of the distinct characters and their unique abilities. Single-player can also provide its own challenges, as you have fewer ""tools"" with your team of one.After three years of development, this is an indie game that exhibits a lot of polish. From the intuitive implemenation of stealth to the clever level design to the fast-paced music, it's easy to see why Monaco won multiple awards at the Independent Games Festival in 2010. It plays well with a keyboard or controller and with Steam Workshop, there is an endless amount of content, from tutorials to PvP arenas.Also: trading cards.			"

												Monaco is a game that’s as much about thinking on your feet as it is about stealth and forward planning, and regardless of whether you’re after a fun co-op game for four people, or something to speedrun to impress people on YouTube, I daresay there’s something here for everyone thanks to its focus on sheer entertainment. It’s exquisitely pieced together in almost every way, it lets you play in a variety of different ways and challenges you to think outside the box, and I can’t imagine anyone that could fail to be taken in by its charms.Monaco is a fantastic and unique take on the stealth genre and a showcase of excellent design, and you should make it yours. Not getting your hands on this would be a crime.			"

												At first I didn't really 'get' this game or why it was so good. I didn't care about the co-op either, as I figured playing with random people wouldn't be great. Then I found myself playing it all weekend and absolutely loving it, and hugely enjoying co-op with random people as well.It seems really simple at first, but the game has a lot of depth. You start to realise how many options you have for dealing with the levels, and the levels go from the trivial opening ones to incredibly difficult end ones. The middle levels are wonderful and the later levels are a huge challenge. A good co-op team can help but isn't required.The people playing the game are properly into it and everyone seems to intuitively understand what each other is doing, and it's a lot of fun.Highly recommended!

												Monaco is a great co-op dungeon run. Or maybe you could compare it favorably to Left 4 Dead. It's a great game.There's no accumulation of loot like you find in MMOs or ARPGs, but this is a feature, not a flaw. Since everyone starts equally, it's easier to pull people into a game at any given time. You don't have to worry about whether your character is too high a level or too low a level, or whether you have the ""proper"" gear. You just get get up to 4 people together and just do it.It has a forgiving ""death"" mode, much like Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, or Guild Wars 2. When playing with friends, if you are downed, you can be recovered by another player. As long as one person is still alive, the game continues!It also has several different modes of success. You can just try to complete the level. You can try to clean it out entirely. Or you can try to do both of the above against the clock. For the hardcore, speedruns may be their thing. For the more casual player, survival might be the challenge. And there are different versions/difficulties of each of the levels, so unlocking those is another potential goal. And of course there are ""cheevos"" through Steam for doing other silly things. So there's a lot to aim for with this game.The graphics are stylish, the music is perfect, and the dialogue witty. My only criticism is that it's a little hard to figure out the ""ring"" of indicators surrounding your character. Parsing that data is hard with all of the other visual distractions on the screen at any given time. But by the time you learn 'em, it's mostly moot. At that point you will probably have enough experience with the game not to need 'em too much.And the price? Cheap! I highly recommend this game.			"

												Whats yours is mine, and whats on offer here is a simple concept, done really well, provides a lot of entertainment, and is all about the multiplayer.  Monaco flys under the radar for a lot of people as it isn't a big name title, and doesnt pretend to be, but the number of different ways you can play the game using different characters with different skills mean there is no right or wrong way to get through the game, although inevitably people will find their own style of play.  Playing with friends is where this excels.  Those moments when someone gets caught and dies in a really stupid place full of laser beams and guards and then trying to come in with a plan to create enough of a distraction for someone to get in and revive them is so much fun.  If you dont have this and see it on offer for under  £2, buy a few copies for your mates, and it will easily repay it with the entertainment time it gives you back.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine a game developed by Pocketwatch Games is an absolute masterpiece, I have been following this game since the day it was announced a couple of years back, and from the time I played it when it first came out to now, I must say that the game has really changed, adding more and more features into the game. Kinda reminds me of Thief but top-down and more comical than the dark Thief. An absolute masterpiece and at a very cheap price (Free Weekend) and best of all, it is best played with your friends!What's mine is yours, and Monaco is mine!

												So earlier on in the spring, I purchased Monaco for 4 dollars because I needed a break from Skyrim. It is one of those rare indy games that comes around that realizes the best way to reward a player is by cleverness rather than trial and error. It's a game of actual skill and challenge rather than merely repetition and memorization. If I'd known how good it was going to be, I would have bought it at full price.Monaco is a stealth co-op game where you play a team of 8 thieves in vibrant colors. Together, they work to pull off a heist at Monte Carlo, the largest casino in the world. The world takes place in the actual city of Monaco, which has been stylized in a sort of retro look. Oddly enough, the game actually resembles the city at night. Just an interesting side note there. Anyway, each of the 8 thieves has particular talents which are used to work together with other players. The objective in each mission is varieties of rescuing a team member, collect a bunch of trophies, or just try to make a quick getaway in the van.Technically, you do not need to play multiplayer to progress, but it's highly recommended for new players as Monaco is significantly easier with three extra pairs of hands. If you do desire to player it single player, I would recommend looking into some player made tutorial missions that'll tell you everything you need to know.If there's any kind of nitpicking I could have about Monaco, it's that combat is just a major waste of time(unless you are playing in Zombie Mode). When you pick up a gun, you only get one shot and it takes ten coins to get one extra shot of ammo. Most floors in a level have 50 coins on average and there's about 2-3 floors per level. That means you're looking at maybe 10 shots at best...unless you're playing in multiplayer. Only then do things get really antagonistic as four thieves are competing for coins when cleaning out places.To top that off, even if you do collect all the coins on your own, you'll often find yourself outnumbered and outgunned by guards and civilians and they can all resurrect each other...so there's no real point to the weapons except to buy for more time. For some people who like the option of blasting through everyone who gets in their way, this may be a bit of a turnoff. I don't personally mind it however, because combat is not the focus of Monaco. It's about the caper, the chase, the theft. If you are looking for mindless slaughtering, check out the Zombie Mode. Zombie Mode makes you get twice as much ammo for the coins you collect and even gives the cleaner an one hit kill sneak attack.Complaints about combat aside, what makes a stealth co-op game like Monaco fun is that you're not scored based on how carefully you stealth. The truth of the matter is security gets so beefed up in the late game that even if you were the greatest cat burglar in the world, you're still eventually going to get caught. But that's part of what makes it so exciting when four thieves are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, collecting all the coins, dodging guards and turret fire while desperately trying to resurrect one another. It's the chaotic elements they add that make it stand out as a stealth game and once you get used to the mechanics on hiding and sneaking, then the game just starts to challenge you.One recommendation I would say if you choose to buy this is don't play this game for longer than 2 or 3 missions per day. Monaco is like a good wine--great for savouring but not so much for consuming. If you do power through it, the novelty will start to wear off fast and you'll just wind up burning out. There's enough enjoyment from getting 100% coins and no deaths with a competent team of friends in a single mission than teabagging every noob you see in a triple A shooter. It's a game that's all about quality over quantity.These reasons are all that what makes Monaco a game that totally deserves your attention because it's the indy game of early 2014 that most deserves to be played. They just finished up the last patch on it and it's available on steam for 5 bucks. So stop reading this, go to the store and buy this already. In the meantime, I have more time to play as the Gentleman. :)			"

												This is a really good game.  It's a top down sneak game with a wide array of characters to choose from.  You play a few levels and it's really easy, and you think ""oh, this'll be an easy 100%.""Wrong.  There are over 30 levels to complete, and about halfway it starts to ramp up the difficulty.  Guards are everywhere, lasers are everywhere, trip lasers are everywhere, and then later all the lasers have shotguns on them (not kidding.)  Towards the end the difficulty is ramped up so high it's just brutal.But it's a good kind of difficulty.  You can't just barrel your way through the game and then get mad when it punishes you.  If you take things slow, plan out your course of action, then even the hardest levels are posssible.8/10There are some sneak elements that're missing but overall a very satisfying game.			"

												After viewing the trailer for this game I wasn't exactly sure what I thought, it looked like it would be fun or it could be a horrible clunky mess of a game. After taking a gamble on this game I was not disappointed. I have not played many top down stealth games which have run this smoothly or been this much fun. The story, as minimalist as it is, is surprisingly engaging as well. If you're a fan of local coop and like playing games in the same room as your friends this game should probably be on your shortlist of must haves.			"

												I cannot say enough praise for this game. Not only do I enjoy it, I recommend it to everyone I know. Most games get boring after you beat them, but Monaco just stays fun by allowing you to try it different ways, with different characters, making it a game you can play multiple times. And multiplayer is great (assuming no one lags too badly) since you can have more fun, knowing that someone's got your back. Even the story is great, as I was truly enthralled in it. As of right now, I'm working on the achievments, which have never felt more rewarding. I cannot recommend this enough.			"

												The game is really chaotic, but by the time it's understandable, how to play it.Sometimes, I was getting lags (maybe also generally because of host) and at some action (it could be because of something of my computer, not by the game).Often it was hard to connect on some server and sometimes I was disconnected from the server, because the game was ended by the host during the playing/game...I wouldn't pay for that game.Somebody likes these types of games, but someone doesn't enjoy these types of games.I just tried this game. Also, it's not such a bad game.You can choose there of some other specific characters (with/for whom You'll play current game)  and modes.There are a lot of sorts of maps and functions.There is also single-player mode and also multiplayer mode, so You can play alone or also with other players and your friends......etc.·˙_____________________________________________˙·.*Edit [7. april 2014 - 3:15 PM]     Over time I have changed my opinion at this game. Who loves these types of the games, then it's great game with lots of functions.Also, You can try 'tutorial' in the game, through which are explained specific functions of characters.*Edit [24. november 2016 - 4:05 PM]Corrected a few grammar mistakes.

												A really original take on a video game: case da joint, sneak past the guards, h4xx0r the alarms, and get away with the loot.  The variety in obstacles and powers to overcome them is good, though I think that some characters seem underpowered compared to their fellows.I like that it's designed with single and multi-player in mind, but think that the single-player is a bit too frustrating.  It really ought to let you swap out characters during the level if you're playing by yourself.  As it is, you only get to use a new guy if your current one dies.  I've yet to actually suicide in order to do this, but close.  There are definitely spots where it gets tough in the later levels, and sneaking by solo is all but impossible.  If you want to grab everything, you may wind up brute-forcing an unpleasant amount of stuff.Haven't tried out the multiplayer to date.			"

												Monaco: A really well-rounded stealth game.The game follows the lives of a band of criminals in Monaco. Main story points are made at the beginning of each level, so don't just skip straight past it on your first play through.The gameplay is very good and it is well balanced between the Stealthy parts and the parts that may require a more brute force approach. There is also a wealth of tools for you to use whihc lets you customize your gameplay to whichever style you prefer.The control scheme works very well, I have tested with a controller & keyboard/mouse. The levels in-game give a good explanation of how to use the controls.There is a surprising amount of detail in the environments, given that it's a 2D top down pixel style. Worthy of note is the lighting algorithm, which limits your line of view depending on where you are in a level.The sound and music involved are very good. Not too over the top, and it suits the stealth aspect of the game very well.There is a wide array of workshop content, and included is a simple & easy to use level editor.I have not yet tested the multiplayer or the pvp aspect of the game, so I cannot comment on it.While playing this game I found no major bugs, or minor bugs for that matter.Definitely try this game if you like platformers in the stealth genre. It should give you a few good hours of gameplay for the main gampaign acts, more if you try to get 100% completion on each level.			"

												Monaco is an incredibly varied game with very simple game mechanism. It’s actually quite staggering with how much you can get done and nuanceful (that’s a real word I am sure) your game play can be with so few commands at your disposal. It’s nothing short of brilliant. It also makes its very approachable and in all probability resulted in 8 different character classes rather than one multitalented one and too, is very cool since it opens up a nice setting for very fun multiplayer games that rely heavily on co-op to get things done efficiently. And with a game play as smooth as Monaco's it really is a treat!So what type of game is it? It’s a stealth action planning coop game where you collect treasure, whack out baddies and hide in the bushes. Occasionally when things go wrong and might have to put the shotgun on the table and some cleaning. The game has a top down view, you have a field of vision (opponents too) and you can see most of the buildings layoutes once you have explored them. You move around with arrow keys and with the help of different character you can go through walls, pick locks or hack computers etc. Your goal is get through security and fine the ""cake"". For me it’s the coop that really shines since you can have your buddies set up different scenarios or organize traps for the baddies and it’s just a lot of fun.  It’s also the type of game you can easily play with your girlfriend!9/10 in my book. "

												Monaco is a top-down heist game where you choose one of four characters (with an additional four unlocked as the story progresses), break out of prison, and then with the help of the mysterious Gentleman, attempt to flee Monaco. The story is in two parts, first told from the perspective of the Locksmith over 17 levels, then retold by the Pickpocket in another 16. There's also a level builder, and you can download new levels to play in the Steam community workshop.I'd call this a Stealth game, but the stealth often decays into a mad dash to run out of sight of enemies or to make a mad dash away from the C4 you just placed to blow open a safe or wall or security guard. The background music is reminiscent of ragtime piano, and changes to suit the situation if you're spotted or set off alarms.It's good in single-player, but where Monaco truly shines is 4-player co-op.I've very much enjoyed this game, and it's on sale (50% off) at the moment. Go buy this game, because it's great. :3			"

												This is a game that truly shines in the co-op multiplayer, especially while playing locally or on a LAN. Each level in this game starts out as Ocean's Eleven, but can quickly turn into Boondock Saints.  Success depends upon a combination of coordination and improvisation, as well as clever use of the distinct characters and their unique abilities. Single-player can also provide its own challenges, as you have fewer ""tools"" with your team of one.After three years of development, this is an indie game that exhibits a lot of polish. From the intuitive implemenation of stealth to the clever level design to the fast-paced music, it's easy to see why Monaco won multiple awards at the Independent Games Festival in 2010. It plays well with a keyboard or controller and with Steam Workshop, there is an endless amount of content, from tutorials to PvP arenas.Also: trading cards.			"

												I've been excited about Monaco for some time so it was great to finally be able to sit down and play it. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed.One of the greatest things about Monaco's design is that messing up is most likely going to happen. In fact, it's almost a guarentee. You can be as stealthy as you like but the moment you linger in a guard's face for too long he's going to come out shooting, the alarms will bare, and the classy piano-only soundtrack is going to kick into high gear. This is where your character's individual talents will come in handy. For example: The Cleaner can subdue any enemy that hasn't already been alerted to your presence (has a exclaimation point over their head, or a red question mark). The Mole can make holes in areas where they shouldn't exist. The Gentleman (my personal favorite) can make semi-effective disguises for himself when he isn't seen.There are roughly 32 missions that you and your criminal enterprise can run through, each one favoring one character over another but allowing for improv. Half are through one campaign and half on the other. Playing by yourself is possible, but difficult and not as fun to perform. Playing with others is where the game starts to shine. Since messing up is pretty much built into the game's coding (see any mission with dogs in them), it's not a matter of being a perfectionist, it's more of making sure you're going the right way, picking up as much gold as possible on your way to the objective. Gold is optional but necessary to unlock new levels. Once you're finished with the entire campaign, you can go back in for your best time. Every gold piece you miss will add 10 seconds so if you're looking to speed run it's a matter of choosing your battles. The resulting multiplayer mayhem is less like Counter-Strike and more like Payday with a little more leniency and a hell of a lot faster.So I recommend Monaco, even more so if you have people to play with. If you're going to play alone I highly recommend using The Gentleman as his disguise trick means you're holding down the shift key a lot and planning ahead, but you're not dying as much. Otherwise, practice practice practice.			"

It has been only 3 month that we married and she got her first steps on gaming culture, so I was a bit suspicious about how she will gonna interact with this game. I can't find true words maybe in shortest way, but It Was Amazing, Full of Fun! We were shouting each others about what we doing for each other whle playing game feeling whole adrenaline rush while running in corridors and hiding from swat guys etc. It was enormous feeling and fun to spend together with keyboard - gamepad while looking on same screen. I just wish to thank dev's team who gave us this beautiful time and opportunity to spend together.My only con note about Monaco is, there is no way to play 2 people on same-screen whle online... We cannot setup 2 different gaming pc at home which I dont believe as ""standard"" around, and we wish to play 2 more people in our team, so we couldnt understand technically why this is not possible...

Monaco is a fantasmic game about litterally stealing from every place robbers shouldn't be stealing from; Hospitals, Embassies, and even hotels.

												As many people have said, if you look at the disrecommendations, this game is very easy and boring.  However, what those people fail to realize is that, they didn't try hard enough.  This game is so boring and simple if you just run through, grab the objectives, and dodge bullets.  Now, on the other hand, if you actually go for the achievements, try sneaking through undetected, getting every coin, and not dying, it quickly becomes very difficult and fun.  Several people have stated it lacks challenge and strategizing, but that's probably because they played the first levels designed for newcomers, and didn't even try to do good.  My friend and I played through the entire game, getting every trophy and achievement, including a hidden one, and it was not easy at several points.  For example, in one level, guards spawn every 20 seconds, and form giant conga lines of destruction.  Now try sneaking past their unpredictable routes into a guarded room, knocking out the guards without getting seen, so that you can hack a computer and hope that everything works out to let you get through the other 2 rooms, past some lasers, and giving you enough time to grab the cash and get out.  My friend and I got rather good at the game and it took us about 30 tries to get lucky on that level.  This game has tons of gameplay, and even more replayability with the many character combinations and strategies you can use on each level.  I highly recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Very fun and challenging game, with a nicely balanced difficulty curve. I'm my opinion, it's best in Co-op and it's available both local and online. The latter is a nice way to meet other players and build strong (ish) teams to clear out those rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s's floors. Of course that implies sneaking, breaking vaults with laser tourettes poiting straight at you and being synchronized with the people you rely on saving your butt by cutting off the power, hacking through computers, breaking through walls, disguising  and even ""cleaning"" or seducing the guards and civilians. You may need to be revived too, so for the sake of your team mates, please don't die in a laser room or in front of a guard. The bushes are your friends and those smoke bombs are going to save your♥♥♥♥♥many times. The top-down view presenting the architectural plans of the floor are very accurate and easily navigable by the players. I give this game a 9/10, it's definitely worth it's money for many fun hours at a time!			"

												Monaco is easily one of my favourite games in my big games library. A quirky stealth action, you take the role of 4 characters, at the start, The Locksmith, The Pickpocket, The Lookout and The Cleaner. Each with their own abilities, and hidden abilities, to aid themselves, or their team. You play through and unlock more characters each with their own unique abilites and ways to aid. Honestly this game is best played MP where it can get out of hand and chaotic, which to be honest is where the most fun is. Running from guards desperatly trying to revive your teammates while being careful that dog doesn't get to you, it's really enjoyable. If you are a completionist then best avoid this as to 100% you have to get 4 trophies, they are as followed: completed in SP, completed in MP, completed without dying (or if doing on MP none of you can die) and finally cleaning out the level, which you must do for EVERY level. Some of the later levels get ridiculously hard.So in summary I would definitly reccommend this game and you should buy it, especially because the Dev who made it is a really nice guy.			"

												An enjoyably arcadey take on the criminal genre that embraces a larger emphasis on stealth than PAYDAY, but a more forgiving view on alerting enemies than Thief. The game contains a ream of both developer and custom-made content, with full Steam Workshop support. Good alone, spectacular with friends.Positives:+ Extremely entertaining, fluid, yet challenging gameplay+ A selection of classes that genuinely change the way you play+ A fun, arcadey graphics style that communicates information effectively+ Seemingly endless content, with four campaigns and Steam Workshop support for user created levels+ An easily usable level editor, containing all of the tiles, objects and tools used in the game.+ Easily-hosted serversNegatives:- Occasional sever connectivity issues- A large difficulty spike between the Pickpocket's Story and Fin campaign.- Lack of checkpoints can prove an irritationRating: 83%			"

												If you enjoy 2D, retro-style games, you will love Monaco. It truly shines as a cooperative experience.You can go through most of the story completely solo (and at times it may be easier for some levels), and the game offers an offline/online feature that is very well integrated. Levels you have unlocked will have a marker indicating open lobby sessions, making it easier to join up for cooperative play. The steam workshop also has fantastic mods, including two CRITICAL tutorials that everyone should go through to get a good feel for the game. The jewel store from PAYDAY 2 is a particularly exciting one. Replayability just for these mods is endless.The aesthetics are great, and the fog of war mechanic is beautifully-executed: there will be a blueprint for each level (including floors), and you will only be able to see the details of your character's field of vision, the rest will remain gray. You can see nearby footsteps of your enemies, but require the Lookout character for constant enemy awareness. This makes for intense gameplay when you are in one area of the map and die, while your other teammates are on the other side, all running away from guards.The layout is still very friendly as your objectives will be indicated by large trophies on the map, and there usually be many signs on the ground to give you directions. The ""action"" timer is given by a small circle that fills up for everything you may have to do, from opening a window to unlocking a door so you can go into the urinal and pee (yes, there is an animation for peeing).The game incorporates an ""ammo"" system for whatever active item you have equipped (ex: C4, shotgun, smoke grenade, etc) that gives you +1 whenever you collect 10 of the yellow collectibles. While you share the total team score with your party at the end, your specific ammo count is individual, so you may have to decide who collects the resources if they are running low.Each character class comes with different skills and responsiblities, making for very diverse gameplay (and high replayability).Very charming cooperative (initally) game.

												The real gem in my game library. Monaco is a co-op heist game with 4 players just like PAYDAY (btw there're some PAYDAY maps available to play in the workshop). Like I said, my favorite part in the game is Community made levels (my favorite is PAYDAY maps). Sure the original campaign is good, but the community made maps have a lot of detailed hand crafted game mechanism. So why aren't you buying this?! go ahead buy the game without hestitate!			"

												Whats yours is mine, and whats on offer here is a simple concept, done really well, provides a lot of entertainment, and is all about the multiplayer.  Monaco flys under the radar for a lot of people as it isn't a big name title, and doesnt pretend to be, but the number of different ways you can play the game using different characters with different skills mean there is no right or wrong way to get through the game, although inevitably people will find their own style of play.  Playing with friends is where this excels.  Those moments when someone gets caught and dies in a really stupid place full of laser beams and guards and then trying to come in with a plan to create enough of a distraction for someone to get in and revive them is so much fun.  If you dont have this and see it on offer for under  £2, buy a few copies for your mates, and it will easily repay it with the entertainment time it gives you back.			"

												So earlier on in the spring, I purchased Monaco for 4 dollars because I needed a break from Skyrim. It is one of those rare indy games that comes around that realizes the best way to reward a player is by cleverness rather than trial and error. It's a game of actual skill and challenge rather than merely repetition and memorization. If I'd known how good it was going to be, I would have bought it at full price.Monaco is a stealth co-op game where you play a team of 8 thieves in vibrant colors. Together, they work to pull off a heist at Monte Carlo, the largest casino in the world. The world takes place in the actual city of Monaco, which has been stylized in a sort of retro look. Oddly enough, the game actually resembles the city at night. Just an interesting side note there. Anyway, each of the 8 thieves has particular talents which are used to work together with other players. The objective in each mission is varieties of rescuing a team member, collect a bunch of trophies, or just try to make a quick getaway in the van.Technically, you do not need to play multiplayer to progress, but it's highly recommended for new players as Monaco is significantly easier with three extra pairs of hands. If you do desire to player it single player, I would recommend looking into some player made tutorial missions that'll tell you everything you need to know.If there's any kind of nitpicking I could have about Monaco, it's that combat is just a major waste of time(unless you are playing in Zombie Mode). When you pick up a gun, you only get one shot and it takes ten coins to get one extra shot of ammo. Most floors in a level have 50 coins on average and there's about 2-3 floors per level. That means you're looking at maybe 10 shots at best...unless you're playing in multiplayer. Only then do things get really antagonistic as four thieves are competing for coins when cleaning out places.To top that off, even if you do collect all the coins on your own, you'll often find yourself outnumbered and outgunned by guards and civilians and they can all resurrect each other...so there's no real point to the weapons except to buy for more time. For some people who like the option of blasting through everyone who gets in their way, this may be a bit of a turnoff. I don't personally mind it however, because combat is not the focus of Monaco. It's about the caper, the chase, the theft. If you are looking for mindless slaughtering, check out the Zombie Mode. Zombie Mode makes you get twice as much ammo for the coins you collect and even gives the cleaner an one hit kill sneak attack.Complaints about combat aside, what makes a stealth co-op game like Monaco fun is that you're not scored based on how carefully you stealth. The truth of the matter is security gets so beefed up in the late game that even if you were the greatest cat burglar in the world, you're still eventually going to get caught. But that's part of what makes it so exciting when four thieves are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, collecting all the coins, dodging guards and turret fire while desperately trying to resurrect one another. It's the chaotic elements they add that make it stand out as a stealth game and once you get used to the mechanics on hiding and sneaking, then the game just starts to challenge you.One recommendation I would say if you choose to buy this is don't play this game for longer than 2 or 3 missions per day. Monaco is like a good wine--great for savouring but not so much for consuming. If you do power through it, the novelty will start to wear off fast and you'll just wind up burning out. There's enough enjoyment from getting 100% coins and no deaths with a competent team of friends in a single mission than teabagging every noob you see in a triple A shooter. It's a game that's all about quality over quantity.These reasons are all that what makes Monaco a game that totally deserves your attention because it's the indy game of early 2014 that most deserves to be played. They just finished up the last patch on it and it's available on steam for 5 bucks. So stop reading this, go to the store and buy this already. In the meantime, I have more time to play as the Gentleman. :)			"

												I love this game because of the many ways to play, beyond just the 8 characters. You can try to stay hidden the entire heist, or burst into a ball of flaming rage while you kill everyone on the level. Either way, it makes for a fun and fast-pased game with so many little ""tricks"", such as secret passages, unmentioned abilities, and even just the variation of time it take to collect a certain ""loot container"" (safe, jewelry case, ATM, stack of cash, etc.). The top-down perspective gives the game a very unique style, especially since this top-down format is being used with a game full of action and stealth. And even though the Guardarme are tough, every level is very possible to beat, as long as you take the right paths, hide in the right bushes, and have the perfect balance of secrecy and lethality.

												This game is almost 'Realistic' from a birds perspective. You can play as different escaped prisoners or people they free in the game. The Hacker is my favourite cause it can deactivate all the electronics for a short while where you walk close too. I Highly recommend to play this game with friends or people who know what they do with they Character and/or the level. You also see the spots like with a coloured perspective like in real life. I mean, when you have a closed door you can't see what's behind it even with the perspective. You can only see, what we also can see if we stand there. Also everyone can make hiding spots in the bushes on some maps to prevent that cops find them easily as they walk by. The weapon system and Equipment system is also a new sort of way to play, you get an extra item of the item you got by collecting money. In overall it's a game who wants to be sneaky, stealth, rich, demolishfull, a charmer or a codebreaker.			"

												I've been excited about Monaco for some time so it was great to finally be able to sit down and play it. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed.One of the greatest things about Monaco's design is that messing up is most likely going to happen. In fact, it's almost a guarentee. You can be as stealthy as you like but the moment you linger in a guard's face for too long he's going to come out shooting, the alarms will bare, and the classy piano-only soundtrack is going to kick into high gear. This is where your character's individual talents will come in handy. For example: The Cleaner can subdue any enemy that hasn't already been alerted to your presence (has a exclaimation point over their head, or a red question mark). The Mole can make holes in areas where they shouldn't exist. The Gentleman (my personal favorite) can make semi-effective disguises for himself when he isn't seen.There are roughly 32 missions that you and your criminal enterprise can run through, each one favoring one character over another but allowing for improv. Half are through one campaign and half on the other. Playing by yourself is possible, but difficult and not as fun to perform. Playing with others is where the game starts to shine. Since messing up is pretty much built into the game's coding (see any mission with dogs in them), it's not a matter of being a perfectionist, it's more of making sure you're going the right way, picking up as much gold as possible on your way to the objective. Gold is optional but necessary to unlock new levels. Once you're finished with the entire campaign, you can go back in for your best time. Every gold piece you miss will add 10 seconds so if you're looking to speed run it's a matter of choosing your battles. The resulting multiplayer mayhem is less like Counter-Strike and more like Payday with a little more leniency and a hell of a lot faster.So I recommend Monaco, even more so if you have people to play with. If you're going to play alone I highly recommend using The Gentleman as his disguise trick means you're holding down the shift key a lot and planning ahead, but you're not dying as much. Otherwise, practice practice practice.			"

												This is a game that truly shines in the co-op multiplayer, especially while playing locally or on a LAN. Each level in this game starts out as Ocean's Eleven, but can quickly turn into Boondock Saints.  Success depends upon a combination of coordination and improvisation, as well as clever use of the distinct characters and their unique abilities. Single-player can also provide its own challenges, as you have fewer ""tools"" with your team of one.After three years of development, this is an indie game that exhibits a lot of polish. From the intuitive implemenation of stealth to the clever level design to the fast-paced music, it's easy to see why Monaco won multiple awards at the Independent Games Festival in 2010. It plays well with a keyboard or controller and with Steam Workshop, there is an endless amount of content, from tutorials to PvP arenas.Also: trading cards.			"

												Monaco is a game that’s as much about thinking on your feet as it is about stealth and forward planning, and regardless of whether you’re after a fun co-op game for four people, or something to speedrun to impress people on YouTube, I daresay there’s something here for everyone thanks to its focus on sheer entertainment. It’s exquisitely pieced together in almost every way, it lets you play in a variety of different ways and challenges you to think outside the box, and I can’t imagine anyone that could fail to be taken in by its charms.Monaco is a fantastic and unique take on the stealth genre and a showcase of excellent design, and you should make it yours. Not getting your hands on this would be a crime.			"

												At first I didn't really 'get' this game or why it was so good. I didn't care about the co-op either, as I figured playing with random people wouldn't be great. Then I found myself playing it all weekend and absolutely loving it, and hugely enjoying co-op with random people as well.It seems really simple at first, but the game has a lot of depth. You start to realise how many options you have for dealing with the levels, and the levels go from the trivial opening ones to incredibly difficult end ones. The middle levels are wonderful and the later levels are a huge challenge. A good co-op team can help but isn't required.The people playing the game are properly into it and everyone seems to intuitively understand what each other is doing, and it's a lot of fun.Highly recommended!

												Monaco is a great co-op dungeon run. Or maybe you could compare it favorably to Left 4 Dead. It's a great game.There's no accumulation of loot like you find in MMOs or ARPGs, but this is a feature, not a flaw. Since everyone starts equally, it's easier to pull people into a game at any given time. You don't have to worry about whether your character is too high a level or too low a level, or whether you have the ""proper"" gear. You just get get up to 4 people together and just do it.It has a forgiving ""death"" mode, much like Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, or Guild Wars 2. When playing with friends, if you are downed, you can be recovered by another player. As long as one person is still alive, the game continues!It also has several different modes of success. You can just try to complete the level. You can try to clean it out entirely. Or you can try to do both of the above against the clock. For the hardcore, speedruns may be their thing. For the more casual player, survival might be the challenge. And there are different versions/difficulties of each of the levels, so unlocking those is another potential goal. And of course there are ""cheevos"" through Steam for doing other silly things. So there's a lot to aim for with this game.The graphics are stylish, the music is perfect, and the dialogue witty. My only criticism is that it's a little hard to figure out the ""ring"" of indicators surrounding your character. Parsing that data is hard with all of the other visual distractions on the screen at any given time. But by the time you learn 'em, it's mostly moot. At that point you will probably have enough experience with the game not to need 'em too much.And the price? Cheap! I highly recommend this game.			"

												A lot of thought and design went into this game and it shows, from the concept to the level design this stealth / heist game is a lot fun. Most of the various characters feel unique each with there own advatages and disadvantages. Co-op is great especially with 3 or 4 players each playing a different class lending their special talents like a disguises or tranq darts. If you like playing rouge / theif type characters you'll really enjoy Monaco.			"

												I bought this game because it was on sale and looked fairly unique, but I wasn't expecting very much. I was wrong. This game is one of the best buys I've made during my time on steam. The trailer's don't necessarily do the graphics justice, which have really clear visuals, and a minimalistic, but aesthetically pleasing neon art style. The soundtrack is also killer, capturing the perfect tone. The gameplay is fantastic, akin to pacman with stealth, guns, and laser-rigged security systems. There is little in the way of tutorial, so you are left to experiment for yourself,but that works well for this for this game, which has you balance careful planning, against quick thinking and resourcefulness for when things go wrong. The plot was also pretty fresh, while nodding to tropes within the heist genre. The game offers a lot of replayability too, as though the single player is fun and carries the game by itself, the multiplayer enables you to play with others to try and try to grab everything and get out as fast as possible. In addition to this, the community is pretty good, and new levels are often being made. Of course, no game is perfect, and if I had to say something, it would be that though the plot was great, it was advanced sparingly from mission to mission. If story is what you look for in a game, this may not be the game for you. Also, although you don't have to collect every coin to ""win"" a mission, if the coins are ignored some missions lose a lot of challenge, especially as on some earlier missions the number of lives you have is fairly generous. However, there are a lot of levels (3 parallel campaigns, with a 4th coming out soon, as well as zombie mode), so this would only bother those exceptionally impatient people who can't wait to unlock the later levels, which are extraordinarily challenging, even if you don't collect the coins!I would definitely give this game a 10/10 as it stands, and am very excited to play the new content which is coming out this year			"

												Monaco is a 2D Stealth game where you have various objectives to complete while robbing places.It has style, a captivating soundtrack, but most of all, it's multiplayer fun.If anyone has ever played the old Hitman games (not absolution), they would immediately feel at home, the levels are big and the player is given total choice on how to handle everything, so you can say there are multiple choices to finish a level, defined by your creativity.For example, you have to infiltrate this big mansion, you can use the Mole to breach a wall and enter, you can use the Hacker to deactivate the cameras, you can use the Cleaner to put the enemies to sleep, and countless other strategies being viable even the ""Let's just rush in!!!""The only problem with that last strategy is that levels become harder and it's easier to die against automatic weapons and all of the security measures.All in all it's satisfying to pull off stunts and the game doesn't penalize you for it!Yes, the best thing about the score system,  if you're a completionist like me, you only have to collect all the coins and escape with no deaths.No ""No alarms"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no ""No kills"" or other stuff like that, you can handle the level HOWEVER you want, which is always a plus, even if I usually try to not kill anybody or try not to be spotted, at least I know I can kill that guard that cornered without getting frustrated about ""losing points"".The game is NEVER frustrating so far, even if you die, you just wait for your teammates to get you back up and try a new approach.If you want to compete in the leaderboards, the only factors that counts is Time and Gold (because for every gold you miss you get a higher time), personally, I like to take things slow with my favourite class, the Gentleman (being the slowest class overall).Play with friends or strangers, it's always funny, even when no one communicates and everybody just roams the level to do their thing, collecting money mostly, and when all the coins have been taken, everyone proceeds to the next floor of that particular level.I really like this formula and recommend it to any stealth loving gamer.Have I mentioned it has an editor and steam workshop support? Which by the way, is easy to use.			"

Most games get boring after you beat them, but Monaco just stays fun by allowing you to try it different ways, with different characters, making it a game you can play multiple times. And multiplayer is great (assuming no one lags too badly) since you can have more fun, knowing that someone's got your back. Even the story is great, as I was truly enthralled in it. As of right now, I'm working on the achievments, which have never felt more rewarding. I cannot recommend this enough.			"

												A definitely recommendable game, with a very good concept, art style and humor. However, playing with friends is almost a must, especially in the later levels, and constitutes most of the fun. This is sadly a little bit hampered by the awkward private game creation system (x on the level for list of games, from there create, from there set to private, then send invites...).Perhaps the option for friendly A.I.s and a more streamlined private game with friends system would be of help.

												Monaco: A really well-rounded stealth game.The game follows the lives of a band of criminals in Monaco. Main story points are made at the beginning of each level, so don't just skip straight past it on your first play through.The gameplay is very good and it is well balanced between the Stealthy parts and the parts that may require a more brute force approach. There is also a wealth of tools for you to use whihc lets you customize your gameplay to whichever style you prefer.The control scheme works very well, I have tested with a controller & keyboard/mouse. The levels in-game give a good explanation of how to use the controls.There is a surprising amount of detail in the environments, given that it's a 2D top down pixel style. Worthy of note is the lighting algorithm, which limits your line of view depending on where you are in a level.The sound and music involved are very good. Not too over the top, and it suits the stealth aspect of the game very well.There is a wide array of workshop content, and included is a simple & easy to use level editor.I have not yet tested the multiplayer or the pvp aspect of the game, so I cannot comment on it.While playing this game I found no major bugs, or minor bugs for that matter.Definitely try this game if you like platformers in the stealth genre. It should give you a few good hours of gameplay for the main gampaign acts, more if you try to get 100% completion on each level.			"

												Do you ever wonder how great of a theif you would be? Good, play this and realize you would be terrible and not only be arrested but probably killed in the process. Single player too hard? Try multiplayer and suck with your friends.Pros: Fun game that takes little set up to play with friends, lots of levels to unlock and play. Looks great, and provides as much challange as you put into it.Cons: setting up a private game takes a little finagling. lots of rubberbanding when there's many AI on screen			"

												Very fun and challenging game, with a nicely balanced difficulty curve. I'm my opinion, it's best in Co-op and it's available both local and online. The latter is a nice way to meet other players and build strong (ish) teams to clear out those rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s's floors. Of course that implies sneaking, breaking vaults with laser tourettes poiting straight at you and being synchronized with the people you rely on saving your butt by cutting off the power, hacking through computers, breaking through walls, disguising  and even ""cleaning"" or seducing the guards and civilians. You may need to be revived too, so for the sake of your team mates, please don't die in a laser room or in front of a guard. The bushes are your friends and those smoke bombs are going to save your♥♥♥♥♥many times. The top-down view presenting the architectural plans of the floor are very accurate and easily navigable by the players. I give this game a 9/10, it's definitely worth it's money for many fun hours at a time!			"

												Monaco: What's Yours is mine is a 1-4 player co-op heist game, a lovely 8-bit game where you sneak through locations while trying to steal valuable goods, and is a game I cannot recommend more heartily.  This is one of the indie sensations like Fez and Bastion that were being talked about and were winning awards before the game was even released, so it would be CRIMINAL (pardon the pun) to ignore a game with as much accolades as Monaco.The gameplay revolves around each level being a bit like a puzzle.  There are guards, security cameras, alarms, motion detectors, and other things that you have to bypass in order to get the gold, documents, or money and escape.  Each player gets to choose a different thief that specializes in different things; every thief can do everything necessary to beat a mission, but the Lockpick can pick locks and safes much faster, the Pickpocket can gather gold much more safely than others, the Mole can break through walls, and so on.  Choosing your specialist comes down to playstyle more than necessity, which is very nice since that means your team can be built around what everyone likes most instead of needing to play this or that character.  This really lets people get into the game by picking the burglar that they think is coolest or most fun.Important note: By no means is this a game that depends on flawless execution.  The most fun is when the alarm inevitably goes off and you and your friends scramble trying to grab the money and still escape, with an army of guards chasing you the entire way.  These are the most enjoyable moments of the game, where everything has gone wrong and you're still desperately trying to get the money and escape while everyone is laughing and trying to hide and being shot at.  This is definitely a fun little party game, and though the later levels require a little planning, it truly is a great game to play with friends or family of any age.I cannot recommend this game higher as a co-op game for you and a few friends.  Buy it, bring a friend or two over if you have some controllers, and enjoy Monaco, where What's There is Yours.			"

												Monaco is the first game I’ve played that truly nails the feeling of the heist, with enough traps, items, and different characters that co-op play with friends should be a staple of your online activity for the months to come. However, the over-long campaign is a chore when played solo, especially when the story suffers as a result. If you and your friends are looking for a new game to play together, Monaco is a no-brainer. But playing through Monaco by yourself, or leaving your enjoyment up to groups of strangers, can yield uneven results.			"

												This game is a pleasure to play. Four player co-op itself is a strong selling point for a game; adding a terrific art style and a dynamic soundtrack makes this game all the more appealing. What makes this game a must-have, though? The fight-or-flight gameplay style. You can sneak your way through, looting every coin and dodging every guard, or you can dive in all Tally-HO! into the action, sprinting down corridors and peppering security with bullets in a frantic escape. The choice is yours.Thumbs up!			"

Its a must play if your a fan of games like Payday.

What´s this game about?This game is a incredible top-down stealth game with big, open levels, interesting characters with various abilities and weaknesses, each proposing a different playstyle. You break into art galleries, embassys, police headquarters, ships, prisons (...), each level featuring an interesting combination of surveillance cameras, lasers, handprint scanners, locked doors, ventilation shafts, bushes or plants to hide in, PCs and power outlets to inject viruses, and inattentive guards carrying special keys. (...) How much content/replayability?There is a vast amount of dev-made levels, including little text-based briefings. You can replay a level again and again, a different character selection most certainly leading to a entirely different game expierence. It is great fun to collect all coins scattered through the levels (""clean out""), which acts +/- as a optional sidequest.Additional:And then there is the Steam workshop....And then there is Multiplayer, which is almost a game on its own, including 4-player support.And then there are gadgets, like shotguns, crossbows with tranquillizer darts, medikits, smoke bombs, C4 (...) which you obtain by collecting coins.SO: Buy this game if you like stealth, Co-Op action/voicechat chaos, good timing, tactical thinking and top-down games.I give it a 9/10. Excellent indie game with balanced and distinct characters, very good replayability, 4-Player Co-Op Support and the Steam Workshop offering even more old rich men to loot. "

												I checked the game while it was on a Free Weekend offer. Must say it is a big fun, but you really need a team for that. I played it with three strangers but it was still a great fun. At first it seems really ease, even boring. But the further game goes, the harder it gets. At some moment you need a well-crafted tactics to beat the level. try it, it's fun.P.S. Game has a really unusual visual design (the 'fog of war' is designed as a building plan picture), but one gets used to it quickly.			"

												This game is annoying and weird at first, however! after about 1 hour into gameplay and playing some with my friend, who also bought this game. It began to become fun. I give this a 30/10 :) for anyone who likes PvP and Heisting in France. The only catch is the new interface and the confusing intro. I also recommend playing this with a friend for best results :)			"

												A great pixel game. It has a rich gameplay, where you need to plan every movement and try to get the best out of each character. Playing a multiplayer game may be very funny (even more when cooperation falls down, and everyone runs for their own lives). The history is great and funny, also.Recommended9/10			"

The game's chaotic situations really get hilarious. Running around healing teamates and getting money all the while trying to stay undetected is ridiculous and a ton of fun.			"

												WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS GAME...if you're planning on playing it alone! However, this is the perfect party-play game. Whether you are completely new to this game, or if y oure a veteran and have all of the tricks up your sleeve, you'll feel right at home with fun,stealthy, and strategic title. When playing alone however, the gameplay feels lacking as youre limited to the special ability of only one character. However, the more people you add to the game, the more fun it gets!			"

												Hands down, the best game I have ever experienced. Though it was made in 2009 it has graphical capabilities akin to next-gen consoles. The narrative storytelling seems real, beautiful, as Microsoft Sam always does. I feel as though I need to help the Rats or my purpose in life will never be fulfilled the Rats need me, and I need the Rats. I will never put this game down, the sheer heavenly, awe-inspiring, near-♥♥♥♥♥♥ic experience this game gives you is like nothing else I have ever seen. Beware: this game will, 100%, eat away hours, days, months and eventually years of your life as the lifelike physics bamboozle you thank you Invent4 Entertainment you are all Gods and will live in my unworthy, mortal heart forever. Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was ""The Perfect Game"" but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10			"

												The quintessential co-op experience. Every moment of this game spent playing with friends is an absolute joy whether you succeed or fail. The visual style may take some getting used to but it serves its purpose, but what puts this game over the top is the music. The soundtrack is a brilliant compilation of piano tracks reminiscent to those of the silent movie era, and the tone and pace of the song changes depending on the situation, making it feel like your playing a wonderfully interactive heist film. If you're gonna play this game, play it with friends or you're doing yourself a great disservice. 9/10			"

												Great game with amazing art and concept.This game will surely bring all your friends together as you will work toegther as one cohesive unit. This game relies on the skills of each and every character. You can beat this game on your own, but it will be hard. Playing single player often gets me thinking ""Having a breacher here would be great."" or ""Man, a lookout stationed here would be really helpful"" which is why playing online is the only way to go.The music, is another plus point in this game. The music has a lot of pace, picking up extremely fast as you get spotted by a guard, or managed to take the prized loot. During sneaking mode, the music provides a spy-ish sort of music.Overall this game is guaranteed to give you a whole lot of fun and a unique experience, be it bad or good totally depends on your teamwork, when working in a team.My rating: 8.5/10			"

												Monaco is a hidden gem. At first glance, when watching youtube videos of it, it looks complicated and probably boring, but I couldn't be more wrong. Monaco is one of my favorite game. It is a top down view, and there are different class, and you basically try to steal treasures while avoiding guards, camera, civilians, lasers, etc.; sounds boring? but trust me, it is really fun. It's a shame that there are almost no one playing online. Don't let that discourage you though, single player is really fun, but better with multiplayer. Like I said, this game is a hidden gem.			"

What´s this game about?This game is a incredible top-down stealth game with big, open levels, interesting characters with various abilities and weaknesses, each proposing a different playstyle. You break into art galleries, embassys, police headquarters, ships, prisons (...), each level featuring an interesting combination of surveillance cameras, lasers, handprint scanners, locked doors, ventilation shafts, bushes or plants to hide in, PCs and power outlets to inject viruses, and inattentive guards carrying special keys. (...) How much content/replayability?There is a vast amount of dev-made levels, including little text-based briefings. You can replay a level again and again, a different character selection most certainly leading to a entirely different game expierence. It is great fun to collect all coins scattered through the levels (""clean out""), which acts +/- as a optional sidequest.Additional:And then there is the Steam workshop....And then there is Multiplayer, which is almost a game on its own, including 4-player support.And then there are gadgets, like shotguns, crossbows with tranquillizer darts, medikits, smoke bombs, C4 (...) which you obtain by collecting coins.SO: Buy this game if you like stealth, Co-Op action/voicechat chaos, good timing, tactical thinking and top-down games.I give it a 9/10. Excellent indie game with balanced and distinct characters, very good replayability, 4-Player Co-Op Support and the Steam Workshop offering even more old rich men to loot. "

												My friend bought me this game and I have never sat down and tried to play it seriously, so I am only writing this at his request. I don't really get it.I say that with a lot of games. And usually it's because I don't have the patience and like to blame other things for my own faults. I've only played it multiplayer, and it felt like there was no real strategy. My friends and I would all pick whatever characters ( I was the Mole because he was by far the coolest ) and would pretty much just run about the stage doing whatever. We were probably only on the default difficulty, and obviously weren't going for any high scores, yet nothing was really stopping us. We would waltz right into the building or whatever, grab the money, knock a few people out, die, get revived, and then eventually progress through the level and win. I never felt like I was supposedly to play differently. It almost felt like I didn't even need to, because if I could play sloppy like this, why waste my time trying to be smart and stealthy?I'm a bit biased against the game, because I feel like I never really gave it a chance. I think if you have the patience to try and play it strategically then it could be interesting. I do think it's a relatively original concept, so it has that going for it. Plus, everyone speaks French so that's kinda cool.Pretty colours / 10. "

												With a colorful artstyle and a chaotic nature, this is a game where you seem not to know what is going on at any moment in time. Yes, I am here reviewing yet another four-person co-opertative. This is a very strange type of game through concept, but achieves enjoyment through being very chaotic, escpcially when all four players are present for the experience. There are multiple characters to play as, with each one having a special ability that assist the team in one way or another. You can play through the game either through the stealth means or running through it, getting spotted by the security will peforming said action. This video game was specifcally taliored for co-opertative, as having multiple individuals in the game at once is benefital to the success of the operation. If you are trying to play this without being spotted, it is very difficult, with their being a mass amount of security officer and civilans present on each level. There are ways to avoid said obstacles, such as vents and other means of traveling around. The gameplay is enjoyable, with teamwork infused into multiple actions, such as if a teammate was killed you will need to go to revive them and can not proceed without doing so. So, would I recommend Monaco, yes, as it is an enjoyable co-operative experience.			"

												A great game with well thought out stealth mechanics, interesting characters with helpful abilities (And the pickpocket), and overall amazing sneaky gameplay that challanges your mind, reflexes, and strategic skills.Or you could just yolo it and run through all the levels real fast and hope nobody catches you like I did.

Multiplayer is definitely a better experience than single player, but single player is fun as well. (especially if you enjoy speedrunning)			"

												Monaco is a hidden gem. At first glance, when watching youtube videos of it, it looks complicated and probably boring, but I couldn't be more wrong. Monaco is one of my favorite game. It is a top down view, and there are different class, and you basically try to steal treasures while avoiding guards, camera, civilians, lasers, etc.; sounds boring? but trust me, it is really fun. It's a shame that there are almost no one playing online. Don't let that discourage you though, single player is really fun, but better with multiplayer. Like I said, this game is a hidden gem.			"

												I wasn't sure what to expect from Monaco, whether it would be more arcade or more realistic. And I've come to the conclusion it's a little bit of both.When you open the game, the menu itself moves very nicely, with graphics flowing in the background. Right off the bat, there are multiple gamemode options. I dove right into “Campaign” mode, and, like many other games, it showed me the first mission I could complete in color, and all the others were grayed out. However, what I really liked about playing Monaco's campaign, is that I could join/start a lobby, have up to three other people with me, and could stay in that lobby and keep selecting episodes instead of having to join a new lobby for each episode. The gameplay itself is very nice. You start on the first episode by choosing one of four characters, each with their own perk. As you progress through levels, you gain more characters. The game loads very quickly, after you depart from the neat lobby menu of changing options (which is always fun). It is a top-down game, but there are obviously good reasons for that. On the top, directions will be given as to what you have to do, so that it's never confusing, and the goal is to sneak past the police/guards to get to the object the heist was started for and all the spare money along the way. There are weapons to pick up from time to time, but I found that running away from guards and hiding in a room for a few seconds keeps them off your scent.Pros:Menus move very smoothly.The graphics, being a top-down game, are pretty decent.The objectives are always clear.You can stay in the same lobby for as many levels as you choose.All campaign levels can be completed in either singleplayer or multiplayer.The controller support is amazing, and I actually prefer to use the controller.There's Steam Workshop to download new levels to play.It's local co-op too, so it's good for a party with friends if you have more than one controller.Cons:Gun reloading is very obnoxious. It shouldn't take 10 seconds for one bullet to reload.The co-op community is not as large as I had hoped.Guards are almost too easy to get past.So, basically, I had a lot of fun playing this game, though I would recommend getting it on sale.

												If you want a nice over-the-top stealth game that has a lot of variety and challenge, then Monaco will satisfy your desire. The stealth mechanics are well implemented and the different Thieves all have different playstyles and abilities. The stock story is really fun and even more when playing with friends. You can get a solid 30 hours out of the stock story without going for all trophies. After the regular story, you can play in zombie mode, where stealth isn't as big of a factor as on-the-fly decision making. Whether you are playing alone or with friends, I would recommend this game to you.			"

												Monaco Whats Yours Is Mine     We've all had that fantasy, you know, the one where you plan an elaborate heist, Even if you haven't i'm sure you have at least seen ocean's 11. Sadly if you tried this in real life you would risk going to prison, but fret no more because finally a game has come out where you can do just that (other than payday), without suffering the real life consequences of robbing a bank.     Sound 4/5     Art 5/5     Gameplay 4/5     Story 3/5     Overall 16/20     On the sound spectrum i think I was rather generous as the music is not tremendous (purely my opinion), but there are no horrible sound effects that take away from the experience of the game. Where it really excels in this spectrum is the voice acting. while not much dialogue, the little there is is very funny.      At the quality AAA games are at in this day of age it is hard for small teams to get that same feel, so many go for the retro look. However, just because the graphics aren't of their era doesn't write them off the art category. Even though it may not look real it is still one of most beautifully presented games i have ever seen. they really pushed what they could do with the graphics they had     The gameplay is light, fun and a blast with friends. the high speed robbery is a great mechanic and can only be built on,and with so many different classes to choose from it can take a lot of planning until you and your friends have the perfect bank mugging dream team. you can also go solo if you wish and will still be challenged to a very fun and strategic game. Sometimes you can spend hours trying to get that top spot on the leaderboards and it is a game that suites that competitiveness completely. sadly, this game can get slightly repetitave after playing for a while and the replay value isnt great at this point     The story in this game is good but not great, it is quite simple and engaging but gets quite predictable and you sometimes just skip some dialogues before the level completely. However, the story gets the job done and really is not what this game is focused on. like many retro style games story is an afterthought and that definately shows in Monaco, but it is not bad to a point that it ruins the game     I would recommend this game to anyone who has any taste in games. with all the cookie-cutter fps games there are it is pleasant to see something  innovative and new. It is well worth the money and I think most people would have a good time with it			"

												Monaco takes the style of the classic pacman gameplay where you collect loot in a top down view and makes it 10 times more fun, involved, and frantic, wither you're playing alone, or with friends.The goal of each level is to go through a series of ""floors"" of a location and collect all the trophies, then escape. However, this is quite easily done, and most if not all players will eventually decide to start clearing floors, which involves you collecting all the coins on each floor, as well as the trophies, before moving onto the next. Clearing a whole level is a fun challenge that rewards you with a harder version of that level.The game plays quite differently on Singleplayer than it does on Multiplayer most of the time. If you're someone who loves stealth and likes to take it slowly and perfectly, then singleplayer is for you, where some obsticles will require a small plan if you want to get past it unnoticed. Multiplayer is more fast paced, with almost always something going wrong.  You'll quickly find 4 players running around the level hiding in bushes and reviving each other while being chased by dogs, helicopters, guards and more - it's a great laugh.The game has a whole bunch of content to keep you going for hours - just look at my playtime - 100 hours (almost!). There's 3 campaigns, each of which can be played on a normal mode, and a zombie mode where even civillians try to kill you, then there's custom levels, which are made by you and other players alike. Custom levels means there's a level editor which will also keep you busy if that's your thing - its loads of fun to design a place to rob, believe me!All in all, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play for an hour or two whenever you want. When you start out give it a few hours so you can get used to the art style, which can confuse a lot of people at first, and make sure you play more than the first few levels - they're mainly just tutorial levels!

												6 hours in and I can already tell that this game was a good use of my money.Right from the get-go, I liked it. I have a soft spot for good stealth games, and this game set off on the right foot by following my 3 basic rules for making a decent stealth game:1. The player must always be aware hgow close they are to being spotted by each guard2. There must be many ways to approach one goal in an open-ended level3. The controls must be tight and responsive enough for the player to have agency in the gameplayMonaco does all three things very well: each guard has a sight meter over them which fills up over time, the levels are open-ended and full of extra ways to navigate them, and the player is simple and fun to control.A good buy, even when not on sale. When it does go on sale, but four copies and have fun remaking the heist movie of your choice! "

												Solid multiplayer game. This game has both local co-op and online, though not both at the same time.   It's a fun game that can both be played as a strategic heist game, or a fun run through a guard infested building.   It works well as a multiplayer, or single player, and can be enjoyed equally in either mode. Personally I find it best in couch co-op though it can be frustrating.  Some of the mechanics are a little annoying. (sight doesn't work as you expect at times), and a few rooms feel like you need certain abilities to ""cleanly"" get away. But where else are you going to get a mole to dig a tunnel through a wall, to allow a hacker to hack a light switch to disable a security laser, then let the lock smith unlock a safe, while the lookout is watching for guards.

After sitting in a dark corner for more then 7 hours, i realise this game was infact not a hide and go seek emulator and i was not the king of the jews. Overall if Obama was really black he would approve of this so since im jewish im going to do that in his name. 8/10, would play in spare time - Adolf			"

												Imagine a stealth game where the fun of the game is trying to frantically run away from pursuing enemies after you got caught.  They keep attacking but then you finally escape their search.You plan a heist perfectly, but then it innevitably all goes into the gutter and you half the police force on your tail. The thrill of escape as you steal diamonds right under a guard's nose. The feeling of craftiness as you bypass lasers and kill guards.Now put in 4 player co-op with each person bringing different skills to the heist along with a ton of loot to steal and you get Monaco.

												My only complaint about the game is that the classes are boring. Currently the classes you can play as are: a “locksmith,” a “pickpocket,” a “cleaner,” a “lookout,” a “mole,” a “gentleman,” a “hacker,” a “redhead,” and a “blonde.” Really? No WONDER so few finished the game. The people we played with are just boring. Cliches. Veritable “mehs.”But it doesn’t have to stay this way. Pocketwatch Games can fix this by replacing these classes with cooler ones. Specifically these:We can replace the “locksmith” with “Sasha Grey.” The Sasha Grey class makes money by taking many hard tasks simultaneously (often four at a time!). She takes them harder and faster than the other classes and, though they would cause other classes such vertigo that others would vomit, she, at her limits, would just gag and roll her eyes back and ask for more, and with profanities! This class is like a “tank,” and can take great punishment.As for the “pickpocket,” how about “Jenna Haze”? Jenna Haze has an easy-going, perky personality. She’s the charmer of the group. She’s enthusiastic and energetic, bending over to do almost any task. She also has tan skin. This is useful.As for “the cleaner,” that can be replaced by “Tori Black.” Not particularly good at anything but above average at everything, you can count on her to do basically anything. And I mean anything. Some of the others may resent her non-specialization—but the absolute value of her skills makes her a force to be watched.The “lookout”? Let’s replace ‘im with “Lexi Belle.” Don’t let her quiet, high school girl demeanor make you think she’s not willing to do dirty deeds. She’s the innocent-looking one among this group, and you’re going to need her, because, well, everyone else in the group looks a little…suspicious? I think that’s the word. You’re going to need Lexi Belle to balance that look out.And the “mole.” How about “Jesse Jane”? Having grown up on military bases, this girl has the discipline and experience necessary to get almost any job done (wink wink). She’s a down-to-earth girl; not as sunshine and unicorns as Jenna, but not as hard as Sasha. And she has a mischievous facial expression none of the others have. You really want this girl on the team.What of the “gentleman”? Well, obviously: James Deen. With his boyish face, athletic physique, and blue eyes, he’s obviously a gentleman. Female guards will look at him and immediately become disarmed (of COURSE there are female guards in this game! Don’t be a sexist!). He has an incredible amount of experience for his age, and unlike many of the other male candidates for the job, well, he can play the “gentleman.” He’s also a good team player; he can work with the rest of the group all night long, and in many positions.Speaking of which, let’s replace the “hacker” with “Stoya.” Graduating high school at age 16, and being versed in computers and games (plus being a writer), how could we NOT want her on the team? She’s the nerd, and the most rebellious of the group; the proper answer to “the hacker.” Being of Scottish and Serbian ethnicity, she also brings something exotic to the team. How many Scottish, Serbian Americans have you played with?Now, the “redhead.” Coming out of retirement, we have “Faye Reagan.” Retiring from “the industry” early due to drug problems, Faye in this game gets a second chance at life. She realizes that she just has to focus on being good at what she believes in, which is sharing the wealth that her mind and body are capable of with this team of stars.And as for the “blonde,” “Kayden Kross.” No longer a performer but rather a director, she will be the leader of our group. This Swedish American writes well (though not as well as Stoya) and, with her French husband and partner in crime Manuel Ferrara, we can expect her to sweep Monaco’s rich men. Or perhaps rich women? (Mr. Ferrera demands that she work only with women for some reason if she DOES have to perform) (we’ll have to keep her away from the James Deen I guess). Kayden also happens to be the most beautiful of the group. Beautiful in that she has an aura of leadership.And there you have it! Just imagine all these characters in some Monaco mansion, working together all at once! Oh what fun that would be! Pocketwatch games! Give us what we desire!			"

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine Review - Raymond KTSuffers from the same problem Dungeon Defenders did, in that it provides cooperative play without an incentive to utilize it (indeed in both cases it was almost a hindrance to bring others into the game). Had some fun with it though, probably worth checking out if you're not expecting much and you're just looking for a casual experience to share with a few people. I'd recommend waiting for a sale though. I wished there were more people playing this game. Multiplayer is pretty dead, need some AI bots to revive it.			"

												I love the fact that I can go all Jihad and suicide bomb the guards in this game. That's probably my favorite part.This game is one of if not my favorite game I've played. It is hilarious.There is much entertainment value in it, you can play with friends, you can build your own maps, and the replay value is phenomenal.They have two separate campaigns (I guess it's sort of like the same campaign only the level gets bigger and more difficult). The different characters you can play are very diverse (not the bad, politically correct way) and have different skills. The NPCs are friggin' HILARIOUS in their interactions with you and the bush in which you are hiding (but they, of course KNOW you could not possibly be hiding there) and it's just an all around well balanced and fun as hell game.I give this game an 11/10 (because that's possible).

												Monaco is a unique take on the Heist genre and I applaud it. Story-There are a total of 49 story missions divided into 4 campaigns - Locksmith's Story(17 missions), Pickpocket's Story(16 missions), Origins(8 missions), Fin(8 missions). You can choose to do these missions in 3 different modes: Enhanced, Classic, Zombie. The Enhanced and Classic levels are practically the same except that some layout and AI changes have been made to the levels in Enhanced mode to make them easier.-The general story follows a group of thieves(The Locksmith, The Lookout, The Cleaner and The Pickpocket) as they finish various jobs for money or other things. As the story progresses, new members join the group, The Gentleman, The Hacker, The Mole, and the Redhead. The actual story is told by two members of the original cast - The Locksmith and the Pickpocket. They both share their versions of what they've done to an inspector. Those stories are very different in difficulty and actual narration.Locksmith's Story-Narrated mostly by the Locksmith. The ""Easy"" mode of this game if you ask me, and  the levels are similiar to the Pickpocket's story.Pickpocket's Story-Mostly narrated by the Pickpocket. The ""Hard"" versions of the missions from the Locksmith's story. Levels are fairly similiar but there are still some major differences. It includes one of the greatest twists that I have ever seen. SPOILER ALERT:The first crew(Locksmith,Lookout,Pickpocket,Cleaner) are the same people as the the second crew(Gentleman,Mole,Hacker,Redhead). The original crew was made up by the Gentleman to avoid arrest.Origins- Narrated by the Lookout talking to an Inspector.  Explains why the thieves started doing what they're doing. For them, the law doesn't apply until a ""moral debt"" is repaid to them. The Lookout, for example, does this because Haitian soldiers stole all her family's possessions.Fin-The Finale.Narrated by two inspectors chasing the thieves. The missions are mostly cleaning up evidence from previous jobs and escaping police officers that are looking for you.Gameplay-The gameplay mostly focuses on stealth - going in guns blazing is still possible but not recommended. Unlike other top down view games, this game doesn't allow you to see around corners unless your character leaves cover. The game instead gives you a blueprint of parts of the map you've already been to but you can't see where guards, civilians, and other useful items are.You are allowed to sneak and that will greatly reduce the distance from which guards and civilians spot you. Controls are very simple and most of the interactions require you to just walk into something and hold the same button until it's done. At the beginning of each level, you are presented with backpacks that hold various items. The backpacks can hold shotguns, SMGs, smoke grenades, C4, EMP, Wrenches that complete any action instantly, and even a rocket launcher and many more. This equipment is not mandatory to complete the mission, but highly recommended. Collecting 10 coins grants one more ""ammo"". A somewhat unrealistic mechanic is in the game - you can hide in bushes to hide from guards, though you if you are spotted while entering it or they will attack you. Some enemies are overpowered, like the Shotgun SWAT and the RPG Soldiers but they only appear on maps where they are generally easy to avoid. It's possible to beat this game in singleplayer, but co-op with a mic is highly recommended. Local co-op is also available, so that's a huge plus. Planning how to enter a building and how to disable an annoying laser to get the trophy with a friend feels amazing.The game, if you haven't noticed, also has a workshop. Sadly, we are not allowed to create weapons or character skins or props(you can, however, modify these in the game files) but in exchange we can create maps. Oh yes, your custom heist. It's really easy to learn how to use the ingame editor so you'll find yourself making a complex mission after 5 minutes of practice.Characters-The thieves in Monaco all have different special abilites, and that is, in my opinion, the greatest strength of the game. Though some are more powerful than others, each character has its usefulness.-Original Crew-The Locksmith: Can open locked doors, safes, ATMs and cash registers faster than any class-The Lookout: While sneaking, special icons represent enemies and civilians on the blueprint part of the map, allowing players to sense danger before it appears.-The Cleaner: Can knock guards and civilians unconscious and they remain in that state for a short period of time(~30 seconds).-The Pickpocket: His pet monkey follows him around and collects any coins that he misses.-New Members-The Gentleman: Can disguise himself while hidden allowing him to traverse areas that are normally off limits. Needs to stay away from guards and civilians or his cover will be blown almost instantly. (My favourite character.)-The Hacker: Can insert viruses into power outlets(crazy, right?) which allows him to disable security.-The Mole: Can dig through walls allowing you to get behind enemy lines.-The Redhead: Going near one guard,civilian(even female), or even a dog charms them and causes them to follow you around, allowing your team to get around easier.Special:-Blonde: The Redhead but when she was younger. Guards only attack when they get close. Only available in Redhead's origin mission and custom missions.Final VerdictStory: 9/10 - Considering that it's not the main focus of the game(and it shouldn't be), it's surprisingly good including the twist at the end.Gameplay: 10/10 - Read the Gameplay segment.Characters: 10/10 - The game doesn't give little information, but at the same time doesn't overload us. The perfect middle.Overall:10/10 "

												This game is a hell of a lot of fun.  Stealth games are something you dont see pulled off to well too often and this game really does a good job of creating tension while hiding and panic when you've been spotted.  When there are more than a few players in the game it becomes pure chaos, someone screws up and gets spotted and then theres a chain reaction where everyone gets dragged into it and are all scrambling to find a hiding spot.  The game has VOIP built in so if you play this with your friends you will all be screaming at each other while playing, its great.  There still seems to be a player base so you can play online with people but I reccomend getting a premade group together to go through it as some of the other players might already know what to do and take a lot of the challenge away.  This game has a bunch of different difficulty modes some of which i've not gone through yet because they were added after the last time I played but I will be trying to move through them now.  The game does get quite challenging so depending on your penchant for punishment you may only end up doing one of the story runs.  There are also community made maps and some quirky player vs player maps that add more content to the game. I find the art style and story to suit the gameplay quite well and really enjoy the charactes and how there are different campaigns that tell different sides of the story from different perspectives. All in all very quality experience for 15 dollars, highly reccomend.			"

												This is a very unique and awesome stealth game. It has a strong emphasis on co-operative multiplayer gameplay, which more and more games are tapping into, and for the better.As a single-player title, it is not particularly impressive. It has its moments, but for a long while, the game is just too easy. Luckily, it has a lot of challenging and fun levels later on in which you'll actually have to play it stealthy.As a multiplayer game, it is one of the best gaming experiences one can have. I think having 2 players instead of 3 or 4 is still best, but all options are very fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to play with friends, and also any fans of the stealth genre (like me!).			"

												Monaco has one of the most unique gameplay combinations I have played, its filled with indie pixely goodness, but also has a detailed ""stealth"" system along with 4 player co-op and a level editor makes for near endless fun. Monaco doesn't let its art style hold it back from telling a story either, throughout the campaign you will learn about the characters and what motivates them. The protagonists are each there own character with there own ""personality"", something I would think hard to do given the graphical style of the game. I think you should give Monaco a try. Its not an expensive game but it is definitely worth a few bucks!			"

												Monaco is a unique take on the Heist genre and I applaud it. Story-There are a total of 49 story missions divided into 4 campaigns - Locksmith's Story(17 missions), Pickpocket's Story(16 missions), Origins(8 missions), Fin(8 missions). You can choose to do these missions in 3 different modes: Enhanced, Classic, Zombie. The Enhanced and Classic levels are practically the same except that some layout and AI changes have been made to the levels in Enhanced mode to make them easier.-The general story follows a group of thieves(The Locksmith, The Lookout, The Cleaner and The Pickpocket) as they finish various jobs for money or other things. As the story progresses, new members join the group, The Gentleman, The Hacker, The Mole, and the Redhead. The actual story is told by two members of the original cast - The Locksmith and the Pickpocket. They both share their versions of what they've done to an inspector. Those stories are very different in difficulty and actual narration.Locksmith's Story-Narrated mostly by the Locksmith. The ""Easy"" mode of this game if you ask me, and  the levels are similiar to the Pickpocket's story.Pickpocket's Story-Mostly narrated by the Pickpocket. The ""Hard"" versions of the missions from the Locksmith's story. Levels are fairly similiar but there are still some major differences. It includes one of the greatest twists that I have ever seen. SPOILER ALERT:The first crew(Locksmith,Lookout,Pickpocket,Cleaner) are the same people as the the second crew(Gentleman,Mole,Hacker,Redhead). The original crew was made up by the Gentleman to avoid arrest.Origins- Narrated by the Lookout talking to an Inspector.  Explains why the thieves started doing what they're doing. For them, the law doesn't apply until a ""moral debt"" is repaid to them. The Lookout, for example, does this because Haitian soldiers stole all her family's possessions.Fin-The Finale.Narrated by two inspectors chasing the thieves. The missions are mostly cleaning up evidence from previous jobs and escaping police officers that are looking for you.Gameplay-The gameplay mostly focuses on stealth - going in guns blazing is still possible but not recommended. Unlike other top down view games, this game doesn't allow you to see around corners unless your character leaves cover. The game instead gives you a blueprint of parts of the map you've already been to but you can't see where guards, civilians, and other useful items are.You are allowed to sneak and that will greatly reduce the distance from which guards and civilians spot you. Controls are very simple and most of the interactions require you to just walk into something and hold the same button until it's done. At the beginning of each level, you are presented with backpacks that hold various items. The backpacks can hold shotguns, SMGs, smoke grenades, C4, EMP, Wrenches that complete any action instantly, and even a rocket launcher and many more. This equipment is not mandatory to complete the mission, but highly recommended. Collecting 10 coins grants one more ""ammo"". A somewhat unrealistic mechanic is in the game - you can hide in bushes to hide from guards, though you if you are spotted while entering it or they will attack you. Some enemies are overpowered, like the Shotgun SWAT and the RPG Soldiers but they only appear on maps where they are generally easy to avoid. It's possible to beat this game in singleplayer, but co-op with a mic is highly recommended. Local co-op is also available, so that's a huge plus. Planning how to enter a building and how to disable an annoying laser to get the trophy with a friend feels amazing.The game, if you haven't noticed, also has a workshop. Sadly, we are not allowed to create weapons or character skins or props(you can, however, modify these in the game files) but in exchange we can create maps. Oh yes, your custom heist. It's really easy to learn how to use the ingame editor so you'll find yourself making a complex mission after 5 minutes of practice.Characters-The thieves in Monaco all have different special abilites, and that is, in my opinion, the greatest strength of the game. Though some are more powerful than others, each character has its usefulness.-Original Crew-The Locksmith: Can open locked doors, safes, ATMs and cash registers faster than any class-The Lookout: While sneaking, special icons represent enemies and civilians on the blueprint part of the map, allowing players to sense danger before it appears.-The Cleaner: Can knock guards and civilians unconscious and they remain in that state for a short period of time(~30 seconds).-The Pickpocket: His pet monkey follows him around and collects any coins that he misses.-New Members-The Gentleman: Can disguise himself while hidden allowing him to traverse areas that are normally off limits. Needs to stay away from guards and civilians or his cover will be blown almost instantly. (My favourite character.)-The Hacker: Can insert viruses into power outlets(crazy, right?) which allows him to disable security.-The Mole: Can dig through walls allowing you to get behind enemy lines.-The Redhead: Going near one guard,civilian(even female), or even a dog charms them and causes them to follow you around, allowing your team to get around easier.Special:-Blonde: The Redhead but when she was younger. Guards only attack when they get close. Only available in Redhead's origin mission and custom missions.Final VerdictStory: 9/10 - Considering that it's not the main focus of the game(and it shouldn't be), it's surprisingly good including the twist at the end.Gameplay: 10/10 - Read the Gameplay segment.Characters: 10/10 - The game doesn't give little information, but at the same time doesn't overload us. The perfect middle.Overall:10/10 "

												I love the fact that I can go all Jihad and suicide bomb the guards in this game. That's probably my favorite part.This game is one of if not my favorite game I've played. It is hilarious.There is much entertainment value in it, you can play with friends, you can build your own maps, and the replay value is phenomenal.They have two separate campaigns (I guess it's sort of like the same campaign only the level gets bigger and more difficult). The different characters you can play are very diverse (not the bad, politically correct way) and have different skills. The NPCs are friggin' HILARIOUS in their interactions with you and the bush in which you are hiding (but they, of course KNOW you could not possibly be hiding there) and it's just an all around well balanced and fun as hell game.I give this game an 11/10 (because that's possible).

												Having put 60 hours into this game solo and co-op with an additional 25 hours in creating my own custom mission, I felt it's finally time to leave a quick review. This is a great game for casual gamers like myself. With my short attention span for games nowadays, it's awesome to come across one that is so simple in concept that it is easy to pick up. Missions range from a few minutes to maybe 45 minutes, and it's just perfect.Even when you're done with the campaigns, there is a plethora of custom missions created by dedicated players. Of course, not all are winners, but there are definitely some very fun ones to play with friends.And of course, that brings me to the best aspect of this game: Co-op play. It's hard to find great co-op action these days, and Monaco delivers. I just love that you really have to work together to finish, period. If just one player is dead, you simply cannot progress. It's also fun to have to constantly be saving each other's asses...especially when you have a friend who likes to throw himself into the throes of danger just so he can shout ""WHOOOOOOOOOOO!"" And then he gets blasted in the face by shotguns.As someone who doesn't even play games that much anymore, Monaco was a delightful surprise that will keep me playing as long as the custom missions keep coming out.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6.

												This is a very unique and awesome stealth game. It has a strong emphasis on co-operative multiplayer gameplay, which more and more games are tapping into, and for the better.As a single-player title, it is not particularly impressive. It has its moments, but for a long while, the game is just too easy. Luckily, it has a lot of challenging and fun levels later on in which you'll actually have to play it stealthy.As a multiplayer game, it is one of the best gaming experiences one can have. I think having 2 players instead of 3 or 4 is still best, but all options are very fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to play with friends, and also any fans of the stealth genre (like me!).			"

												Monaco has one of the most unique gameplay combinations I have played, its filled with indie pixely goodness, but also has a detailed ""stealth"" system along with 4 player co-op and a level editor makes for near endless fun. Monaco doesn't let its art style hold it back from telling a story either, throughout the campaign you will learn about the characters and what motivates them. The protagonists are each there own character with there own ""personality"", something I would think hard to do given the graphical style of the game. I think you should give Monaco a try. Its not an expensive game but it is definitely worth a few bucks!			"

												Okay....I'll admit it.   For a long time I didn't like Monaco because it just felt strange to me.   It's an acquired taste (As one of my friends said in his reviews).But after many heists with friends, I must make a confession....I LOVE THIS BLOODY GAME!!!!!It's not too good in single player, but when you're playing with friends, the chaos becomes your new best friend!You can relate this game to a top-down Metal Gear game, but with a charm of it's own.BRILLIANT story-telling.BEAUTIFUL music.WONDERFUL chaos.FUN gameplay.GREAT mechanics.If this game is not in your library, then why are you even on Steam?!If you meet me in a server, be ready for a good time.

												Not really very good.Too fast paced/arcadey for good cooperation and the artstyle inteferes with gameplay. Certain classes are massively overpowered and others next to useless (a major problem in any coop game).Almost everything you can do in the level (knocking out or even killing guards, hacking computers) resets either after a short timer or when someone finds the body and even the players may be revived infinitely. In addition the vast majority of classes are only really given a small bonus to an ability anyone can do. If anyone can pick a lock being able to pick it slightly faster isn't THAT useful.All of this combined makes it much more likely/effective to simply have each player rush around alone than work together to come up with a proper plan. There is no real punishment for losing players since someone else can do the same thing (though a little more slowly) until you revive them again. Sure you COULD play the game as 'intended' but why? Yes, maybe it does magically get better towards the end but I can't see it being worth the♥♥♥♥♥♥before it. Fixing bad underlying design with 'good' level design is not acceptable.The trailer (video on this store page) is completely unrepresentative of how the actual game plays in coop. As mentioned by others (and indeed at the start of this review) the art style makes it difficult to tell what is actually going on and isn't particularly pretty in its own right.Maybe if you put significant hours into it you'll get used to the art style, only play the 'good' levels/play for score and speed etc but that is not an argument in favour of the game. It is advertised as a cooperative heist game (similar to, say, Swat 4 or Chaos Theory coop in design). Instead it is a fast paced arcade-style game with multiple flaws.			"

												Greatest lips ever. It was as if they had coldsore blisters all over them. Plus, having multiple lips in the same area is not only enthralling but also endearing. It made everything that much more fun. Never sure if one lip would do what you needed it to at the right time, or noticing as a random lip would quiver and the blisters would pop and spray all over the other lips. Coop at it's best. A shining achievement in blister history. I'd give it five full lip blisters and a quarter pus filled sack -- have fun!			"

												This is Quite a long review but nevermind...I was and still am a huge fan of monaco but i had onlt completed it on the xbox, and i mean 100% unscathed, bring the bleach all levels completed with all trophies but 1 which was multiplayer and after about 1.5 years i gave up.Then when i bought monaco on the PC i thought it would be nice to try it but i feel the zombies mode has ruined the aspect of monaco, not in the sneaky-ness of it because now you have to be even more sneaky but from the fact the zombies mode seems quite... off for monaco as it is set in france, meant to be a game about stealing (zombies still is but does not feel the same) murder if you can do it silently using a wrench or 7 and getting those SWEET trophies is still there but doing it against the watchmen, THAT HELICOPTER! (you know the one if youve played the game...) and the dogs feels like its proper thievery but against zombies its just collecting coins, a faded screen and 2 zombies called margo and pierre (im assuming the two computer people) just grunting and walking past zombies.*RANT ENDED*But other than that Monaco is a game i will for ever cherish, for its story of which for all my life has never beaten my love for itSOOO... i highly recommend you purchase monaco but if your into completing it as in multiplayer, single player unscathed and cleaned out from head to toe get the xbox version for i think it is better!

												This Game is great the enemy AI is unpredictable the levels have a lot of replay value and most importantly the game is hard the first couple levels are fairly simple but in the later levels you really need to experiment with all the diffrent classes and that's some genuinely nice design because at that point the game changes into a stealth puzzle game instead of just a stealh game this genre was never really something I played a lot mainly because I couldn't find any games to play that were based purely on stealth and decision making in most stealth games you can perform takedowns or other things of that type but this game only has one character that can do that which is really great it means you have to rely heavily on your enviroment instead of the normal hey you've got 50 diffrent gadgets that you can use to not get spotted and take this guy down without anybody noticing so yeah long story short this game has it all the sound design ( that actually uses real life sounds ) the character variety, the stealth, etc. so basically to conclude Monaco is a great game and I would recommend it a lot heck I probably forgot like half of the features of this game because there is just so much to talk about and there is a lot of quality to be found in every single one			"

 DISCLAIMER:  This is the first time I write a review, so it's not  that  deep and may have some errors. Have fun!Ah, Monaco. The best place to relax, party, and get robbed by a monkey. This Top-Down 2D game is good, I like it, and like any other game, it has it's  pros  and  cons  . PROS: -Steam Workshop.-Steam Trading cards.-Cheap.-Original.-Nice History.-Nice Graphics. CONS: -Gets boring after you complete the game.-Zombies are sometimes too Overpowered.-Limited tiles and tile placement. (If you do know what I mean..)-There's a part in the history that is too Overpowered.So yeah! That's it. What's yours is mine, and this review, is  mine  . RATING: 9.9/10 - Me.*****/***** - Me.A+ - Me.I recommend the game. It's a good buy.			"

												Monaco is great! Litterally when I was just on the few couple levels I was just confused and screaming since I didn't know what I was doing xDMonaco is addicting, really fun and just wow... xD It really got me into the game where you get in the game and it was just going madman! Straight into to game, heaps of drama while stealing + escaping just got really catchy! Doing different gamemodes and such got pretty fun too I mean who wouldn't like this game? (Except for some people) But Still!Single Player is very challenging but being able to connect with 2-4 players on levels make it easier and also fustrating in a good way. I rate 9/10 because I mean yes it's awesome but there isn't much of variety of levels except for the workshop, but who knows how good the workshop ones are. If you are reading this and are about to buy the game or anything. I REALLY SUGGEST YOU DO!!! *Amazing :D*			"

												A great game all around, possibly the most fun you can have while being frustrated at the same time, the best part is when you make what you feel is the perfect plan for a level with your friends and then watching it fall apart and fail miserably in 10 seconds because the guard that has gone right every single time suddenly felt like going left and thus ripped your well thought out plan to shreds and you have to improvise and next thing you know it's like a top down view of a Three Stooges episode. 10/10 :D			"

												This Game is great the enemy AI is unpredictable the levels have a lot of replay value and most importantly the game is hard the first couple levels are fairly simple but in the later levels you really need to experiment with all the diffrent classes and that's some genuinely nice design because at that point the game changes into a stealth puzzle game instead of just a stealh game this genre was never really something I played a lot mainly because I couldn't find any games to play that were based purely on stealth and decision making in most stealth games you can perform takedowns or other things of that type but this game only has one character that can do that which is really great it means you have to rely heavily on your enviroment instead of the normal hey you've got 50 diffrent gadgets that you can use to not get spotted and take this guy down without anybody noticing so yeah long story short this game has it all the sound design ( that actually uses real life sounds ) the character variety, the stealth, etc. so basically to conclude Monaco is a great game and I would recommend it a lot heck I probably forgot like half of the features of this game because there is just so much to talk about and there is a lot of quality to be found in every single one			"

												Monaco is a great stealth action-packed game. You take the role of 8 different thieves with very different gameplay through two campaigns and great number of challenges. The gameplay is solid. While you can pretty much force your way through the first levels, you really must avoid getting caught later on. The difficulty of the second campaign is quite hard, with a lot of achivements to go for. While the game is great in solo, it really shines in coop multiplayer, where each player control a different thief. There's also versus multiplayer, which is great fun too. Monaco also has a very fitting soundtrack and a very interesting storyline, mostly because of the way it is told. For those interested, there's also a great deal of community maps made with the very complete level editor in the game. The game recently recieved an update consisting of a reworked campaign and a zombie mode with new enemies. If you like stealth games, monaco really is a blast. I especially recommend it if you can find friends to play with.			"

												I've never really played a game quite like Monaco. It is more about stealth than it is fighting. It makes you think about where to go next because you might get caught. The soundtrack is amazing. My metaphorical hat goes off to Austin Wintory, the composer. This game is a blast to play with friends. There will be the woe of almost beating a level and then dying because of some stupid reason (example: your friend was AFK.). There will also be the joys of beating a level when you've been working so hard and you know that you have only gotten that far because of the help of your comrades. Single player is also fun because of the thought that you're challenging all these people by yourself. While the graphics seem all pixelated, but they have a certain charm. Oh, and the French voices are a nice touch.9.5/10Complete it. "

												This game is one of my favorites, it's fun to play with friends, awesomely designed and the music makes me feel like i'm planning some Paris 1980's robbery.What's most amazing about this game is that you don't need to manage your own server to play with friends, devs have their own servers just for you to play with your friends, so everything you need to do is to create a lobby and wait for your friends to join in.This game has level editor so you can create your own levels to post into workshop or play with your friends on.I found no bugs in this game at all, and i really recommend it to you, this game is a ""must have"".I rate 10/10			"

Not sure what all the hubbub is about.I gave this game two shots to impress me but I just don't see the appeal. First I played it with the keyboard online with a stranger and then the next day I tried it solo with a controller, both sessions were about 45 minutes. I came away from both bored.At its core Monaco is a pretty basic stealth game with a silly tone to it. There's a little bit of story before each level but it doesn't take itself seriously nor should you. I didn't see anything worth caring about. The majority of players probably skip it altogether. The guards you'll spend your time avoiding also have a bumbling way of acting that adds to the droll atmosphere.I did like how each character you choose to play as has a unique special ability that enhances their gameplay in some way. I even enjoyed a few chases at times when I did get caught. However, with most chases I never felt like I was in much danger. I have read that many multiplayer rounds devolve into free-for-all sprints through the level with no regard to stealth and I can see why. There's really only two things to do in each level: collect coins and reach the exit. As far as I can tell coins only add to your score on an online leaderboard which I'm probably not alone in not caring about.Without an interesting story, likable characters, deep gameplay or enjoyable goals to strive for I couldn't find enough to keep me playing Monaco.

YouTube™ Video: Monaco STTP Review by Kenuty 

			Views: 63		

			Here is my review of Monaco, My first indie thrown up and will throw up more! enjoy guys, STTP as usual stands STRAIGHT TO THE POINT, my new review done quick, and straight ot the point lol, if you...		

This is a great game for those who enjoy top bottom heist, You have to actually try it to see if you like it or not because the video cannot do this game the justice it deserves. Also coop is a blast with friends, but wild with pugs, YOLO+catchy tunes+Very fun gameplay+awsome multiplayer if you set it up+Great concept, hope to see a better sequel, hours of fun and replayability, change up your path and class- Pugs can ruin game without communication- Multiplayer can be hard to find players, no real replayability except ranking and the path you take- Trolls will mess your game up			"

												This game is absolutely phenomenal. It's great if you have friends that can play with you, and even better if you can talk to eachother whilst playing it. This game is my game of the year 2013 and game of the year 2014 so far! I love this game so much, but my only knack is the dodgy level editor system. It's controls are somewhat flawed, but if I could navigate it with my mouse then I feel that it would be greatly improved. Buy this game and share it with your friends!P.S. I have taken the liberty of creating a group for our Monaco friends by the name of Voleurs De La Nuit. Please join us and invite your friends to have even more fun in Monaco!			"

												The first thing I tried to do with this game was make it play in windowed mode, because that's how I prefer it. This required me to restart the game.So I did.Then the game opened up in windowed mode, and I tried to drag the game into a corner of my screen, because that's how I prefer it. I got about halfway there before the game stopped loading assets and tried to get into the menu.The game locked up. For a minute. Hitting the red X in the corner to shut it down did absolutely nothing, I had to give it the three finger salute to get it to ♥♥♥♥ off.Subsequent attempts to move the window were entirely futile; I can't even get the game to accept moving the top bar so much as a pixel because as soon as I tab out to get my captured mouse cursor back the game throws a shitfit and locks up HARD.This game is such an attention ♥♥♥♥♥ that if I go outside of the game for so much as a second I have to give it a three finger ♥♥♥♥ you just to get my entire computer back.I don't know what the game is like. I can't even get that ♥♥♥♥ing far in the ♥♥♥♥ing game, because I can't put the game window where I need it to be in order to play.So ♥♥♥♥ this game. Maybe you'll like it, but I don't really go for BDSM where the game I'm trying to play wants to whip me until I beg for mercy.			"

												this game is fun but the later levels get quite rediculous so much thta just killing 1 person will end up alerting the entire map and guards and civilians can revive each other which makes it even more annoying and ammo is hard to come by aswell even though the game goes overkill on guards and lasers making it way too hard to stealth too so gameplay boils down to running through guards alarms gun turrents on suicide runs to grab as many trophies as possible before you die then running to the escape vehicle until eventually theres no place to hide and too many defenses to get through			"

												Monaco ... I decided to try this game out due to it being on a ""Free Weekend"" deal. After downloading in anticipation and excitment, I finally had a chance to start playing. (BEWARE! This is were it all goes down hill) OK! After waiting for around 10 -15 minutes for the game to put me in a lobby, which it never did, I thought ... You know what, I'll try Offline Mode, but NO! You have to have IRL people around your house to play. So finally, I don't really have much to say about gameplay and soundtrack, but i bet they are amazing, but i nver had a chance :( pitty			"

												Probably the worst overhyped game ever made. If you read the other reviews you'll see it's recommended by people with as low as 0.6hrs playtime. So what is Monaco? Monaco is a coin collecting simulator. Imagine pacman, but you've got a gun, and also the ghosts pose 0 threat and don't come back to life. That's Monaco in a nutshell. Stealth? Oh sure, you can stealth through the game. But it's very easy to screw up and set the alarms off, at which point stealth is over and it switches to being one of the easiest shooters ever made. It's just such a laid back game, there's very little consequences for doing anything wrong. The game practically plays itself. Your objective is mainly just to tilt the control stick in the direction of coins then sit back and relax. Want proof Monaco is a poor game? Take a look at the global achievements. Less than 0.9% of people have finished the second act of the campaign; and I'll tell you it's definitely not because it's too hard.It boggles the mind how this game managed to get such amazing reviews as it did; really says a lot about the quality of mainstream reviews nowadays.

Get some friends round if you can and play single screen.My friend bought this at full price while we were at his house and we were bored, and it was the best £12 we ever spent. He loved it so much he 100%ed it within a week (normal for him). And then we went back a month later and discovered there were 2 new campaigns!Just seriously, get it!			"

												I've played the first levels of the first storyline with a couple of friends. I haven't enjoyed it as I thought I was going to.The game, if you play it as a proper thief, is good for its sale price ($ 2.54), but it can get pretty annoying (sometimes funny, though) if you play it reckless. I would not pay its full price ever.I think I was expecting something more from the hour and a half that I have played. If you think of buying it just consider of telling your friends to get some copies so you can have a better time.2.9/5 for 1.5 hours played.			"

												Top-down 2D stealth.  It's pretty meh.  The stealth itself is pretty silly with guards getting bored after chasing you, not following you to new areas, and reviving their fellow guards without giving much of a damn.  BUT, it features full 4 player co-op campaign on all levels and full steam workshop support with tons of extra content.  Worth the asking price and could be a fun time running around while setting off hundreds of alarms.			"

												My thoughts so far:- Alright retro style- Fitting music, but nothing I would look up on YouTube to listen to afterwards.- Seems to have some story, but when playing online with random strangers it's sometimes hard paying attention to it (some people seem to be in a constant rush typing ""GO!"" all the time in the pre-match readying lobby phase despite you still reading the story text that comes before each map).- Could need more incentives to play stealthy, maybe. You can run/rush through all maps it seems. It turns out real quick and pretty chaotic when playing with random strangers. The difficulty has increased over the course of the maps I've played (""The Lockpick"" missions), but not enough to actually force people's speed down. Maybe I need to progress further in it to see even more difficult missions.- Many classes, but not sure if they are equally useful. Some like the Lookout you don't need when running through the maps/when things get loud and none of your teammates care about hiding and going stealthy again. Some like the Hacker appear ""overpowered"".			"

												This game has potential but unless you somehow get a full group of people willing to play the game it's meant to be played, every game will be people running through causing too much attention to do the game porperly and have fun.On another note, the game is way to complicated. You play on a top down POV but there is SO MUCH going on at any time that it's neraly impossible to see what's happening. You will lose yourself constantly, also basic parts of the game like laser alarms and hacking are just frustrating and random which makes most people just run through them.Try it if it's on sale and ONLY if you have goof friends willing to play with you the way it's made to be played.Alright/10			"

												""Singleplayer or Co-op heist game"", key word being singleplayer. No. It's not singeplayer orientated. Singleplayer and co-op have the same maps, same amount of enemies, except you're by yourself. I'm sure this game would be fun with friends to play it, but in my curcumstance this game is not fun, AT ALL. It's massively unbalanced. So much so that it's ridiculous, especially when guards can resurrect each other, despite taking a direct hit to the chest with the full slug from a shotgun. If you like a hard-as-Dark-Souls challenge then by all means buy it, if not don't get it, unless you have friends to play with. At least I got it for $2.54			"

												Seems like it would be a fun coop game but I just couldn't get over the art style.  It is the worst use of the retro pixel style I have ever seen in a critically acclaimed game. The ugly doesn't bother me so much as it being not functional.  It's a struggle to tell the tile sprites apart while racing through the level: is that a shelf, a wall, a door, or something else?  I don't know, it all looks like placeholder programmer art.   Even after playing for hours I wasn't able to tell what certain things were without stopping and thinking about it.			"

												I can appreciate the difficulty in bringing a quality indie concept to fruition, but that doesn't excuse a game from being compelling. At first blush it's a fun little romp which friends can join in on, but it quickly dissolves into an almost meaninglessly easy sprint. It's a stealth game in which stealth is not required, enemies are not particularly lethal, and your characters move blindingly fast. You can easily sprint through all the alarms and trail every guard behind you on the way in and out of each heist, ignore almost all of the loot, and be none the worse for wear. Loot is needed only for high score, and who really cares? All this without mentioning the abilities that make it even easier, especially the Miner character who literally can tunnel around all the obstacles in a level and walk out unscathed. No reason to go stealthy, no reason to really play, actually.			"

This is gonna be thumbsed down to hell because my opinion is different than yours and im not allowed to not like it even though I personally cant recommend it and you won't even give me a chance and read the reviewStraight up can't play it. The concept is amazing, I'm really liking the concept but whats lacking is the execution, the art style is just so terrible to look at, I can't tell whats going on, I don't know who is who, when I'm running around in panic I can't for the life of me figure out what the hell is going on. The objective is confusing too and theres a random story or something for some reason. Thats my only gripe with the game, if the game was re-released with a much more simpler, less blocky and colorful art style and make it not so busy to look at like i'm about to have a seizure, then I'll play the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, but for my own sanity, i'm not going to recommend it because its horrible to look at in its current state. Now bring on the thumbs down			"

												As of now, I can't really recommend Monaco.It's definitely a fast paced, incredibly fun game. It's definitely fun to sneak around, figure out how to take out guards, and recruit new characters.however, there is a lot of emphasis on multiplayer, and, well, unless you have friends, online is pretty much dead. characters that you play are very single strength, so there are certain missions that are extremeley difficult to pull off unless you know which character is good and how to play them well.overall, grab it while it's cheap, or if you really enjoy a challenge + stealth, I can't recommend this game enough.

												Way too fast-paced to be a stealth heist game. You wanna play online? Oh that ain't gonna work, it took me half an hour on my first play (not exagerating) to find a server that didn't shut down as soon as I joined, and your team lacks all communication and teamwork, within a second everyone has rushed in and triggered about 20 alarms. If you're gonna play, do it in a private friends co-op.			"

												A cool concept lacking good execution. Everything is so busy! Everything is so bright! Characters all look the same! Blocky for the sake of being blocky. Multiplayer is an absolute mess of flashy, neon, blooming colors and meaningless symbols. Too simplistic to have much depth, yet too complex to be intuitive or much fun with friends.			"

												Monaco as a whole is a very interesting and fresh concept. However its executed poorly.I never played the singleplayer as it was me and 2 friends (plus a random player) playing together, the multiplayer is insanely unstable, we would barely beat a level before one of us disconnecting, we all tried making the lobby to see if that helps but someone would always end up disconnecting. The game would occasionally just crash anyway.What little time we could play in it, it was fun other than the fact its really hard to distinguish who's who besides a slight difference in colour.The game could be good if it weren't for the instability.

												We bought a 4-pack of this game since it seemed like it would have some interesting mechanics. Unfortunately this game didn't capture our attention.

I did enjoy the game's graphical style though.This game isn't bad but I wouldn't recommend it as I didn't really enjoy it.			"

												When I looked at the game in the store, I tought it'll be some kind of a robbery simulator like Payday but with pixel-graphics, also the ""field of view"" (of the robber) looks gives us a modern-oldschool game, wich I'm a fan of. So I bought this game and started downloading it with a big smile on my face. When the downloading is completed, I opened the game and started a match. I was waiting and people were just joinning and leaving and I couldnt start to play. After I figured out that there's an option to play offline, I started the game. The character had a delay in movement and crosshair (I mean mouse) and the gameplay was all about moving from a place to place, collecting some golden things and avoiding guards (Wich is impossible in some levels). When guards are chasing after you, they will start saying things in French and that's very annoying.  Now let me tell you the pro's and con's:Pro's:1. The game itself looks high-quality and makes a feeling of an old&new game at the same time. 2. Field of view looks very cool and makes the game more ""realistic"", wich means you cant just notice all the guards, you'll need to look at them somehow.Con's: 1. Gameplay is same, you'll just need to listen to some convention in the start, and then do the mission. The mission are really boring because the lack of content, you'll find yourself interacting with doors / other things. 2. Sounds are really annoying, especially the one that the guards does.3. A really big amout of levels as a story line, wich makes no sense at all. This game may be cool if it was free, I'd better donate to charity the money I wasted on this game.			"

												I recieved this game as a gift a while ago, and from around 90m of co-op gameplay, I cannot stand this game, not one bit. I liked the layout of the menus and their bright intense color on black, contrasting the giant pixels to the max.However, the gameplay in my opinion is extremely repetitive, and the game kind of ""forces"" you to stealth the joint.In this I mean how you may have a shotgun, you can go in and blow someone to their pixely skeleton, however note that you can only use it once, before having to collect 10 stupid coins to load another use into your weapon/tool. And by the time I collected 10 coins, I had about 20 stupid Watchmen following me, tripping lasers as I ran, and doctors shooting me with tranquilizer crossbows, which led to me being beaten to death with the deadly forks the Watchmen hold. Sure, you can try to hide in a bush/vent/tree, but by the time I went in one, they followed me to the bush and happened to poke the bush with their forks, leading me to my instant death.The music, in my opinion, is awful, just sounding like an extremely sped up piano ballad, or better yet a 2-year-old banging their hands and arms on every key possible. The graphics are squares. I think everything is a square. Your body is a big square, with a smaller square (the head, which stupidly bobbles left and right any time you move your mouse), and two little squares (the arms) on the side of the big square. Despite this I do like the lighting effects and post-processing. The animations are like pixel ragdolls.. It's strange.There are different characters to choose from, all with different abilities. I thought that it was cool, being able to have a specialty and all. You start off with 4 at the beginning, and get more as you progress through the campaign.Also, I just want to throw out there that if you want to go up a staircase, ladder, etc., you have to ""prepare"" it first, and once it's ""prepared"", you need to wait for ALL players to go there in order to go up. Hated waiting.Overall? 4/10.. Others may like this game, but I sure as hell don't. I'll give them points for originality, but that's it. It's not my kind of game.  "

For most of the game there is no point in sneaking as blasting through levels running from guards is less frustrating and way faster. It feels like there is really no point in trying to sneak and make the game work the way it's meant to be played when it's frustrating, dull and the game encourages you to complete levels as fast as possible. You won't be playing as all the characters mainly because it feels like a lot were added as filler and their perks are out classed by other characters.

												Maybe I haven't yet invested enough time in this game to appreciate what it offers, but some friends and I tried to just jump in and we were not enjoying it. A slightly better tutorial would probably be nice. The game really just keeps throwing new stuff at you expecting you to know what's going on, and for my friends who never even play stealth games, it became a huge hurdle. I can definitely see a fun game in here, but it's not very accessible as-is.Edit: I also totally forgot to mention the terrible interface and options. Why can I not start a room for friends only? I had to kick Shrek out of my room about five times before my friend could finally join. I don't like saying no to Shrek.			"

Essentially, there's no hard proof of this game, its creators, or the judges were involved in a massive coverup at the Independant Games Festival at GDC 2010, but there's too many coincidences to just shrug off that this game won anything or got the press it did on merit alone.  There's definitely a nepotistic attitude going on within the ""Indie"" scene since there's a lot of coincidences and very friendly dealings with the major developers of that scene.  I don't want to support a game that's involved in that.			"

												Monaco is a great concept gone horribly wrong. I got it as part of Humble Bundle 11, even paying extra for it alongside Antichamber. Antichamber is an epic journey into the mind that can't get enough reccomendation from me. Monaco is a failed attempt at a retro looking stealth game about heists. As you start it, it draws a mysterious air around itself, with, I'll admit, a pleasing retro aesthetic. And then you watch the cinematics. They're certainly not what the advertivements show. They're just the characters at hand sitting someplace taking turns spewing out TEXT-BASED dialouge while doing their stupid, 8-bit, repeating animations. The gameplay is clunky, and the retro aesthetic collapses in on itself when you can't tell what's a wall, what's a door, what's a plaza for you to walk into and yell out at the top of your lungs, ""HEY GUISE LOOG AND ME IM ROBB N. YOUR BANK!"" You can't tell what's going to break line of sight, what's going to get you noticed, what's going to - oh, wait, it doesn't matter, because you can just run past every guard, kill everyone, set off every alarm, ♥♥♥♥ up every lock-pick attempt (oops, that doesn't matter either cos it's just hold down a key and boom, lock picked) The outcome won't change, you won't get more reinforcements thrown at you, you won't lose money, or fail the mission unless every single one of you dies. It just gets more♥♥♥♥♥♥easy if you have a whole gang of friends at your side, because then, with each classes game-breaking ability, you hardly have to do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ It sadly fails, with all its' promise, at being a good action game, at being a good stealth game, at being a thriller, at being a good co-op game, all failed. The worst part is it's not actively bad, just plain boring, like a McDonalds hamburger: Far overpriced for the bland thing you get. 3/10			"

												The game is okay at first. Run around collect gold end level. Most of the people you play with are raging idiots. They either don't try to be careful or they run through the level urging you to hurry up over and over again instead of letting you get a feel for the game. There's also no real progression other than unlocking a few new characters. So your basically just playing for score and i've never really been into arcade style games.			"

												My friends and I were looking for a co-op stealth game, and we came across Monaco. Quite generously one of them bought a copy for all three of us. We started playing through the main missions, having a lot of fun sneaking through the maps, silently taking out guards and what not. But then we started to realize that you didn't really need to sneak at all. You could simply run the through the level with abosolutely no consequences. In games like Mark of the Ninja or Hitman: Absolution, you're penalized for being seen, and in the latter even penalized for killing non-targets. With no points system in Monaco, there's no incentive to play it stealthily. Outside of a score, the levels themselves don't feel particularly rewarding. Very repetetive and easy to complete. I would recommend this game to a group of friends who just want something to play together and laugh about. However with no need to communicate or strategize I would not recommend this to anyone looking for an in-depth cooperative stealth game.			"

												The game is interesting in it's design.  You select one of a few unique characters with different abilities and attempt to achieve a goal, usually one pertaining to an overarching plot that you uncover as you progress.  Some stories unlock new characters with new abilities that may (or may not) help you during your next mission.  I loved the references and easter eggs in the game.  The developers certain put a lot of thought and creativity into the game.  That, unfortunately, is where the good ends.  The mechanics aren't consistent.  There are times when you can be standing almost right next to a guard who is staring at you and they will not react, even when in LOS.  Other times you can be standing in another room behind a wall walking softly and they suddenly become alert to something nearby (you).  Mixed with the fact that the characters don't have precise controlling (the gun aiming is atrocious), which makes things ridiculous when there are lasers that will trip alarms and the choice between hacking a computer or smashing through a wall is the same motion.  There were plenty of times I was trying to hack a computer right next to a laser and had to frustratingly inch my way up to the console so as not to slide right into the laser (when you let go of your movement key, your character keeps moving a small distance).  With some refinement, I'd say this game would be a most excellent and exciting co-op game.  As it is, me and my friends simply ended up frustrated and just dashing through the level to make it to the escapes or safe zone with no regard to who we alerted.  Needs more work.			"

												I'd heard a lot of great things about Monaco so I decided to pick this game up.From what I can tell, it's a 2D heist game with a lot of stealth elements thrown in for good measure. Sadly, it seems like I may have decided to jump on the bandwagon a bit too late - looks like everyone's already gotten off. The online community for this game seems to be zero with a serious lack of diehards. Playing this game by yourself can only be fun for so long.I'd recommend getting this game only if you know for certain that you will have other people to play with.			"

												This game is better than Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I. You can play as the guy with the monkey and pretend that it's Tails and it'll be a better Sonic game than it because it has Tails in it. You can even play with your friends, and with Shrek, but it will be terrible because you won't be able to see jack because the graphics be uglier than Dr. Eggman's armpit. In other words, this is solid for a Sonic game these days but I would advise that you pay no more than one dollar for it.			"

												No incentive to actually steal stuff, which just leads to the following step-by-step program:1. The mole digs a hole in the wall and takes the trophy.2. You walk 2 meters to the escape zone.3. Repeat.No fun at all. The game is simply overrated.			"

												I tried to like this game. But the graphics are so bad I can't tell what is happening on screen. Seriously. Weird art direction is one thing, outright indistinguishable blobs are another.Maybe there's a good game here. In fact, there probably is. But I can't play it if I can't follow what's going on the screen. So it gets a thumbs down for a truly hideous art & graphical style.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												I found this game very interesting and fun.  You strive to collect all the money in a mission (optional objective) while looking for a Trophy case (primary objective) you need to find and escape.  It's like a heist.   The first few hours, I was having a positive experience playing this game.  However, as time goes on, after completing missions here and there,   I have realized that  most of enjoyment I get out of this game are depending on how well-made the missions are.  How fun and challenging they are.   Some missions, I can run around attracting all the guards and still complete the missions,  I realize that isn't fun at all.    So I really suggest to restrict yourself to being a harmless ninja and try to loot everything and escape.  Everything else really fall just short.			"

												""Monaco: What's Yours is Mine"" is a top-down, 4-player CO-OP stealth/heist game inspired by the Oceans Eleven movies. Some have described the game a mix between stealth and PacMan, it being top-down and having to collect coins. PlotSeveral talented people felt they were wronged in their past lives and turned to crime claiming that the world ""owed them a debt"". Inevitably, all are arrested, and happen to be placed in the same prison where they consolidate their efforts. They meet a crimelord known only as ""The Gentleman""; a master of disguise, and are forced to help him rebuild his life after he too lost everything in exchange for a way out of Monaco, France, away from the police, and - finally - freedom. The dialogue is interesting and each character is given enough of a personality to be enjoyable without flooding the player with text. The story isn't too complicated, but it's few twists are enough to make you lean back in your chair and exclaim ""No, way!"" It's very well written and was a delight to hear.GraphicsThe fastest and easiest way to describe the graphics would be Minecraft's blocky, pixlated look. The visuals and art are wonderfully inspired and fun to watch. Same for the game's goofy animations (My favorite being the Red-Head girl's wave. A long, black stick represents her arm with a small block shifting left to right at the top. Another is the ""head box"" of the toons' body sliding left to right across the ""body box"" to look around.) Levels are colorful eye candy without being cluttered and hindering vision. The layout is still believable i.e. desks are in the right places, the insane asylum's layout makes sense and so on. Even the menus are well polished, organized, and easy to navigate. Unfortunately, you can't ""click"" on anything. Sorry, PC fans; it's the age of console ports. Arrow keys and Enter keys it is. SoundPerhaps Monaco's most proud feature is the sound design. From opening shafts/doors, to gathering/using items, the sound design is spot-on. Even when you die, you leave behind a skeleton that can be revived by allies. While being revived, it literally sounds like they are pouring flesh and blood back into you! It's so great!....if not, sometimes a little gross. The voice acting is equally commendable. Although our theiving protagonists don't make a peep beyond heavily breathing when their health is low, the guards are well-voiced and their dialogue is in pure french. Hearing a guard go ""What was that?"" can get old when it's in your native language, but hearing it in a foreign tongue makes the same line suprisingly facinating! However, beyond all this is the TRUE pride of Monaco's sound: the music. While undetected, the music is mostly piano that rouses a combination of silliness, and stealth. The tunes are dulcet with a personality of it's own. When you're caught, the music morphs to a reminiscent sound of Chaplin-esque, ragtime music. Imagine this: you and 3 friends lay out a detailed and complex plan of how to tackle the next puzzle, but EVERYTHING goes wrong! The alarm sounding, the guards sprinting to the scene, you and your team are panicking as you scramble to get away, slowly opening vent shafts and scurrying into bushes while this music plays. It's a feeling I can't describe beyond ""masterpiece"". So rarely does music and gameplay weave together to make such immersion like this. GameplayAll of the above would be wasted on a game if it's gameplay wasn't good, right? Monaco's gameplay is simple, yet brilliant. It plays very ""simply"" but is far from casual. The goal is to take an objective always symbolized as a giant trophy, but you can only unlock the next mission by gathering all the coins on said mission. You have a main ability, a secondary ability, the weapon/tool you take, and sneaking. That's it. Sounds shallow? In fact, it's not. The simple mechanics of the game leave it to be very controllable and follow a tight meta of teamwork. Therein is the brilliance of the simplicity. Some examples are: The Lockpick. He picks locks the fastest (omg nowai??) and his secondary is he opens safes and cash registers the fastest. The Look Out (My personal favorite) can spot enemies with radar-like precision across the entire map. She also unveils ""shroud"" to reveal the level to the otherwise blind team. Her secondary ability is to open vent shafts the fastest, providing an escape route for the whole team. Lastly mentioned is the Cleaner who can knock out guards if they aren't too suspicious of him. His secondary is using health kits the fastest. There's several more, but you get the idea. They are all powerful, yet not omnipotent, forcing a reliance on others without making anyone feel useless. Teamwork in games is rarely captured this perfectly. The online functionality is also smooth as butter. Connecting to games is a breeze and I rarely experience lag that breaks the game.The VerdictMonoco: What's Yours is Mine is a superb display of game design, sound design, and gameplay mechanics. Charming visuals, hilarious and honeyed music, perfect sound, low price, and well polished gameplay make for a game that can't be refused. Monaco earns the coveted 10 out of 10 from me! It's that elusive indie gem we've all been searching for!			"

It's crap graphics which is to be expected of any indie game.  That's easy to look past though if the game has fun, interesting gameplay.  Hell, even a great story might make it worthy of playing if the latter both fail.This game has zero of any of these elements.  It's not visually impressive.  It's not fun or even catchy gameplay.  There is zero story.  What the ♥♥♥♥ were these critics smoking??Jesus lord this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥  Rarely have I ever played game with friends where all of us, in sync, gave up on a game.  We reached this moment at about the 10 minute mark of playing this attrocity.  You know the PC gaming sector is sad when critics are acclaiming awful games like this as ""amazing"".  ♥♥♥♥ me I wish Steam had a return policy.			"

												Eh, Some decent gameplay alot of indie-games that most people like would definitely buy this, So far i don't like the game because all you have to do is walk and pick up coins your teammates will pick up first as in my experience, So essentially that shotgun item you first pick up is useless, Thus why this game has a hard learning curve for new players.Overall i wouldn't buy the game, I'm lucky i got it from someone else.

												I have been looking forward to playing this game since I grabbed a copy during the Steam sale at Christmas.  To say that I feel like I've been ripped off, even though this game only cost me £1.55 is an understatement.The art style is nice, but it's not easy to see what's going on, and very confusing.  I hate the idea of co-op play on any game, but this game is built around it.  Also, there is never little in the way of telling you what to do, and what is going on.  When you start a game for the first time you except a mini tutorial just to get you started and introduced to some of the basic game mechanics.  No such luck here.This game will live in my game library, and I doubt I'll ever fire it up again.			"

												This game is, without out a shadow of a doubt, one of the most boring games I have ever played. It should have a base price of $3.00, not $15.00. The gameplay is not as fast-paced as one would think a heist game would be. The story is mediocre and very stale. Even with friends, the game is still boring and tedious to play. If I could refund the six dollars I put into it, I would.2/10 would not recommend.			"

You had an objective but the gameplay itself was pretty messy and it was difficult to work with other players. Even joining a game was rather confusing? The lack of instructions kinda surprised me and it really dampened the whole game. In addition to that, everything seemed really repetitive and was pretty boring >__< "

												Had rather high expectations about this game and unfortunately, they never reached that level. I think the biggest problem is the messy graphics thats becomes a big bowl of psychedelic effects when you are up to four players. But in the other hand, we probably play the game the wrong way as the game wanted us to play it. Instead of taking it easy so stressed we around in sheer panic. I will give it one more chance, but for now I can not recommend this game.			"

												A top-down heist with multiplayer! Was interesting to play with friends, but ultimately didn't hold very much interest. Some of the visual cues (like guard sight range) were a little unclear and when combined with a sparse tutorial I overall felt like I was thrown into the deep end too soon. I could see it being fun if everyone in the group put the work into becoming proficient though.			"

												Fun top down bank heist game. Much better if played with someone you know(the lobbys can be pretty empty). Get ready trip alarms and run for the bushes as fast as possible. There are a good number of characters to choose from with fun skills and the game now features a zombie mode so it is twice as long as before. Plus usermade maps for ""endless"" gameplay. Good dialog mixed with some difficult levels but overall a good experience.			"

												It's okay. I wouldnt pay more than a cheap sale price for it (I paid like $1.50 or something). It's a top down game w/ pixelated graphics and it's very simple. Theres 4 classes (locksmith, etc.) and you do these missions where you traverse through structures of traps and bad guys to achieve goals like getting an item or saving some guy.I don't want to rate it poorly b/c it didn't dissapoint me. My expectations were low given it was a cheap game, but overall compared to what other games are available and what you could be spending your time playing, this is pretty boring. "

												Extremely fun and challenging multiplayer game, with the right combination of stressfulness and entertainment that keeps you wanting to play it. I haven't had a whole lot of play time with it, but that's mostly because I want to experience the game with a full party and not just by myself like a lonely loser. Playing with friends is surprisingly balanced for a multiplayer game, and even if everyone has different classes, the game is still difficult and it requires a lot of communication and coordination with your team to get through the heists - that is, if you plan on getting out with everyone alive. Very nice, very pretty, very fun, I can't say I have a single bad thing to say about this game. 10/10 would play again.			"

												Monaco is one of my favorite games, and probably will remain so. From my perspective, its meant to be played co-op and not too seriously. Because it doesn't take itself too seriously. You and three of your friends (or three strangers on the internet) get to run, hide, steal, and generally cavort your way through tons of zany levels. And due to the amazing level editor, the content does not stop when you finish the story mode. Its tons of fun, so go buy it! You won't be disappointed. This game knows that even without the most advanced graphics, perks, or features, its all about gameplay, and Monaco's gameplay cannot be beat.			"

												To call Monaco a stealth game would be like calling a dandelion food. While technically it is, if you are eating a flower you are probably doing it wrong. In the same way, Monaco is more of a cooperitive game then a stealth game. That isn't to say that it's a bad stealth game, in fact it's one of the best that I've ever played. It just that it's so much better with friends. The best parts of the game are when one player saves the rest of the party and completely turn the hiest around. Even playing online is better than playing solo. So if you are looking to spend a weekend with friends, this is the game to play.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic. The ambiance is wonderful, with the music, the guards and NPCs actually speaking french, the vibrant colors contrasting with gray and black, it's really amazing.And the game is SUPER fun, especially when you can get a couple of friends to play with. Nothing is more satisfying than cleaning a place out with a bunch of friends, or pulling off the impossible when saving them in a terrible situation with a combination of stealth, smoke bombs or your character's skills. Walking around the map just avoiding, deactivating the security, dodging guards and running off with the loot, it's all fantastic. Sometimes we start a game thinking, yeah we'll just play a bit, but a few hours later we're still at it. This game can get intense and you just really get into it.If you're wondering if you should buy it, yes you should. I got it on sale, but imo it's 100% worth the full price.			"

												Monaco has the stealth, thievery, backstabbing, and all the rest iconic of it's genre, mixed with the chaotic teamwork that comes from a multiplayer indie. After joining a lobby and choosing a thief to play as, all 4 players are dropped in the entry zone of the mission with a common goal, but different ways to do it. While the mole slowly digs around the conflict, The Locksmith is running for his life from the melee police, the hacker is running to every power point and computer, building an army of viruses, and the pickpocket is using the disguise he found in the guards locker to walk among the rich peacefuls as his monkey hauls in the loot. Next mission: The gentleman is darting from cover to cover, trying to get there before the guards see through his rapidly disentegrating disguise, the redhead noob is trying to to get the guard she has charmed to fight the angry guards shooting at her, and the cleaner is using chloroform on everything between him and the dead lookout he is trying to revive. Once they have gotten back together, The Gentleman stumbles into a laser tripwire and accidentally kills everyone with TNT. The Lookout says he should have gone hacker and the others quit the game. In case you missed my point, the pure chaos of the game mixed with the number of ways to play makes it well worth the cost (while the sale lasts)			"

												Monaco is a great looking game and is VERY fun to play with your friends. You'll find yourself and your friends messing up a couple levels constantly but it only adds to the fun. Usually gives you a good laugh whenever you do something wrong or read something funny in the game. The PvP mode is also very fun to play with your friends and strangers. Gets really intense when you end up having all the trophies. I would recomend this game to anyone who is willing to just have fun and not take a game seriously.9/10			"

												This is one of those games where you can come up to me in, like, 20 years, and say ""Hey, wanna go a few rounds in Monaco?"" and I'll be all like, ""DO I?!?!?"" and we'll play all night long and eat chee-tos and be bestest friends. That's how good this game is. Single player is okay, but multiplayer is where it's at. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a straight stealth game, either! This is a game where getting caught and going ""Screw it, grab the loot and GO!"" is just as much fun as pulling off a perfect heist. I haven't played multiplayer online yet, but I can't imagine it getting much better than playing with your friends in the same room and on the same screen. You should get this game so we can play together. Or better, come over and bring a wired xbox controller so we can get some 3-player action going!			"

												I can't recommend this game enough. Screenshots and videos really just don't capture how well the game recreates the hiest feeling. I've played multiple runs and still revisit it from time to time.In addition to the gameplay the writing is very compelling. The string of hiests follow an appropriate plot with an Rashomon-esque retelling. Though the story would have been interesting on its own it was definitely enhanced by its fusion with the gameplay.Monaco's greatest weakness is that the game tragically degrades in quality when playing by yourself. The formula really shines when you're going at it with friends whether it's using slick coordination or frantically fleeing death.I highly recommend this game if you'll have people to play with. Otherwise it's probably not worth your time.			"

												A Definate Must-Play.Monaco is one of those games that put itself out there to try something new, and it made it through. Monaco, like Minecraft or Team Fortess 2, is one of those games that were inovative and risked being criticized for leaving that line of what has become the cliche' of modern gaming. It is a game of skill and precision, you can't go around kill everything... well... actually, you can, but I wouldn't consider it. Sure, it's not anything to compete against espionage of today like the god-forbidden Splinter Cell, and whatever happened to it's dignity, or Metal Gear Solid, but it is completely worth the $15, it is intensly fun, especially with friends.I recommend that you and a friend buy this game, it's a really good way to spend an afternoon.

												Wysiwygbaby! This game is great. It mixes an interesting story filled with humor and intrigue with fun and challenging gameplay.Monaco allows players to work together with friends or randomly matched online players to attempt to pull off some of the biggest heists the world has ever seen. A selection of characters, each with their own special abilities and personalities, are available for players to choose from to assemble their team. Each level offers new challenges that the team must overcome in order to succeed in pulling off the perfect heist. The game gets hard, particularly in the second plot arc, but it never really gets frustrating. Even when you end up botching a mission terribly, you tend to have a good time doing it. Then it's a matter of reorganizing your strategy, maybe picking up different characters, and throwing yourself back into the breach.The only complaint I have is that some levels seem almost too hard to complete without a full 4-man team. It's simple enough to pick up online players when one does not have enough friends to fill out a party, but sometimes you really just want to play with one or two other people.Overall, whether you are making it to the getaway car with health bars to spare or getting mauled by guard dogs, playing Monaco is always a good experience.

												Monaco is a difficult game to describe because it doesn't fall into a well-tread genre, but it's part puzzle game, part top-down action game, and overall a lot of fun. Up to four players form a team of criminals attempting a heist, and the game is a race to collect all of the money and treasure without getting caught by the gaurds. It's heavily designed around online multiplayer, and the open lobby system makes it easy to get matched up with random partners in crime.One of the best things about the game is how it handles difficulty and varying player skill. Aside from levels that get progressively harder as the storyline unfolds, success in each mission is less about getting through the mission at all and more about doing it as quickly and effeciently as possible. So if you end up with a mix of veteran players and n00bs, everyone can still do their own thing and feel like they are contributing even if some players are doing more of the work. The time/speedrun system works well for replayability, because once you become better at the game it's a lot of fun to use your new skills to plow through some of the earlier levels.There are eight different characters in the game all with different abilities, and the balance between characters is pretty good so that there are not obvious best and worst characters. Also each level has different aspects that can make certain characters more advantageous, although it's always possible to complete the levels with any set characters. There's also an entertaining and somewhat convoluted storyline for the game that gives each character a unique personality.The core gameplay and level design are both top notch and that's why the game makes you want to keep playing levels to try for better times. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action-y games, especially if you are looking for an online co-op game. Even for people who don't generally like online multiplayer games it can be a good intro into that kind of game because you can start out as a novice and not feel like you're in way over your head. Great game and I look forward to more games from Pocketwatch.			"

												Although playing by yourself may be alright, playing with multiple people is fantastic. You work as a team, using various classes, to pull off a heist. It has the potential to be tense and feels like you're a master criminal pulling off a heist, yet there are a few silly things and easter eggs that can break the tension and to provide hilarity. It may take a little bit to learn the game, but there are enough ""classes"" so you can find your niche. Playing it with friends makes it feel rewarding and worth it. I would definitely recommend this game if you and your buddies had a weekend to blow on a fantastic game.			"

												Experience on Linux:+ No issues at all so far.Game:You move around in a 2D maze filled with obstacles. Available tools and strategy will take you through. There's sort of a class system where you can choose your type of player, each has advantages and some unique skillsets. So far it seems to be a matter of personal preference as all the maps I've played can be finished with either ""class"".This is a fun game and it has nice multiplayer support. I don't like the graphics, they get messy at times, but it's managable. The game is super fun to play, even though populated sessions can be hard to find, not enough players. The music is also fun. If you dig hardcore puzzle and stealth games, this is the one to play.Score:4/5			"

												This is one of the best co-op games I've ever played. I really like that it's equally fun to plan and execute missions very smartly, and to run around the level with four people getting chased by everyone. This makes it a brilliant party game, because thinking isn't always required. The different characters are also a great addition to this, everyone will find their favourite very quickly and it really enhances teamwork. But really, just buy this if you like local or online co-op, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Monaco has very simple mechanics: walk into things to use them, line of sight the gaurds/civs, and steal everything of value. The classes pretty much do the same thing as the next class can do but are specialized in some actions. Locksmith picks locks and safes fast, Pickpocket hides in bushes fast, etc etc. Some classes have special abilities as well, like Mole can dig into most walls, Redhead can charm enemies, etc etc.Unlike most stealth games, Monaco doesn't end when you're seen. Your score isn't based on how stealthy you are, but how fast you cleared the level with coins missed adding time. It's a ton of fun when you're with 4 people, alarms are going off, and everybody is disorganized.Despite the simple mechanics, it's a challenging game. Towards the end you're up against SWAT guys with shotguns who can pretty much 2-3 shot you from accross the room so STAY HIDDEN!UPDATE DEC 21 '13: I should note that the game comes out with free updates. Last update came new game mechanics like pickpocketing keys off gaurds to unlock doors in the mission or ""buttcash"" (people used to stand on top of coins, now they have wallets) which should have been in the game from the start but is in now. Last update also nerfed some of the difficulty in a lot of the missions in order to allow for all players to get through the game.			"

												Monaco is a wonderful game and for all you heist loving fans this would be your type of game. It's a stealth co-op game. You cna work together as a team or do it yourself. But it is hard when you only have one person. All the characters are used in this game for different things.Pros:- It's a good game, perfectly made and has a wonderful aspect to it.Cons:- It's a more Team Effort game and not everyone is up for that and it's just hard doing it by yourself and there's not that meny people playing online to do it with. Despite the fact you can't choose servers it just hooks you up to a random one.But overall this game is well done and i recommend this game to people who like a sneaky challange.			"

												It's no exaggeration when GameFront says that Monaco is a strong contender for Game of the Year. It may look like a simple game at first, but Monaco is the most fun you can have, alone or with friends. Multiple well-designed campaigns, a cast of quirky and sometimes lovable characters, and a terrific soundtrack make Monaco one of the must-have games of the year.			"

												Very fun game. At first I was a little unsure about the very simple graphics and top down view, but it works really well and is very crisp/stylistically appealing. My friend and I have fun trying to play stealthily and sneak past guards, but we quickly learned there are some levels where it's just easier to run around like a chicken with its head cut off; both approaches are very fun. Also there are cute small touches that add personality, like the guard character who keeps popping up in every level writing an email to his family why he got fired from his previous job. Really enjoying it so far, A+ .			"

												I admit, I haven't been following Monaco's epic sucess story since the beginning (I actually bought the game on a whim after seeing all the raved reviews), but I do know a thing or two about the game's past. It's the winner of the IGF 2010 grand prize, and that was THE SAME IGF HOLDING FEZ AND THE BINDING OF ISAAC (I think). Now, it's a full-fledged game. The story is a classic story of a bunch of criminals trying to escape Monaco. Stealth is challenging, collecting all of the coins can make your life hell, and the characters all feel unique with specific designs and special abilities. The one thing I didn't like about the game was the art style, because, contrary to the popular belief, I feel that it only really worked for characters and not the environment. Overall, 9/10.			"

												What can I say about Monaco? Well the 2D graphics are simple extraficant and eye catching, smooth and beautiful and also fun to play with. Monaco is a puzzle solving game. One of my favorites.But there are some faults. Like inactivity of NPC. I would love to see something like an NPC in the futher makings of the game. It just fustrates me how you have to play by your self (just one character with one ability) making it hard to solve levels, multiplayer (online people from around the globe) you'll probably get left behind if you suck online, and splitscreen, if you have no friends then thats a big downer.If there were NPC you could solve the levels at you own pace, not getting left behind or waiting for others. You can solve it easily and enjoyably and you can have some friends! No their not real get a life.But in all honesty this game is fully enjoyable and I fully reccomend it to everyone who loves to solve puzzles without the impossible challenges. Monaco earns a good 7/10. Great platformer and I cant wait to see the improvements in the upcomming years.			"

												""Get in, get out, get rich."" What's not to like about a cooperative heist game? This fun game puts you and thee others in a fight to survive an onslaught of guards, dogs, security cameras, and doctors as you steal everything that's not pinned down. Each character has his or her own specialty (and colour) and adds his or her own personal touch to whatever missions you are running. The learning curve is a bit steep, but with some practice, what belongs to others will soon be yours.			"

The single player is also fun, but if you buy this game it is for the multiplayer. There are eight playable characters (four of which you unlock)  all with varying skills and abilities. And on top of all of that it has a great story, told by different points of view, but it is easy to understand without even reading the dialogue. Get it so we can play! 8/10			"

It's not a ""camp in one spot until the guard leaves"" kind of game. You can be really agressive if you want. And best of all: It isn't a linear hand holder.

												This game is wonderful with friends. Plan your moves carefully, craft a clever plan to get the goods undetected and then bask in glow of your accomplishment as you pull it off. Or, more often than not, go on a frenzied panic-fuelled run through the level as you try to lose the angry pursuers. And this is the real strength of the game - having your elaborate (or not, as the case may be) plan fall to pieces does not mean it's time to restart. It means it's time to think on your feet. And that's often more fun.The various classes all distinguish themselves, though some are clearly more or less suited to some levels. The visuals can initially be confusing but it grows on you.			"

Add 3 more players to the games missions and Monaco becomes a slapstick reinactment of Oceans Eleven, with the Mole digging tunnels to evade cameras, the redhead seducing guards and the hacker violating every electrical outlet in range. Its art style, excellent soundtrack and sense of humor seperate Monaco from other games in the stealth genre and provides only what it can deliver, hilarious heist action.A bush is a theives best friend...

												Monaco is an interesting game. It's straight forward gameplay, and level design really sold it for me. Due to the fact that each player has different abilities, each player has a specific role to play. Working as a team takes practice and timing, but is really rewarding at the same time. Yet, you could also just run loose and have crazy missions which are equally as fun.The only areas of the map that you'll see in color is your field of vision, so get use to black and grey layouts. While I haven't beaten this game 100% completely, it is still in my top 25 games.The only problem I had with it is that finding a group to play with can be difficult at times, and if you lack any way to communicate, then you'll have to play the game by ear.Overall I give it a 4/5.

Be sure to get this game on sale, right now as I'm posting this, it's $3.74 USD, until April 7th 2014. Anyone wondering if they should fork over the couple of bucks, my answer is yes! Don't hesitate.			"

												One of the best, if not THE best Co-Op game out there. The classes' abilities are unique, and beating a particularly hard level (Such as Identity) is incredibly satisfying.Definitely get the 4-pack for this; the game is at its best when playing with friends who are at the same skill level as you.The game is designed so a lot of the levels can't be ghosted, so players need to blend stealth with strategy and intelligent item usage. It's difficult to understand what's going on at first, but it is worth the $15 without any doubt.			"

												This game is multiplayer stealth that works. As if that alone wasn't enough of a reason for you to check this game out, it's also crazy amounts of fun. I say best played in a group of people you know, or with a mic, but even then, so much fun. Highly reccommend.			"

												This is a backlog review for me of a game played in 2016 that came out much earlier.  It's not meant to reflect the release experience of the game, but merely how i feel playing it for my own enjoyment as almost sunk cost in 2016.Gameplay: 6/10.  It's actually pretty fun to solve these 2d stealth puzzles and collect the coins.  There's nearly no variety between the classes that makes me feel like I'm doing something special or cooperative in the heists.  There aren't any customization options to speak of.  There's no depth in the stealth-alert system.  There is no real distinguishing features between the weapons or loadouts.  It's very simple.  There's no plot to speak of, and it doesn't feel like I'm engaged in the gameplay.Sound: 9/10.  The sound is beautiful.  The french classique motif is really fun and engaging.  It holds the whole game together with how immersive it is.  You'll enjoy the patois of french-english that the characters speak as you surprise them.Graphic Presentation:  6/10.  It's pixel art, but it works.  They've designed the game in a way that has good humor from the pixel art system, and the whimsy from the pixel art goes top down through the rest of the game.  It's objectively well presented as pixel, but it still feels like other games have improved on this system and done a lot more with the 2D stealth genre (such as Klei's near-perfect Invisible, Inc. to which this game invites comparison).  I will further add that the pixel art is necessary to the presentation of the game, rather than being a result of cost-cutting laziness, and I have considered that and awarded score for the unity of the styling instead of detracting because it is so simple.Replayability: 4/10.  There's really just not much here.  There are a few maps that you can go through, collect coins and attempt to get a good timed score.  You're pulling off 2-D heists, but there is absolutely, and I mean absolutely no challenge.  It's fun for an hour or two, but honestly it feels like these people are letting you take their stuff.  The characters are rough sketches of heist tropes, and while games like Team Fortress 2 have trope characters that have great personalities that engage with sketch humor and are very memorable (the Heavy coming immediately to mind), Monaco's characters are all really bland.  The Gentleman doesn't make you feel like he's above everyone else.  The Safecracker isn't an obsessive compuslive cretin.  The Lookout has almost no lines at all.Overall: 6/10.  It's cute.  It's fun.  You'll have two hours of fun, maybe more out of it.  It might be fun to play with some friends that are very casual gamers, or you could get your little sibling to play with you.  There is room for a nice and easy casual puzzle game.  When you compare it to better games in its genre, like Invisible, Inc., or better pixel multiplayer games, like Risk of Rain, or very casual cooperative games, like Terraria or Trine, it just falls short.

												Monaco has the stealth, thievery, backstabbing, and all the rest iconic of it's genre, mixed with the chaotic teamwork that comes from a multiplayer indie. After joining a lobby and choosing a thief to play as, all 4 players are dropped in the entry zone of the mission with a common goal, but different ways to do it. While the mole slowly digs around the conflict, The Locksmith is running for his life from the melee police, the hacker is running to every power point and computer, building an army of viruses, and the pickpocket is using the disguise he found in the guards locker to walk among the rich peacefuls as his monkey hauls in the loot. Next mission: The gentleman is darting from cover to cover, trying to get there before the guards see through his rapidly disentegrating disguise, the redhead noob is trying to to get the guard she has charmed to fight the angry guards shooting at her, and the cleaner is using chloroform on everything between him and the dead lookout he is trying to revive. Once they have gotten back together, The Gentleman stumbles into a laser tripwire and accidentally kills everyone with TNT. The Lookout says he should have gone hacker and the others quit the game. In case you missed my point, the pure chaos of the game mixed with the number of ways to play makes it well worth the cost (while the sale lasts)			"

												Hailll yisss, Monaco is my jam. Make sure you have a friend or two to play with! I had fun playing with strangers online, but the fun is amped up when you have a true partner in crime. You'll sneak your way through buildings, pulling heists, grabbing cash, causing distractions and making a clean getaway.It's one of those games where each level can be completed in a variety of manners and it's fun enough that you actually want to try each solution. Five bags of popcorn.			"

												When I first got Monaco , I found it boring. I'm not an experienced gamer , and didn't know much about Monaco itself . I struggled a bit and didn't know how to go online .However , after about half a year of not playing it , I decided to give it another go . I loved it . I was hit with an exciting stealth game , which was cunningly designed . I adore the look of the game and its great how each character has its own little personality. But I have to say online mode is the best . Its not about stealth - its about set all the alarms of and run . I must've spent hours online playing with people all around the world , howling with laughter one minute , then reviving a player the next minute. The whole design of the game mixed with the beautiful music makes it a really good game to play alone , or multiplayer . Apart from the occasional crash ( after returning to desktop a few times it fixes it ) ,and not being able to make my own levels ( for some reason this just didn't work ) the whole game ran smoothly for me . I definately reccomend this game to anyone !			"

It has a nice sound track. The smooth jazz always fits in with the sneaking or even the running. And the charactors all have that special layout. If i could rate this game i would give it a 10/10. I recomend this game to friends. And even if on youtube the sound track and the gameplay will give it that feeling of suspence or suspicouseness in the game. All i have to say now is.... Nicely done.			"

												Interesting heist game that is best played with friends. Multiple heist characters to choose from and stealth is essential in the game. You can't expect to run through and entire room without guards noticing you. Line of sight is especially important as you can lose your pursuers by hiding in a room or behind a pillar.It takes some time to get used to the top down view though, some stuff can get cluttered and new players i've noticed kept getting lost.All in all its fun and i recommend you get it if you don't mind Bit-styled teamwork.

												Had tons of fun playing this game. I'd reccomend doing a solo playthrough to get the basics down and then hoping into an online multiplayer game. that's where all the fun is to be had. I liked the different character mechanics/skills which lends well to a team based game. The additional level modes (classic, zombie, and upgraded) add new flavor to the missions. Connecting to and hosting online games is super easy. which in my opinion is the best part of the game.While doing a solo run is pretty fun i higlhy recommend playing this with a groupd of friends or play with people online. that's where this game really shines.

												To be honest I didn't get this game at first. I selected a character (role) and waited for ages for it to determine when everyone was ready. Then after that I spent a minute looking at an image. I couldn't tell if the game was loading or just froze.After playing a couple of games, I got the hang of the game and didn't really like it. I didn't feel like the I was playing with a team of people, just some other people randomly running around the map with me.I don't know if I could select a different server, but at times the lag just made the game almost impossible to play.I cannot recommend this game for anyone.

Easy to connect. Several different playable characters. Zonaco, a zombie version of the game which is interesting. A PvP aspect which is fun if played with friends. Very easy to fun. Never crashes.Cons : Not fun alone. Can be aggravating, but that's just a player preference kind of thing.			"

												A top-down third person version of the Payday series, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play among friends. Relatively easy to learn as well and has a variety of game modes and community mods to ensure you neevr get bored.The mechanics of the game are fairly simplistic and easy to understand and remain constant for most parts of the game. The only thing that needs improvement would probably be the connection system. It took me 20 mins on my first try to create a room and start a game with friends. The gameplay afterwards made this mishap relatively forgiving though.8/10, strongly recommended for groups of friends of all ages.			"

												A Definate Must-Play.Monaco is one of those games that put itself out there to try something new, and it made it through. Monaco, like Minecraft or Team Fortess 2, is one of those games that were inovative and risked being criticized for leaving that line of what has become the cliche' of modern gaming. It is a game of skill and precision, you can't go around kill everything... well... actually, you can, but I wouldn't consider it. Sure, it's not anything to compete against espionage of today like the god-forbidden Splinter Cell, and whatever happened to it's dignity, or Metal Gear Solid, but it is completely worth the $15, it is intensly fun, especially with friends.I recommend that you and a friend buy this game, it's a really good way to spend an afternoon.

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is a stealth/action singleplayer & co-op game developed by Pocketwatch Games featuring eight playable characters, each with their own specialty, as well as a lot of levels within the campaigns to keep one busy for hours on end (not including the MANY user-created levels made with the very well-done built-in level creator). Playing the levels with each character is like a different experience on it's own, which doesn't include the experience you and your friends could enjoy with the awesome co-op. Add to that Monaco can be (and is for me) a VERY addicting game with a nice soundtrack that fits completely and you have yourself a game worth every penny. Buy it now or it'll be your loss!			"

												Great game if your palying alone or with 3 buddies. you can choose to be either sneaky and silent or barge right through the misson not caring if guards see you! And the level creater is really cool too, but hard to get the hang of, and it takes an incredibly long time to create a level because of the way they set it up, but i still recomend this because the level editor is not really part of the game. the story is not really in depth and should not be the reason to buy this game, the way the game plays and how awsomly fun it is to play should be the thing that someone interested in buying this game should pay attention to!

												Really good with a friend or two. I wouldn't recommend getting it if you're going to be playing alone, but if you have a friend, definitely think about picking Monaco up. The game has a substantial amount of content for its relatively low price. Took me about 8 hours to finish the main campaign. After you complete the main campaign, a ""hard mode"" of sorts is unlocked, featuring maps from the original campaign, just with a higher difficulty. There are also bonus maps added in an update. Everything considered, I think you should be able to expect at least 15 hours of content.			"

												This is a fun, exciting game. It's not Payday, nor is it Left 4 Dead, but it's a fast paced multiplayer experience just the same. While it may be tough to get into if you're not used to overhead 2D graphics, it's quite enjoyable once you get used to it.My main greivance is the lack of a single player mode, and that you need to play with others. If you're as bad as I am, it's embarrasing to die in front of others. Yet, I understand that programming AI for a heist game is pretty tough, and must be even more so for indie devs.If you're not into playing face paced, quick games; this is not the game for you. However, if you're willing to give it a try, you'll find this game to be more than enjoyable, and what it lacks in a single player mode, it more than makes up for in the artistic sytle and captivating environment and music it provides.Overall, I give it a 4.25/5.

												Honestly, I can't recommend this game.  The concepts and mechanics of the game are not immediatly clear, and once they become clear you start to realize that the game was almost entirely created for multiplay.  Where this wouldn't normally be an issue, it becomes one when you sit in lobbies waiting for randoms to join, or you try to convince your friends to play only to find out they don't have access to the level you want to play.  I like the concept of the game though, very ""clue"" like and it was fun to play with a few friends over local multiplayer.  But towards the end it becomes repetitive, I got bored real quickly and will likely only revisit it if someone asks me to play with them.			"

												Let me tell you this game. THIS. GAME. Its super rad. I don't tend to latch on to stealth games or online games that make you follow the story, but Monaco is one that I was able to do just that. Each class is useful with none being better than the other, and the combinations that you can use in this game really makes is a game you can play with anyone! I highley recommend this game and I highly recommend you get other people to play it with you!			"

												This is my favorite game i've found on steam so far. Basically it is a stealth game, with great co-op and pvp multiplayer, where you basically conduct heists. The single player is also fun, but if you buy this game it is for the multiplayer. There are eight playable characters (four of which you unlock)  all with varying skills and abilities. And on top of all of that it has a great story, told by different points of view, but it is easy to understand without even reading the dialogue. Get it so we can play! 8/10			"

												Monaco is a whismical, colorfully violent game.  It boasts an intriguing story, one-of-a-kind art direction and soundtrack, and the kind of cooperative gameplay and mechanics we haven't seen since Gauntlet: Dark Legacy.  It improves on that formula in almost every aspect, bringing true cooperation to the modern era outside of Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2.  Every character has their own distincy personality, color and playstyle, and it's super fun to figure out which one would be best for each encounter.  A single round can turn from meticulous planning to outright chaos in seconds, and no matter how you play, it's just a blast.    And what's even cooler, is that the community is the most civil I've ever seen.  Perhaps it's the lack of a competitive element, or how it's impossible to do well solo, but people just love this game, and are super cool about who plays as who.  TL;DR:  BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.			"

												Monaco is one of those rare multiplayer experiences where everything goes from ok to ""everythings on fire, and all we have is oil to put it out"" and you love every minute of it. The characters you choose from each have their own unique strengths, and often you'll find yourself choosing a specific one that matches your playstyle. The music is very well done, changing based on the situation but never feeling intrusive. Lastyly i've never joked about chloroforming people as often as i have in this game.

												Every positive review of this game is spot-on, but I just didn't like it as much as I hoped.I love 2d retro games, but Monaco (single player mode) quickly came to feel repetitive. The characters are actually very diverse, and the life system (losing one character allows continuing with a different one from the same stage) forces you to adapt and make long-term strategies.But eventually every level felt like ""hide as long as you can, then run as fast as you can, then hide until they forget you. Rinse wash and repeat.""The developers did a great job, but Monaco has made me wary of future purchases based just on cool graphics and a neat concept.			"

												Fast paced and crazy while maintaining a level of strategy, this game is fantastic.  The multiplayer is where it especially excels.  The cast of characters each has a unique feel and are suited for different approaches to getting through the level.  All of this with an excellent musical backing.

												WELCOME! FlamerJoe here with the half♥♥♥♥♥review of 8bit-MMO since you wanted me to review this piece of junk,I have to do it...I guess.It is made by the quote 'company' quote called Archive Entertainment.Which seems to be owner of the previous games like..Nothing.What the duck.Before,I actually start the review of this game I will see what I can see from store page,uh it is free to play that seems fine but there must besomething behind this greatness...UH THERE IT IS! STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK BASIC aand as you guys asked for it STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK DELUXE which includesdifferent amounts of gold and plats and exclusive hats!Waow,I mean everyone likes hats.Alright let's not keep our expections high and we should be fine.*OPENS THE GAME*Alright,so game asks me to create an account even though I am connected to this game through steam,that means nothing to the game.Oh there it is.Select a Server...There are 2 servers I guess Primary and Potato!?!..*sighs*....Aight whatever.OH...MY...GOD..This looping music,it is so...arcadeno that is not the word,so annoying,yeah that is right.There better be a mute option for this music,oh there we go.Wait a minute..That graphic oh my god,is that 3d or 2d I mean while you were developing the game you went like,♥♥♥♥ it let's mix them up oh by the way let's fool these idiots by calling this game 8-bit and MMO but let's not include them all HAHAHAH- alright.Hmm W,A,S,D = Movement E= Use Door/ Talk THIS IS THE BEST TUTORIAL SEGMENT EVER! No not really.Alright let's talk to this NPCwith the quote 'tutorial' bubble.Go on.Head up through those doors and speak with me in the kichen.*SARCASTIC VOICE* No' don't ask me how I'll alreadybe there when you arrive. Shh. HAH DID YOU SEE THAT IS HUMOOOOOR NO,JUST NO PLEASE GOD NO.Alright this guy seems to be 2 meters in front of the placeI just was.Hmm let's check what he gotta see..You survived the great and treacherous journey to my kitchen.Truly you are brave enough to be the hero!Etc,etc,now get out.Oh the developers of the game did not just call this game player-created world and made the enviroment half♥♥♥♥♥now they were too lazy to write a dialouge between me and the NPC.That is it ladies and gentelmen,this is what we get.Alrighty,I got my first quest which is to slay 5 Slugs and come back.How originaş.Almost forgot,since the developers are too ♥♥♥♥ing lazy to get a minimapat the corner of your screen they just tell the locations of these objects,NPC's,enemies simply like Head to pantry (south-east),I can finally understandhow much hardwork went in to this game but if you are looking for a map you could simply click map BEFORE you enter the game from servers section and get a GOOGLE EARTH style map from your internet explorer.Alright there is one slug,let's attack him,hmm.. space bar to attack with your sword.What the ♥♥♥♥,did I just poke it with my sword and it just faded away in a paint of red.WAOW,you get everythingyou wish for.And those sound effects there are only 2 kind of SOUND EFFECTS IN THE WHOLE GAME, and that is the sound you get from attacking or getting attacked.WHERE DID YOU FIND THESE ATTACK SOUNDS from freesounds.org? Oh my god this humor in this game would be better if it did NOT exist.So after I choose respawn (root) I get teleported to a place kind of like lobby where I see RobbyZ the guy from the beggining.By the way there are no in-game real characters so developers decided to put their nicknames in the game because you know it is more harder that way to make a decent story or maybe even a decent townkeeper.NO.HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.Alright let's not go that harsh on the game maybe player made world is actually made better than those developer's intro buildings lobby and that kind of stuff.So I am simply going to uninstall this game so I won't go harsh on it and It won't be able to go harsh on me either.That is it ladies and gents! As a result:I would say OH GOD PLEASE NO PLEASE OH GOD NOOOOO (OFFICE)

												In the beginning you choose between 4 or 5 characters that have each its particular advantages in completing the levels. As you progress through the game you unlock new characters with new capabilities.Great for teamplay and plan devising. It's a game that works both well for casual and hardcore gamers, I like to play for the fun, not minding to complete the level perfectly, just doing it is fine, but I see teams that are very well planned and are designed to finish the levels in the fastest way possible so that's great too.

												This game has great content and a great editor. If you just want the game for only the campaign and the story line then this game is great for you. If you want to be able to download player-made maps and make your own map, then don't get this game. Whenever you make a map, the map gets corrupted if you don't make it correctly and you will have to restarted the entire game. Whenever you download a player-made map, the same thing will happen. Hopefully they fix this somehow. Bugs aside Monaco is a great campagin coop game and has a great storyline.			"

												This is my favorite game i've found on steam so far. Basically it is a stealth game, with great co-op and pvp multiplayer, where you basically conduct heists. The single player is also fun, but if you buy this game it is for the multiplayer. There are eight playable characters (four of which you unlock)  all with varying skills and abilities. And on top of all of that it has a great story, told by different points of view, but it is easy to understand without even reading the dialogue. Get it so we can play! 8/10			"

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is a stealth/action singleplayer & co-op game developed by Pocketwatch Games featuring eight playable characters, each with their own specialty, as well as a lot of levels within the campaigns to keep one busy for hours on end (not including the MANY user-created levels made with the very well-done built-in level creator). Playing the levels with each character is like a different experience on it's own, which doesn't include the experience you and your friends could enjoy with the awesome co-op. Add to that Monaco can be (and is for me) a VERY addicting game with a nice soundtrack that fits completely and you have yourself a game worth every penny. Buy it now or it'll be your loss!			"

												Great game if your palying alone or with 3 buddies. you can choose to be either sneaky and silent or barge right through the misson not caring if guards see you! And the level creater is really cool too, but hard to get the hang of, and it takes an incredibly long time to create a level because of the way they set it up, but i still recomend this because the level editor is not really part of the game. the story is not really in depth and should not be the reason to buy this game, the way the game plays and how awsomly fun it is to play should be the thing that someone interested in buying this game should pay attention to!

												This is a fantastic game, singleplayer OR multiplayer. As you play through the campaign, you unlock new characters, each one completely different than the last! The 'heist' gameplay style is very unique and innovative, and the plot is not just a cliche story somebody thought up in two minutes. Every character has a plyable backstory, each one very well-thought-out. The only downside of this game is that the level editor has a very confusing and non-user-friendly interface. Otherwise, I completely recommend this game to anyone who is tired of cliche shooter heist games with no real strategy. 8.5/10			"

It's a great game to play with friends and if you can have all your friends playing in a 4 player co-op, your in for a good time, the game though has a lot of re-play-ability trying to beat other players times on levels a well.

It is a more flashy version of THE MASTERPLAN, with no crash and the multiplayer bonus.The game has multiple unique characters which translate to supporting different play styles. The game essentially stealth heist, but has multiple variations of stealth, such as seduction, disguise, demolition, hacking, etcPros:-Multiplayer :D-Even for $17 CAD, still wurf-Amazing visuals with low graphic requirements-Supports multiple play styles, but essentially still stealth-Comedic narrativeCons:-Since the last time I played, I don't remember having anyOverall:Buy it, your life is not complete as a stealth gamer without this :D			"

												Very fun game. At first I was a little unsure about the very simple graphics and top down view, but it works really well and is very crisp/stylistically appealing. My friend and I have fun trying to play stealthily and sneak past guards, but we quickly learned there are some levels where it's just easier to run around like a chicken with its head cut off; both approaches are very fun. Also there are cute small touches that add personality, like the guard character who keeps popping up in every level writing an email to his family why he got fired from his previous job. Really enjoying it so far, A+ .			"

												This game is a game that you sort of have to play with 3 friends to really get the most out of it. you COULD play online with strangers and you COULD play alone but it's simply way less fun.Anyways, tight feel to the game and unforgiving gameplay with definitely a lot of replay value if you and your friends really like to speedrun things. However this game isn't for everyone. It's NOT casual and it's VERY co-op heavy.Oh and the music is great.			"

												Monaco is one of those titles that comes around only every so often...It's a fast paced single/multiplayer heist game filled with nonsensical shenanigans that will keep you coming back for more each time. Regardless of if you play the campaign alone or with friends it's definitely a purchase worth investing in for the long term. You'll see yourself going through the levels again and again for either new experiences or to finish higher in the leaderboards that are availible. Sometimes you'll find yourself running around like crazy as guards or agents chase after you to throw you in the slammer...other times you'll approach the level very stealthily with little or no contact with the NPCs in the game. Monaco offers a variety of ways to achieve it's one goal which is to get the loot/gold to complete the level and to get the hell out of there! Whether or not you like the art style or even some of the other small nuances of the game it's definitely worth the buy to try out! (Personally I give it a 4.5/5, one of the best 2D co-operative games out there in terms of indie games).			"

												Monaco is a neon-blooded marriage of Pac-Man and Thief, a grand tribute both to 1920s silent comedy capers and to modern-day heist movies. It's Ocean's Eleven meets Keystone Cops, played out top-down in a world of living blueprints. It's a criminal take on Laurel and Hardy, except with a four-man band instead of the dysfunctional duo. By and large, Monaco is one of those rare games that somehow stay magnificent regardless of whether you're getting things right or your mission has turned into an eight-lane car crash.""Monaco stays magnificent regardless of whether you're getting things right.""And crashes of the non-software-related variety will happen in abundance. With Monaco's minimal approach to player guidance, the only way you're going to figure anything out is through trial and disaster. Have a Hacker (one of the game's many playable characters) interact with a power outlet and watch as sensors go out and security cameras turn friendly. Walk across a red panel and discover that there are, indeed, pressure plates connected to the security system.The missions are all performed to a similar tune: get in, get the prize, get out. Or, in some instances, simply get out. You start in a safe area of the level, surrounded by items that you can take along with you. Once you've selected your weapon (or non-combat item of choice), it is your prerogative to determine what 'getting in' will actually entail. Do you cut through a queue at the local nightclub or do you sneak through a locked door on the other side? Though all the levels operate in largely the same way, there's sufficient diversity in the contents of each to make every playthrough outright enthralling. Should you circle around the main area of the map and inch towards the safe on the third floor, or do you take a quick detour through the guard-infested inventory room? (Hint: don't do that second one.) Your choice, your years behind bars, monsieur.			"

												Monaco is a fast-ish game it is challinging but fair at the same time it never gets boring with it's no-stop thrills and frustrating but just enough enemy layout. The enemies arn't just placed like all over the place but instead you see them where you would actually see police which adds to the emursian of the game. Speaking of which the emursian in the game is fantastic eventhough is never takes it's self to seriously. I would strongly recomend buying this gem if you don't have it already, and look at Pocket Watches other games if your into realtime stratagy.			"

It's fun to try and be stealthy, but it's equally as exciting to try to run and gun through the map. Or do both, just hide really well after running and gunning and you can go back to being stealthy haha.			"

Monaco is a top-down stealth/action game. I had a lot of fun with it, but it can be boring under the wrong circumstances. tl;dr: this is a top-down tactical stealth game, it's by far the most fun with a friend in 2-player mode, and you should experiment with different characters.Single-player runs are a bit too predictable and straightforward, and every mission will feel just like more of the same thing. Multiplayer is much more interesting - it's moments like sneaking in to steal the treasure while a friend stands guard and another hacks the security, or splitting up to clean out an entire floor within a minute, that make this game worth playing.On the other hand, groups of too many (inexperienced) players are likely to get in each others' way and spend too much time being discovered to get anything done. Two coordinated, voice-chatting players are the best for combining your characters' abilities successfully and pulling off your own strategy together.On the other hand: While smooth and coordinated runs are very satisfying, it can also be fun to treat Monaco as a party game and frantically stumble through a level with four players and swarms of guards behind you.The graphics are stylish, unique and do their purpose, but a bit taxing on the eyes and take a while to get used to. The music fits the heist setting, but there's not enough of it. The story also helps to set the mood, and while it's not important, I'm glad that it's there because it gives the missions context.Stealing money slowly grants you additional tool uses/ammunition, so raiding optional rooms is actually rewarded within missions and it can be advantageous to do so and e. g. gather additional EMP charges before taking on the main vault's motion detectors.This means that while skilled maneuvering is still a focal point, threat assessment and careful planning are just as essential.While the core stealth gameplay always remains similar, the 8 characters' special abilities have a huge influence on which path and approach you can take to beating the level. One team may allow you to tunnel towards the objective past a large portion of the treasure and just run past the guards that remain in your way, while another one relies on luring them one by one and knocking them out so no one's even awake to answer the alarm.Monaco is fairly forgiving for a stealth game - getting detected early on hardly ever means having to restart a level in advance.It does get kind of boring how easily you can disperse attention by crawling into ventilation ducts and waiting.The normal price is a bit high because the game only shines if you buy a second copy for a friend, but I very highly recommend buying this when it's on sale if you're into strategic, sometimes chaotic co-op action.

If you fail a mission just a click away and your trying it again. missions are quite short so you can blow through them (literally for a few of them). Had trouble getting groups of 4 but when they were together they were great. Groups of 3 or 2 are much more common and just as intense.			"

												Monaco: whats's yours is mine is a brilliant game that will cause you do work together with friends and share the paranoia with them as you just quiety say ""footsteps.. Over there.."" I have only played online with one other player and it is extremely exciting but it does have the occasional bug of droping the person that is not host even though the person I am playing with isn't even out of my own state.I do reccomend it because:1. The art style is likeable and nice to look at2. the voice acting is a bit funny to me and I like that.3.The co-op is exhilaratingly fun4. The story and singleplayer are grand!8.5/10 on my book.

												A top-down third person version of the Payday series, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play among friends. Relatively easy to learn as well and has a variety of game modes and community mods to ensure you neevr get bored.The mechanics of the game are fairly simplistic and easy to understand and remain constant for most parts of the game. The only thing that needs improvement would probably be the connection system. It took me 20 mins on my first try to create a room and start a game with friends. The gameplay afterwards made this mishap relatively forgiving though.8/10, strongly recommended for groups of friends of all ages.			"

												Monaco is a fast-ish game it is challinging but fair at the same time it never gets boring with it's no-stop thrills and frustrating but just enough enemy layout. The enemies arn't just placed like all over the place but instead you see them where you would actually see police which adds to the emursian of the game. Speaking of which the emursian in the game is fantastic eventhough is never takes it's self to seriously. I would strongly recomend buying this gem if you don't have it already, and look at Pocket Watches other games if your into realtime stratagy.			"

												 Would I reccomend this? YES; there is a good reason why. As much as this game is a stealth-based game involving robbery, this game is still pretty dang good, and it proves that you don't need the best graphics, to play excellent games! While nothing phenomenal, I also reccomend this game, because it supports Steam Workshop! Increasing replay value, even further! And what's interesting, is that unlike some games, this is what Metal Gear could've been, if it were strictly based on robbery, rather than bossfights. But it's also a bit trickier, and definitely worth checking out! It even has multi-player support, from what I believe.			"

												It's a cool game that works perfectly both playing on your own and with some friends.The single player experience is really fun and invites you to try to beat the levels with all the different characters - depending who you choose to play as the experience will change but at least on most of the levels it will always feel fair too.Multiplayer, at least with a group of friends, is an even more fun, sometimes chaotic beast - not that this is a bad thing.Great music, great visuals (although they might be a bit confusing at first) and artistic direction... A great game indeed			"

												WELCOME! FlamerJoe here with the half♥♥♥♥♥review of 8bit-MMO since you wanted me to review this piece of junk,I have to do it...I guess.It is made by the quote 'company' quote called Archive Entertainment.Which seems to be owner of the previous games like..Nothing.What the duck.Before,I actually start the review of this game I will see what I can see from store page,uh it is free to play that seems fine but there must besomething behind this greatness...UH THERE IT IS! STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK BASIC aand as you guys asked for it STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK DELUXE which includesdifferent amounts of gold and plats and exclusive hats!Waow,I mean everyone likes hats.Alright let's not keep our expections high and we should be fine.*OPENS THE GAME*Alright,so game asks me to create an account even though I am connected to this game through steam,that means nothing to the game.Oh there it is.Select a Server...There are 2 servers I guess Primary and Potato!?!..*sighs*....Aight whatever.OH...MY...GOD..This looping music,it is so...arcadeno that is not the word,so annoying,yeah that is right.There better be a mute option for this music,oh there we go.Wait a minute..That graphic oh my god,is that 3d or 2d I mean while you were developing the game you went like,♥♥♥♥ it let's mix them up oh by the way let's fool these idiots by calling this game 8-bit and MMO but let's not include them all HAHAHAH- alright.Hmm W,A,S,D = Movement E= Use Door/ Talk THIS IS THE BEST TUTORIAL SEGMENT EVER! No not really.Alright let's talk to this NPCwith the quote 'tutorial' bubble.Go on.Head up through those doors and speak with me in the kichen.*SARCASTIC VOICE* No' don't ask me how I'll alreadybe there when you arrive. Shh. HAH DID YOU SEE THAT IS HUMOOOOOR NO,JUST NO PLEASE GOD NO.Alright this guy seems to be 2 meters in front of the placeI just was.Hmm let's check what he gotta see..You survived the great and treacherous journey to my kitchen.Truly you are brave enough to be the hero!Etc,etc,now get out.Oh the developers of the game did not just call this game player-created world and made the enviroment half♥♥♥♥♥now they were too lazy to write a dialouge between me and the NPC.That is it ladies and gentelmen,this is what we get.Alrighty,I got my first quest which is to slay 5 Slugs and come back.How originaş.Almost forgot,since the developers are too ♥♥♥♥ing lazy to get a minimapat the corner of your screen they just tell the locations of these objects,NPC's,enemies simply like Head to pantry (south-east),I can finally understandhow much hardwork went in to this game but if you are looking for a map you could simply click map BEFORE you enter the game from servers section and get a GOOGLE EARTH style map from your internet explorer.Alright there is one slug,let's attack him,hmm.. space bar to attack with your sword.What the ♥♥♥♥,did I just poke it with my sword and it just faded away in a paint of red.WAOW,you get everythingyou wish for.And those sound effects there are only 2 kind of SOUND EFFECTS IN THE WHOLE GAME, and that is the sound you get from attacking or getting attacked.WHERE DID YOU FIND THESE ATTACK SOUNDS from freesounds.org? Oh my god this humor in this game would be better if it did NOT exist.So after I choose respawn (root) I get teleported to a place kind of like lobby where I see RobbyZ the guy from the beggining.By the way there are no in-game real characters so developers decided to put their nicknames in the game because you know it is more harder that way to make a decent story or maybe even a decent townkeeper.NO.HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.Alright let's not go that harsh on the game maybe player made world is actually made better than those developer's intro buildings lobby and that kind of stuff.So I am simply going to uninstall this game so I won't go harsh on it and It won't be able to go harsh on me either.That is it ladies and gents! As a result:I would say OH GOD PLEASE NO PLEASE OH GOD NOOOOO (OFFICE)

Though top-down games normally look terrible, the art style here looks great in motion, as the map changes depending on line of sight and even hearing to give a fog of war that's not annoying at all, but accurately reflects the character's senses.

												For me Monaco is the Game of the Year 2013 and it's also one of the best games I've ever played. Whether you like to play games casually or competitively, Monaco delivers them big time. Just when you have 100% completed the game with your sneaky and stealthy strategies you will find out that there is also a lively speedrunning community which tries to push quickness to it's limits all the time and all over again. You cannot even think of how competitive this game is after you have grinded one level for hours just to get that world record. Moreover, if you have friends to play with the fun is suddenly doubled. Planning crazy heists or speedruns with friends absurdly pleasant and after you get fed up with your constantly dying team mates you can turn them into foes in multiple PvP maps!All in all, Monaco is tons of fun and laugh no matter how you play it. It's definitely worth couple of bucks (and it's on sale ALL THE FREAKING TIME) and for me one of the best video games I've ever witnessed.			"

If you can look over a game's graphics and go ""hose gameplay mechanics equal a jolly, good time"" then welcome to Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine! Yes, the graphics are pixelated, but that just makes it more stylish, cartoony and unique. The stealth in the game is great and the characters all have perks that can help with the stealth. You can arm yourself with shotguns, crossbows and smokebombs, and get ready to steal some swanky stuff. Have I sold you yet? No? Just watch the trailer and listen to the Gentleman's smooth voice. That'll sell you.			"

												Fast paced and crazy while maintaining a level of strategy, this game is fantastic.  The multiplayer is where it especially excels.  The cast of characters each has a unique feel and are suited for different approaches to getting through the level.  All of this with an excellent musical backing.

												Every positive review of this game is spot-on, but I just didn't like it as much as I hoped.I love 2d retro games, but Monaco (single player mode) quickly came to feel repetitive. The characters are actually very diverse, and the life system (losing one character allows continuing with a different one from the same stage) forces you to adapt and make long-term strategies.But eventually every level felt like ""hide as long as you can, then run as fast as you can, then hide until they forget you. Rinse wash and repeat.""The developers did a great job, but Monaco has made me wary of future purchases based just on cool graphics and a neat concept.			"

												Amazing Game! No complaints at all! if you like stealth games, then this is the game for you. This game has brought me alot of fun alone and with friends! Graphics are amazing and can run on almost any PC. Challenges around every corner. i used to play this game on a console but since i got it back on PC it is amazing to play again! The community maps are a great addition towards the game making it so that you donèt have to replay all the basic missions. the character spread is a difficult choice to make, and you'll probably end up hating your choice, but thatès what make it more of a challenge. Every aspect of this game is amazing! no complaints at all! 10/10 Would buy it again. ~NaiVe			"

												Don't try playing this on your own. You need friends to revive you (a lot) and show you where to run (all the time) and save your butt from guards, dogs, lasers and knockout darts (heaps). On the downside they usually insult you as you're struggling to remember which way to run next.I mean the friends insult you, not the guards, the dogs, the lasers or the knockout darts.			"

												A great top down heist game with different classes that each have useful ablilities. Later levels take alot of patience and thought to even complete, let alone get all the coins. There are a variety of different levels and eneymy types, keeping the gameplay fresh even in singleplayer, though this game is best played with friends. Stealth is your best friend in this game, and getting caught is almost always your faultI'd recommend this game to anyone who wants a good heist game			"

												I like and respect this game. Unfortunately, a lot of the multiplayer community is gone, which leaves the cooperative aspect fairly limited.Edit: The multiplayer community comes and goes when this game goes on sale.Why I like it: Gameplay is how you choose to play, which gives a great open environment feel that lets an action game be an adventure game if you want it to be. As you progress into the story, there's a lot of flexibility on how you can play, which even furthers this feeling of open environment. Almost anything can be destroyed or mined through, and can, in some regards, be looked at as a scaled down, 2D version of Payday.Why I respect it: This game is the embodiment of the idea that not all great games need great models. A lot of the game is basic pixels scaled up. There are no flashy skins or gorgeous maps. The atmosphere fits the game perfectly, and playing it just feels right. It's hard to explain why this game feels good to play - stealth, fighting, sneaking around, all packed into an 8-bit-style game about robbery.As a single player experience, it's not bad. But where this game really shines is multiplayer.			"

Good music, looks nice, and the sound effects are pretty funny (snapping necks as the cleaner and reviving people, for instance). Get it if you have a friend (or friends) who will play it with you.

This game has GREAT controller support, so if you have a USB controller, you'll enjoy this game more in my opinion. Be sure to get this game on sale, right now as I'm posting this, it's $3.74 USD, until April 7th 2014. Anyone wondering if they should fork over the couple of bucks, my answer is yes!

Then after that I spent a minute looking at an image. I couldn't tell if the game was loading or just froze.After playing a couple of games, I got the hang of the game and didn't really like it. I didn't feel like the I was playing with a team of people, just some other people randomly running around the map with me.I don't know if I could select a different server, but at times the lag just made the game almost impossible to play.I cannot recommend this game for anyone.

												Monaco, What's Yours Is Mine. And Monaco... is mine!A fun and colorful game, with multiple characters with different special abilities to play as.Monaco is a great stealth game, but when you get caught & the alarms go off, it really shines because you're not immediately screwed -- you have options & abilities and the game lets you use them how you like.The thematic elements, the jazzy piano soundtrack, the flexibility-vs-constraints come together for a great game to play.Play with good stereo headphones on -- you'll be able to hear the direction of nearby footsteps of NPCs even if you can't see them on-screen.Play with friends, over voice chat!  just like Ocean's 11 or any team-heist movie you're set up for a good time when working together and using misdirection (or just havoc!) to bail each other out of a FUBAR situation.If you've wanted to star in a heist movie, and you enjoy fun, this game is for you.

The game itself is great; I love the art style and the way that the whole thing feels. But the thing that made it for me is the soundtrack. This Ragtime-French-Criminal style of music fits so well with every level and I adored every note of it. Fantastic.			"

Monaco is a top-down stealth/action game. I had a lot of fun with it, but it can be boring under the wrong circumstances. tl;dr: this is a top-down tactical stealth game, it's by far the most fun with a friend in 2-player mode, and you should experiment with different characters.Single-player runs are a bit too predictable and straightforward, and every mission will feel just like more of the same thing. Multiplayer is much more interesting - it's moments like sneaking in to steal the treasure while a friend stands guard and another hacks the security, or splitting up to clean out an entire floor within a minute, that make this game worth playing.On the other hand, groups of too many (inexperienced) players are likely to get in each others' way and spend too much time being discovered to get anything done. Two coordinated, voice-chatting players are the best for combining your characters' abilities successfully and pulling off your own strategy together.On the other hand: While smooth and coordinated runs are very satisfying, it can also be fun to treat Monaco as a party game and frantically stumble through a level with four players and swarms of guards behind you.The graphics are stylish, unique and do their purpose, but a bit taxing on the eyes and take a while to get used to. The music fits the heist setting, but there's not enough of it. The story also helps to set the mood, and while it's not important, I'm glad that it's there because it gives the missions context.Stealing money slowly grants you additional tool uses/ammunition, so raiding optional rooms is actually rewarded within missions and it can be advantageous to do so and e. g. gather additional EMP charges before taking on the main vault's motion detectors.This means that while skilled maneuvering is still a focal point, threat assessment and careful planning are just as essential.While the core stealth gameplay always remains similar, the 8 characters' special abilities have a huge influence on which path and approach you can take to beating the level. One team may allow you to tunnel towards the objective past a large portion of the treasure and just run past the guards that remain in your way, while another one relies on luring them one by one and knocking them out so no one's even awake to answer the alarm.Monaco is fairly forgiving for a stealth game - getting detected early on hardly ever means having to restart a level in advance.It does get kind of boring how easily you can disperse attention by crawling into ventilation ducts and waiting.The normal price is a bit high because the game only shines if you buy a second copy for a friend, but I very highly recommend buying this when it's on sale if you're into strategic, sometimes chaotic co-op action.

A few times playing online the whole floor map appears and locks me in, so I had to make or find a new room to play.

												Monaco is a great reminder that games can be played exactly the way you want to play them. I loved the Ocean's movies and the feel of sneaking around the whole level makes you feel like a true robber. The single player experience is really great but it becomes infinitely better with friends. There is never one way to complete a level and most of the time you find out that your ""great plan"" backfires within 30 seconds. It's really satisfying to try to improve your technique through each level and the mayhem that occurs with friends is unmatched in a co-op expirence.			"

Two coordinated, voice-chatting players are the best for combining your characters' abilities successfully and pulling off your own strategy together.On the other hand: While smooth and coordinated runs are very satisfying, it can also be fun to treat Monaco as a party game and frantically stumble through a level with four players and swarms of guards behind you.The graphics are stylish, unique and do their purpose, but a bit taxing on the eyes and take a while to get used to. The music fits the heist setting, but there's not enough of it. The story also helps to set the mood, and while it's not important, I'm glad that it's there because it gives the missions context.Stealing money slowly grants you additional tool uses/ammunition, so raiding optional rooms is actually rewarded within missions and it can be advantageous to do so and e. g. gather additional EMP charges before taking on the main vault's motion detectors.This means that while skilled maneuvering is still a focal point, threat assessment and careful planning are just as essential.While the core stealth gameplay always remains similar, the 8 characters' special abilities have a huge influence on which path and approach you can take to beating the level. One team may allow you to tunnel towards the objective past a large portion of the treasure and just run past the guards that remain in your way, while another one relies on luring them one by one and knocking them out so no one's even awake to answer the alarm.Monaco is fairly forgiving for a stealth game - getting detected early on hardly ever means having to restart a level in advance.It does get kind of boring how easily you can disperse attention by crawling into ventilation ducts and waiting.The normal price is a bit high because the game only shines if you buy a second copy for a friend, but I very highly recommend buying this when it's on sale if you're into strategic, sometimes chaotic co-op action.

												Oh my god.Monaco is possibly one of my favorite games to just pick up and play. The early levels are usually 5-10 minutes, with most levels being about 20 minutes, and maybe 30 minutes on the later levels.The game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥in solo. Don't buy it to play alone. If you're going to buy this game, make sure some friends have it too.Each character has a special skill, all of which are useful for the current situation. (Except the Pickpocket and Locksmith, they're only good for a speedrun)There are 4 chapters, each told by a different character, and each one escalating in difficulty from the last. Notably, there are 3 versions of every level- Monaco 2013 has the original levels before updates were made, and Zonaco replaces all NPCs with zombies.The entire game is orchestrated by Austin Wintory's fantastic soundtrack(Discotheque Rouge is the best), and let's be honest, how many games feature ragtime in their soundtrack?

												I like and respect this game. Unfortunately, a lot of the multiplayer community is gone, which leaves the cooperative aspect fairly limited.Edit: The multiplayer community comes and goes when this game goes on sale.Why I like it: Gameplay is how you choose to play, which gives a great open environment feel that lets an action game be an adventure game if you want it to be. As you progress into the story, there's a lot of flexibility on how you can play, which even furthers this feeling of open environment. Almost anything can be destroyed or mined through, and can, in some regards, be looked at as a scaled down, 2D version of Payday.Why I respect it: This game is the embodiment of the idea that not all great games need great models. A lot of the game is basic pixels scaled up. There are no flashy skins or gorgeous maps. The atmosphere fits the game perfectly, and playing it just feels right. It's hard to explain why this game feels good to play - stealth, fighting, sneaking around, all packed into an 8-bit-style game about robbery.As a single player experience, it's not bad. But where this game really shines is multiplayer.			"

												Initially I put off playing this one because I figured I knew what it was already.  And while my guess wasn't too far off, it didn't account for just how much fun it would be.  You get to play as one of a number of different criminal roles (locksmith, mole, lookout, etc.) as you attempt heists, prison breakouts, etc.  In a way, it almost feels like a multiplayer version of Bonanza Bros, which not a whole lot of people probably remember.  Definitely fun and way more fun when playing multiplayer.			"

												Monaco is a game in which you, along with a band of other criminals go on ridiculous endeavors to go on heists, clear evidence of previous heists and so much more. It has its own simple but very unique and dynamic art style which is not quite retro but in a pixelated look; and dont get me started on the music. This is one of the best factors of this game, with a quirky piano solo in the backround which suddenly escalates as you alert security. The storyline is also exellent as you play the roles of many different characters, each with their own funny personality. As you play through the campain, the story develops and twists and creates great suspence and enjoyment. I fail to get bored of this game with the huge amounts of extra campains adding to the backstory and the almost infinite amount of crazy workshop created levels which you can play with friends. 10/10			"

												Monaco, What's Yours Is Mine. And Monaco... is mine!A fun and colorful game, with multiple characters with different special abilities to play as.Monaco is a great stealth game, but when you get caught & the alarms go off, it really shines because you're not immediately screwed -- you have options & abilities and the game lets you use them how you like.The thematic elements, the jazzy piano soundtrack, the flexibility-vs-constraints come together for a great game to play.Play with good stereo headphones on -- you'll be able to hear the direction of nearby footsteps of NPCs even if you can't see them on-screen.Play with friends, over voice chat!  just like Ocean's 11 or any team-heist movie you're set up for a good time when working together and using misdirection (or just havoc!) to bail each other out of a FUBAR situation.If you've wanted to star in a heist movie, and you enjoy fun, this game is for you.

												Definitely a little fun game to play. Great for teamwork!However, the online community is very dead. So you will be playing many levels by yourself. Which kind of sucks.			"
