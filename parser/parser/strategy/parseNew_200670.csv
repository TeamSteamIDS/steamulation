												I read a lot of reviews on Disciples III.  A lot were bad however there was a lot of positive as well so I took a chance because I loved Disciples 2 so much.  Well let me be another that is in the bad review camp.  I also read that D3-Resurrection was the game that should of been released in the first place.  They said they fixed most of the bugs.  If that is true then I would hate to play the hot mess that was before this one because there is still tons of bugs.   Some of those same reviews said how beautiful the graphics were, are they playing the same game as me?  Your move points are very low, so just going to get that gold pile that is about 5 inches away takes two turns. Its also really hard to logically see where you can move on the map without triggering combat.   Sometimes during combat there is no walking animation, the units just glide as they move.  Most of the time when an archer fires the terrain will block the camera view. Really cheesy!   The combat is slow, repetitive and boring.  The only real tactical dission is what unit to attack.  Then it boils down to just exchanging blows and hope you can win.I dont recommend Disciples III.  If interested get Disciples 2 as that is the game the fans fell in love with. "

												*edit for more details to help people make decisions*At one point, kalypso changed the login procedure associated with this game where we suddenly had to register on their sites to actually play the game. At that point, i entered my key and managed to play a few hours. Those hours were not incredibly fun. The strategy would boil down in having werewolves as soon as possible because all the melee creatures were unable to touch them making most fights trivial.The features they had changed from renaissance didnt look like good ideas balance wise so i ended up quitting the game. Fast forward 5 months and i suddenly cannot login the game anymore because it decided that my online key isn't valid. Nothing has changed in my setup. Since the game wasn't super fun last time around, i gave up. Couldn't recommend the game to anyone because of both the balance issues and the key issues on their server.			"

												Overall if you enjoyed Renaissance and don't have Reincarnation, it might be worth having this on sale.Otherwise, just get Reincarnation.+Continues story from III Renaissance+Same graphics/gameplay, familiar and enjoyable if you enjoyed Renaissance+New race to play as the Undead+Length of story comparable to Renaissance-Extra DRM: Kalypso account required-Similar problems to Renaissance-Esc key for menu and right-click info only work intermittently-No subtitles in voiced cutscenes-No voiceovers in text dialogue-Little in the way of new gameplay elements, only 1 playable race			"

												Not as good as disciples II but I would still recommend it for any disciples fan. I think the game was made a little dummer this time but the graphics are better. Story line will put you to sleep. Every map features a lot of objectives. Huge maps to explore. more advanced combat from the one we saw in disciples 2. Here both parties actually can move around during fight which is both good and bad. If a melee unit gets close to your ranged unit it will take heavy damage. If you take out enemy unit that has healing properties you will gain advantage.			"

												This game feels so bad that i deleted it from my account!I feel like this game studio $$@ that released nothing interesting, ruined this franchise.Buildings - the same from Disciples 2, Creatures - the same names from Disciples 2 - only changed stats, crappy looks and some other stuff, Ruined - the hero management: - introducing some lame skill tree, - introducing lame cinematic camera in hero screen,- way harder to acces to own army from hero screen more clicking - tedious and useless work in a strategy gameBattles- way harder to level up, no reason to get lvl5 creatures, you need to upgrade x4 to upgrade to 5th level - just mindless grinding- introducind lame cinematic cuscenes into battlefield, so boring after lots of fights- stupid decision to introduce a battlefield - creatures taken from Disciples 2 were best used in old fighing styleGame- less races than Disciples 2- no more planting rods - changed that with weird @$$ guardianI played D3 with Legions of the Damned and put on my hero 4 brutes, just rushed on the map until got bored, i have probably 6-7 hours of total offline play time. No replayability, no random maps, no joy from exploring, feels like has low fps even on powerful systems - graphics look rushed and inapropiate for Disciples.			"

												Ouch, it really pains me to see that a title with such a rich and interesting history (Gallean series) suffered so much after the transition to hexagon open battlefield. The developers apparently thought that all you need to do is leave everything as it was in the previous games. The reality proved them wrong. The result is a bug-riddled game where gameplay is not fun (stupid AI) and full of unbalanced creatures. Okay, the game looks beautiful and is full of the series folklore, but nowadays graphics is not enough for a decent game. There is much unused potential in the title. But I don't recommend it in the current state. I hope they change the dev team and truly ressurect the title.			"

												Unless you loved the origonal don't buy it. It adds a new faction and a new campagin but the leveling system is so slow you need to go though half the map before they level once... which means a lot of time spent running back and forth healing your troops. It adds to the story, revamps some misc units, and adds some new ones but It's just not worth it. Other than the experience thing it is still a good, working, game.			"

I dont have the best computer on the market, but is an athlon 8320 3.5ghz, 8 core with 8 gigs on ram and a 450gts. After a couple of turns, the map turns yellow, i cant see a thing, and it crashes randomly often.I wont put time on a game that requires a couple of hours to understand then i cant play. "

												Based on my experience so far, Disciples III has been fairly good. I'm new to any game in this series and so far I'm satisfied with the battle mechanisms and the map set ups. It vaguely reminds me of Advanced Wars or Age of Empires. I'm hoping to play some more and will update this  as I find out more about this game. I've encountered a single bug at this point relating to the map presentation, but it has by no means prevented me from being able to play the game and was fixed by saving and restarting the game.

												A game that isn't given enough attention.  It has a new style of gameplay that mixes a turned based game, with a RTS game.  It is quite difficult, but that just makes it feel more rewarding when you accomplish a goal			"

												Disciples III: Resurrection – a grand sequel of the series!This is a new landmark in the history of Nevendaar, when a new race ascends to power – the ruthless and merciless Undead Hordes. It is the story of selfless love and unfading glory. Heroes of the past, who had lost their lives, but not their sentience, are exacting their revenge in the name of Mortis, the Goddess of Death.This Disciples 3 game is dedicated to a new race – the Undead Hordes. It was the mostly anticipated race among the gamers and fans of the Disciples series, and now their dreams have come true.			"

												This is not the worst turn based game, only because the last version was even worse... Many bugs have been fixed for this version but the gameplay was hopelessly broken. There's no playing value. Winning on losing depened on 0 strategy on pure luck....			"

												Modelled after the game format used in Heroes of Might and Magic, and improved upon hugely, Disciples is an engrossing game to play once you've mastered the rather steep learning curve involved.  There are two different types of magic, one for use in the battle arenas, and one for use whilst travelling across the world map, and if you don't have your wits about you, neither will make sense.  Apart from that the game unfolds nicely (play the main release first, as this is the expansion, even though it plays without the original) and has an involving, if very complicated, storyline.Watch out for crashes and other curruptions even in the updated version.  Always save before going to battle or visiting shops as these tend to create crash points.They've made changes to the combat system in this exapnsion, and personally I don't think they're for the better.  Certain character types (mellee in particulart) now have two slots per battle round, rather than just one, and reinsert themselves high up the turn table when their first turn has been used.  This may have been done to balance the difficulty that mellee types normally missed their first round attack as they couldn't cover enough arena squares to reach an enemy.  However, mellee types have always had the extra advantage of delivering much more damage than a ranged attack, so this change really wasn't necessary.  It actually becomes confusing.  That, coupled with a revised ""cover shot"" system, whereby you get locked into covering yourself, not just other characters under your control, means the balance of arena battles has been seriouslly jarred and takes a while to figure things out.  You can also trap oppsition units into self-cover, so perhasps there is a small up side to this.  Like a lot of games, once you'be worked out the system you can play it to your advantage, but it's a tricky system and misjudgements are usually fatal.On the plus side, Lambert has been brought back from what we thought was the dead,,,,			"

												Good expansion for a game that was already pretty good. A few bugs but nothing to bad and they did seem to add a few things I didn't like, the points you need to gain to level was raised way to much in my opinion which takes you even longer to level up. Plus the fact that the non-campain maps only feature two where you can play as the new race. Still, I had fun.			"

												Do NOT buy this game until it recieves a major patch from Kalypso. As it is currently, the game is simply unplayable due to massive and ridiculous imbalancing. I couldn't even finish the first scenario because the AI was that overpowered on normal difficulty. Just save your money and go buy a pizza or something.			"

												After Finishing Disciples 3 - Renaissance, I was all set to begin Resurrection. Disciples has always hooked me up whenever I got my hands on any of it's installments. Anyway about this installment. Well this installment only has 1 campaign that is ""Undead"" which consists total 8 chapters and playing as undead feels powerful. Really powerful. I didn't have to struggle like how I struggled in Disciples 3 Renaissance. Nevertheless I enjoyed that challenge and without any cheat codes I went through all the chapters. Here in this installment there are no major bugs except one which you will encounter in Chapter 7. Not really a big of a problem but it can become quite irritating. You are most likely going to see some black blocks or background music will stop playing. When you experience that then my advice will be just save the game and relaunch it to fix it.That's it. It offers only 39-42hours gameplay. I wish it would have been longer than that. Anyway whatever it was it was fun. Do I recommend this game? Well I am a disciples fan so If I say Yes you'll he's just a fanboy. So my suggestion is if you're sceptical then get it on sale. ;)			"

												Don't bother I might have had a chance if the game gave me 1 attack for every attack by the computer but 2 to1 against is rediculous and very very hard to beat.			"

												While i would have liked to play through before giving a review this proved impossible as the game constantly crashed on me while running under Win 10 64bit. I tried all compatability modes and several suggestions from kalypso forum but nothing fixed the problem. If anyone decides to buy this I urge you to play it straight away and if it crashes then get a refund.			"
