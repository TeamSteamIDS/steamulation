												Humorous Dungeon Keeper like game.Pros- Good beginning story - lord of the pit to sidekick of a loser- I love stories from the perspective of the bad guys- The demon, your champion, really does grow to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥  You get served very easily towards the beginning, but at the end you've reclaimed your lord of the pit status- Session skill tree.  Points are earned through almost every action (i.e. killing heroes, crafting items, raiding, etc.)  You unlock new branches of the skill tree mostly through exploration/side quests that can be interesting- Squad combinations can lead to good bonuses (plus to crit, defense, etc.) encouraging the player to mix and matchCons- Storyline grows weaker throughout the game- Clunky controls (i.e. assign worker to repair room, but game doesn't auto assign him to then work it).  Launch Game vs. Load Game between stages - if you hit load instead of launch it takes you to your last saved slot instead of the next level - why is this even on the page?- Camera - cut scenes frequently have you looking in a different direction super zoomed in- Ladders - the attempt to keep you on your toes while you accomplish main and side quests.  Decent concept, but they happen at regular intervals and with your ability to teleport yourself or squads directly most any where, this becomes zoom out, find ladders, teleport squads, and go back to what you were doing- Traps play almost no role- Almost necessary to play with Priests and Overlords- Runes disappearing?  Played the entire game through and still had some empty rune slots.  Some would show unlocked at the end of a successful mission, but not appear on the next mission.  Not sure if they were meant to be passive, but could not find a way to view them- Demon upgrades - no way to preview before selecting so be warned!- Session skill tree.  Mentioned above as a plus.  Unfortunately, if you want to build a ton of traps, summon a horde, equip your squads to the teeth, etc. you'll only get so many points for each route.  What this means is that you're going to build x number of rooms, build x number of traps, equip x number of minions, craft x number of items, dig x number of tiles, etc.  I really felt like this was the major failing of the game.  I picked the exact same skill tree items for about 3/4 of the game.  This pigeon holes you into the same rooms, same units, and same path to victory again and again.- Difficulty.  I play most games on normal expecting to have some challenges, but not pull my hair out.  If your demon dies, he respawns about five seconds later and you can teleport him right back in.  The only way you die is if they destroy a treasure room?  It is strange.  My demon died quite a bit in the beginning, but I was never in danger of losing a stage.  This makes the game a total grind.  I'd recommend bumping it up if you expect any challenge. - For a humorous game, the jokes were really hit and miss and mostly miss.- Voice for the demon is good when you're still a little imp, but really needed to change after you reclaim your stature.- Ending was just strangeOverall, if you like the genre then you might give it a whirl, but I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it.

												Impire is a real time strategy game developed by Cyanide Studios. The game was released in early 2013 on PC.Gameplay in Impire is heavily inspired by Dungeon Keeper. You are in control of a demon, and you have to build your own dungeon, with a large amount of rooms to build and modify however you want; along with building tunnels connecting all of the rooms together, you can create some really interesting dungeons.  The action in Impire is based around having squads of other demons, these squads consist of four demons, and they operate as a team, think of them as like a 4 man group out of an MMO, you want to have a tank, a healer and some damage dealers.  You are able to unlock new demons using the talent tree, which interestingly resets at the start of each level, allowing you to only spec into what you really are going to need for the objectives. Impire also has another game play element, called Raids. This function allows you to send your squads of minions on mini raids to other dungeons in order to gather treasure, materials, or complete side quests – this is nice addition but can sometimes be forgotten about if you aren’t careful.  The raids require no human interaction other than you telling the squad to go and start it. The graphics in Impire will again, remind you completely of Dungeon Keeper, they just have a more higher resolution look to them. The UI in Impire can look daunting upon a first glance, but the game has a very good tutorial mission which explains everything very clearly and you’ll be navigating through the menus with ease after completing it. It would have been nice if all of the buttons came with a tooltip though, so you can just remind yourself as to what some of the lesser used buttons do at times without having to just click it to find out. This game is fully voice acted to a pretty high standard,  the game is narrated very well, units are all voice acted. The game has quite an abundance of cut scenes with multiple characters, which can sometimes become an annoyance when you are in the middle of a fight, but some of the dialogue is quite funny so you can sort of take it with a pinch of salt there. Impire gives the impression that it is a hard game, but in reality, you really have to be bad at the game to fail. The only way you lose a mission is if one of your treasure rooms is destroyed; I never saw it get destroyed once in my entire time playing this game.  Playing the game on the hardest difficulty may make it more of a challenge, rather than a grind; but I would of thought the medium setting would have given some sort of challenge. So far I have put about sixty three hours into Impire – the story mode is split into five chapters, each has about five or six missions to them; you can sometimes spend an hour on each level,  this game has a serious amount of content to offer. Not to mention the multiplayer mode (something which I didn’t experience so will not comment on). I did have one technical problem whilst playing the game – it can be played on all resolutions up to 4k which is nice to see; however even on the lower resolutions, you will notice quite a bit of stuttering on the cut scenes when the camera angel changes, it just looks janky but if you can ignore that you’ll be fine.  The game has a wide variety of graphical options so you can customize the graphics to match your rig very easily. In summary; this is a brilliant Dungeon Builder game with a huge amount of content on offer. Fans of Dungeon Keeper should definitely be checking this game out.  The price of £14,99 may be considered high for some, but given how many hours I have put into this game, I am going to highly  recommend it.

												It looks fun, it starts out ok, then the micro-managment makes it feel like work.  Work at a boring, mundane desk job. All the rooms have a preset lay-out and size taking away some of the dungeon building creativity.  Then you go adventure, but your minions are hungry so you have to send them back to the dungeon to feed them, by the time they arrive back at the battle they are half-way to hungry again. Then the ladders apprear.  The annoying ladders they say are needed for ""balance"". Maybe to balance out the boring micromanagement between ladders and hungry minions, but adds little to nothing to gameplay.  The game has received almost no updates or attempt at fixing the game-play at all.  Paradox has our money and gave up on the game, don't give them your money too, just move on.			"

												I spent a lot of time trying to like this game and clear it from my backlog...19 hours in and my conclusion is.... do not spend any amount of time or money on this game. The first levels in the game start out rather slow and it never really improved beyond that.  Even after getting to the point of full upgrades/squads Resource collection was primarily through sending out squads on missions and felt like a more annoying way than say telling a worker to cut trees in a standard RTS.Enemy Heroes were kinda trivial since you could instantly teleport around the map and destroy the ladders before they started spawning.Fell into the routine of deathballing since it was either that or suiciding smaller groups until you cleared out the area and against certain bosses.  The story was rather bland, evil guy doing evil stuff.The dialogue/voice acting was cringe worthy, enough that the game becomes unplayable unless you mute it.TLDR: There's a premise here that could be an interesting game but it falls short in every way.  Not worth your time or money.			"

												From what I can tell, public opinion on this game was heavily tarnished by the fact that the game made the fatal sin of NOT being Dungeon Keeper. Regardless of its lukewarm to cold reception, I found the game to be fun to play as a squad based RTS with some light base building. Essentially, this game was what Dungeons was shooting for and missed. So if you felt like Dungeons was terrible, but found the ideas intriguing I'd definitely recommend you load up Impire and give it a spin. It's not a flawless game by any means, but still manages to be a humorous, challenging, and moderately fresh way to kill a Sunday afternoon.			"

												As you would probly guess it's like dungeon keeper with some gameplay changes while trying to keep the same brand of humour. That being said it's take on the humour, in my opinion, feels childish and drab while the gameplay leaves me struggling to keep my attention in order to finish. Not to say it's a bad game, you should know that if you want to play a dungeon keeper type game then you could do better.			"

												To make it very clear at the beginning, this game is no Dungeon Keeper III and looks more like an underground based RTS. The campaigne has 4 chapters with 5 mission each and takes all together ~20hours. Sometimes the jokes during the missions are too bad but if you like the kind of humor used in Grotesque you should also like this one. At least there are two ends of the game, so playing again isn't a bad choice.  Your main character, the demon Baal-Abbadon, has three specs (Support/Melee/Caster) and all three are play- and enjoyable.The grafic isn't up-to-date but there are many lovely details if you look at the little demons or the underground rooms.  The whole game can be played in coop and has also some mulitplayer parts. There you have to protect NPCs, raid some enemy camps or to fight of endless hordes of heroes.Some negative aspects are the low variation of missions and the missed chance to improve the experience outside of the dungeon. But I had many hours of fun in Coop with this game, so anyone interested in RTS should have a look at it. Last hint, it plays like a mix of Majesty II and classic RTS games.			"

												Impire is a poorly executed amalgamation of some of my favorite franchises. It could have been oh-so-much more.The Good* Its like a MOBA-Squad based Dungeon Keeper* Its Ardania (I'm a big fan of the Majesty franchise)* Characters are pretty awesome* Dialog is great... although the demon's voice is slightly annoying* Pretty nice graphics overallThe Bad* Dungeon Keeper clone is not Dungeon Keeper* Pre-Fab rooms cut down on customization. Training room, for example is a fixed size. Can't be expanded or made into a different shape* MOBA-style RTS is a poor replacement for the Simulated Life (individual monster AI) of Dungeon Keeper* Squad-based RTS is tactically uninteresting. Its mostly ""Oh A go attack B""* Pretty-much the same strategy can be used over and over again endlessly with no variation. This becomes grind-tastic quickly because this game has a billion levels.* Decent graphics, and humorous dialog seem lost on ingame movies with game assets close-up (no high-poly models) who's mouths don't even move. They took the time to do good writing, and make a great engine, but didn't consider high-poly models for close-up briefings and cinematics? WTF.* Controls feel sluggish and dull* Hero ladders are extremely annoying and grindy.* The need for constant teleportation should have informed the game-makers that something was wrong with their gameplay. Perhaps they should have made it so you didn't have to ninja over to hero ladders and perhaps make garrisoning better so you don't have to constantly shift frontline troops back for hero invasions.I give this a 6.5/10, which is barely a passing grade, but is still a passing grade. I had fun, even though there's really very shallow in terms of tactics or strategy. The same things work over and over again. Most units don't even need to be used. But the Dungeon Keeper nostalgia and cute dialog put it over the top for me. "

												Just awful. No control over building at all, it is all cut and paste. This game is so far from anything remotely good it hurts. Yes we expected a Dungeon Keeper type game, get over it, that is what the customers wanted and it was not even close. Even attempting to look at it from a different point of view as a stand alone game not compared to Dungeon Keeper will leave you disappointed. This game is all about puting down a few predetermined rooms and leading your minions to a fight then to kitchen, a fight then the kitchen... it almost feels like this game doesn't even need me to be involved in order to play it.

												First off - THIS IS NOT DUNGEON KEEPER! Do NOT buy it if you're looking for a DK fix. Go play Dungeon Keeper instead :PThe story line isn't really that great, and the animations and voice acting that follows it, are below par.However, if you last long enough to get past that, the game play is quite enjoyable. A sorta dungoen building/ dungeon crawling combo. Build up your squads so you can have them zapping over whenever those pesky heroes come a-knocking, while you were out exploring yourself. Just don't have all your squads out raiding at the same time... <.<Being still in the beginning of the game myself, I haven't seen the highend units yet, but the lowend are versatile enough to make some good combinations in your squads.So far, though, I'd recommend it to anybody who enjoys dungeon building/ dungeon crawling kind of games.

												Humor is nice, gameplay is nice, it's not nessisarily a *bad* game...  But it's also not a *good* game.It's far too grindy, and a lot of people will go in hoping for dungeon keeper, only to end up with a squad-based RTS where every unit looks the same.  This would be an 8/10 game back in 2003, but this is 2013, ten years guys, could have been so much better.Again, not *bad*, just, with the sheer amount of better games at a lesser price and a similar theme; it's a pass.  Thanks open market.Edit: Oh and before I forget, the main complaints I heard from my friends were ""the ladders"" to explain, occasionally heroes would break through the ceiling of your dungeon and climb down ladders to attack you.  Devs say it's to add balance and excitement...  I feel I'm the only person who actually looked in the options menu because there's a very obvious ""LADDERS ON/OFF"" button.			"

												After reading some of the reviews my heart sank. I preodered this game a while back and played it quite a lot. I liked the game myself. If you aren't familiar with the world of Ardania (it's the same would in the Majesty games) then you're probably not used to a game of micromanaging. The game itself has some nice storytelling and the units are quite adorable. The gameplay isn't all that hard, and on occasion you just have to wait out for a few adventurers to delve into your dungeon so you can exploit them. In response to the revier which he said your units are starving by the time you get them to a battle, I wonder if you are using the built in teleportation system in the game. I never once had that problem. Overall if you are happy with some simple humor, stategic thinking, and some decent customization then you have found the game. Not all games appea to everyone sadly.

However its a good game to play when your bored or just want to be evil. I am dissapointed with the lack of a good skirmish game.If your looking for a game you can easilly spend 100+ hours on, dont buy this game. If your not strapped for cash and you just wanna experiment and dabble around with different types of games this is a good one to check out.			"

												Rather nice little game pretending to be the ""Dungeon Keeper of the modern era"" :) Terrible control of battle units (only 5 squads with only 4 units each, and achieving the ability to create the 4th and 5th squad is rather painstaking), and limited number of technological points to spent are major flaws.

												This isn't a good game, no matter how hard i tried to like it while it starts out promising it delivers so very little and while the Humor is mostly on point it sadly can't make you ignore the painfull excuse for gameplay this game has.The Campaign largly consists of the same structure over and over again.- Get a base going- Get an army going- take the objectivewhile there would be nothing wrong with that, seeing as many criticly aclaimed titles follow a similair pattern. If there was any variety at all, the whole campaign consits of you building the same base over and over and over again from scratch, to create the largly the same unit composition. The game gets repedative very fast, making the whole 30 min of building the exact same base for the exact same units seem completly unessesary.Additonaly the game is plagued by bugs that can cause it to crash, i highly recommend against buying it.

Work your way around in different demonic squads and raid♥♥♥♥♥♥and evolve your  minion. I'm only a little into it, but not bored after a couple hours. Certainly doesn't deserve such bad reviews.

It was fun to set the traps and stuff and wipeout heroes.There isn't alot of replayability in this title. I played it twice and then it kind of died. There isn't really much that will make you want to do it all again a bunch of times. It would have been nifty and you could make your demon way bigger and badder.7/10 would recommend if you want a closeish DK			"

												This game was under my radar a bit, but Rock, Paper, Shotgun had a couple stories - including a video of the tutorial.  It's a game in the vein of Dungeon Keeper, and the early-mid 90's dungeon management games that spawned afterward.  I won't call it a clone, because it's different enough from Dungeon Keeper, but you can definitely see the lineage that the developers had in mind.  After looking it up on Steam, I decided $20 was worth taking the risk of pre-ordering it.  It is definitely worth it.  After six hours of play, I'm positive that I'll get enough enjoyment out of it to justify the $20, and with a four-player co-op mode, I imagine that the campaign would be a lot more fun than it already is.  :)			"

There were a few mechanics of it I didn't like, such as the random upgrade drops and inability to expand a hallway into a room.Gameplay was about 45 hours to OCD the campaign.

												Dammit, if I find any more like this I'm going to have real trouble paying tuition... at least I lucked out and this was 50% off at the time.Impire is a sort of strategy RPG with RTS elements. You play Baal, a demon lord who's been pulled from hell and put into a rather... less than impressive state as an imp (and got Gilbert Godfried's voice too the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and is working with a demonologist named Fairweather in an attempt to overthrow the kingdom and (cue M. Bison) take over the world.Its got some really addictive gameplay though and the humor is good too. I spent about four hours on one mission alone earlier and I honestly didn't notice the time passing at all. I can wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games and (sadly) know that I'm probably not getting much homework done this weekend...			"

I won't call it a clone, because it's different enough from Dungeon Keeper, but you can definitely see the lineage that the developers had in mind.  After looking it up on Steam, I decided $20 was worth taking the risk of pre-ordering it.  It is definitely worth it.  After six hours of play, I'm positive that I'll get enough enjoyment out of it to justify the $20, and with a four-player co-op mode, I imagine that the campaign would be a lot more fun than it already is.  :)			"

												Dammit, if I find any more like this I'm going to have real trouble paying tuition... at least I lucked out and this was 50% off at the time.Impire is a sort of strategy RPG with RTS elements. You play Baal, a demon lord who's been pulled from hell and put into a rather... less than impressive state as an imp (and got Gilbert Godfried's voice too the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and is working with a demonologist named Fairweather in an attempt to overthrow the kingdom and (cue M. Bison) take over the world.Its got some really addictive gameplay though and the humor is good too. I spent about four hours on one mission alone earlier and I honestly didn't notice the time passing at all. I can wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games and (sadly) know that I'm probably not getting much homework done this weekend...			"

												I give it a 7.In the vein of Dungeon Keeper, this is a dungeon building RTS.  The voice-acting and script are equally horrible and excellent; some of the jokes fall flat while others are great.  The graphics are decent and the gameplay good.  There were a few mechanics of it I didn't like, such as the random upgrade drops and inability to expand a hallway into a room.Gameplay was about 45 hours to OCD the campaign.  I'd put it in the $15 range, if you like this style of game.			"

												This game is funny. It is a dungeon lord type of game where you build your dungeon, train your monsters, kill the heroes who try to get into your treasure room and do the missions to raid and destroy and generaly do mahem and eeeeevil things!It has a good sense of humour and the incompetence of your master is quite amusing! He's like the Austin Powers villain! It is a fun game. I've seen a few crashing bugs tought, but when you restart the game it seems to go away. And my computer is rock solid in any other game, so i don't think its my hardware.I recommend heartily!			"

												I 1st played this straight after relase back in 2013, back then it was a buggy mess with some game breaking bugs that stopped the campaign advancing on certain missions and prevented one from playing multiplayer for more than a few minutes before desyncing for various reasons. A lot has improved since then and now in 2015 its much more stable and quite playable.There are still bugs apparent, but they are generally minor.Some of the more controversial game designs now come with a couple of different toggle settings ie ladders, fixed ladders and no ladders. Aggression can also be toggled in multiplayer and runes are now available to offset the other common gripe of keeping ones minions fed.The largest problem with this game is still its UI and the way that so many simple things need user input in a needless but tedious manner, user micromanagement replaces the basic ai outside of combat (which the user has no control over).Other gripes include disruptive and non immersive cutscenes that trigger throughout the levels pulling one away from their current set of actions. A clunky corridor and room placement design which offers no second chances even in the design phase of placement. A drop in Co-op that only saves the Hosts progression and offers only a partial co-op experience with players unable to share resources or enter each others domains in times of need making it feel more like single player with mutual objectives. And a mutiplayer aspect that is relaint upon pvp modes (in a very quiet community) with no ai or bots. (Edit: Our experience of the only co-op MP mode Survival was flawed by all but one player being bugged and stuck in their own dungeons, unable to access the global area even after the peace countdown had expired.)This game is another that would benefit from a maybe button as its quite solid in its current state it's just not that enjoyable... which is a personal preference.

												Well I have pretty mixed emotions about this game so far. I would not recommend my friends buy this game just yet. Its release has some pretty annoying bugs, balance issues and micromanagement/interface problems. But I do see a lot of potential and I think the problems are very easy to address IF the devs see it the way  see it and are going to change it.The game is not a Dungeon Keeper clone, though it will spark up some fond memories of that game. You are indeed the manager of an evil dungeon and you summon a healthy variety of units which can level up and be upgraded and you can place traps and so on. But the strategy layer is very shallow. You have one room to grow muchrooms, and you can send your units on these simple raids to acquire materials and treasure, which comprise the 3 commodities for building units, upgrading and building rooms. The rooms are fixed size and shape which is a bit sade, you cant just build a giant storage room for example, but add more of the fixed size storage rooms instead. Digging tunnels is really just for connecting rooms, you dont mine anything.The dialogue and story in the game is really fun though, which is what you can expect from the guys who made Magicka.I do find it fun to play and I myself do not regret buying it but I am pretty hard core on these kind of games, I can tolerate a lot to get this sort of gameplay :)Keep in mind the game only saves your progress on Steam Cloud, so make sure you have that enabled!

												At first glance, the game looks as if it's a successor to Dungeon Keeper ..If you go in thinking that, you'd be wrong.Sure, it seems to have the look that could be perceived as a spirtual sucessor to Dungeon Keeper however only the atmosphere and humour could be loosely based on Dungeon Keeper.To summarise, you play the role of a demon known as ""Baal-Abaddon"", whom of which is summoned by a not so smart sorcerer named Oscar, into the lowly form of an Imp. The gist of the game is helping Baal to gain his lost powers and to terrorise the surrounding land of Ardania in the ol' ""Evil is good"" sort of way.You start each level with a handful of workers and Baal, building up your dungeon with pre-laid out rooms and creating/summoning units to form squads to go raid for materials/gold/food and to defend from hero invasions from the front and/or ladders (With the addition of choosing random/fixed/no ladders, thank god!).The game can get tedious and rather monotonous as the general tone of each level is essentially build up dungeon, build up troops, raid, rinse and repeat until you're strong enough to go into the main part of the level. The main part of the level is usually the same (With an ending ""Boss"" of sorts) however getting there can change from level to level. The most part is the same, however on some levels there are some puzzles which can be somewhat challenging to start with.With the patches that were released since the release of the game, it seems to be a lot more stable compared with release. Fortunately there doesn't seem to be as many crashes/problems/bugs which was ultimately frustrating for those that first had the game as there isn't a save game as such. On the whole, I enjoyed the game. Sure, it gets a bit repetative but I enjoyed the cheesy humour.TL;DR - Not a successor to Dungeon Keeper but is loosely influenced by its atmosphere and humour. Game can get very monotonus and tedious but is fun at times. A lot better than what it once was on release due to bug fixes.			"

												Impire was always going to face a tough reception, being the first in a wave of very familiar looking dungeon sims that’ll be popping up throughout the year, but rather than take that challenge and run with it, Cyanide have instead made a game that is slightly worse than its inspiration in pretty much all aspects. If you’re pining after Dungeon Keeper, your money would be far better spent grabbing the originals on GOG. While you’re there, do yourself a favour and pick up Evil Genius and Startopia. By the time you’ve worked your way through all those, the next contender for the Dungeon Keeper throne will no doubt be nearly ready, and we can go through this whole merry dance once again.			"

												This was kind of an odd pickup for me.  It feels a lot like Dungeon Keeper in the way you play, but with less diversity in HOW you can build.  So...it's enjoyable, albeit less so.  The game does have the dark humor that DK did and it pulls it off well.  The set up for how you gather resources in the game is pretty neat, but it gets repetitive quickly.  Your enemies are equally neat, but repetitive.  It's worth a few bucks and the fact that it DOES have co-op functionality certainly makes it better, but as a single player game, it gets boring quickly.  It gets a 5/10 from me.  It does a good job in making the effort to bring back DK style play, but it loses points on the fact that every mission just feels the same.  You need friends to play with you and amp up the difficulty to make this game worth it.			"

												This is a bit of a guilty pleasure to me. It's inspired by one of my all time favourites: Dungeon Keeper: a classic dungeon management RTS. Impire borrows some basic concepts from this classic and is at times a fun and enjoyable game with good humour. But after a few hours, the slow pacing, some weird design choices and the tons of micro-management take the fun out of it and leave you wanting to play the classic Dungeon Keeper instead.Recommended only to hardcore fans of the genre.

Dungeon management is a genre we don't see very often and tha this is what a company chose to put out there comes across like a cheap attempt to cash in on a nostalgic fan-base.In short, do not buy this game. It is not fun, it is not interesting and it is certainly not worth your time in the slightest.			"

They had a decent story and tried to be the classic DK funny but they failed on almost all other levels. The squad system is garbage. The way dungeons are raided by Heros is more like the DK mobile version and for a PC game that is just sad. I really wanted to like this game but I actualy like Dungeons better only because Dungeons didnt try to hide what type of game they wanted to be although the marketing team didnt get the memo and featured all the DK style Dungeons, but I digress. All in all, if they had made it so you could make rooms any size you wanted it might have been better. The static rooms while offering neat and unique animations were a terrible waste of resources.  If you want a DK game with an active and dedicated development team go look at WFTO. Even for $1.49 this game isnt worth anyone's time. 2/10			"

												This was kind of an odd pickup for me.  It feels a lot like Dungeon Keeper in the way you play, but with less diversity in HOW you can build.  So...it's enjoyable, albeit less so.  The game does have the dark humor that DK did and it pulls it off well.  The set up for how you gather resources in the game is pretty neat, but it gets repetitive quickly.  Your enemies are equally neat, but repetitive.  It's worth a few bucks and the fact that it DOES have co-op functionality certainly makes it better, but as a single player game, it gets boring quickly.  It gets a 5/10 from me.  It does a good job in making the effort to bring back DK style play, but it loses points on the fact that every mission just feels the same.  You need friends to play with you and amp up the difficulty to make this game worth it.			"

												This is a bit of a guilty pleasure to me. It's inspired by one of my all time favourites: Dungeon Keeper: a classic dungeon management RTS. Impire borrows some basic concepts from this classic and is at times a fun and enjoyable game with good humour. But after a few hours, the slow pacing, some weird design choices and the tons of micro-management take the fun out of it and leave you wanting to play the classic Dungeon Keeper instead.Recommended only to hardcore fans of the genre.

												There is very little in this game to reccomend it. It is a great idea and it could have been a very fun game had it been given more development. That makes the game all the worse though... that it could have been great and it was released in such a poor state makes it go from ""just bad"" to almost depressing. Dungeon management is a genre we don't see very often and tha this is what a company chose to put out there comes across like a cheap attempt to cash in on a nostalgic fan-base.In short, do not buy this game. It is not fun, it is not interesting and it is certainly not worth your time in the slightest.			"

												On the surface this looks like a reboot of the Dungeon Keeper games but it lacks the depth to really compare. The dungeon construction is limited and not that interesting. The squad system where forming a squad with four different minions gives them special skills is a cool idea but the implementation falls short of the promise. Limits on how many minion types you can spawn and the fact that the AI will (sensibly) focus fire on the weakest squad member serves to limit the number of squad combinaions that are actually useful.The writing and voice acting are also sub-par. They fail to capture the amusingly evil style of games like Dungeon Keeper and Overlord and feel like a whiny emo teen instead. In fairness, I think that the intent was for Oscar to sound like a whiny teenager but the other characters fail to frame this in a way that might actually be amusing with the end result that you can't help rooting for the good guys to win.

												Impire is probably the best dungeon management game that has come out in a long time. While the story is nothing special and almost linear, it is commendable that this is done flawlessly. The voice acting is on the spot, at least for the main cast. Micro- management has never been this much fun, since well… ages (in my opinion). Impire keeps you busy and interested from start to finish. Complaints about repetitiveness of the game might be founded, but I think it is more of a matter of preference. It is true that there are a couple of imperfections that should (and could be easily) addressed. The lack of grunt noises and the inability to be able to re-check the mission goals, are flaws that can be frustrating at times. The biggest imperfection is perhaps the lack of information when it comes to upgrading units. A micro-management oriented game is not as pleasant to play when the necessary information is missing.But in the end Impire is a captivating game, unique characters and funny dialogues are more than enough to recommend it to everybody. A herd of (almost) impervious, impertinent, imps are waiting to serve their overlord. So what are you waiting for? You’re supposed to be on a highway to hell!			"

												Lets start from I am an old gamer and from that I played with Dungeon Keeper 1-2. I loved it. No other game could bring back that feeling. Because of that I jumped on the hype train wached videos from developers and even TBs alpha preview. It looked promising. The most sad thing about the game is the commercial it got. Developers (sorry for saying) lied about the game in vidoes and previews.The game itself: lets start with the good things. Talent system for your main character. Humor. Great room design. Armor/weapon upgrades.The bad things: There is absolutely no AI in the game. Your creatures stand around doing nothing. They don't go eating when they are hungry nor they go training. Fights are meaningless you don't feel involved. There is no challenge in the game and there is nothing to do. Feels very dull from the first map. The problem is your dungeon is liveless.I know it is my problem I got scammed by the developers for this game, no problem learnt form it, I will never again by stuff from them. To be honest this is my first game that I would love to get a refund. Absolutely not worth it. If you are looking for Dungeon Keeper experience then look elsewhere! "

And since heroes randomly pop down by ladders (the most annoying mechanic ever) there is not strategic benefit to the layout of the dungeon or the use of traps. It constantly breaks up the surface mission action and since your minions can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥while hungry (and they will be after a mission) you are most likely better off flinging balled up tissues at the heroes.A very dull and frustrating experience that is in no way worth your time!

After you unlock all the rooms, the rest of the campaign is ""Use the same things, and wander about killing stuff until you stumble upon something useful.""If its on sale cheap, get it for the story			"

												Imagine Dungeon Keeper with crappy accents and an actively bad sense of humor. Then take anything else you love about it and make it boring. That's this game. They added some stuff I'd love to see fleshed out, but this is Cyanide after all. I wanted it to be great. I really did. And they have some great ideas. Overland raids could be so much better. The RPG elements if taken a few steps further could be fun. ANY AI for your people would jsut be great so they at least remembered to go eat. They forgot to make it an ant farm that let you build a place for heroes to come die in amusing ways while watching your little goblins and vampires live their lives. They took out its soul.			"

												A dungeon keeper game this is not.  It bears only a superficial resemblenace to the series.   Gameplay is as follows:  Lay out some dungeon rooms using resources you get from the ""overworld"".  The overworld is non-interactive.  You just send a squad a of units to raid it.  There is no more interaction then that.After you make your basic dungeon which is virtually identical every single game, you enter ""the maze"" which is a zone next to your dungeon.  There are many things this maze is called, be it the necromancers tower or the sewers or the ""forbiidden land"" or whatever.  All you do is go with a group of units killing things and then collecing or clicking on quest glowies.  That is it, and that is every single scenerio.  If you can get it for like $5, it might be worth a few hours of diversions, otherwise save your money for something else.  I heard that ""battle for the overworld"" is under production which is supposed to be a dungeon keeper like game.  Hopefully it will turn out better.  You should save your money for that.			"

												It's a decent game that's quite similiar to Evil Genius. The game does tend to be a bit slow. My main issue with the game is the bugs. They left asserts in the build so everytime something goes wrong the game has to tell you about it before you can keep playing; It's just poor form. Still, it's not a bad game for 20$... but if you didn't like Evil Genius then you proably won't like this.			"

												I really tried to love Impire.  Unfortunately, there are just too many oversights that turn the game into more of a micro-management chore than an evil empire builder.Having cookie cutter rooms would be fine if you were allowed to actually plan out the rooms and halls beforehand.  As it is, if your hallway is off by even the smallest amount (which is obscenely easy to do) you need to either restart/reload the level or hope that you can salvage the situation without destroying your chances of fitting everything into the level AND being able to defend it.Overall, this is one game that played too much on the awesomeness of Dungeon Keeper to sell copies.

												I think this game received an awful bum rap for what turned out to be a good effort at taking the Dungeon Keeper minion game style and turning it into something a little more unique, with some effort to make the game less about operating progressively harder dungeons and more about following a quest line -- it can conceivably be thought of as an underground version of Overlord, albeit with a crappier avatar and point-and-click strategy-RPG style combat instead of action-RPG combat.  That said, it's still not a top performer.With an absolutely atrocious and unimmersive lobby system that tries to convince people to play co-op, it's really hard to get into and play.  Realtime strategy co-op is almost unheard of -- it's almost always TvT, free for all, or 1-on-1 adversarial.  By attempting to push the boundaries, they came up with a great idea but of limited utility to the typical fan base.The graphics are very good, for an independent title from a now increasingly un-independent publisher, and the subtle touches are all fantastic.  The main problem is that the gameplay itself is somewhat kludgy.  It is quite obvious that the developers intended to make minions move around the dungeons on foot and then got bored of how long it took, so they added ""ladders"" which spawn heroes inside your dungeon, and the ability to teleport to avoid sitting around waiting for your minions to navigate.  Speaking of teleportation, their pathfinding is pretty poor for a game with astoundingly simple prefabs that should be a cakewalk for an A* algorithm with well-selected nodes.  A lack of waypoints and patrol routes and other RTS staples really makes the game into a micromanagement fest, which is so unfortunate because it would have taken so little time to improve upon the basic accessibility features to make the game more playable.  A little bit of effort in streamlining the back end would have made the content and gameplay itself massively entertaining.Impire can really be thought of as an experimental effort to break from the standard and to introduce a whole whack of new gameplay features.  The problem is not so much the ideas as the lack of conceptual integration: it's like a giant smorgasbord where people forgot to keep things consistent, so you have the Chinese dumplings right next to the tray of Louisiana dirty rice and adjacent to a tray full of nachos with chili con queso.  All three are bloody well delicious, but they just don't go together.The game gets better as you go on, but it's such a slog through the early levels that it really makes you wonder whether it's worth it, and even then, better is a relative term.

												This game is an odd one. The design makes it charming enough to see what it has to offer... only to find yourself doing the same stuff over and over. There is something to be said about games that let you play the bad guy and enjoy yourself doing it. However... there isnt enough to do to in Impire to make full use of the consept. The Units and Dungeon rooms are delightfully creative. I personally enjoy the abominations. menacing and yet strangely cute... part of me would want one as a pet if it wasn't for the toxic spit. Game design is Impire's strong suit. Its fun to make a your evil lair and then see it all at work. -PROs-The characters are quirky and delightfully Evil. Delivering ""saturday morning cartoon bad guy"" levels of villainy to the story. Its nice to be the villain every once in a while. Impire is a relaxing game to cool off and fool around with at the end of a long day. Just relax and slay a few Heros... -CONs-The slow and unengaging gameplay. Raiding for supplies or loot is dull, repetitive, and offers nothing to the game experiance. Most fights can be broken down to ""Send units into problem until WIN happens"". Little to no strategy. Lack of content and uneventful multiplayer make this game have little replay value.In the end, I would give this game a pass... but only by a little. There is nothing wrong with what the game offers, But that being the case, Impire doesn't offer very much. Unless you are looking for an easy RTS/Dungeon builder for your 10 year old, or a nice little game to toy around with, then better off looking elsewhere for a better ""Play the villain"" game.			"

												I was so dissapointed with this game that I decided to write my first review. It has fun moments early on before you realise that every level has the same formula. Grow the same army every level, explore to finish quests, teleport back when heroes attack, then back out to finish the quests. Rinse and repeat. The worst part was the multitude of semi game breaking bugs. On the bright side, the writing was pretty good. Very funny most times.			"

												There is some good potential here, but there are some major problems that may or may not be fixed (since the game seems pretty unfinished). The major problem, besides CTD's, the necessary and bugged cloud inclusion, and the unfinishable bugged levels, is that gameplay devolves very quickly into a routine. Feed monsters, defend base from heroes, go do main quest for 2 minutes; repeat. You are pretty restricted when it comes to building your base and without detroying random ladders every 5 minutes, traps are useless because heroes can drop in anywhere. Tedious and not worth buying in its current state.			"

												So, lets start with game play.Controls are easy, there is an excellent starting tutorial at the beginning of the game. The gathering of resources is relatively easy. Upgrading isn't terribly difficult so long as you're not worrying about some timer count down. The storyline is amusing, up until the end. No matter what you do in the game choice wise, ie, the mini missions, it doesn't effect the ending out come. Which is bs in my opinion. Maybe the devs just got bored and couldn't think of alternate ones or were just to lazy to do them. The dlcs are neat, but you wont get to use them unless you go through a bunch of profile setting changes (after figuring it out) and then getting to almost the end of the game. There are several points where it looks like you can get rid of oscar in favor of a more compitent advisor thing, but, apparently your all powerful demon is too stupid to figure it out. Spoiler:no matter what you do the king always wins. He beats you, makes you kill what ever companion you've been traveling with (oscar or velvet), and you are left there to either rule the basement or go back to hell. The end. It's honestly a shame the devs didn't put in five more minutes of time to add in alternate companions, ie the fire demon,  the undead snake lady, and such. Let alone alternate endings dependent on the choices you've made through out the game. I give the game a good rating, the creativity with the end and options a non existant rating, even negative. But, if you like the rts dungeon building bit, it is loads of fun. Just don't count on depth of story line or your options doing anything important.			"

												Not to put too fine a point on it, but: there is not enough Dungeon Keeper in the world. Impire looks like a decent-enough clone of Dungeon Keeper, but it is sufficiently unique in most respects to be its own game. This is both good, and bad.The good side of things is how Impire handles dungeon management. By zooming out or pressing a hotkey, you’re given a flat top-down view of your dungeon. Here, you can queue up units, build rooms, order upgrades and place traps. Units, like minotaurs, vampires, imps, warlocks and such, can be put into squads of six. Squads in turn can be moved around as a single unit, and coordinate their attacks. A well-formed squad of a tank, some ranged casters, a healer, and a general damage-dealer, are highly effective at handling almost any situation. Ladders may randomly appear in your dungeon, bringing adventurers that’ll try to destroy things. You can build things like a Tavern that lure adventurers in and gets them drunk, making them weaker, but it’s not really necessary.You are limited in exactly what types of units and rooms you can build initially, and here is where things get idiosyncratic. As you complete set objectives removed from the main mission objectives, you earn DEM points which can be placed into a Diablo-esq skill tree, which resets each mission. If you want minotaurs for this mission, you may have to sacrifice gaining some spells, or a type of room, etc. It gives the genre a kind of build-order strategy, which isn’t bad, but it can rub you the wrong way. Squads can be sent off on raiding missions using an overworld map, which removes the squad from your dungeon for a time. If they succeed at the raid, you gain much-needed resources, as a dungeon is not entirely self-sufficient. There is no ore to mine, like in Dungeon Keeper.The game can be played cooperatively over network or Internet, up to four players, or competitively if that’s your thing. The cooperative mode works well enough, each player gets their own dungeon, and each dungeon has it’s own entrance into a kind of common battle area where mission objectives are usually located. The plot is amusing, in a 90s video game kind of way, and while it innovates where it counts, Impire fails in the areas it needs most.For everything Impire does right, with its own spin on the dungeon management genre, it gets equal amounts wrong. This is the type of game that’s best bought while on sale, and only if you really want this kind of thing.Bonus: Is this Majesty’s Ardania?You are correct, sire! Impire takes place in the fictional fantasy realm of Ardania of the Majesty series. Much of the design, how things look and act, are direct nods to their counterparts in Majesty. The plot even involves you playing as a subservient demon in the employ of the son of a certain Scottish-sounding Advisor...			"

												Game is quite fun.Initially was quite annoying (heroes dropping in every part of dungeon out of nowhere) but since that has been patched out, you can really have fun.Game was rushed, a lot of bugs may have stayed there, never managed to play coop for example.Controlls are also no too intuitive (controlling large ammounts of minions is tough) but when you get over it, it is quite a nice game.Surely way better than the meta score suggests.While it is nowhere near close to Dungeon Keeper 2, it is better than Dungeons (as Impire actually does bring some fun).I would recommend the game to the fans of Dungeon Keeper or Overlord games.If you are not... Well, think it over? My scoure would be 6.5/10.If they tweaked upgrades and add in normall, decent way of controlling of your minions, I'd give it 8.5/10. Seriously. Those two things (initially 3, with ladders they patched out) are the things that mostly affect the low score in my opinion.			"

												I came expecting something similar to Dungeon Keeper, was I wrong. I ended up making it mid-way through the 2nd chapter and gave up. It's a micromanagement hell. There were several things that frustrated me with the game, here they are:CombatMicromanagement of your troops is non-existent. Healer getting mashed? No quick way to pull him out of battle, hotkeys are terrible. You end up just teleporting all your squads in and letting it resolve itself. When the fighting is over you have to teleport your troops to the kitchen to feed them. Feeding them refills their ""aggression"", if the unit's aggression is too low, they suffer combat penalties. Doing this over and over is mind-numbing.StoryPainful. I can't believe I sat through those cutscenes. Voice acting is mediocre, the slow pacing and grade-school writing make it even worse.Tech Trees and ResourcesYou basically get points for each achievement in the dungeon (e.g. Killing a hero, building 2 traps, building 10 traps, raiding a village, etc). Those points unlock buildings, units, unit special abilities, etc. The problem is having to do that in every single map make it especially painful. Most of the tech tree items are worthless--All you need to do is make a beeline toward some combat units (tank, healer, damage-dealer) and some key structures (to do things like upgrade armor). Resource gathering is another pain point. While the idea of sending squads to raid nearby villages sounds cool, it ends up being a major chore. The map sucks and you are limited in the number of squads you have, yes more squads are unlockable but you already have most of them them tied up in combat to advance the storyline. (And you have all your troops in combat because: read above, combat sucks).Hero Invasions AnnoyancesSo you've started on a new map and all your troops are tied up gathering resources or fighting to advance the story. Now you have random ladders spawning across your dungeon to slaughter your workers. Traps? Traps are worthless. Another ladder...great. Teleport troops over, wait for fighting to finish. Teleport to kitchen to feed your troops, then teleport your troops back to where they were. More ladders? Wash, rinse, repeat.			"

												Failed wannabe. Shallow, grindy and distinctly unfunny. I wrote a fairly detailed commentary about this game detailing the things I didn't like (and why) along with the (far fewer) things I did like.Then I discovered that the devs practiced censorship and my comments were all deleted.Poor-to-meh game  +  censorship  +  dev's attitude  =  a game I uninstalled and a dev that's been blacklisted.

												My Impire experience was terminated prematurely by a corrupted save game, leaving me time for a quick review. Luckily it was my second playthrough, so I already finished the game.  I didn't play dungeonkeeper a lot so I wasn't stuck to that concept. Don't be fooled by my hours ingame. Many of them were replays due to bugs.Even after the patch it seems to be quite buggy (or some may be features, I honestly can't say). But the problem of this game is best described by Baal himself ""oh how tedious"". The game seems bent on ruining any chance of having fun. Managing will mostly be clearing ladders, feeding your peeps, killing heroes that enter your dungeon - rince and repeat. In between you might be able to play the game ... a bit. There is some fun to be had in the cutscenes, though they get old really fast and you'll be waiting them out at the end. The graphics don't help, though I liked the rooms with the imps running around doing what imps do. Building an optimal dungeon would be nice, but there are usually fixed rooms in the way. The units are ok, but there just aren't enough. Halfway in the game you've seen them all. *spoiler* I highly recommend going with Velvet so you can play with some other units even though the differences are small. Units might respond to your commands but 50% of the time they decide what to do, damn smartypants Trolledons! In the chaos it's hard to click anything anyway so it might be for the best. Some corridors I couldn't enter until I carefully maneuvered my camera in just the right angle and by them ""heroes have entered your dungeon"".It looks like the game got stuck in beta. Even after the patch there is no load button. Only one save game (which after the patch still gets corrupted). And the ladders omg the ladders, who thought that would be fun? Yes, I played most of the game with the 'no ladder' setting but still ... do you like commercials during your favorite movie? Of course you do!Maybe some day with a lot of player input it might be a nice game. Until then, be sure to spend your money and time on another game. If only the game would let you play...			"

												Talk about a hugely dissapointing game!It has such potential! I Was watching TotalBiscuit Pre-Alpha-review of it and thought, hey this game could be great. But they don't seem to have done anything, they game must still be in alpha.It's tedious, it's NOT fun, it's so freaking aweful it's hard to keep a straight face. It is so bad, because it COULD have been soooo good. But it feels half-hearted and abandoned. And thats a big shame. It could have been the next Dungeon Keeper.My hopes, would be that they (or someone who WANTS to make it good) goes back and mod it to hell and back. Fix bugs, add AI to units, upgrade the Dungeon management system and much much more.This game would make the perfect Game Design School project on ""How to improve a good idea into a finished good game!"" because it could have been!Maybe i'll re-install it in a year and see... damn wasted money so far.

												I liked Dungeon Keeper and Dungeons. Thought this game might be similar, which it is similar except for one thing. I have owned the game over a year and I have yet to even finish it. Not because of a lack of time, but a lack of interest.You simply have no options when choosing a room to build. That room is that size period. So this makes any layouts kinda blah.The outdoor raids are boring, unless you like watching timers.Adventurers raiding your dungeons are annoying period. They rarely use the enterance because the drop ladders anywhere in your dungeon at random.This game is a shoulda, woulda, coulda.			"

												Thank goodness I got this game in a bundle otherwise I would feel ripped off. The one good thing about this game is the, uh, voice acting? And I guess the squad system.Now, to get a full idea of just how bad this game is, I want you to go play Dungeon Keeper 2 if you haven't already. Awesome game right? Most of your time is actually spent working on defending the dungeon and building it up. Most of the other qualities of micromanagement (while still available to you for the most part) are pretty much taken care of. Impire goes in the complete opposite direction. Most of your time is spent microing your forces, sometimes for no obvious reason. To make matters worse you aren't given any keyboard shortcuts so what should be a 10-20 minute map will stretch into a 60 minute match of you having to replace fallen minions that shouldn't have died, training them, and feeding all of your units (almost individually). Units low on aggression? You'll need to order them through a menu to go get food (context or squad). And if you have 15 units in the same situation? You'll need to individually tell each one to do the same. And you'll have to do this repeatedly throughout a single game. Which leads to simply ordering units into squads and never utilizing a full force (because it is a waste of time). And if you do go with extra units, if you want all of them to follow the leader? No matter how you do it, you'll need to tell each and every single one of them -individually- to follow Baal. And if you die? You have to repeat the whole process. They can't follow other units (IE, a vanguard squad) or do other things that might make sense.And the story? The adviser and Baal are just whiney. No, they aren't funny. I could tell there were moments where the developers were trying to make me laugh, but . . . It just fell flat on its face. Paradox, hire Teamfourstar next time. They know how to write (and voice) comedy. And the story just isn't worth it.Don't get me wrong though, this game does seem to have some good qualities buried underneath the clunky menus and terrible micromanagement. They just aren't worth your time and effort. Which is sad since this game was obviously inspired by Dungeon Keeper. If you like the ideas behind this game I suggest you sit down with Dungeon Keeper or, if you really don't mind wasting hours learning how to play it (it will be worth it), Dwarf Fortress.			"

Not quite Dungeon Keeper, perhaps even betterYup. I'm saying, having played DK's 1 and 2, this game is kinda winning. If you're familiar with DK you're familiar with this game and much of the mechanics are the same but slightly more polished. You have more direct control of your minions and less controll over the layout out and size of your rooms. Tactical combat improvment in exchange for more building constraints. Seeing how much combat you'll be doing in this game, this is a good trade-off.Where this game shines though is in the characters. Baal and company have some rather charming personalities that grew on me. The humor is on the nose and the game itself rather challenging but in a more casual way. A good buy.PROS* Likeable characters* Well polished mechanics* Plenty of room for experimentationCONS* Loading time is horrendous.* Micromanaging becomes tedious at times.All in all i liked this more than I liked DUngeon Keeper. though it suffers the same problem as other 'Evil'  games.  And the fac that you're supposed to be evil kinda takes the joy out of it. Besides there doesn't seem to be much you can do to really be especially evil. To quote a funny man. It's the difference between Lawful EVil and CHaotic Evill one's a job and the other's for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.Trythe demo first though I do not think you will be disappointed.			"

												Good game, Its a lot like Dungeon Keeper but more focused on the battle system then the dungeon building. You dont get to build a cool custom dungeons like on dungeon keeper. On this the rooms are pre designed and sized. The only thing i dont like so far is how long each mission is. I personally would prefer shorter but more plentifull missions. With that said you should get plenty of hours played on it. I bought it when it first came out and it was super buggy so i put it in my try again later pile and i just got around to playing it again and its pretty fun. Get it if you are a fan of dungeon crawlers or dungeon keeper it will keep you entertained.			"
