												Imagine with me, if you will.  You are leader of a small but prosperous empire, controlling roughly two dozen small star systems.  You and your allies have been at war with the most powerful civilization for years, and you've managed to gain the upper hand.  A long and costly war has cost you several star systems and most of your fleet.  Finally, they agree to peace.  You sign the papers, and begin to focus on internal affairs.As you check your intelligence briefings, you notice that another empire has been building up their military.  Significantly.  As it stands, the Yor have four to five times as much firepower as the rest of the nations put together, as well as a much larger population.  They begin to greedily prey upon the weaker nations, demanding tribute or conquering them.You halt all social and military production, and begin pouring all of your resources into your R&D projects, developing weapons and shields specialized to counter the growing threat.  One by one, your allied nations fall to swarms of powerful Yor ships.After the research had advanced sufficiently, you empty your coffers and upgrade your small fleet, and purchase some additional cruisers.  You position your fleet on the Terran-Yor border and wait.Its time.  Your destroyers flash across the border, seeking out the numerically superior Yor fleets and engaging them.  Terran ships begin to explode, but the Yor are technologically inferior, and they explode faster.  War erupts across the galaxy as civilizations pick their sides.  A galactic conflagration begins.Behind your destroyers, fleets of heavily-escorted troop carriers descend onto Yor worlds, crammed with billions of troops.  Tens, then hundreds, of billions die as your begin to inch your way towards the Yor homeworlds.  Your war machine keeps turning, producing dozens of sophisticated warships.Eventually, Icos itself falls.  You survey your vast empire, won with the blood of countless billions.  Your huge fleet dwarfs all others.  Your allies are afraid of you.  You've positioned fleets on all of your borders, backed up with troop ships.Then you realize: you've become what you set out to destroy.This is Galactic Civilizations.			"

												Apparently I'm not saying anything new about this, since it's so highly rated and regarded already, it seems, but nonethless:A game that I have played, stopped playing, and come back to playing again many times over the years. I've enjoyed it a lot, and for some reason a big title or two will come out and I'll eventually forget about galactic civ. for a while, and then eventually  I'll stumble upon it... always surprised by how much I enjoy playing it, time and again.It lacks some of the graphical 'bells and whistles' of a Civ-type of turn-based strategy game, but as any player of ck2 knows, what a game lacks in polish can be very much made up for in actual game content and replayability. The depth of galactic civ (and ck2, for that matter) makes civilization look like simplistic child's play (unplayable to me, as a by-product) in comparison. Distinctive differences/cool elements of the game:- Skill trees are actually unique to every race.- fully customizable ships (designing ships became one of my favorite elements of the game early, to my surprise).- plot/narrative elements that differ game-to-game, making it very replayable.- Races themselves are fully customizable, adding another layer of replayability and depth to the game's customization.On the downside, it has many layers of things to control and 'develop,' so to someone coming to this from civ or simpler games of that nature, galactic civ could be daunting, by all means, even overly so. This is a game for a real turn-based strategy-lover, who wants to have a depth of 'control' that might be beyond the average gamer, whoever or whatever that even means...?I'd say for a strategy-lover (someone who likes games like ck2, europa universalis, etc.) it's a must have regardless of price (I don't think it's more than $20, this far from publication). If you're a civilization/spore lover and you're worried this might go a little too deep and not have the 'sheen' you look for in a game, wait for it to go on sale, as it does every so often, and get it for $5, and give it a shot; Who knows? The developers clearly labored over it with love, and put in a lot of good work in making a very fine game (as I see it).			"

I have registered for this dumb account proccess and the game errors after launch every time. why this is now part of this game I do not care but i feel it is now becoming a ""process"" for running some steam games.

												Ah, GalCiv2... Memories...I sank so, so many hours into this game. I owned it on CD before losing them and having to buy it again on Steam. And then sank in some more hours, for good measure.So, what makes this game awesome? It's often compared to Civilization, but in space. Yeah, that sounds about right... but it's not totally true either. See, GalCiv has many things Civilization does not. Unique tech trees for every race: check. Unique gameplay for every race: check. Being able to customize every single ship: check. That's right, no Warrior vs Warrior here. You can build your ships however you like with the ship builder and put whatever weapons, armour, modules and engines you damn well like.The political system is also well tought-out and doesn't feel out of place. Want a bigger economic bonus? Go Star Democracy! But what's that? Oh yeah, we're a democracy now, I can't just declare war on a whim... Alright then, let's ask what the parliament thinks. They approve? Oh yeah, let's kick some alien butt, baby! (If your approval is too low, good luck getting your people to follow you into war. They have other priorities you know.)Okay, enough talk. You're a strategy fan? Need another 4x game to sink time into? Get this game and thank me later!			"

												Ok listen if you're a strategy game fan you need to own this game no questions asked. This is about as good as you're going to get when it comes to the 4x genre and is pretty much Civilization 5 in space but better and with its own ship designer. There is an extremely large amount of techs, buildings, weapons and so on so yeah a lot of variety. Even the ship builder is well developed as you can build a ship anyway you like and equip it anyway you like based on the technology you have availible. With Galactic Cvilizations 3 announced recently and the low price this game is at there is no reason why you should not pick this one up and give it a go if you like strategy at all I promise you won't regret it.

												If you like Civ IV/Civ V, epic, long games, and space, then GCII is definitely for you. It strikes an incredible balance between providing large-scale epicness and surprisingly robust micromanager's playgrounds.**While micromanager's playgrounds are not uncommon in modern games, it's exceedingly uncommon for a game to include them sporadically enough that they don't become tedious obligations and yet give them enough weight to make them worthwhile and rewarding. You can go an entire game without ever creating your own ship if that's not your cup of tea--but boy is it ever satisfying to wreck other civilizations with ships you designed.**GCII is such a vast, epic game it'd be a bargain at twice the price. It's got a bit of a learning curve, but dive right in with a custom scenario and learn by doing until you master the incredible depth and number of facets to it--it's way easier than doing the tutorials. Then, like Civ games, sit in stunned silence when you look up and realize that you've been playing for 13 straight hours. It's that good.			"

												Galactic Civilzation takes a different spin with ""civ"" games.This game offers so much content in terms of making decisions, upgrading your ships and such. upgrading technology which impacts how the game is played. You can even create your own Civilization, however the downside is that you have to use template portraits of galactic leaders both big and small.The AI is very well done, you can really see the differences between the lowest diffculty setting to the highest. However, the downside is that it will either handicap them or the player. depending upon what setting you want to go with. The combat system is pretty straight forward ""The more capable you are, the better results"". Also this game offers an indirect warning to players ""don't expand too early or quickly"" sure it will help your civilization get resources and such. But however you have to constantly manage the planets you colonize and later on, as the game progresses it will become incresingly diffcult to do anything.Events in the game are usually recycled or ""important"" events but they either happen once or not at all. The story mode is pretty good for a space game, but by the end of it all, you just want to play the game itself and not any story Lastly, there are no mods for this game, no matter what anyone tells you.I would recommend this game for players who love civilzation games and love space games			"

												Imagine Sid Mier's Civilization in Space!Despite being classical, this is still one of the best turn-based 4X space strategy, developed by Stardock known for established reputation of developing great strategy games.There're no other games with the same variety of strategic options as this game has.You choose your race from 10 preset ones or create your own custom race, pick your political party with various bonuses and aim for victory on randomly generated galaxy through negotiations or wars with other races, you can also choose which victory condition so it's replayability is quite high!There're so many options you can choose while playing, such as alignment of your civilization (good, neutral, evil), form of your government, and you can adjust your tax rate, the ratio of your government spending and its distribution to 3 categories : ship, building, research.The most fun part is ship design, this allows you to create your own ship by combining various components!You can also choose what type and how many of weapons or shields or engines to mount on your ship.This game needs many requirements to declare war compared to other 4x games, which makes the game progress slower than other 4X titles, crush of civilizations begin around 100th turn.The range your ship can travel from your friendly planets is determined by the amount and efficiency of life-support modules on your ship, which means you need to research better ones to colonize or invade further planets.Turning citizens to colonists or soldiers for invasion means less workers and tax payers on your planet so you need enough population and your people's approval which affects planet's population growth rate for maintaining your economy.Espiionage is also important to know which type of weapons and shields your enemies use.Yes, interplanetary warfare costs so many resources including manpower...The only annoying drawback is that it needs a Stardock account before activation...its old menu, interface and graphic aren't much concern for playing.This is definitely a great strategy worthy playing.Thanks to its tutorial and many players' guide, getting the rule isn't difficult.(Japanese translation below)==============================古い作品ながら宇宙が舞台のターン制4Xゲームの中では今でも傑作、ストラテジー系ゲームの製作に定評のあるStardock製で他作品に無い戦略性の高さが売りです。既存の10種族か自作のカスタム種族を使い、ランダム生成される銀河を舞台に他種族との交渉や戦争を通して勝利を目指す、要はシド星の宇宙版です。複数の勝利条件からどれを選ぶかも自由で、何度でも遊べます。プレイ中も自種族の属性(善・中立・悪)や政治形態など様々な選択肢が用意され、また税率や政府支出額と造船・建設・研究の3分野への配分率も調節できます。最も楽しいのは船の設計、部品を組み合わせ自分だけの宇宙船を作成可能、搭載する兵器の種類や量も調整できます。他の作品に比べ戦争の条件が厳しく、ゲームの進行は他の同ジャンル作品に比べ遅めです、戦争には100ターン前後かかります。宇宙船の行動可能範囲は生命維持装置の搭載量と性能で決まるため、遠くの星への入植や侵攻には高性能のものを開発しないといけません。また徴兵や入植により惑星の人口＝労働力と納税額が減るので、人口と人口増加率に関わる支持率を一定に保つ必要があります。更に敵種族の装備を知るため諜報活動も重要です。難点はStardockのアカウントが必要なこと、一昔前のインターフェース周りとグラフィックはプレイに支障をきたす程ではありません。チュートリアルと多くのユーザーが書いたガイドがあり定石を覚えるのは簡単です。間違いなくプレイする価値がある作品です。			"

												This thumbs down is for the Steam version of GCII: UE (although I haven't played the GoG version so I could likely give it a thumbs down as well). The game-play/mechanics are actually very fun and well-designed but, there's a major problem that prevents me from truly enjoying it--the 2GB Virtual Memory limitation of 32 bit applications.I love 4X games. Specifically, I love playing 4X games on the largest possible map with the maximum number of opponents and the highest density of resources (in this case planets, stars, asteroids and other celestial bodies). I play 4X games this way so I can shape the game-world to my liking. Unfortunately, that is impossible in this game.Because this game was developed as a 32 bit application, its VM maxes out at 2GB. This is a huge problem. After a 100+ turns (sometimes fewer) the game will crash because it runs out of VM. I tried a 4GB patcher on the application with no luck. I did manage to get a game past 500 turns by playing on the very lowest graphics settings but, after a point I still encountered the VM crash.I suppose my biggest mistake was buying this game on Steam. From what I've read, it appears that using a 4GB patcher will work on the GoG version but, not on the Steam version. If you enjoy playing massive 4X games that last for 100s of hours/turns--don't buy this game unless you are willing to pick it up on GoG and patch it to use 4GB of VM.			"

If you play enough you get to the point where you can work with the AI so you can gain ever greater amounts of money and technology simply through trade.But until you reach that point, the game is enjoyable, challenging and engaging, with a lot of neat ships you can design and have to redesign every 10 turns because your new technology makes it entirely obsolete.

												For now I have to dislike. Initially, I thought it would be an excellent alternative to the much more expensive galactic civilization 3. Little did I know that once downloaded I would have to sign up for their crappy website in order to play. So i spent my time registering. Of course, when I attempted to play the game, I couldnt play it as their website login wasnt working. So now whenever i feel the urge to play, i have to run it in administrator mode. I get no achievements for the game, it doesnt even show that i actually have over 20 hours in this game. Its fun, but not worth the hassle it puts me through to play. You are better off saving you money for the 3rd game and playing something that isnt frustrating to launch.			"

												I can already tell I'm going to sink hours upon hours of my life into this game. I have never really been big on Civilization games. I just never really enjoyed them. But this is unbelievably fun. Just the feeling of researching so many things to build up the might of your military, the progression and improvement of your research, the approval of you government and the strength of your social skills is overwhelmingly fantastic. And when you become strong enough, invading planets and eradicting other Empires/Civilizations, working your way up from weakest to strongest gives your the feeling that you're powerful beyond belief (even though in real life you wouldn't stand a chance doing all of this).This game takes a while to understand, but that's what it's meant to be like, I find that to be a plus.Get this gem. It's a definite 10/10 in my book. Definitely worth the full price, even after all of these years.			"

												My history with Gal Civ II is long. Origionally, I had the disk version before any of the add ons were introduced. I have not touched the disks in many, many years. One day while cleaning, I discovered them . So, after a little bit of googling, I discovered my version had none of the extended cotent the UE has. I go to Stardock and contact support. Thankfully they ahve a live chatroom that made life easier. After explaining that I had a ancient copy , I wanted to know how to aquire the addon packs so I can get the full experience. to my displeasure, they informed me that they no longer sell the addons seperately. Also, I never made a Stardock account at this point because it was not even relevant or necesary for the physical version I had. After I was asked to register what I had so the support agent could at lest know what I had, they decided to give me a steam key for the ultimate edition. they did this even though I was asking a way to pay and get the add ons. Even though Stardock uses DRM n all, as long as your game is properly registered, you should have no issues whatsoever. I personally would recommend this game, even though Gal Civ III is out.  "

												this game isn't bad for a 4x game, i enjoyed playing it quite a bit, but after you learn how to win, it becomes actually fairly easy to win. basically there are certain dominant strategies that take a long time to figure out, but once you've figured them out, you can reliably win every single game, even on the hardest setting. for instance, there is a certain overpowered laser in the 'evil' branch that if you rush you can defeat anyone for the rest of the game with minimal effort. there are also strategies of mass population growth early on leading to mass cash later on. this is kind of unavoidable in a game this complex, but i feel like there should be more varied choices rather than so many specific dominant strategies. still i got 200 hours out of it before i learned enough of those strategies to get bored with the game, which is more than i can say for most games. the only 4x game i'd consider clearly superior to this game is sid meier's alpha centauri.

												Have you ever played Civilizations IV or V? Well, this is quite a similar deal but in space. I actually had this game in retail form but the CD got so f#cked over the years that it wouldn't play ever again, and with the constant price drops and sales in Steam, why not just buy it here? However, as usual, I will start explaining the bad things of the game to then move to the reasons why you should buy it as well:First and foremost, the random events. If you don’t yet know much about the game, f#cking turn them off. There are a few that will completely ruin games, and I ain’t even joking. One of them, for example, spawns a max level alien race that will seek out other puny races and will start destroying ANYTHING ANYONE HAS, with a ship so broken, you might even lose a few units trying to kill it in LATE-GAME. WHICH CAN SPAWN IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME. It’s as game-breaking as it sounds.Second, the story. The devs did put some effort into putting a story behind all the crazy sh#t that happens in these games but… Jesus anal f#ck christ, is it boring. Seriously, just ignore the story mode. It’s like story on porn, you expect it to be there, but it ain’t important in any sort of way.Also, the game has the option for you to make your own ships, which is COOL AS F#CK, however that editor is quite difficult to understand. There’s no tutorial or anything on it, so good luck getting the ropes on what the f#ck you’re doing with it.Lastly, the races already set on the game already have a set way of playing by default instead of being somewhat random. Because of this, they'll try the same bullsh#t in every match and they might get extremely repetitive. Specially when only one or two of them are more pacifist and the rest will constantly wait for a chance to start a pointless war against you.Getting that crap out of the way, what do we got left? An interesting alternative to classic Civilizations. While the races themselves are nowhere as interesting and can come as cliched and one dimensional, a decent effort was put to make them.Something that I totally love is how colonizing works. There’s a f#ck-load of planets out there, but as with real life, not all of them are good to live in. You couldn’t live on f#cking Jupiter, however you can study some weird technologies and make some of those damn planets habitable later on. How good the planets are is quite randomized and some of them are nearly useless by how small they are, but it's good enough.Trading and doing crap with other Civs is also fun enough. You can force them to give you crap like a damn mafia boss, trade normally or even give stuff away for free, and all of that will change how they see you. Another good detail on the game is the karma system, which works similarly to the previous point. At random times, the game will give you some details on crap going on and you can choose what to do with it, usually just being the “nice guy” option, the “neutral” option and the “F#CK ALL OF YOU SIDEWAYS” option. All civs have a different karma, so it makes them all very unique.The game also lets you create civilizations, not only your own, but to fight against, which is great, and offers decent modding support... Although the modding community is a bit dead, as after all this is an old game and a sequel already came out.Finally, even though I’ve already♥♥♥♥♥♥a bit on top of the ship creator tools, I will however say that I’ve seen some serious sh#t on them. Like, seriously, you should look out for crap that people have done.Do I recommend this game? If you're a fan of strategic games similar to CivV, then yes. However, ignore the sequel, Galactic Civilizations 3. For all I know, it's average at best. This one is still fairly superior, even if it's old as sh#t. A solid pick on a sale, and a game that will last you hours and hours.TL;DR Edition: Fun take on the Civilizations style games by setting everything on space with weird aliens and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fun gameplay, overall good game on a sale.

												I decided to pick up a new 4x space game after pouring many hours into Endless Space. Endless Space lacked complexity and I searched for a more in depth game. Galactic Civilizations 2 fulfill that criteria. I started playing this in 2015 so I have no nostalgic feelings for it. The game is quite good and fun despite its age and limitations, in fact it is the best 4x space game I have played so far (other space 4x I've played are MOO2, Endless Space and Sword of the Stars). Take a good look at the pros and cons because some points might put you off.FeaturesGrid-based mapYou are not restricted to starlanes. You can go anywhere you want. Trade routesFeighters will fly from planet to planet generating more money when they are further away from your planet. They can be attacked.EspionageGet intel and placing spies inside enemy buildings will cripple their production or research depending what building type is being sabotaged.AlignmentYou have a choice to be evil, neutral or good. Races with similar alignments tend to have better relations with eachother and will grant you unique alignment tech and bonuses.United planetsYou will vote on proposals once every year. These could turn into laws if they get the majority of votes.Minor RacesThese are independent races which do not seek to expand and conquer. They are mainly there for trading purposesPoliticsVery thin feature in terms of depth but it spices up the game. Choose your party and government. Changing governments will grant you economic bonuses but will need a higher approval rating to stay in power as the leading party. Multiple victory conditionsSphere of cultural influenceTaking over planets by overlapping it with your area of cultural influence.Tile based systemPlanets contain tiles. Each tile can house one building. A planet's class determines the tile limit.Pros+A.IGalciv 2 has a good AI which becomes more intelligent instead of getting more OP by stats up till Tough difficulty setting. This game has the best AI I've encountered in any 4x game. Races will make alliances with smaller Civilizations to pounce larger ones, they will attack Civilizations which are under siege to take a part of the pie or use spies for destabilization before going in for the kill. They will ask for help when they are under attack or let you know they will declare war to a Civ if you do so. They rarely take any suicidal or crazy decisions. Civs will properly make use of ships and technology given to them.+DiplomacyDiplomacy is solid. It is not gimmicky but very functional. You might trade money, influence, treaties, technology, ships and planets besides the relation factors which determines your relation with that civ. Building up your relations is important for maintaining peace and increases your chance of survival significantly. Other 4x games have the same diplomacy system but it always felt insignificant or ineffective in those games unlike this one. The game is designed in such way that there is no way around diplomacy. The AI is competent at trading and extorting money.+Empire buildingThe main focus of the game is on empire building and comparable to the Civilization series. There is a good developing pace of your empire. Galciv 2 encourages you to specialize planets by exploiting buildings with large bonuses which only work when you build them on planets which are specialized in areas like economics or population growth for instance otherwise their bonus is useless. +ExploitationPlanets could house bonus tiles which grants you a bonus whenever a specific building is being constructed on them. Bonus tiles may boost up your production even more ranging from double to seven times its normal output per tile. Exploitation of these tiles will give you an edge and make smaller planets more important when they have bonus tiles on them. Also resources in space can be mined for exploitation.+Races play differentlySuper abilties differentiate the way races play in addition to their different stat buffs. Some races might persuate civs getting into war easier, make more deals per turn or breed 8 times quicker if their approval is 100%.+StatisticsNo stone is left unturned concerning statistical information. Graphs, (relative) stats, event history, everything is here.+Unique tech trees for each race+Complex+Lots of content+Sandbox feel+Ship editor+Fast turn speed+Custom Race+Governors+High Replayability+Mega events+High amount of difficulty levels+Stable in terms of bugs and crashes+Runs on a potatoMixed+/- MicromanagementNeeds more micromanaging than most other 4x game. +/- Slow paceIs slower paced than most 4x games. Good for some people, bad for others.+/- Massive tech treeWhile the tree is absolute massive and diverse it left me mixed. Combat related tech branches are lacking in diversity, originality and every new combat tech gives you only an increase in damage or defense. It's like Laser 1, Laser 2, Laser 3 and then switches to a different name like plasma 1, plasma 2 without changing anything except weapon damage and name, this goes on for dozens of tech levels. Just uninspired and a shame because all other parts of the tree are well done.+/- High learning curveCons- CombatThere is no tactical combat, It is auto-resolving. Place your ship onto the ship of your enemy and the battle will auto-resolve itself. You cannot fire projectiles on the main map as in civilization with archers, it's placing units on top of eachother. You have zero influence on battles, it is even worse than endless space (here you could at least draw cards and choose formations).- No comeback mechanismThere is a point of no return it seems. This is where other 4x games fail as well. You will encounter a point where other civs are unable to keep up with you and you essentially won the game from that point on. To conquer the remaing galaxy is just a matter of mindless grinding where civs are unable to make a comeback other than teaming up with races to fight you.- No customizable galaxy shapesGalaxy shapes are predetermined maps. Like choosing a spiral map gives you a scenario where the parameters are set in stone. You cannot choose a shape and customize its size thus you will be ending up with the same random squared maps because these will lend itself for customization.  - Interface not intuitive and in some areas clunky- Not 4x beginner friendly- No stealth elements- Lack of super weapons- Semi-cartoony looking race portraits- Dated graphics- No ingame tutorial and encyclopedia- The game doesn't show you how to properly balance a game- Upgrading multiple starbases to the max can be chore- Out of memory issue on largest mapPlaying on the largest map size is impossible due to 32 bit limitations meaning it will crash.- Space is lacking featuresSpace is very dull. There are no nebulas, pulsars, black holes or other environmental anomalies that affect gameplay. - No idealogy- No teleportation mechanism like wormholes or stargates - Alt+tab could make your game crash- Lack of good music tracks- Lack of tooltips "

												Before Windows 8 and before GalCiv3 came out, this was a pretty epic.. singleplayer only game that seriously should have been re-worked for multiplayer.But more to the point, it requires a massive amount of very tedius micromanagement.your probably thinking.. oh that can be so bad...Per.. Turn..Oh crap..  Yea exactly.. and each game can literally go hundreds of turns before its conclusion.But hey, its one of the VERY few games you can actually customize your own units to how you actually want them.Would I recommend buying it?  well sadly.. not anymore.  Its unstability makes it very un-desirable to continue playing it, not to mention the complete lack of support for any other OS other then windows.To be fair, if you asked me a few years ago when this title was newer, I'd have said yes, get it, its a glorious turn based strategy game.

												one of my favorite series.  This game has one of the smartest ai ive ever seen in any game.  You will actually watch your opponents in order what to figure what to do yourself, and they have done some interesting things with the skill/tech trees and ship designs.  The factions are pretty cool, and you can tweek them around to your playstyle fairly well too.the graphics are pretty simple as  this is a pretty small company, but the game has got an extreme amount of depth to it.  I actually prefer this game to endless space or the sid meiers civ's both much newer and more expensive games.			"

												As someone who has never really enjoyed the 4x genre, I've been pleasantly surprised by Galactic Civilizations II. The learning curve isn't too steep, but the game has an obvious depth. The ship creation is a fun little toy that I would liken to Spore's creature creation, but an entire game can be played without using it even once.			"

												I got this game months ago as part of some Humble Bundle or another. Today I decided to finally see if it lived up to the hype.First, I had to create a Stardock account. I didn't have to validate the e-mail address to start playing, so I suppose I could've just entered a fake address. Seems like completely pointless DRM. (I mean, even moreso than usual.)After I finally got to start playing the game, it turned out to basically be a clone of Master of Orion 2. It has a few extra gimmicks (like having to choose the location for each planetary construction), and the interface is much, much worse. I built an asteroid mine, and then tried to select it, but no matter where I clicked it selected the mining ship instead. I had to move the ship to a different asteroid in order to see where the mine was sending supplies.Speaking of moving ships, for whatever reason, instead of ship movement being planned during your turn and happening when you advance time, ship movement happens during your turn as soon as you right-click on a destination. There's no way to undo movement (as far as I know), so if you accidentally right-click, you've wasted a couple turns of movement for your active fleet. Also, there's apparently no way to not have an active fleet.Eventually I wanted to see if there were any keyboard shortcuts I didn't know about. The options don't have a keybinding menu, so I tried to check online. That's when I learned that GalCiv2 breaks the Steam Overlay. The Steam version was released over three years ago, and they still haven't fixed it?After closing the game so I could open a web browser, I checked to see if there was some way to get the Steam Overlay working. What I found was a thread in the Stardock forums where someone asked how to fix it, and the game's community descended on them like a swarm of piranha. Apparently, like EA and Ubisoft, Stardock has its own Steam knockoff. They also have a rabid fanbase that practically worships the developers. Put those two things together, and you've got a forum full of crazies calling for the developers to sabotage the Steam version to try to drive people to use the local knockoff.That killed off the last bit of interest I had in the game.My personal recommendation would be to buy Master of Orion 1+2 from GOG instead. Better games at less than half the price, and no DRM.			"

												Story Time So there I was the emperor of a vast and powerful galactic empire, nobody could stop me anymore the destiny of my imperial ambition had almost been reached but yet I felt hollow there was something missing, after some soul searching I came to a revelation what I was missing was a symbol of my might and power, a weapon of unimaginable destructive power. So I ordered my minions to start researching the knowledge and tools necessary to build such a weapon. The years past and my patience was tested but the minions had finally acquired the capability to build the weapon, so I ordered the construction to begin immediately in the deepest part of my core systems and worlds.  Once again many years past and by this point patience was an all but lost virtue to me, but at last it was finally done, my symbol of ultimate imperial glory, my gift to my loyal subjects and my tool of wrath against the taint of alien influence. It was truly beautiful as vast as a small moon with the power to end the stars themselves, but to my annoyance I had failed to realize to take into account the continued expansion of my imperial border during the years of researching and building. The sad realization that struck me was that my empire was now so vast that my enemies where all to far away for my new imperial child to be used on.  I was enraged all those years spent making this truly beautiful and pure imperial force but no alien taint to be destroyed. So I sat down on my throne and started to ponder how can I have created something so magnificent for it to be unused, it was simply not acceptable the galaxy had to be shown what true power was. I stared at the imperial holomap and I made the decision, the galaxy simply had to know. I sat eagerly on my throne on the imperial flagship waiting for the Imperial Intelligence director to give me the news, two hours went by when the director finally arrived and told me what I had been waiting for, he said the weapon had reached its destination. I ordered the blast shield to be lowered on the bridge, in front of me I could see a bright star and to some distance on the right from the ship I could see my weapon. I yelled fire, a beam was fired so beautiful and bright it could blind the gods, it hit the star and what happened next was something I can only describe as watching the big bang itself happen, it was that magnificent a true imperial marvel. I had shown the galaxy, I was no longer hollow.  Now that I think back it amuses me that all it took to show the galaxy my true power was the sacrifice of one imperial star system. 3 planets and 40 billion of my loyal subjects, but then what is 40 billon subjects compared to an emperors destiny to reach true imperial glory. Thinking back there is only one thing that still fills me with some regret and that is that the 6th Imperial Fleet was parked a little to close to the blast radius.Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 8/10Music 9/10Graphics 8/10Replayability 10/10One of the best if not the best 4x game out there, a classic gets a 9/10 from me.

												If you love Civ games , you are going to like this too since it is basically just Civ in a space suit/skin. My only real beef with GC2  is that it is another space game on a 2-D map.  Sure I know that the map tries to create the illusion that it is in space and at least the battle viewer and the really fun ship designer are  3-D but what I really want is a spherical or cubic strategic map, you know like a map of space :D This is the main reason that I am not going to buy GC III. Maybe I will get my wish in GC4.			"

												I don't think I'll ever have as much fun with a 4x game that doesn't let me build my own ships from scratch...(That's why you failed, MOO4)      The gameplay itself is solid enough for the most part, and I just can't hate them for putting together a major update a decade after the game was released, which should tell you enough about the designers; gotta love perfectionists...      Simply being able to create literally any ship in sci-fi, and/or just something you threw together, and watch them lay waste to anything you point them at, or just build them and sell them to somebody unscrupulous who'll do it for you=fun: literally hundreds of hours worth.     Oh, of course, always remember to sell crappier versions than your own fleet, or it can become unpleasant if one of those random, diplomatic events rolls around, especially after you've been mucking around in the raceconfig files to make things interesting.  Good Game, really.I haven't tried GC3 as of yet, but I hope they've made some good improvements, and didn't wreck anything. -CheersPS:  Watching multiple variants of Veritech fighters escorting an ID4 City-Destroyer face off against Stargate Daedalus-Class ships escorting X-COM Battleships?

The early game was fun, but the middle just felt like a long slog where I would just hit the next turn button over and over again. The victor felt like it was determined in the early game, but there was a long slog to the end.Pros: Pretty, interesting setting and variety of racesCons: Dull, shallow, and pointless.

												To hear more of my thoughts on this game, check out the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[gamehoardpodcast.com]GameplayAs the name might imply, Galactic Civ II plays a lot like the Civilization series. This is definitely not a bad thing and Galactic Civ II expands on the formula in interesting ways. Rather than just unlocking new units, new technologies unlock new ship parts that you can use to design your own ships. Want a slow moving transport with tons of armor? Build it. Want a super fast fighter that can zip across the galaxy and deal out damage but goes down in one hit? Go for it. I really enjoyed this aspect of the game and found that it made combat very rewarding.Another great aspect of the game is the fantastic AI. I really got the sense that the AI players actually know how to play the game and aren't successful just due to unfair bonuses, as is sometimes the case in 4X strategy games. This is important because the game completely lacks multiplayer, which is a strange omission, even with the age of this game.Overall, it's a lot of fun to just start a random map and begin conquering the galaxy. There are lots of different victory conditions and lots of strategies for pursuing them. I won with a mix of military strength and focus on culture to win an influence victory, but was simultaneously pursuing an ascension victory, which requires capturing energy from ascension crystals scattered around the map.Unfortunately, I didn't find the campaign very fun or interesting. All missions seemed to rely on military strategy alone but didn't even start you off with military technology. The result was a slow and clumsy build up to a strategy-less conflict. I spent the majority of my time in the sandbox mode, as I expect is true of most players.PresentationBoth the art and sound in Galactic Civ II is good, but not great. It's all fairly standard sci fi fair and feels pretty derivative and uninspired. These aren't very important aspects to me in a turn-based strategy game, so I was happy to play while listening to my own music. Presentation is definitely a major differentiating factor between this game and the Civilization series.One good aspect of the presentation is that the parts you use in building ships actually animate differently, with shields and weapon systems having different effects during battle.Also, don't expect much in the way of a riveting story.OverallI really enjoyed my time with Galactic Civilizations II and it really does hit that ""one more turn"" paradigm. If you are looking for a space-based 4X strategy game, Galactic Civ II will definitely scratch that itch and you can have a lot of fun building up your empire			"

												Galactic Civilizations is by far one of my favorite games of all time. This game drew me in from the very start with it's immense levels of customization, almost every thing about the game can be changed without the use of mods. Don't like any of the races and factions in the vanilla game? Fine, you can make your own customizing even theit AI behavior. Once you get in the game the universe is open to you will you become a ruthless Imperium of xenophobes or race of pacifists and scientists the chioce is yours. The game really opens up once you meet another race, because that is when the UN of the universe is formed where everything is voted on, though this isystem is sometimes unfair as races with population bonuses will dominate the council forcing their agenda upon the rest of the members, though the choice is yours to leave, but if you do you lose the ability to trade meaning you'll have to new sources of income. The combat in this game is lacking as it is practically non-existent, in this game combat is usually a short scene of your ships engaging your enemies' and in the end revolves on who brought the biggest weapon. In the end though this game still draws me in regularly and keeps me in it for hours at a time and I'd recomend it to anyone who is looking for a good 4X game.			"

												I can totally see why a lot of people really like this game and I would love to be one of those people, but there are a few issues that ultimately make me not recommend GalCiv2. The good stuff about this game is mentioned in all the other reviews, so I'll just focus on the things I have problems with:Combat:Yeah it's nice that you can design your own ships (even though that part isn't nearly as good as it could be) but the combat itself is 100% automated, You cannot manually take control in any way (unlike in Master of Orion 2 for example). And once you realized that only a handful of stats are relevant to the actual combat you also realize that the ship designer stuff really is pretty damn shallow.Tech Trees:Yes, the tech trees are rather extensive, but a lot of the techs are just incremental improvements of previous ones. It feels like they artificially expanded the tech trees to extend the time it takes to get through them. Just because it's big doesn't mean it's good. Or easy to find specific techs, which brings me to:The UI:Oh my god. How much time did I spend searching stuff. 'Oh there was this one planet that had that one thingy.... erm... well... it's here somewhere...'In particular I hate the UI for the shipyards. How many freaking times did I click on the wrong button by accident, not because I'm an idiot but because it's so very non-intuitive.The Alt-Tab:Yeah some games hate alt-tabbing. I tend to alt tab very often because I got other stuff going on in the background. This is one of those games that really like to crash on alt-tabbing. And sometimes just randomly for good measure. Usually it ends with a black screen and I can't even open the taskmanager to kill the process. (I'm on Windows 10 btw.)There's more, but those are my main problems with this game.If you like this kind of genre I'd say give it a try, obviously a lot of people really REALLY like this game. But I just cannot in good concience recommend this title. :(			"

												Everyone worth their salt knows that in the space-heavy 4x games the titles Masters of Orion 1 and 2 are a fundamental part of the genre's the foundation. Galactic Civilizations II manages to continue on those footsteps with it's own twist. I remember playing this one back in the days, a lot. The hours I have on this title here in Steam aren't actually truthful in that regard. However just recently I started playing GalCiv II again, and it still hooks me in like a happy salmon. Even after all these years the graphics are still ""ok"", as at least I didn't feel distracted by it from the gameplay. And oh boy what gameplay it is. It's your basic space empire simulator with managing colonies, building space stations, trading and diplomacy with other empires, building fleets of spaceships and watching them explode in hails of über-deadly weapons fire of the future. There are a lot of little twists around this main concept though. You can design your own ships, not just the loadouts but also their outlook to a surprisingly great detail. The technology tree and decisions you take incorporates some rudimentary ethics, and you can steer your empire towards good, neutrality or evil and receive technological advances accordingly. There's a storyline campaign which I haven't managed to ever finish, I guess it's a nice attempt of creating content. However free-for-all type random play is what this game excels in my opinion.There have been quite a few mentions of bugs and crashes in the reviews, but I haven't noticed any such behavior except when alt-tabbing to windows from the game. A minor point is also that you will need to register your game at some Stardock service - give them your email address and game key - to be able to play the game. I know this can upset some potential players, and I agree it's a stupid remant of ages past. However at least for myself the registration process took less than a minute and I've never received a singly spam message from Stardock.All in all, well worth it if you're into the 4x genre and can see past the slightly dated graphics and UI.

												In a word: Addictive. Yes, addictive in that terrifying, inescapable, ""just-one-more-turn"" way. Galactic Civilizations II is what you get if you take Master of Orion II, expand it so that the galaxy, tech tree and ship customisation are roughly a hundred times as huge without ever becoming boring, bump the graphics up to a standard still respectable today for a TBS, give each civilization some serious make-or-break differences (hint: the Drengin and the Yor almost always end up dominating most of the galaxy that ISN'T YOU), and shove it out there to give almost every other space-based TBS a serious poke in the eye.Galactic Civilizations II, made even better by its two expansions Dark Avatar and Twilight of the Arnor, allows you to build up a massive, sprawling interstellar empire, then throw the universe into chaos by stomping rough-shod all over everybody else's massive, sprawling interstellar empires. Each race has its own personality which helps (or hinders) it in its dealings with its various neighbours. Depending on your chosen path, your ethical choices, your research direction and your custom ship designs, you can choose peaceful, violent, subversive or a combination of methods to conquer a galaxy with a large number of customisation options. Galaxies can range in size from miniature star-cluster sized affairs which can be overrun in the space of an afternoon to immense beasts that will probably take weeks to complete a game on. You can pick and choose who shares these galaxies with you; decide how frequent habitable planets will be; choose the difficulty level and the rate at which technologies are researched, and several other options which make each galaxy a unique one. Stars and habitable planets are all renameable for a truly Make-Your-Own-Galaxy experience.Galactic Civilizations II is also still receiving updates from its developer Stardock. The most recent of these seems to have fixed the occasional crash-to-desktop errors which previously occurred, although oddly enough the newest NVidia drivers on Windows 10 seem to generate an ""out-of-date driver"" error on startup. This error however has no effect on the game itself, which still runs flawlessly on my machine.			"

I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone, and I would be wary if you're thinking about purchasing Galactic Civilizations III, as Stardock's track record shows that it will likely receive no support.

												Don't let the old UI or Graphics fool you this, game is one of the best 4x games there is. I got this game during during the Humble Bundle, and was very skeptical about it at first glance. The first time I played this game, I played it for 6 hours straight, it's like the Civilization franchise but in space (No not like Civilization: Beyond Earth kind of space) instead of just one planet. The main reason I got so into this game is probably because I loved Civilization V so much, and this game reminded me of it but in a much grander scale. I reccommend 20 times over.I rate 9.9/10			"

However, over the past few days I have stuck to it and find this game to be one of the best I have played.  I only have about 12 hours into it but it is so rewarding and very complex.  I chose this over the sequel as I heard this had some great features. Really want to try the sequel now.The perks in the game are great and are well worth looking into.  Also research can be slow but there are perks to get a better research ability.  The ship design is difficult for me but may be easier for others.Overall this is an amazing game well worth the price.			"

												This was such a time sink in college. I bought it on Stardock's (used to be) DRM free service. This has DRM btw. If you want it DRM free, buy it on GOG.The AI felt smarter in GCI. The cost curve to build structures and ships feels too high. The tech trading is easily gamed. If you get too powerful and you don't quickly act you will get game altering events such as thousands of pirate ships with advanced technology (where did they get this tech? My military is the most advanced in the galaxy and everyone else is either defeated or Canada.)With that said, the atomsphere, the ship building, making your own story in your head, the event choices. The 23.2 hours at the time of this review leaves out the 100+ I played back when Windows XP was popular. If you like 4X this game is a great experience (and you can get it a good price too during the sales).It runs great on modern machines, except for a random, very annoying delay when you end a turn. The founder of the studio said the issue was in GalCiv1 and the code was so old they didn't want to touch for fear of breaking more things.			"

												I am a CIV 5 player, and have been looking for a game that could give me the hours of gameplay that I have enjoyed with that game.  After exploring several other 4x turn based strategy games that fell far short, I tried this one.   I am nearly through my first game and I can tell, this is the real deal.  I like to develop  my techs to give me an edge and the tech tree in this game gives many more options. Ship building adds a dimension not found in CIV 5.  It is different enough from CIV 4 & 5, that I don't feel like I am playing the same thing reskinned.  I thought about Beyond Earth, but the reviews make it sound like a DLC FOR civ 5.  I got this game key for $2.50 on Ebay,  much better than $50 for a remake of a civ game.  I'm thinking GCIII may be next on my list, but I will have fun with this for awhile first.  This game would be worth the steam price, I just got lucky.			"

												This is the best buy I've made all year long. There's so much customization that every game you start feels new and fresh. I'm always finding something I could do better or another strategy that could be more fun to play around with that the replayability of this game just feels endless. It's addicting. You find yourself spending quite a bit of time just messing with how your ship looks before you even start popping on the components. I've made a Star Trek NCC-1701 d clone for my flagship because I could. I've also made x-wings and tie fighters just goofing around. The fact that ship building is so easy to do makes it a major point in my gameplay. The turn-based gameplay gives you a chance when you are starting off to really take your time to understand the basic mechanics of the game and start putting some forethought into every move you make. I've played a bunch of other space sims/strategy games, Sid Mier's Civs, the older X games, AOE, etc. I love sims, space games, strategy, and turn-based combat. Galactic Civs II has thrown just about everything I love into one game. This game has been my all time favorite so far. If you get it on sale, fine. If you get it on Humble Bundle, fine. Just get this game if you like Strategy games. You won't regret it.Also, if the new Galactic Civs III is anything like this one, it will be my next purchase.			"

The visuals are great, their are a lot of races that actually are different from each other ( not just a different look ).  No multiplayer but the AI plays well and mostly provides a good challenge - and without cheating!.It's a long game if you choose a large galaxy but the play will suck you in - some really interesting minor races as well such as the demented evil squirrels that want to conquer the galaxy - as soon as they are through collecting nuts.  Some really good humour such as that throughout.    This game plays well with 32 bit computers unlike the upcoming sequel as well.  I own several versions of this game and have played 100's of hours all together.  As a bonus it is almost completely bug free by the way.			"

Learnt that I need a MetaVerse profile to submit highscores, so I also created a MetaVerse profile. Just to ensure the game works, started a single player game and, Voila! it works. Entered MetaVerse after creating a profile, and it works too. So don't let negative reviews about DRM discourage you from getting this, it still works. :)P.S.

												Boring, shallow gameplay for a 4x game. The only thing it brings to the table is its ship customization, which is largely cosmetic. Pity it's ugly anyway. This is not a classic.Oh, and check out the kind of stuff the CEO says about minorities. He's one short step away from joining the KKK. I'd pass on this garbage.			"

												Games are long, and without much action, especially if you use a relatively peaceful strategy-- and peaceful strategies, executed properly, are so massively overpowered that you'd be a fool not to use them. It's not like such strategies even require much finesse; diplomacy will get the job done on any difficulty level, so long as you specialize in it and spend vast amounts of real life time doing it. War isn't that much more interesting than peace, either, due to the lack of tactical combat or sophisticated ship design. The ship design system incorporates a lot of meaningless cosmetic elements to try and disguise its fundamental shallowness. Ignore all of the aesthetic stuff and underneath you'll find a very basic system without any art to building a good ship. Just put on the defenses and weapons that counter what your enemy has and that's it. Due to the lack of tactical combat, ships will all fight the same way no matter what kind of weapons they're armed with. Economic management is tedious and ultimately irrelevant in face of the fact that, if you're using a peaceful strategy, you can ultimately build whatever you want and then get the AI to pay for it using the diplomacy system. I'd say skip this one and find yourself a more interesting 4x.			"

												My first real game experience:Only colonized a couple worlds not knowing what to do..Laughed at and threatened by other factions..After hours of just trying to survive finally be stable and start growing.Needed more planets, built up military.Soon my military was stronger than some others, and I annihilated my neighbor.Was finally stable, had enough planets, and military.Jack Knife or some pirate people came in and stole my economic planets..Got mad and went into debt..Killed many of my people trying to take my planets back fighting my own people?Finally got my planets back and had bigger ships, other factions finally respected me except for one who was still stronger than me.My allies and I prepared to take him down, but then..the Dread Lords have returned?!One by one my allies were destroyed, and I can't even see where the dread lords are because of all the fog in space..Then I saw a dreadlord ship which was far superior than any of mine..After that I decided I was playing too much and quit.To sum it all up this is like a hardcore version of Civilization in space with random events and unexpected twists and turns.

												I can't help but compare this game to Master of Orion, one of my favorite games of all times. In terms of content, this game is obviously vastly superior. More tech to research, more buildings to build, a bigger universe, complex fleet building. Nonetheless, its universe felt somewhat emptier and kind of boring. I bought this game years ago and quit playing after a while when I got to a point where every turn becomes somewhat monotonous. That and the excrutiatingly long loading time didn't sit well with me. Now, a couple of years later, I saw the game on sale on Steam and decide to give it another try. My second try has been better so far. Hopefully, my interest doesn't wane the more hours I put into it. for now, I would still recommend this game to my peers.6.5/10			"

												Have played for double the number of hours posted as I have it on old disk.  Bought the Steam version as they help keep the drivers up to date - Windows getting so far ahead of old software that it obsoletes many older versions disks.  That right there is a tremendous endorsement of Steam in that they have recovered many older games that way. Back to GalCiv II.... the game play is about the same as original, but looks more elegant, has smoother UI.  I am afraid to buy GalCiv 3 as many reviews appear to cite that they really only updated the graphics, and the DLC costs make the game a bit pricy when not on sale.  So I will wait.  To change things up in the gameplay for GalCiv IV ... if they ever have one ... I might suggest looking at some old gems like Stars! or Emperor of the Fading Suns.  Stars! had brutal AI and math systems to do statistical analysis on race design and ship battles/designs on large scales.  The EOTFS had not only ship battles but also strategic ground battles that you could manage unit by unit. It was fun when you had armies of 3-5 players on one strategic planet, with space supremacy battles and subsequent bombardment by different victorious fleets every turn. Those were turn based battles ... but I suppose they could do the Star Wars Empires route and go RTS. Either way,  I think scaling the game so you can either macro-manage and watch quick battle outcome, or choose which specific battles you'd like to fight tactically woud be a neat change.  For those looking for a shorter term change of pace at low cost I recommend Civ IV with the Star Trek mod.  Anyway, after all the meandering, GalCiv is still the best 4x game available and if you can get it on sale you won't be sorry you spent the money.  It is super easy to learn, and very hard to beat on higher settings.  And lots of players still out there to challenge.			"

												This game has become one of my all time favorites. I was a fan of the strategy genre, but take strategy, customization, some rpg like elements, and you have a great game! Personally people have been complaining about the 3rd-party thing, but personally I haven't had any problems. After I registered, I'm able to play, no problems. Things that are fantastic-This isn't just a game where you build a civilization to completley wipe out all the others, there are mutliple ways to win, even just being ally with everyone. Wanna be that Civ that kills everyone, you can! Wanna be the nice one that helps and brings everyone together, you can! Wanna be that 'Corruptor' Civ that causes others to fight wars and supplies ships to cause chaos, why not? This game also includes random events which are outstanding. At one point I had a new minor race appear out of nowhere, then I had 1 of every planet from each Civ revolt and created a new faction called the ""Jagged Knife"". One of my personal favorites is the ability to design my ships to my liking. You have full customization and desgins are saved so if you finished a game, those desgins will appear in your next game as long as you have the right research upgrades that were fitted to your ship. It's truly amazing what can happen sometimes in this game.The bad things-Every now and then I noticed the game camera would bug out and move in one direction by itself. I had to fix it by saving, going to the main menu, and reloading that save. It got annoying at alot of times. At certain points of the game, there were these ""Galactic Council"" meetings. Although the idea was cool, I often see the same choices over and over again and it just isn't as exciting. I also found some of the same random events to appear often aswell, though really awesome ones I've never seen still appear. I personally like to stay out of wars and just supply the factions I like with ships and money, though I have noticed that the AI tend to 'lose' ships. I would send them a ship or 2 even if they aren't in war, and then sometime later they just vanish. Either the AI traded them or destroyed them somehow and it kinda annoys me.Overall I think this is a great game worth checking out if your fan of strategy games!			"

												I'm a huge fan of empire building and 4X genre (such as Galactic Civilizations II, Endless Space, etc) and despite owning several titles, I've never really got around to playing any of them... until now.With that in mind I have no real base of comparison with other games in the 4X genre, which in case you were wondering stands for 'explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate'. However, I enjoyed this one.For whatever reason the game was kind on me. All settings were on random and it generated a fairly good sized galaxy, with 3 Civilizations on it, so there wasn't a mad war from the off. Getting to grips with the game, and realising that while on the surface it looks simple as you start to look and prod there is much more to the game. I somehow managed to corner the market on diplomatic translators, which meant no other Civilization could make them - so only I could make and trade them! Nice! Then I discovered the Ship Creator tool in the Shipyard, which allows you to design your own ships. Oh man. The trading and diplomacy looked fairly straight forward, then I was invited to the UP for a Galactic Council vote, which I thought was a nice addition.I think what gives this game a mark of 'good' for me is that I had played for 2 hours and not realised it. Going in a thought it would be a 'time sink' game, and it is, yet it's fun to play. IF I do manage to 'win' at this game, I'll keep it installed and play it again. I have a feeling there's a decent mod community out there, and can imagine that there are plenty of community designed races and ships to use. If you enjoy empire building games, don't mind time sink games, and think you can lead your own alien race to glory... this game is for you.			"

												Do I like this game? possibly.  Why? It was hard to pickup as it appeared to be complex and difficult but once probed for an hour or so it became fun and slightly easier to understand. However there was one thing that was holding it back in my eyes; the waiting time for something to be built. It was frustrating to repedetly click the next turn button just waiting for a settlement ship. Apart from this it is a fun game if you have a lot of time. I would not buy it full price but wait for a sale. "

												This game is great. If you have DRM issues, then I am sorry to hear that. I haven't had any issues with DRM. Transferring to a new laptop or using a temporary desktop for a while, the DRM has not once ever given me trouble. The game itself is fantastic. Plenty of ways to win, you can build alliances with other factions. There are large factions and smaller sub factions.I will however admit there is definitely a learning curve, and it does't help that there is LOTS of micromanagement required. And when your empire starts expanding, the turns will take longer and longer and longer as you check every ship and planet and ensure that they are doing as needed. And making sure you are building properly and so on so forth.The only issue I have had was on my old computer, the game would like to crash every so often. But not on the laptop. I have no problems with this game, you can quickly get lost in it.			"

												GalCiv 2 is a love hate relationship for me. GalCiv 2 is like an old lover. Who visits,  stays a couple of hours then disappears again for the next year or two. Which is fine, she's a bomb but gets on my nerves quick.I can spend hours designing my ships, forming my fleets. Only to have my neat formations confronted by a never ending, undisciplined stream of enemy ships. Like a laser beam they target one spot on the map, and keep on coming to that one spot. For hours realtime. No flanking, no sneak attacks elsewhere, nothing. Just that endless stream of bots. If you try it out, make sure to have random events deactivated. Those release what some nutty gamedesigner considers to be fun: overpowered super race waltzing all over the place.MoO had it as well, precursor motherlovers that suddenly appear and mess it all up with ease. Must be a religious defect in the producer's noggin.Do I recommend it? Would I recommend drinking alcohol? That would be a no, I myself drink too much. Hm. I recommend the old bomb bum.

												Read lots of positive reviews about this one, and given the high metascore, I thought I'd give it a try. However the game lost all appeal once I realized that the tech progress is completely linear. You are presented with a huge tech tree, lots of different buildings and other improvements, but they're all completely boring. It's just like, +1 armor, +2 armor, +3 armor. 1+ economy, +2 economy, and so forth. NO nonlinearities, NO interesting synergies to be seen whatsoever, but these are what makes 4X games complex and interesting! The game mechanics really lack imagination, which is a problem I see with lots of Stardock titles. With Legendary Heroes, the lack of complex R&D mechanics is mitigated by the roleplaying system which manages to keep the game interesting. In Sins of a Solar Empire, the linear mechanics are fine because it's an action- and speed-oriented RTS title. But GalCiv, that's just as dull as it gets.			"

												An all around great game.The AI actually understands its own game well enough to play without breaking its rules. It's certainly not a genius, but if you turn the AI's ability all the way up, it will make deals that don't involve the player quite often and build armies designed to counter whatever they're fighting is using. They also use spies properly and generally play the game.It's easy to customize. Got a 256x256 and a 430x280 png of something. Drop it in the right file and attach it to a custom civ. Want to make your custom civ have the same bonus stats as an initial civ or increase everyone's stats, open an XML editor and the notation will practically tell you how. Then there's the ship editor atop that, which is easy to work and works even out to the map. Want to build a giant robot or a mecha space scorpion, you can do it, and watch it advance on enemies.It has some of the best macroing of 4x games. You can easily create a few templates, then drop the templates on worlds as you get them, and the game will auto-assign improvements to the tiles that would give them bonuses. Then you can assign ship building and rally points with a few more clicks without ever touching any of your planets. Or you can do it all by hand.			"

												Easily one of the best Strategy Games I've ever played, particularly if we isolate that to 4x Turn Based Games.  I first bought GalCivs II when it was new and after a bit of a learning curve (Having never played a Turn Based Strategy Game at that time) I figured out just how amazing the game actually was.  The ability to customize your faction in almost every aspect, plus continue to develop it down the path you see fit, provides an excellent replayablity and immersion.  The ship designer even allows you to recreate designs from some of your favorite Sci-Fi tales, or develop your own line to help crush the galaxy.  The ability to watch fleet battles was a huge plus, and the game's soundtrack is exceptionally easy to modify if one wants to mix it up after hours of playing.  Once I saw a chance to pick up the Ultimate Edition for 75% off, I bought it in a heartbeat and put in another full game or two.  I've had a number of games in the past taking months to complete on the largest map settings, so the increase in maximum size and depth of the factions only made things better.  The option to customize your enemies ships and faction name sets the stage to truly create your own sci-fi epic, for those you find themselves essentially role-playing such immersive games.In short, I can't reccomend this game enough, as it is a brilliant buy and at an affordable cost.  Even better, one doesn't necessarily need a high-end computer to run the game, despite its high entertainment value!			"

												This is an excellent 4X game.The scripted games are challenging, whilst the random galaxy generater is worth the cost of admission alone.Add the Metaverse (a free service), a place where you can compare scores and even join or create your own empire to rule the galaxy - you cant go wrong with this game.A fun game, which can be as challenging as you want it to be.

												This is one of my all-time favorite strategy games. I simply love it. Galactic Civilizations II is a fantastic turn-based strategy game with a massive mod database and a really cool shipbuilding aspect. I bought the retail version. Then the disc broke, and I bought it again later from Stardock's Impulse service. And then again on Steam simply because I felt the devs deserved it (and Impulse was sold off). That 92 rating is no lie. Highly recommended.			"

												An all around great game.The AI actually understands its own game well enough to play without breaking its rules. It's certainly not a genius, but if you turn the AI's ability all the way up, it will make deals that don't involve the player quite often and build armies designed to counter whatever they're fighting is using. They also use spies properly and generally play the game.It's easy to customize. Got a 256x256 and a 430x280 png of something. Drop it in the right file and attach it to a custom civ. Want to make your custom civ have the same bonus stats as an initial civ or increase everyone's stats, open an XML editor and the notation will practically tell you how. Then there's the ship editor atop that, which is easy to work and works even out to the map. Want to build a giant robot or a mecha space scorpion, you can do it, and watch it advance on enemies.It has some of the best macroing of 4x games. You can easily create a few templates, then drop the templates on worlds as you get them, and the game will auto-assign improvements to the tiles that would give them bonuses. Then you can assign ship building and rally points with a few more clicks without ever touching any of your planets. Or you can do it all by hand.			"

												I don't understand all the good reviews on this game.  I feel like I was ripped off.  I played the game one time all the way through and felt no need to want to play again.  The game felt like it was put together fast and not with a whole lot of thought.  The ground fighting is a joke.  I don't even think it can be called ground fighting.The concept of the game itself seemed to be a good idea, but the implmentation was horrible.  The graphics were definately bad.  Not that I judge a game by it's graphics alone, but if the graphics aren't going to be good, then you need to ensure that the core of the game itself is excellent to balance it out.I also think the people who compare this to any CIV game have got to be crazy.  Civilizations is a quality game that I can play countless times over and over again and still not get bored.  Galactic Civilizations is a poorly made game.			"

												The way economics work it very counteract intuitive. The game encourages you to specialize a planet in what it would be best at but the way it actually works means that could cripple your other colonies. Also it's better to build all factories everywhere on every planet or all labs and then have science produced from factories or manufacturing from labs. Takes the fun out of building up colonies when they work this way.Also I discovered a way to make the AI focus all weapon fire on one non threatening but indestructible ship while leaving my high damage but defenseless alone. To not use this exploit I'd have to not use a class of equipment which takes the fun out of designing ships if I have to do it in a way that gives the AI a chance.I played a lot and had fun, but learning how the game actually works made it all pointless.

												I really like this game, but it has serious buggy issues that seem to get worse the more time you play. You become mysteriously aligned, at war or at peace with races without choosing to do so.  It crashes at random, and particularly at start up. This becomes more frequent as number of times played goes on. Despite the forums on the internet complaining about this for years, it has never been properly addressed. It's a well designed game that is ultimately made unplayable by crappy debugging.			"

												My steam record is only a handful of hours but I've had the CD edition since release and played easily a thousand hours of this game. It is hands down the best strategy game ever made for any medium ever ever ever.The insane detail you can go into, and yet it never feels like micromanaging. you can tell it to basically run things for you, or tell every little peon exactly what to do. there are so many ways to play and to win, you don't have to be a military invader at all, ever if you don't want to. and hell if you do? go ahead and make that fleet of deathstars and blow everything to hell. do whatever you want, however you want, and conquer the galaxy your way. beautiful fantastic game I can't praise highly enough.

												Wonderfully complex and highly customizable. I consider this a must have for fans of the Civ V series because it manages to go beyond planetary conquest and into the cosmos. In addition, technological advancements unlock this game's customization features which allows for the creation of specialized units ,designed by the player, and tailored to the situation at hand. I highly recommend this strategy game.			"

Also not to be written it off as 'Civilization in space'. While the two games do have alot of similarities in how they work there is more than enough stuff that's unique to each game to make it worthwhile to have both in your collection.I promise.			"

												GalCiv II is, in my opinion, the current King of 4X space games, particularly turn-based ones.  The bits of humour that show up in the diplomatic and scientific text are nice changes of pace from constantly wondering what will befall you when you hit the 'Turn' button.  I've tried RTS 4X games, and they simply don't allow me time to micromanage my empire as much as I want.So, if you want to conquer known space (and unknown space) this is your best bet, at least until GalCiv III comes out.

												I lost months to this game. It's a 4x galaxy conquest extravaganza. You pick a race, each with their own traits, you can modify traits to your liking, or keep them as they are. Then you set out on your homeworld and slowly expand to other planets. One good yet bad is that the tech tree. It's pretty big and hard to comprehend your first playthrough. Also, researching weapons and ship tech makes it available to you for use, but doesn't necessarily unlock new ships. That means YOU need to go into your ships designs and refit as you see the need. However, ship customization is one of the big pluses for this game. You not only pick what tech to use, you also can design your ship from the hull up. You can make it look however you want. This game is a definate classic. I highly recommend to anyone who likes 4x conquest.			"

												Galactic Civilizations II (or GalCiv, as it's affectionately called) is the overall best space 4X available.  There are others which do individual pieces better, but none which match the whole polished package provided by Stardock.  One thing Stardock does particularly well - at least as well as Firaxis with CIV and CiV - is their expansions - and you should play GalCiv with all of them enabled for the full experience.  (All the expansions are available in the Ultimate Edition.)Make sure to spend some time in the ship designer - the stock designs are very pretty, but nothing compares to fielding a fleet of dreadnoughts that you designed literally from the keel up, using an intuitive system of stock pieces with various connection points, a sort of intersteller LEGO.  You can also download ship sets made by others and import them into your game; designs based on popular SciFi universes abound.			"

Offers both a sandbox mode and three story base campaigns for you to choose from. Each race in the game has it’s own buildings, tech tree, abilities and ship designs with the last two being customisable by the player giving you endless re-playability. If you consider yourself a fan of the 4X genre of video games this title is a must have or if you’re new to the genre and prefer a sci-fi setting to a historical one then this is the game for you as well.

												Seems like your typical 4X game.  Fly around, meet new people, and take their stuff.  There's much more to it than that, though.  The AI is exceptional.  At higher difficulty levels it's smart, adaptive, and even cunning in a way a lot of human players aren't.  It also doesn't discriminate between player and AI since computer players are as likely to screw each other over as they are to go after you.  AI races play to their strengths and try to avoid exposing their weaknesses. - Militaristic races will hit you with powerful ships, economic races bribe others into attacking you, and diplomats form coalitions to take you down.  The game is also very customizable - It comes with its own editing utilities (though you do have to look for them) and designing your own races and ships using the ingame designer is easy but powerful.  My only complaint is that it lacks any real multiplayer capability - If it had that, it would be close to the perfect game.			"

												While the game is rather dated, it's still a really good turn-based strategy game. Very similar to Sid Meier's Civ, except without a pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, a more open tech tree, and the ability to design custom units It's basically like old civilization with less micromanagement and more strategies. I'm really surprised I waited so long to play this because I'd put this game right up there with Civilization 2; it's definitely better than 3, 4, and 5.			"

												Not since Imperium Galactica 2 have I encounted a Space 4X has pulling power of Civ and the feeling stepping into the unknown. You can set the size of univese to a huge scale for marathon games of exploration and conquest (a size that makes you feel properly insignifficant)  or set it for tiny for quick few hour quickie , either way with amount of other options availble  race creators, tons of techs various ways to win (or lose)  all ends up in  game that you start playing at say 6Pm and stop at 6AM			"

												This game series is most often compared to the Sid Meiers Civilization series, and this game in particular compared to Civ 5. But the difference being that this is in space. So it's a turn based strategy game in space.But I want to be a bit more specific.When starting up the game it sort of looks like Civ, but feels a bit empty after just a few turns. It feels as though there isn't as many options as in the Civ games. But after maybe an hour into a game it suddenly changes by having heaps of stuff to do. The techs are interesting and making improvements are quite enjoyable. And you have a ship designer which lets you design a ships looks and functionality, cool stuff.It might not be as sophisticated as the Civ games, but if you like the Civ games and are bored with them, then you will enjoy this. I would be as bold as to suggest you'd like them even if you aren't bored with the Civ games. "

												I know a lot of people love GalCiv, and it has its appeals. The lack of any kind of combat game-play, the rock-paper-scissors ship combat mechanic, and rather limited diplomacy to make up for it really kill the fun for me though.Despite that, worth playing, and worth buying if you're into the genre. Just don't expect MOO2-esque polish. (OK, so the diplomacy in that was a bit like a ferret on crack, but this game has diplomacy like a tranqulized walrus instead.)			"

												Galactic Civ 2 is your typical 4x game. It's got your research, culture, combat and such. But what sets it apart is the witty writing that makes your oppoents feel real, and the endless customization that you can do to your space ships.Stardock also went above and beyond by making the AI downright manipulative and intelligent, working behind your back to achieve its own goals, with you none the wiser. A real challenging game, but a very fun one that will eat your time just to play it even more.			"

For example, the Torians will always be 2-3 techs ahead of everyone else in production.-Ai doesn't use defenses. You'll see an early ship with, like, three laser damage and no shields, armor, or missile defense. And it'll be the only thing they produce. I've played games on the harder difficulties where I'm behind 5-6 techs on weapons and I just stick robust hull on a cargo hull, add some shields, and wipe out hundreds of ships with three ""platforms""-Ai doesn't use larger ship hulls that i've seen. They research the tech and spam the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fighters i mentioned above. It comes to the point where you can build one ship that could easily wipe out every other ship in the galaxy in the galaxy.-economy and military score counters are broken. You can have a fleet of above godships, and everyone will still declare war on you and demand tribute every turn because the military score only counts how many damage points your ships have. Economy score is ♥♥♥♥tarded; you can be making 5k profit a turn and the Terran alliance be 5,000,000,000,000 in debt, their research and production flatlined, and their economy score will dwarf yours-With regular planets, you have no chance of building a decent ship this year, even with all factories, quantum fusion reactor (+25/30% production), and manufacturing capital (+100% production) it will still take you 2-3 weeks to build the smallest fighter-With super planets (20-30 quality planets) you can pump out a godship every turn-AI rushes colonization, and even on Immense-size galaxy maps, all planets are colonized within 20-30 turns all planets are taken. A big ♥♥♥♥ you to anyone who wants to play it slow.-games are ridiculously long. Because of above rapid expansion Ai, you will find yourself 100 turns in, not wanting to finish the game because the other races pose no challenge to your navy, but there's so many planets that conquering everyone else would be tedious. -Arcean is the only tech tree worth using-The Yor-mods are trash, which is a shame because its really easy to mod and use mods on the game-only 2-3 basic ship styles-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OP events literally turning random races into gods, and they still can't be bothered to put so much as a deflector on their ships, and are thus just as weak as everyone elsetl;dr:♥♥♥♥♥♥Ai to match the♥♥♥♥♥♥computers it can run on, worth your money on sale, you'll get your money's worth.

												Read a lot of good reviews, thought to myself, ""Guess I'll try it out,"" bought it, spent 40 mins just registering on a dozen different sites just to play it, then realized, ""wow, this game is not great at all.  Breakdown:  Micro-manage, micro-manage, micro-manage.                       How do I get resources or money?  No explination or tutorials about asteroids, etc.  Spend 30 mins to an hour online asking relavent questions.  Finally get answers.                       Ok back to game.  Difficulty: Normal, Oponents: Normal to sub-intelligent.  3 hours later...                                                      Results:  Out played on everything from research to weapons, I lose.                       Shake it off, restart, Difficulty: Beginner, Oponents: Dumb.  3 hrs later...                                                      Results:  Out played on everything from research to weapons, I lose.  Conclusion:  What a stupid game.			"

												There is a cool mod for this that makes it Star Wars vs. Star Trek. I like to cancel out all the Star Wars civs and make it a fun Star Trek: TNG themed turned-based space exploration game. A few years ago online play was still an option, but i'd still get this old gem on sale.			"

												I love these tech-race space management/colonization games so much! I even love the board game in vain of a civilizations space version called Imperium Twilight; but this game has no MULTIPLAYER. If you don't mind playing a very mediocre campaign on single player, then by all means pick this game up! (I've seen it on sale quite a few times for 75% off)+Graphics are sweet for an indie game, but below average.+Controls are easy to maneuver and great. Remapping is available.+It doesn't really get boring.+Tons of tech! Masters of Orion style :)+Random events!+Big star maps-AI could be better (turn up the difficulty if it gets too easy)-No multiplayer-no multiplayer...-no...multi...pla--*sob*G:CIV III is coming out soon. So, I would wait for that or get this on sale if you really wanna live the experience sooner :)Sins of a Solar Empire is a huge favorite of mine as well since it is not turn based and the management is easier than I thought in real-time (thought multiple battles at once will overwhelm you, but the AI is good enough to ignore a few).

												Too dated compared to current offerings, including its successor, GC3. I recommend skipping this even on sale and going with one of the newer 4X games such as Stellaris. I'll ""recommend"" it but only in the sense that it ran fine and was enjoyable in its prime, but I got quickly bored with it during a recent replay and decided to uninstall it.			"

												Never really having played any of the Civilization games I took a punt with Galactic Civilizations 2 and got it when it was on sale. I knew it was turn based and an older game so I reserved any expectations.Turns out it's a really enjoyable and addictive game that runs great on my non-gaming work laptop. Sure there is a fair learning curve and you need to invest some time on YouTube to get your head around the games ebb and flow but there is a lot of depth to the game - the tech tree is enormous.It's not for everyone, you need to be willing to read;  it's turn based, so it's more a thinking game than frentic action; and this means games take a long time (usually over multiple sessions) so it's not for the very time poor.Stardock have announced Galactic Civilizations III, due for release some time in 2014 so I'm looking forward to checking that out while I play GC2.

												I had high hopes for this game based on other's reviews and my own love for 4X genre in general. However, I was dissapointed with Gal Civ II. My biggest gripe rests with the mildly cumbersome interface and the lack of 'terrain' or other interesting features in the game map. Without these features there are no strategic bottlenecks or natural borders to exploit. Also, in the course of a game of Civilization II, the players will dramatically alter the appearance of the board and thus see the effects of their progressing nation. No such changes are apparent in Gal Civ II and it feels very much like there is no real visible progress to match the hours consumed. As a result I spent many turns staring at the map in boredom.

Posted: October 3, 2014
												So, my review is that this game is not recommended. I'll say now, that some people may enjoy it, but personally I didn't. It's a time-sink, but not a particularly fun one. I'll begin with the pros.Pros:Good tech tree. It's interesting, useful, and well-made. It goes quickly, while still lasting quite a while.Customization. You can build ships, create custom races, all of that. I spent most of my time simply re-inacting my books, and seeing how different races of mine would react to those of other universes.Battle screen. If you have two fleets that are in battle, you get a more detailed video of the battle. Though not particularly useful itself, it is enjoyable to watch.Now, for the cons. These are the reasons why I wouldn't recommend this to most people.Cons:Slow start. The beginning feels boring and long-running. Every game begins the same: You have your system, you colonize the one other habitable planet, then you move to the next. And even once you meet another race, you don't have diplomatic incidents to worry about. The worst you could do is sell something important to them by accident. Until you go to war, it's a very tedious and repetetive task.Tactics are useless. Aside from wanting to attack THIS planet instead of THAT one, you don't really need to use tactics. If your ships are strong enough, you just win.Lack of diplomacy. You can't use diplomacy at all. You can pay other races to ally with you, or to declare war on somebody, but that's it.Finally, the game just doesn't fit the role I expected from it. Instead, I got a time sink that I probably won't play for months on end. If you want something that will bring tactics into the game, I'd recommend Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. For those who enjoy a more basic game when it comes to fleet tactics and diplomacy, you may enjoy this. It has it's ups.			"

												All flash, no bang. Eye candy with very abstracted game play mechanics (ie: minimal effort into the parts that matter)It's not Master of Orion II.In fact, this one, and Endless Space, fans and marketing shills have to invoke that title in promotions because it is the only way to make an impulse sale. If a game was made that was really as good as MOO 1 or 2, it would be able to stand on its own name.Save your money, buy something else, nothing to see here.			"

												This game is tedious. It takes too long to have anything going and everything you do doesnt seem to matter much. Building a factory, researching certain tech first, constructing a trade fleet: any of this activities takes forever to have any effect, so you feel like you are doing nothing all of the time.In Sid Meier Civilization, when you build a certain building you feel your civilization improving, here it doesnt matter much. Part of that happens because the interface isnt very good, it is hard to know what is going on with your civilization: how may trade routs do I have? What´s the growth rate of my planets?Also, the technologies for going to war are so expensive that you are only going to see war at ending game. Diplomacy doesnt work very well either and you will usually use it only to exchange techs.This game is inferior to civlization in every aspect, play Sid Meier Civilization if you want a civ simulation. If you already played and enjoyed that and you are bored, you can buy this game.			"

												Disappointing. I looked at the metascore and the reviews, and I was expecting to be wowed.   I'd give it a 6, maybe 7/10.  I'll be honest, it can be easy to waste away hours in this game, but not because the game is particularly 'exciting', but because ... that's just the time the development / research tech trees.   You can strategize on what worlds to colonize and how to build them up (although it's pretty shallow), and what types of strengths you want to give your ships once you've researched far enough into the tech tree, but the core element that let me down was where you actually battled another race/ faction.   There's no input from you, as a player, as to how that battle will go.  If your ship is powerful enough, you can send a single ship to take out several, if not dozens of enemy craft.    No skill, no positioning, no planning of attacks like there might be in ROME or Age of Wonders II.   Heck, I would say that games that are over 10 years old (like RoN or AOE) are better at the battles then this game is. Also, let's talk about diplomacy - the game tries, but the races/ characters are pretty one-dimensional.    I might play this game again every now and then, but I'm disappointed.   Dont buy this game unless it's on a sale of 75% off regular price or something.			"

												I would love to recommend this game because it is a lot of fun but I just can't since it is impossible for me to play properly. In fact I have never managed to finish a single long game because of frustration. There is a massive bug that really ruins all fun and frustrates me to no end. For no reason the cursor will start panning towards a random direction, will not stop and there is nothing you can do about it. You are forced to watch helplessly as the game goes to the edge of the map and remains stuck there. This bug occurs randomly, sometimes you can play for 10 mins or so without any problems but nowadays it seems to happen every 3 turns or so. I have tried everything to get rid of it with no luck. Sometimes it goes away on its own or after pushing a button or going to a different screen but there is no reliable way to remove the issue. Sometimes nothing will work and you will be forced to quit. Since I started plaything this game again a couple of days ago, I have been forced to shut down the game and restart to make it go away about half a dozen times. This problem was there when I first bought the game many years ago but it just seems to have gotten worse. Help from the GalCIv2 official forums seem to mostly point the blame to specific graphic cards but during those years I have switched pcs, gotten laptops or different brands and hardware configurations and still nothing.  Otherwise the game is pretty good with the only missing element being multiplayer but I can't recommend it as long as that game breaking issue exists. If you've had this problem too then you'd probably understand.			"

												2 Stars. This game may have been really good once but it has been superseded. The tutorial, graphics, gameplay and AI have all dated poorly. Like Sins of a Solar Empire there seem like there were many layers underneath the surface that maybe I'm not appreciating.  But part of a good game should be to simply and enjoyably introduce you to the finer points and this was lacking for me. Overall if you're thinking of playing a turn based space strategy then play Endless Space instead.			"

												Played the first game a lot. hundreds of hours maybe so getting this game was a no brainer. But is it good?  After some deliberation i must conclude that a thumbs down it is - but only narrowly. My main gripe with the game is that it's pace is slower and the complexity that one would have wished to be included in the first game such as ship design doesn't really add much to the sequel. Features just don't add up to any meaningfull addition to the gameplay. What nails the coffin shut is the brutal competition coming from other titles. This game just isn't smooth or modern enough to compete with the new comers but isn't quite as fast paced as the first game. So what is it then? i couldn't quite figure out what would be the best way to play this game - do campaigns or free customizable games. So better just shelve it.			"

												I keep trying to love GalCiv (I dabbled a little with the first game too).  On paper it's got all the elements of a game I love: 4x check, sci-fi check, it's even turn-based.  Master of Orion II is my favorite game of all time, and I started playing GalCiv I when someone told me that it was what MoO III should have been.  I disagree.  The game is sprawling with completely inadequate tools to help you keep track of what's going on.  I spend half of the time playing searching for that one planet I caught a glimpse of once, and don't get me started on resources and blackholes.  I'm supposed to coordinate multiple colonies building constructors (10-20 turns) and sending them to a resource (20-30 turns) and I can't even find the resource when I want to.  A searchable, sortable database of planets (like the one they had in MoO II!) and resources would go a long way toward making this game playable.  Or since building starbase modules is all constructors do, why don't they just ask which resource I want to go to when I build them?  You remember how in MoO II when you sent a scout to solar system, it automatically found all the planets in that system?  Not here, my friend.  Even with advanced sensors, it takes weeks to explore a system.  And the auto-explore feature on the scouts does not even try to find all the planets.  A lot of the game seems quirky and gimmicky.  You might think that trade routes would be worth a certain steady amount based on the relative wealth, technology, and resources of the trading partner empires rewarding diversity such that if you're very different than your trading partner you make more, right?  No, they pay off based on the distance between the two worlds- like the rest of your civilization isn't even involved in trade.  So you make most off trade routes if you build all your freighters on just one planet, the one furthest from trading partner regardless of what you do on that planet.  Then the value of the route runs through a cycle.  At first it's of little value and it gradually increases to a maximum then it gradually decreases again and repeats.  What the hell is that?  If they cost a bunch then you had to wait then paid off all in a big lump sum, it would seem like they were going for realism with an age of discovery feel.  But what's this cycle thing?  Steady value seems more realistic for trade between advanced civilizations.From the name alone, the game begs to be compared with Civilization.  But if you're going to compare this game to Civilization, it desperately needs a much better GalCivilopedia because virtually every aspect of the game requires more elaboration than what's present.  Between inadequacies, redundancies, and murkiness, it seems like the designers just can't organize your thoughts.  And the result is frustrating game that rapidly becomes boring.  I understand why people want to say they like it, but I don't understand why they do.			"

												This game is tediously boring.Par for the course of these kinds of games is that you begin with a very small area and number of units, etc. and must find your way to expansion.  This is always relatively boring at first, but goes quickly since there is little to do and you can click through turns quickly.The make or break point for this category of game is how tedious it becomes once significant expansion occurs.  Do you have to click on everything in the map to see if anything needs your attention every turn or does the game notify you whenever something important happens?  In this area, the game is mediocre.  There are notifications when significant events happen, but I still feel the need to check up on every planet periodically to know how things are going.A huge factor for every game's enjoyability is what aspects come into focus.  Every game has good and bad parts.  The question is, do the good parts shine and the bad parts fade into the background or do the bad parts constantly nag you until you can't enjoy the good parts anymore?  Here the game is mediocre to bad.  What you consider good or bad will depend on your gaming preferences and I don't care to take the time to elaborate, but suffice to say I was not impressed with the balance (despite some quite good features).Another big factor is the interface which is mediocre to bad depending on your adaptability and preferences.  It is never good when you spend as much time finding and clicking buttons as you do making real game changing decisions.A significant factor that made me set this game aside was that the explanations of core game concepts was weak.  I read the manual before I played and also went through the tutorials.  Yet, as I played, I didn't really feel like I knew what was going on in many important aspects.  Some people enjoy figuring out the mystery as they go along.  I do for subtle aspects and tricks.  I most certainly don't for the basic core concepts (especially when having taken the time to read the manual...).There are also a handful of other minor points against enjoying this game but I won't bother to elaborate since this is already a long enough review.  The important point is that with the huge number of games available for cheap today, this one just isn't worth the (extensive, tedious) time to play.As I side note, I do not understand at all the number of positive reviews (almost all of which are little more than ""YEAH!! AWESOME!! COOL!!! BEST GAME EVAH!!!!!"").  I suppose it takes a certain kind of player to enjoy this title.  Make sure you are one of them before you buy it.			"

												Sorry GalCiv fans, but this game is super boring.  I love Sid Maier's Civ series, and I've tried a couple of times to get into GalCiv, but it's just too dated, slow, and uninspiring.  This is one of those titles where people who like it, like it a lot, and they'll gush about it and give it positive reviews, while the rest of us just shrug our shoulders, go ""meh"", and really don't see what the big deal is.The graphics are not only dated, but that's to be expected, I can look past that, I mean I still play a lot of older games. But they're just too simplistic as well, even back in the day this would look crappy.  The music and SFX are actually really horrible tho, so bad that it actually stands out lol.There's a lot of content to the game, by that I mean in game mechanics, the tutorial is VERY large - maybe too large, but there's ZERO in game help, no tips suggesting what to do next or what steps you need to take to accomplish your mission. So you can waste a lot of time building and researching one strategy only to find out you need to take a completely different path /wasteoftime.If you like this game, good for you, but for new players - there's better options out there, this game is just really, really boring.  Pretty bad when even the Civ series seems more exciting than this space aged 4x game.			"

												I usually like 4x games, and I have no doubt that this is a good game. The problem for me is that it doesn't really ease you into anything. I weren't caught by it at all, and was just looking at ship models larger than planets, and a complete mess of things to do. Likely I shouldn't have started with a skirmish and found some form of tutorial, but I've been fine doing that with other 4x's and yea. This just didn't catch me at all.. I'll likely give it another try in the future, and then this will be updated. For now, I can't recommend it, as I didn't personally like it. However keep in mind that if you don't mind an overwhelming complexity from the start, due to the various and varied game play, allowing you a lot of freedom as to what you want to do, then this might just be the game for you.

												Stardock is a big, dirty, evil, money theiving company (like all companies) which decided to put DRM into Gal Civ II and stop me from playing the actual game.5 minutes earlier:DO YOU HAVE A SERIAL NUMBER! *goes to link* inserts e-mail which I used for Steam to buy it, claims I don't own the game...If you are planning on buying this game , DON'T. Stardock do not deserve money for this game because I said so, BUT if you want an actual review see below (once I went into the files and launched a lesser version from there)!Graphics wise the game is definitely outdated as it was released a while back (I think) so yeah.Performance wise I have had no problems running the game and between turns it loads relatively quickly so thats good.Apparentely this game has a campaign but I didn't try or care for it.Gameplay wise Gal Civ II is a masterpiece of turn based games where you build up planets with buildings and wonders much like Sid Meiers Civilization series, and spaceships which can be starbases to gain extra resources and stuff or scouts which you can explore the galaxy for Alien Civilisations and anomalies and stuff or military which is NOT FOR KILLING STARDOCK (unfortunately) and even colonies which you can colonise planets with, I find this to be a fun part of this game as claiming stuff makes me happy.It's a shame Stardock won't let me claim this game those filthy scumbags!

												Although a well crafted game and better than most in the genre, this game just doesn't play well.In one play through I'm already bored, and have little to return for.I'd write a longer review, but there isn't really much else to talk about. It's a space rts that is wildly similar to others with a few bonus features, and that's about it.Get it on sale, but unless you're a die hard RTS fan, this will fade into the background and fall on your played once and never played again lists.

												Really wanted to like this game, great reviews. However I just couldn't get past the horrible graphics and UI. It's an older game (2011) and the UI and graphics were outdated when it initally came out, not to mention in 2014. Try to picture what your games looked like and worked like on a SNES and that's about what this game is. A SNES in a HD graphics world.			"

												Slow and clunky.. Not much to do. Map generation options seem to do not work at all. I prefer Distant Worlds and Endless Space not to mention Master of Orion. A question to developers: Explain to me what is the reason for uninhabitable planets to exist.. There is none. At least let me exploit them in some way. It is like the sea in Civilization.. Useless if I can't make cities or something on it.. Good thing I did not pay anything for this game thanks to bundles.. I will try it another time in the future when I am less enraged with stupid developers who do not know anything about ""FUN"" and a ""functioning program that works"".			"

												This game is far too easy to win, while actually conquering anything is simply too much work to be worthwhile.  Was hopeful that this would be an improvement to GCI which was exactly the same.  Was hopeful that either would be as good as MOO][, neither is.If you are looking for an immense time sink, or the ability to min/max the game to try and find just the exact combination of things that makes it hard enough to be fun, but not so stacked against you as to be not, this is the game for you.  On the plus side, the game looks nice enough to distract you of the fact that very few of the decisions you make really matter.			"

												my favourite part about this book was when a random event took five planets from me and i couldn't get them back though the means i'd availed myself tomy second favourite part was the bewildering amount of stats with no clear in-game explanation or tooltips; i suppose ""+30% Courage"" is good, but why is it good? what is the difference between +16 Industry and +16 Production? why is there one?my third favourite part is the constant sheet of gauzy, miserable fog of war blanketing your view like a cancerous malaise of boredom that constantly begged the question of why i was still playing iti can see the possibility for Possibly Ever Enjoying myself while playing this game, but Civ IV, Civ V, Sins, and possibly any other 4X turn-based strategy game are much better 4X games in my opinion. chances are they'll have clearer design, better conveyance, and be more approachable. in GalCiv, everything is grey and bleary and in the fog of war and terrible, and while i adore turn-based strategy games of practically any species, there is just something less than enjoyable about a view of nothing but greyed-over bland iconography interspersed with increasingly-disinterested jammings of the ""end turn"" button.i'm aware the game has tutorials, but i'm not terribly fond of the idea that playing a tutorial is absolutely mandatory to enjoy a game. i've picked up and played and had fun with other 4X games over the course of my fat obstreperous gaming career while ignoring tutorials, and had yet to find one obtuse enough to impede fun until trying my hand at this game.with that in mind, the game's just not for me. maybe it's for you - no judgement if it is. there are just more and better games that scratch this particular itch, and while Sins is technically a 4Xoid RTS rather than a ""proper"" 4X game, if i want to feel like the Supreme Hivequeen of Space, i'll play that instead.

There is no Auto build me a world, it is just Load up your Own Personal Auto build List.. like a shopping list for the store and hope for the best.The best way to win this game is to do nothing... that is right nothing but play sim city. no one will attack you and you can win culture victory within the hour.This game slaps you around if you try space victory.. fights you every step right down to the tech needed to land on planet. it takes about 200 turns before you can trop a boot on the ground, leaving yourself open to tech builds, econ builds and cultural attacks.so if you want to conquest on a normal map in this game expect to go though hell and expect your OWN culture to overlap and win over battle.The game crashes and is full of bugs ..so save offen and PRAY...After one game of this Dung Heap from Stardock.. I let me kids play it. They enjoyed it about 1 to 2 games each and no one plays it anymorethey all got tired of nerd raging with the bugs and the crashes...  they are outside playing sports and reading booksI highly recommend a failure like stardock to get your kids off of video game crack +2 points for unethical business practices of this company.well done2/10  for that...Oh and startdock slandered my person as well to steam and went on the offence.

												4/10. This is a lifeless, dumbed-down version of Sid Meier's Civilization set in space. Masters of Orion II for a new generation, it is not.I'll admit something here and now: I stopped playing this game the INSTANT I realized there was no manual combat system. They REALLY need to be more upfront and honest about that. NOWHERE in the game description or gameplay videos is it revealed that the combat is AUTOMATED. This absolutely killed this game for me, but honestly, until I realized combat was automated, I was already slogging this bland clone of Sid Meier's Civilization.It's sad and pathetic, REALLY sad and REALLY pathetic, that a game made in the early 90's (Masters of Orion II) is a FAR better iteration of what this game OUGHT to be. AUTOMATED COMBAT EVERYONE. STAY AWAY.TL;DR: A sh itty Civ clone, set in space. A monkey could plod its way through this one, given enough time.			"

												Galactic Civilizatons II Ultimate Edition is a great game when you do the tutorials. The only bad thing is when when you try to install the game. You need to make a stardock account and do the key so it took me 47 minutes to figure that out. The actual game is great. The best part I think is making the ships for your civilization and the economy stuff. Anyother thing is that if you pick a custom race they can be OP in many ways. so I would reccomend this game to people with patience.			"

The maps can be made to hold only 2 galaxies or can be made to be an entire universe and each galaxy holds at least 3 planets so i have a lot of inhabiting to do ;) .all in all so far i think it is an amazing game with great capabilites as ive said ive only just started playing so havent tried the multiplayer yet. the singleplayer campaign is great and the main thing i love so far is that you can create your own space ships i.e frigates (satr wars imperial ships), destroyers, constructors and scouts etc and you can even name or edit what they look like. ive spent most of my time though trying to wipe out other races adn controlling the galaxy but you can also make allies or be neutral and just go through trading instead of killing. so my rating of this game so far is 4* as it may go up or down depending on what else this game can give me and also what the multiplayer gameplay is like.

												What a fantastic game this is. You can play for hours on end, play as up to 12 races and research, negotiate, ascend to a higher plane of existence, spread your culture and win by an influence victory or crush all those who oppose you. Or surrender for no reason what so ever. Seems to be based loosely of the Stargate TV series. Campaign modes will keep you going for hours on end and of course you can play skirmishs that are actually fun and challenging to play. I got it during the sale when it was only 4.99e and is probably the best buy I've got on steam. Worth a tenner if you're into Sci-Fi and strategy/simulation games.			"

												For those who like a good strategy game, this one is really something else.  Although the graphics are very dated, this game is one of the few that has a genuinely strong replayability scale for me.  I come back to it every so often, and it re-hooks me into a new game.  Heavy difficulty is actually very hard, contrary to some games I've run into, and its options both during game start and in methods of victory really make this game wildly variable in how it turns out.  After getting accustomed to it, you'll find that if you're going to be beaten, 60% of the time that's going to happen in the first 30 or so turns, which makes it a quick game.  Sometimes you'll get beaten later on, which is a satisfying if not happy defeat.  When you win though, you'll be able to see it long before you finish the game - so you'll again have the option of restart or play to the very end.  Very fun stuff, and for the price it's hard to beat.  v3 is coming soon, so it couldn't hurt to bone up on the concepts in v2 now.			"

												Look up the definition of ""awesome"" in the dictionary. When you get to the word, you should see ""Galacitc Civilization II: Ultimate Edition"" in the 'definition' space, because that's exactly what this game is. I have played space games/simulators/strategy since I could touch a keyboard + mouse, and I can safely say that very little in my experience has come close to the stunning gameplay that GCII has to offer. The only other space game(s) that I feel have a chance of competing against this beast are Sins of a Solar Empire (if you prefer real-time and epic space battles) and Endless Space (if you're wanting a simplified version of GC).The graphics aren't next-gen due to the age of this sequel; but then again, one doesn't play this game for its graphical quality as GCII will prove to you in the long course/progression of a custom match.The economic system is by far the best I've seen in any strategy game I have played (and I play most macro-scale strategy games). You have to carefully learn how to balance the taxation of your population with their overall approval of your empire, as well as how much you spend on the different budget groups (Social, Military, and Research). Sliders and percentages make this easy to understand the moment you open up your Domestic Panel (another great aspect of GCII). Keep in mind however that the more money you might place into a specific sector of your empire will yield different results, which all have their benefits and drawbacks (for example, focusing fiscal policies will return you with superior profit, some average research progression, but little military  unless you're spending your profit on fleets instead of further economic upgrades). Overall, the financial situation presented to the player in GCII is simply stunning in its conception as each choice you make will have an effect on your empire.The Research is kind of standard, depending on how many 4X or macro strategy games you've played (various techs lead into specific tech trees, etc). But the gem of the Research aspect is how it differs between each races (which there are many of by the way) and how there are so many options depending on a number of factors (your race tech tree selection, your research spending, etc). Pretty typical of a strategy game, but your decision on even some of the smaller techs still make big differences (think ahead based upon your current empire trajectory and how the galaxy is progressing!).The combat is cool at first when you get to see your first ships/fleets in action, but can quickly become tedious and boring (luckily there is a fast forward and end button to wrap up the combat in a timely fashion). It basically plays out like a rock/paper/scissors match based upon your ship configurations (which is reviewed below), your research into armor/sheilds/anti-missile defenses and your weaponry (beam, missile, mass driver). Obviously the superior number in various attacks and defenses compared to your enemies or vice versa will more than likely result in victory or defeat, but other factors are involved (such as hit points and some other minor military research equipment). You do not gain control in the real-time combat, but are able to view it from a multitude of vantage points while the game takes over the battle, which can become pretty epic once the fleet sizes grow to large capital ships. Other than that, nothing to report on combat (obviously planetary invasions are of an equally similar experience with much the same factors involved).The customization is the crux of GCII, and it shows to great extent what it is capable of. Customizing the very size and decor of individual ship types can sap hours of your time if you have specific designs in mind. It truly is fun to incorporate custom designs into an automated availability system for your fleets (i.e. based on what you craft for a ship type it will become available after the required research has been met without a lot of questions as to whether you wish to use said ship type in games or not).  Micro-management of planets and planet tiles can become aggravating, only because you'll find that sometimes there just aren't enough tiles or there are too many tiles, and deciding whether to balance or focus on a particular output can cause brain tumors (but then that's the fun, in my opinion, of being the supreme ruler over every little choice in your empire). The AI is extraordinarily intelligent, and by far some of the best in my gaming experience. Diplomacy in GCII is of the utmost importance. Creating trade routes, establishing areas of influence (which you'll learn through playing), and attending galactic council meetings/voting sessions can be some of the more exhilarating aspects of the game (United Planets council once voted against me to place an inter-galactic prisoner base on one of my best planets, doubling its production for the duration of the base, but causing a breakout of prisoners who seized ships and formed pirate fleets behind my lines, which I had to divert forces from my main front in order to crush). The muliple random events (which I recommend leaving at a high frequency) makes the game that much more interesting as well. Choices seem easy in the beginning, but later on may force you to think for a few minutes on each one as good and evil start making an appearance (Paragon and Renegade for your Mass Effect players), with each decision having either short term or long term effects (whether they be empire boosts or differences in the way you are viewed by the United Planet's empires/races).In the end, Galactic Civilizations II easily obtains a 9/10 on my gaming scoresheet. With tons of replayability and a campaign to create a mood, for any Civ gamers or 4X lovers this is a MUST BUY.			"

Starting of with little, catiously searching you sorroundings, taking everything worth having from thoses findings and using it to obliterate your enemies or valiantly hold your Homeworld. The AI though has a rough time with some of the DLC additions but there are mods to remedy that.			"

												This is a pretty good strategy game! If you're a fan of Civ V, you'll most likely like this game. Diplomacy is unmatched, ships (units) are customizable, and overall it's a fresh fun experience. As with any game though, I do think it's worth points out some stuff...Pros: Huge variety of customization options. AI seems to be very well balanced, and the dialogue is definitely awesome. Diplomacy is insanely well done. Cons: If you don't do the tutorial, you will be lost, very lost, and will make a review of this game saying it's horrible after 0.3 hours played. Just watch the tutorial vids, it's probably 20 minutes and you'll be a pro. No multiplayer, but then again, I prefer games that focus on actually being good instead of multiplayer, so that goes either way.Verdict: If it's on sale, get it. It'll probably take 12-40 hours of your life, so I'd consider it a good game.			"

												Possibly a great game made terrible by ill-considered DRM. Just ""downloaded"" the game, and have spent the past 5 hour trying (and failing) to get past the game's DRM.This appears to be a common issue (look at the game's steam forum). If you're willing to risk it, and it works, this appears to be a fantastic game (from what I've seen on youtube playthroughs). But I've wasted so much time dealing with this, and I'd recommend avoiding any Stardock game whilst it employs such a rubbish DRM system.			"

												I started playing the game. It had been a while since my last attempt. So far, the interface looked confusing, too much stuff going on, can't possibly take it all in. Guess I'll just make my best guess as I go. Well, at least it looks like I'm doing alright. Maybe I'll go for alliance victory, make everyone happy. Hey look, my economy's doing alright. And I can make these cool trade routes and get super rich! Wow, I can get all the techs from everyone else with this money and a few of my own! Hey, those guys built an Inflience starbase next to my planet, that's not cool; guess I'm going to declare war. Funny how these different races have personalities and stuff. Darn Korx always forcing such expensive trades. At least the Drath seem nice. Well now that I've conquered those other guys in the corner, time to take on the big...oh wait, they actually like me...enough even for my last alliance! I win! Wow, that was great! Time to play another game and try for a different victory!This is a fantastic game. I didn't like it at first, but recently tried it again and its amazingness sort of snuck up on me. I'd recommend it to any fans of strategy. I especially enjoy how warfare doesn't play the dominant role it normally does in strategy games. Playing the nice-guy trader whom everybody loves is entirely feasible in GalCiv2, but conquering is just as legitimate a strategy. There's plenty of races to try out with their own playstyles, and you can even make your own and pit them against yourself! Maps can be somewhat customized as well, and there is a great editor for making your own starships. So far I have no cons to report, but I haven't been playing for too long.			"

												What a fantastic game this is. You can play for hours on end, play as up to 12 races and research, negotiate, ascend to a higher plane of existence, spread your culture and win by an influence victory or crush all those who oppose you. Or surrender for no reason what so ever. Seems to be based loosely of the Stargate TV series. Campaign modes will keep you going for hours on end and of course you can play skirmishs that are actually fun and challenging to play. I got it during the sale when it was only 4.99e and is probably the best buy I've got on steam. Worth a tenner if you're into Sci-Fi and strategy/simulation games.			"

												Started playing this in the past 2 days and i can say it is gigantic! The maps can be made to hold only 2 galaxies or can be made to be an entire universe and each galaxy holds at least 3 planets so i have a lot of inhabiting to do ;) .all in all so far i think it is an amazing game with great capabilites as ive said ive only just started playing so havent tried the multiplayer yet. the singleplayer campaign is great and the main thing i love so far is that you can create your own space ships i.e frigates (satr wars imperial ships), destroyers, constructors and scouts etc and you can even name or edit what they look like. ive spent most of my time though trying to wipe out other races adn controlling the galaxy but you can also make allies or be neutral and just go through trading instead of killing. so my rating of this game so far is 4* as it may go up or down depending on what else this game can give me and also what the multiplayer gameplay is like.

												Look up the definition of ""awesome"" in the dictionary. When you get to the word, you should see ""Galacitc Civilization II: Ultimate Edition"" in the 'definition' space, because that's exactly what this game is. I have played space games/simulators/strategy since I could touch a keyboard + mouse, and I can safely say that very little in my experience has come close to the stunning gameplay that GCII has to offer. The only other space game(s) that I feel have a chance of competing against this beast are Sins of a Solar Empire (if you prefer real-time and epic space battles) and Endless Space (if you're wanting a simplified version of GC).The graphics aren't next-gen due to the age of this sequel; but then again, one doesn't play this game for its graphical quality as GCII will prove to you in the long course/progression of a custom match.The economic system is by far the best I've seen in any strategy game I have played (and I play most macro-scale strategy games). You have to carefully learn how to balance the taxation of your population with their overall approval of your empire, as well as how much you spend on the different budget groups (Social, Military, and Research). Sliders and percentages make this easy to understand the moment you open up your Domestic Panel (another great aspect of GCII). Keep in mind however that the more money you might place into a specific sector of your empire will yield different results, which all have their benefits and drawbacks (for example, focusing fiscal policies will return you with superior profit, some average research progression, but little military  unless you're spending your profit on fleets instead of further economic upgrades). Overall, the financial situation presented to the player in GCII is simply stunning in its conception as each choice you make will have an effect on your empire.The Research is kind of standard, depending on how many 4X or macro strategy games you've played (various techs lead into specific tech trees, etc). But the gem of the Research aspect is how it differs between each races (which there are many of by the way) and how there are so many options depending on a number of factors (your race tech tree selection, your research spending, etc). Pretty typical of a strategy game, but your decision on even some of the smaller techs still make big differences (think ahead based upon your current empire trajectory and how the galaxy is progressing!).The combat is cool at first when you get to see your first ships/fleets in action, but can quickly become tedious and boring (luckily there is a fast forward and end button to wrap up the combat in a timely fashion). It basically plays out like a rock/paper/scissors match based upon your ship configurations (which is reviewed below), your research into armor/sheilds/anti-missile defenses and your weaponry (beam, missile, mass driver). Obviously the superior number in various attacks and defenses compared to your enemies or vice versa will more than likely result in victory or defeat, but other factors are involved (such as hit points and some other minor military research equipment). You do not gain control in the real-time combat, but are able to view it from a multitude of vantage points while the game takes over the battle, which can become pretty epic once the fleet sizes grow to large capital ships. Other than that, nothing to report on combat (obviously planetary invasions are of an equally similar experience with much the same factors involved).The customization is the crux of GCII, and it shows to great extent what it is capable of. Customizing the very size and decor of individual ship types can sap hours of your time if you have specific designs in mind. It truly is fun to incorporate custom designs into an automated availability system for your fleets (i.e. based on what you craft for a ship type it will become available after the required research has been met without a lot of questions as to whether you wish to use said ship type in games or not).  Micro-management of planets and planet tiles can become aggravating, only because you'll find that sometimes there just aren't enough tiles or there are too many tiles, and deciding whether to balance or focus on a particular output can cause brain tumors (but then that's the fun, in my opinion, of being the supreme ruler over every little choice in your empire). The AI is extraordinarily intelligent, and by far some of the best in my gaming experience. Diplomacy in GCII is of the utmost importance. Creating trade routes, establishing areas of influence (which you'll learn through playing), and attending galactic council meetings/voting sessions can be some of the more exhilarating aspects of the game (United Planets council once voted against me to place an inter-galactic prisoner base on one of my best planets, doubling its production for the duration of the base, but causing a breakout of prisoners who seized ships and formed pirate fleets behind my lines, which I had to divert forces from my main front in order to crush). The muliple random events (which I recommend leaving at a high frequency) makes the game that much more interesting as well. Choices seem easy in the beginning, but later on may force you to think for a few minutes on each one as good and evil start making an appearance (Paragon and Renegade for your Mass Effect players), with each decision having either short term or long term effects (whether they be empire boosts or differences in the way you are viewed by the United Planet's empires/races).In the end, Galactic Civilizations II easily obtains a 9/10 on my gaming scoresheet. With tons of replayability and a campaign to create a mood, for any Civ gamers or 4X lovers this is a MUST BUY.			"

Starting of with little, catiously searching you sorroundings, taking everything worth having from thoses findings and using it to obliterate your enemies or valiantly hold your Homeworld. The AI though has a rough time with some of the DLC additions but there are mods to remedy that.			"

												This is a pretty good strategy game! If you're a fan of Civ V, you'll most likely like this game. Diplomacy is unmatched, ships (units) are customizable, and overall it's a fresh fun experience. As with any game though, I do think it's worth points out some stuff...Pros: Huge variety of customization options. AI seems to be very well balanced, and the dialogue is definitely awesome. Diplomacy is insanely well done. Cons: If you don't do the tutorial, you will be lost, very lost, and will make a review of this game saying it's horrible after 0.3 hours played. Just watch the tutorial vids, it's probably 20 minutes and you'll be a pro. No multiplayer, but then again, I prefer games that focus on actually being good instead of multiplayer, so that goes either way.Verdict: If it's on sale, get it. It'll probably take 12-40 hours of your life, so I'd consider it a good game.			"

												Possibly a great game made terrible by ill-considered DRM. Just ""downloaded"" the game, and have spent the past 5 hour trying (and failing) to get past the game's DRM.This appears to be a common issue (look at the game's steam forum). If you're willing to risk it, and it works, this appears to be a fantastic game (from what I've seen on youtube playthroughs). But I've wasted so much time dealing with this, and I'd recommend avoiding any Stardock game whilst it employs such a rubbish DRM system.			"

More important than that is the fact that this game has one of the best AI's I've ever dealt with in a video game. It's smart enough to know when to pull back from a bad situation, knows when to make arrangements that benefit it and also smart enough to avoid taking actions that weaken it too much so that other AI players can't proceed to pick on them. It's all around a pleasant experience to play against and get beaten by the computer in this game which makes winning all the sweeter.			"

												The (as of this writing) best iteration of one of the most important 4X franchises, the final version of GalCiv2 brings us much more diversified races; deep tech trees; a unique system of space stations; highly customizable ships; an economy system that is arguably even more important than military strategy; and highly customizable game setups.But the most legendary aspect of the game is its best AI in the business. Whereas most games' non-cheating AIs that play by exactly the same rules as human players are a joke, the AI here is a monster and will find ways to surprise you until you have a LOT of hours invested in this game. Beyond that, cheating AIs that even get a relatively paltry 10% bonus are often too tough for me to handle. If you are like me and have friends who never play PC games, and the AI is the only competitor you'll ever see... the importance of this is difficult to overstate.Weaknesses: a simplistic 2D grid map; long, slow games that would turn off adrenaline junkies; and a boring rock-paper-scissors approach to ship weapon and defense, with no cool exotic weapons to look forward to (besides terror stars that rarely see action anyway).

												This game has held up incredibly well for it's age.  The graphics are fine for a 4x even today and scale well to modern resolutions.The gameplay harkens back to a time when the focus of 4x was on immersion and fun rather than a vain chase for mathematical balance.  Different factions have unique flavors that aren't necessarily balanced, but who cares--they're still fun to play.  Regular cutscenes add a sense of immersion.  Military and industrial management is very well done with waypoints, governors, and auto-upgrading that lets you skip a lot of micromanaging.  The tech tree allows for many play styles, as the prerequistes for a tech are only techs of the same sort--it would be possible (though not advisable) to research to the highest level of laser weapons without researching any non-laser tech.  And different factions and alignments have unique techs available only to them.I hope the upcoming GC3, currently in beta, lives up to the promise of GC2, and they don't make the mistake Civ 5/BE have made of dropping the little things that make 4x games fun and immersive--cutscenes, victory movies, the possibility of discovering unbalanced strategies, faction personality, diplomatic insults, etc.			"

												This game is a sleeper for most gamers. It looks cheap and boring on the outside, but what lies beneath its exterior is a massively complex and brilliantly engineered game. I have looked for other games like this, such as Endless Space, Sword of Stars, Sins of a Solar Empire, and no other 4X game, not even Civ 4 or 5 come close IMO.The AI is excellent. The developers didn't want to use artificial bonuses for AI to fill the skill gap between human players and what you typically get with most AI's skills. They actually made it so that the AI is thinking and planning while you are taking your turn, so you don't have to wait around for the AI . to perform all of these calculations, which it does. Often the AI will fight poorly when at a disadvantage however, but I always find adequate and fair challenge when I play from some of the AIs. I haven't played multiplayer, so I don't know how that is. The UI and game flow is smooth in spite of having a ton of complexity. Prepare for an in depth tutorial when you first play this game. Once you get the hang of it, it's wonderful.You can wage war or play diplomatically, try to tech up fast or build a trade empire. There are many different ways to play. I have waged proxy wars where I supply another faction with weapons I designed to be effective vs our common enemy, an enemy that I didn't want to go to war with myself due to my trade routes being too close to their territory. There are just so many situations that can happen and each time you play, there is no guarantee that the same strategy you used before will work again. You have to assess the situation and act accordingly. For example; a faction near me declared war on me, and while I had ships that could fight, they were too slow to intercept the enemy ships, so I scrambled to station them in each of my worlds to defend while I researched warp technology. Those worlds I coudn't get a ship to were lost to the enemy for the time being. After defending for a long time, I sent a small fast attack fleet to strike back eventually leading to their downfall. All the while there where huge wars going on in nearby clusters (clusters of star systems).Some issues I have with the game are that special events can unbalance the game to the point that you may as well surrender. Like a ship with massive damage and defense emerges and and stars to obliterate all of your ships. Or half of your worlds defect and form their own faction, which is cool, but could have been implemented better. These things can be turned off however. Another problem I noticed is that if your game gets minimized, when you try to go back you might get a black screen. Sometimes it resumes the game after waiting other times it seems to stay forever. This game does not like to be minimized. Some say to play in windowed mode to fix, but I hate windowed mode. Lastly, it leaves me wanting more from the graphics and music. These may seem trivial compared to game play, but they are very lacking and the game would be much better with them improved.I had to drop another point off of this game due to it not allowing me to install at an internet caffe. It wanted me to register or fill out this form with tons of info I didn't have on hand. I'm not doing that, I don't need to do that. 8/10			"

People tell me this is one of the best 4X strategy games on the market, and after playing, I believe them. I have high hopes for what Stardock can accomplish with GalCiv III. Tons of customization, combined with a lot of ways to win (or lose in my case) makes for a game that's hard to get tired of. The tutorial is pretty unintuitive though, so I had to learn most things on my own (not that that's necessarily a bad thing). A great buy for any price.			"

Unfortuantely this does lead to the aforementioned 'winning solution' that ultimately trivializes other options and play styles.  Still, it's definitely worth a play though.			"

												An oldie but goodie.  I rememember playing this game back on an older machine where it was on a couple of CDs.  I picked it up again on Steam and it still hits the sweet spot.  This is old school 4X that while it doesn't offer all the bells and whistles that more recent games might, still has quite a bit for it's age.  Being the second game in the series(as of the time of this review Galactic Civilizations III has been out for awhile) it doesn't offer a lot of surprises.  It's mostly a refinement of the first one just like the more recent III is a refinement of this one.  If you're familiar with 4X games you'll know what to do.  If you aren't, just set the game on it's easiest setting and test stuff out.  The dumbest level AI is very dumb so it'll be fairly forgiving of mistakes.  Having been out for a long time there's no further support for it but it's also free of any serious bugs as far as I can tell(I've never had it crash on me or do weird things anyways).  Hell, I can't recall any minor bugs.  While a variety of new games in the genre have come out since(Galactic Civilizations III, the remake of Master of Orion, etc) it is nice to go back and look at older games that are key parts of the genre.  And of course being as hold as it is, it's cheap(and if you can get it on sale cheaper still).  Definitely worth the price.			"

												With my old GC II box-set I used to play monster custom maps that took as many hours to finish as I spent playing with other games overall. GC II feels like playing a board game that has the size of a football pitch. I kind of like its game mechanics and balance. It includes all the elements of a wide-range strategy gameplay but it does it without going too deep into them. During gameplay it means that you don't get drowned into micro management that is not a bad thing.Ages ago there was a game called Imperium Galactica II that bests this one for me, despite the fact that is more than a decade older, because it included direct control over your planetary and space combat where your decisions could win or lose the battles (with immeasurably smaller maps I must add). With good tactics and right choices you could win against much bigger forces. I miss this ""outsmarting"" option from GC II where you have automated battles where the outcome has already been fixed before the encounter itself.Anyway, it doesn't make the game any lesser. If you support the idea of LEGOing together your own spaceships and roast the hell out of your opponents with them, it would be hard to find a more capable and fun tool. Damn, you can even build your own death star.			"

												Galactic Civilizatons II Ultimate Edition is a great game when you do the tutorials. The only bad thing is when when you try to install the game. You need to make a stardock account and do the key so it took me 47 minutes to figure that out. The actual game is great. The best part I think is making the ships for your civilization and the economy stuff. Anyother thing is that if you pick a custom race they can be OP in many ways. so I would reccomend this game to people with patience.			"

												Look, this game is amazing. I probably had 300 hours played before even getting it on Steam. It's the only worthy successor to Master of Orion 2. It's not insanely overcomplicated like MoO3 or dumbed down like Endless Space. A few caveats: - The economy/production mechanics are significantly different than other 4x games, it takes some getting used to. Personally I like it. - The automatic governors are pretty limited. - The AI is extremely hostile; they'll only be your friend if your military is more powerful. - The initial rush to colonize planets plays a huge factor because it's not until much later that you have the tech to invade and take over a planet.Other reviews mention all the great things about GalCiv II so I don't need to go into it. Oh, and there's mods!NB: I've never had trouble with the DRM. Never even noticed any, actually. Maybe they removed it? YMMV			"

Often the AI will fight poorly when at a disadvantage however, but I always find adequate and fair challenge when I play from some of the AIs. I haven't played multiplayer, so I don't know how that is. The UI and game flow is smooth in spite of having a ton of complexity. Prepare for an in depth tutorial when you first play this game. Once you get the hang of it, it's wonderful.You can wage war or play diplomatically, try to tech up fast or build a trade empire. There are many different ways to play. I have waged proxy wars where I supply another faction with weapons I designed to be effective vs our common enemy, an enemy that I didn't want to go to war with myself due to my trade routes being too close to their territory. There are just so many situations that can happen and each time you play, there is no guarantee that the same strategy you used before will work again. You have to assess the situation and act accordingly. For example; a faction near me declared war on me, and while I had ships that could fight, they were too slow to intercept the enemy ships, so I scrambled to station them in each of my worlds to defend while I researched warp technology. Those worlds I coudn't get a ship to were lost to the enemy for the time being. After defending for a long time, I sent a small fast attack fleet to strike back eventually leading to their downfall. All the while there where huge wars going on in nearby clusters (clusters of star systems).Some issues I have with the game are that special events can unbalance the game to the point that you may as well surrender. Like a ship with massive damage and defense emerges and and stars to obliterate all of your ships. Or half of your worlds defect and form their own faction, which is cool, but could have been implemented better. These things can be turned off however. Another problem I noticed is that if your game gets minimized, when you try to go back you might get a black screen. Sometimes it resumes the game after waiting other times it seems to stay forever. This game does not like to be minimized. Some say to play in windowed mode to fix, but I hate windowed mode. Lastly, it leaves me wanting more from the graphics and music. These may seem trivial compared to game play, but they are very lacking and the game would be much better with them improved.I had to drop another point off of this game due to it not allowing me to install at an internet caffe. It wanted me to register or fill out this form with tons of info I didn't have on hand. I'm not doing that, I don't need to do that. 8/10			"

												It's a lot like the Civilization franchise... but in space.  Unit customization superior to CIV. Diplomacy is about the same but maybe a bit better.  But very similar gameplay means this won't impress you if you're a CIV veteran who is burned out on the genre.			"

												This game has held up incredibly well for it's age.  The graphics are fine for a 4x even today and scale well to modern resolutions.The gameplay harkens back to a time when the focus of 4x was on immersion and fun rather than a vain chase for mathematical balance.  Different factions have unique flavors that aren't necessarily balanced, but who cares--they're still fun to play.  Regular cutscenes add a sense of immersion.  Military and industrial management is very well done with waypoints, governors, and auto-upgrading that lets you skip a lot of micromanaging.  The tech tree allows for many play styles, as the prerequistes for a tech are only techs of the same sort--it would be possible (though not advisable) to research to the highest level of laser weapons without researching any non-laser tech.  And different factions and alignments have unique techs available only to them.I hope the upcoming GC3, currently in beta, lives up to the promise of GC2, and they don't make the mistake Civ 5/BE have made of dropping the little things that make 4x games fun and immersive--cutscenes, victory movies, the possibility of discovering unbalanced strategies, faction personality, diplomatic insults, etc.			"

												Love this deep 4X space empire game. Played it a ton back in the pre-steam days. Loaded it up for just nostalgia... 12 hours later the beautiful Horatio have dominated the galaxy.			"

												With my old GC II box-set I used to play monster custom maps that took as many hours to finish as I spent playing with other games overall. GC II feels like playing a board game that has the size of a football pitch. I kind of like its game mechanics and balance. It includes all the elements of a wide-range strategy gameplay but it does it without going too deep into them. During gameplay it means that you don't get drowned into micro management that is not a bad thing.Ages ago there was a game called Imperium Galactica II that bests this one for me, despite the fact that is more than a decade older, because it included direct control over your planetary and space combat where your decisions could win or lose the battles (with immeasurably smaller maps I must add). With good tactics and right choices you could win against much bigger forces. I miss this ""outsmarting"" option from GC II where you have automated battles where the outcome has already been fixed before the encounter itself.Anyway, it doesn't make the game any lesser. If you support the idea of LEGOing together your own spaceships and roast the hell out of your opponents with them, it would be hard to find a more capable and fun tool. Damn, you can even build your own death star.			"

												Good, hard, classic 4X game.  AI is brutal when the difficulty is turned up.			"

												Starting out is pretty rough, be ready to Google many of the core mechanics, but once you get the hang of it, this game can be very rewarding.			"
