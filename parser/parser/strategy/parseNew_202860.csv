												Can't even play it because in order to press buttons I have to search around until I find it.. Hovering over the buttons doesn't highlight them.. theres some sort of resolution error or something that I can't figure out.			"

												Great game: battles are fluid, and the AI is stunning. The campaign scales very well and is both challenging and enjoyable. If your units don't show initiative, it is not the AI's fault, check you unit stats; also upgrade your commander skill for your lead troops. The HUD is intuitive and easy to follow. I highly recommend this game to any strategy-lovers.			"

												Good game , the battle is just like the previous title which has almost perfect system for historic tactical battles, it refined a bit and feels more fluid especially the camera control. The nice add to this title is the camapign map which is played like Mount & blade system, all in real time, where you can recruit & upgrade your army, and also trade and seige castles, and many other things. There are RPG elements which are good add, you can enhance your hero abilities and thus can be reflected on your army or other aspects of the game, siege battles are fine but could be better. Graphics and overall atmosphere are great for such theme.However, the campaign map adds a lot as I mentioned previously, but the excution is really poor, the campign map feels so buggy, not realistic at all,for example robbers are like organized kingdom army that can crush you, the trade system feels unreal, the upgrade could be much better, and after sometimes you will feel extreamly bored from campaing and you just want to play those epic historic battles which were in Real Warfare 1242, thats why I would give 6 just because of the campaign, and I think if they make it like Total War game campaing but in real time it will be much better			"

												really nice game... it has inovation... really has a lot of potential...But for now crashes ... crashes ... and more crashes...Update:There are not more update so far... and look like the company already ""dissapear"" ... so this is a death game, don't buy and hope that they are going to fix everything...This game really have the potential to be better than Total War Roma... but they just give up.The game really crash and quick you out all the time, from doing nothing to just a single click... Don't buy it.			"

												Couldn't get in to this game. It was too hard to control units etc. They often just wouldn't go where I tried to put them I felt llike I was battling the controls and game system instead of the enemy. After playing the total war series it just doesnt compare.			"

												This game is truly awesome, It polished gem that everyone has missed out and that was hidden in the propagande of the Total war series.It´s well worth 20 euro even though it now is on sale for just 2 euro. I has high quality graphics and feels very  immersive.Combat seems more realistic in pace than the total war series and it has a very interesting campaign.I havent played so much but this game does not deserver all that bad critique it has gotten.  I dont understand those at all.			"

												Combines Mount & Blade with Total War; kinda like the Red Orchestra 2 of strategy games.A unique and underrated title from a studio that went under before bugs were fixed.Buy it on sale you won't be dissapointed.			"

												I really like this game it is a good alternative to medieval total war 2. It has good map layout and better battle graphics . The battles are alot of fun espeacially the way the calvary charges and they dont just stop like an moron like in mtw2. The controls are really easy and the open world is a cool addition to the series.			"

												I don't think that this game was worth my money at all... seeing right now 12.9.2014 that i could have bought Skyrim for less money then i payed for this crap makes me actually CRY! T_T-0/10 WASTE OF MONEY! do not buy.The controls are wierd, old the enemies IN THE STARTING campaign are quote:""invincible army"" compared to mine, so i can't even fight anyone, once it said that i am equal with an army of 4x swords, 3x archers, 2x spearman, 1x cav, with mine: 1x axe, 1x sword, 1x knight cav.... i was destroyed.... and the game restarted from where i was at the last ""safe - saved game"" eh.... disappointment			"

												Точно такая же, как и 1 часть, только + глобальная карта, даже карты в скирмише не поменяли. Глобалка вообще не конкурент Total War (ближе даже к Mount & Blade). а вот тактика радует, ибо тот же TW имеет по всем параметрам, Если патчить игру, то может получится толк.			"

												*PLEASE READ THIS PARAGRAPH SO YOUR NOT RIPPED OFF!""The currency on the store page is messed up, it is £20 and $20, dollars is 50% more than pounds so if you live in the uk use http://store.steampowered.com/?cc=us to purchase the game and you can get it 50% cheaper, this either means they are trying to rip you off if your in the UK or just made a mistake.I wont review the game I just want to warn you that if you live in the uk you dont get ripped off by 10 pounds as if you purchase it in dollars you will pay a estamate of 10 to 12 pounds.But I will say this, it is a good game done bad as it lacks factions and features.
