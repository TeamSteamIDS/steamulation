Color blind buyer beware!As a colorblind player, I cannot tell the difference between the reds and greens, making this game impossible (or impassible?) for me to play. Being that it only costed me $.99, it's still $.99 wasted. This problem could have easily been avoided by the developers as there is no option to change the colors or a way make them easier to identify. This game is one to avoid if you are colorblind.			"

												RUSH is one of the more challenging and enjoyable puzzle games I've played, and exactly the kind of challenge I'm always looking for! But thanks to a really good optional hint system, everyone can play and enjoy this game.You have to place direction tiles on a platform so that when blocks move over it, they will go the direction you want, so they can reach their finish. But you only have a limited amount of tiles, so you need to think it through as to where to place them. On top of that you need to be careful as to not make blocks collide into each other.The game starts with a bunch of easy levels, which will give you an idea whether this game is for you or not. The harder levels can become quite a challenge, and especially the hidden levels and secret Portal levels can take up a nice bit of your brain power.			"

												Despite its name, this game should not be played in a rush.I mean, it is a puzzle game. Puzzles should be solved slowly.If you're a genius, why in the world would you be playing a puzzle game? You'd be making one.The good thing about this game? There are no hair-pulling rage moments. Seriously. If you cannot beat a level, take a break, close the game, think it over, and try it again when you're ready. It is basically a puzzle simulation, not some action-based platformer.

RUSH is simple puzzle game wrapped in a gorgeous 3D package.RUSH is ideal for people who love to sit down, strap on a thinking cap, and let the brain juices flow. The game provides a plethora of beautifully made puzzles, based around the concept of transporting cubes from point A to point B under various conditions and using a given set of pieces to alter pathways. I really enjoyed my time with Rush and found myself getting the great sense of accomplishment with each success, I just wish I could think a little more critically to do it.			"

												Wow, I've hardly started playing this game and I'm in love! The puzzles are dynamic, colorful and fun, as well as a challenge like any good puzzle game should be; full of brain twisters. I love watching my little blocks roll to their destination, or doom if I messed up. This game looks amazing, is vibrant in not only color, but feel. The music is also great and compliments the game perfectly. I have a sense of accomplishment when I complete a puzzle in this game, it simply makes me feel happy playing it.			"

												There is a churning feeling of satisfaction once you have completed everything there is to do in this simple, yet mind-numbing puzzle game. This game has so much more to offer beyond the limits of the easy - medium - hard puzzles. Finding the hidden clues and levels allows for even more time to be spent on this game. Also, much respect for doing the crossover with Portal. Really brings good variety and comical relief into a game which, may at first seem rather bland.

												RUSH Review - Raymond K. TurcotteA amazing game all in all. I really enjoyed playing it, some puzzles were diificutlt but it was worth the achievements. The game has some easy achievements and hard ones. My one complaint would be with the achievements, thier are some that you can only get in december and one that you could only get in 2011. Really? Why? Not sure. I'm assuming just to make a quick 10$.I managed to get around 80% of the achievement so, i'm not to sad. but believe me, i would get the two i'm missing in a heartbeat if i could. One thing i loved about the game was that it refferenced other games, like Portal 2 (Glados) and Toki Torri. (I think...) but i think it's awesome that the developpers do that in games. It gies my a smile. because i loved the Portal seris. Anyway. I 100% percent recommend this game! Get it now while it's only like 0.20 cents.			"

												I bought this game on sale for very cheap, and while I can't say it's not worth what I paid, because it most certainly is, I just think there was a lot of wasted potential here. The thing is, puzzles in general can be very fun and rewarding, or very frustrating. I think the main thing that makes a puzzle frustrating is when you simply don't have enough information to solve it. Sure, it's a valuable life skill to be able to solve problems even when you don't have all the tools, but those kinds of problems are supposed to give you real life rewards, not present themselves as games and take your money.My biggest complaint about this game is that it relies heavily on things it never gives you a chance to understand, particularly timing. Many of the puzzles are very simple in a spatial sense, but require timing movements exactly so that you can interweave block paths. However, the game doesn't let you change the speed of the runs, and it's not consistent between different runs. Furthermore, some of the harder puzzles have blocks traveling at different speeds. As if that wasn't enough, it seems the game doesn't even judge collisions based on a notion of which block occupies which tile, but rather it actually uses hit detection, so blocks entering and leaving a tile at about the same time can still collide by touching corners for a split second. This makes some of the puzzles unnecessarily trial-and-error in nature, with the player just switching blocks around between multiple nearly identical solutions in spatial terms which result in slightly different timing, in the hopes that one of them will eventually produce the correct result. A good puzzle game shouldn't be designed to make you just randomly try things until one works.Another complain I have is that there's no ability to zoom the camera in or out as far as I can tell. You can rotate the camera, but the level of zoom is consistently too close or far to clearly see all of the map. The game would've also benefitted from a square lense (orthogonal view if I remember correctly from 3D modeling) rather than an eye-type lense, because several of the puzzles have you dropping blocks from one platform down to another below it, and trying to line up the camera from above to see what will happen isn't very effective.All in all, it's an interesting concept for a game that had potential, but it feels like it was developed to work against you and force you into trial-and-error runs rather than actually thinking about space and time in discrete units with well-defined, known rates of movement. This game could've been more fun in 2D 20 years ago. I found myself using the hints (which make it way too easy) and trial-and-error to solve the harder puzzles, because it didn't even feel like cheating when that's about what I would do without the hints anyway.

												From the same developers as Toki Tori, their talent with creating tricky but doable puzzles is still readily apparent. I am not at all a fan of puzzle games as I get frustrated very quickly, so the fact I finished this one is probably everything a fan of the genre needs to know. Gameplay is deceptively simple- use redirectional tiles to guide a series of coloured blocks home. If you've seen the trailer, you already know everything you need to know in order to start playing. The layouts are fiendish though, and tease you with making it very clear what you HAVE to do, but keeping HOW to do it closely guarded. Many of the puzzles are forehead-slappingly clear once you figure it out, but until you get to that point you'll be dazed and confused trying to figure out how you're supposed to get THIS block over THERE with two Turn Left tiles and a Stop tile.Unfortunately the hardest levels tend to devolve into a confusing mess of tiles and blocks everywhere- while earlier levels it was clear where you were going wrong, later levels are so tightly packed it can be hard to figure out exactly what the problem with your solution is. However, the powerful in-built Hint system is tremendously helpful in untying these knots, and perhaps borders on being TOO helpful if you allow it to be- one button tells you if the tiles you have placed should be where they are or not, the other reveals the correct location of every tile you have (but not while tile to put in that place). With trial and error these hints can pretty much solve the puzzle for you, so stay strong-willed and only use it when you're completely against the wall!			"

												If you've played directional games (such as ChuChu Rocket, or RoboRally) and enjoy puzzle games, RUSH is likely right up your alley. The tutorial is lightweight and the controls easy to pickup and remember. It's a rewarding game that eases you into the thick of things. The hints are well-done and if you use them, the game only tells you how many you used. The tutorial is a little vague on a few topics. For example, any color can use any portal: the portal color is just indicative of the matching entrance/exit. Also, different colors can roll over different end spots without penalty (for example: red can roll over yellow's end zone to get to the red one).			"

												I hardly remember this game at all, how am I going to write a review for it...Well hmm. The hint system is a bit too helpful considering there's really no penalty for not using it. I think the best part of this game is just how neat the blocks look rolling around in most levels. It's fun just to watch.Issues would be that it's a lot of trial and error because even if you know how blocks are going to behave some of it comes down to timing things right and it's pretty tough to visualize that in advance. I'll admit that I basically gave up on some of the harder puzzles, just couldn't be bothered. It can get a bit tedious to play since there really isn't too terribly much variation.I'm making this sound pretty negative aren't I? I still like the game but there's better out there for your time, I'd say.			"

												I bought this game for 5-6 years and have off and on finished it. It's a very well design and concept puzzle game that is very challenging to solve things in a 3D persepctive. The music is fitting for both the menu and during a level.There are hidden levels, some bonus levels if you follow the game, and Actual levels staring Glados from Portal (however you're given no hints.)The only issue is you can't zoom in on a puzzle to help you solve it, you can only rotate it at different angles with a fix distance and location of the camera. While it's a creative way to solve a puzzle, for few you'll feel very restrained. I've had to look up some walkthroughs, sadly, as the perspective for some puzzles were too obstructed to read and know where it'll go.Regardless, it's still a fun game to play off and on, till you get to Actual Puzzles then it's just frustration after another.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

'RUSH' is a casual puzzle game with multiple coloured cubes.Desc:Your goal is to guide the cubes from their spawn point to their designated exit point. Red cubes have to be guided from the red spawn to the red exit point, blue cubes .. etc. You have a certain amount of placeable objects in each level to solve the puzzle. There are objects like a stop sign, where the cubes will pause their movement for a second or arrow signs, where the cubes will change their direction. The level will fail, if one the cubes falls of the platform, cubes will crash together or cubes won't get to the right exit.Pros:+ Easy to get into.+ Nice soundtrack.+ Three different chapters of difficulty and one bonus chapter.+ Tutorial chapter. (Not really needed except the fact that cubes at walls will turn 90° to the right.)+ Hint system for inexperienced gamers. (I never used this option.)(+ nice to see cubes rolling to their designated point like a working machine)(+ downloadable demo)(+ steam achievements)Cons:- You can't speed up the rolling sequence of the cubes.- You can't zoom with the camera.- You can't hide planes of the platform!!! (Some levels are cramped and you have to adjust the camera like crazy!)- There are always to much cubes that will spawn. (I don't know why the devs have implemented so much spawning cubes for the levels. It would be enough if there would spawn 4 cubes of each colour.)Recommended, but only if it's on sale, because of the short game duration, the small amount of levels, the easy difficulty and of the (IMHO) annoying cons.@Devs: One good patch that would patch the cons would rise the rating enormous.@Gamers: Play the game 'EDGE' (same dev studio) it's definitely much better than 'RUSH'.6.5/10 "

TL;DRChallenging and engaging, RUSH is a puzzle game that keeps the player interested and involved the entire time.Square DancingYou don't need to break new ground to create a good game. RUSH is a puzzle game that's more of the same, but in a good way. The game itself isn't incredibly long (depending on how fast you solve the puzzles), but it feels rewarding. Each puzzle you struggle through feels like an accomplishment and each puzzle presents a whole new bag of tricks so that almost no two levels feel the same. RUSH is an excellent game, especially for the price.BreakdownPros Scaffolding: Even though RUSH does offer a few tutorial levels, the real learning happens as you're playing. The game's level design is well thought out as each level teaches you something you'll need in upcoming levels. Quality > Quantity: RUSH is a game that's as long as it needs to be. Many puzzlers attempt to pad playtime by having dozens of (what essentialy amounts to) the same level. Instead, RUSH doesn't overstay its welcome and gives the player the cream-of-the-crop. Secrets! Even for such a short game, RUSH contains a handful of secret levels and a bit of comedy (courtesy of GLaDOS).Cons Move B*tch, Get Out the Way: One thing this game does lack is a fast-forward button on the levels. Some long levels with slow-moving cubes will be the bane of your existance. Third-Eye Blind: The game does some wacky stuff and sometimes, it's a pain to try and position the camera juuuuusssst right to reach that one tile space. The ability to at least zoom in and out would've been great. Score: 9/10			"

												RUSH is quite hard, yet very accessible. For the rest of my review, you need to understand the gameplay a bit: watch the videos, because I won't explain it here. If you are stuck, you can always use an in-game hint: it can either show you which tiles you used are in the right spot and which one are in the wrong spot, or it can show you where the tiles should go (without telling you which ones go where). It's up to you to decide which hint to use (you can use both as much as you want in every level) or if you'll use hint at all. It's nice to be able to move forward in a puzzle without having to look at the solution and feeling like you're cheating.			"

The object of the game is to place arrows guiding different coloured blocks to a portal with the same colour, making sure that they don't crash into one another. When you get the level right, and place all the arrows in their correct places, you just gotta push that play button and let the eye candy begin. "

RushIf you're a puzzle fan, I definitely recommend this. It's a fun and addictive casual game, and at this price it's a no-brainer. I often come back to it and would definitely be interested in some sort of sequel.Pros:Stylish presentation;Good difficulty curve;Clever puzzles based on original mechanics;Satisfying marching display when solving a puzzle;Soundtrack is true to the mood of the game;Very decent length at 70+ levels.

												I  have bought this game during the Summer Sales 2015.""Why not?"" I thought, since it was there for a bargain.And I wasn't dissapointed!Now, let's get to the game itself.The goal is to lead the boxes (orange, purple, green, blue, red,  I hope I have mentioned all colors now!) to their dedicated (same colored) destination.To achieve this, you have a certain number of ""direction markers"" (among other things) you can place on the field, like arrows that show the direction where it will lead each box that touches it. You can place these direction markers on any spot you like, just make sure you are placing them on the right position so the cubes reach their correct destination.Oh, and these markers are limited, depening on the level/area. And it's not allowed to let the cubes bump against each other...or let them fall off the field. With logic, you'll make it.K, now to the music:I like it. it's some ambient electro stuff, and matching very well to the game.So yeah, I started it, played the training and finished some ""beginner"" levels so far.Since it's a nice looking and fun game, I'll keep playing it more often.You should get this game too if you like logical games or want to have something to play & relax!Oh, the animations are nice too. You can move the camera around, so you have a nice overview.Unfotunately, I didn't see any option where I could have set the speed of the boxes (I can be such an impatient person, no matter how nice the cube animations are in this game). Anyway, I like it so I recommend this game. "

												Awesome puzzle game. Loved how the progression of the game got more difficult with each level; it did not just jump up incredibly with one level. And the challenge levels at the end...just when you think you had it. This game is not for people who just want an easy breezy walkthrough.			"

												RUSH is a 3D indie puzzle game by Two Tribes[twotribes.com]. It's their second Windows release after the successful Toki Tori. In RUSH, the player needs to guide colored cubes to the appropriate exit points. This happens by using items that are unlocked through the progress of the game, such as Conveyor belts, Warps and more. The player places the items in advance and needs to imagine how they will affect the cubes' process through the level.I don't have much to say against this game, just one suggestion: a level editor would be great. After completing this game once, I have nothing more to do and there's no motivation for me to play it anymore. If there was an option to download community-created levels (for example through the Steam Workshop) and designing own levels, it would definitely raise the replay potential for me and probably many other players.Other than that, this game has great, tricky levels, for those who want a challenge, or if you want to set your mind at ease or are just stuck at one level for a while, there's a hint system that makes your life easier. The environment looks neat and clean, which contributes to the game's calming and relaxing feel along with a chill music and simple drag and drop controls. Everything about this game says ""No rush."" (such irony). On a gameplay level, I like the idea of the game, it's really simple but they did a good job implementing it, the levels have interesting and creative patterns, the items used to control the cubes are decent.Overall I'd recommend this game if you're a puzzle game fanatic or if you just want a calming game to free your mind. If you're none of these two, you might not have as much fun with the game as I did, but it's worth a try.			"

												A must have for any puzzler enthusiast's collection.RUSH is a 3d puzzle game involving simple logic skills. There's colored entrances and exits, and as soon as you believe you've finished the puzzle, blocks will teleport into existence and follow a straight line across the map, only turning right when they bump into walls.You, as the player, have to place special movement pads on the ground that influence the path these blocks take, allowing you to divert block traffic to help all of them reach the exit without colliding or falling off the map.While this premise sounds really simple, in practice it can get really complex because of this simplicity. There's 4 direction changing pads, a direction switcher that switches back and forth when blocks use it. A pause pad, as well as a conveyor belt pad. While their effects are simple, it's the entire contraption and combination of switching and redirecting traffic at the right place that turns out to be the big puzzling question in this game.The game divides the puzzles in a few difficulty settings, starting with tutorial/easy puzzles that only involve a few pads, up to hard and 'special' puzzles that require great insights and rational systematic analysis of the paths the cubes take to find out the solution. As such, pretty much anyone should be able to get *something* out of this game, and the more you practice, the better you'll get, allowing even the weaker puzzle fanatic to grow and progress to the harder areas of the game.RUSH also features a slightly upbeat ambient track that is fun to listen to, and it really fits with the sounds of blocks squeaking their way throughout the level.So if you like puzzles, if you like 3d puzzles, if you like logical thinking. Get this game! It's definitely worth the price.As a sidenote, if you liked Chu Chu Rocket: This is the exact same thing, except it uses cubes.Sound: 3/5The sounds are simple but fitting, though some people might get tired of the Sqeaky Cube noise after a while.Graphics: 3/5The graphics are again, simple, but fitting. Everything is cube shaped and the ambient lighting gives the entire game a soft look and feel. The cubes themselves are a bit more shiny. There's not much to say due to the simple graphics, but they look good for a puzzle game.Gameplay: 4/5Great puzzle fun, though there's less replay value once you've finished them all, unless you forget the solutions to the old ones. Controls are fluent, game mechanics are simple to understand and logical.Overall: 4/5It just works, the amount of content you get for the low price is great, the gameplay is fun, and everything just blends together into one great game.

												Rush is a nice little puzzle game that's good for a few hours of play. The only gripe I have is the difficulty. Easy is exactly as it says it is, Medium is a little harder and Hard is for when you want to feel like a dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The jump in difficulty from medium to hard is disappointingly gargantuan, going from a little challenging to frustratingly confusing. The artificial difficulty lies in the very specific tile placement needed to beat the levels and the little to no clues to help you decipher the solution. Even when you figure out the trick to beating a level, fidgeting with the tiles to find the ONE solution it asks for is somehow both simultaneously boring and frustrating. I felt very disappointed in myself for having to use the hint system, but unless you want to move tiles around aimlessly for hours you're going to have to use and abuse it to win. Simply put, hard difficulty is not fun and felt more like a chore than anything else. However, in the 3 or 4 hours it takes to beat the easy and medium stages, I would recommend picking up this game only if it is heavily discounted. Not worth a whole $5 in my eyes.			"

												A clever 3D puzzler. The game at first sight feels shorter that other puzzle games, but in reality it has lots of extra and hidden content, plus achievements which requires replays. In total, it almost doubles the first seemingly 66 puzzles. And the game is hard. You have to guide cubes to exits, but the hardest part is not how to lead them, but to prevent collisions between them. Fortunately, almost all levels have hints, and you can chose between 2 types. In a puzzle game, it's expected for you to solve them by yourself, but this feature can help you if you're stuck. And you will be a lot. And in here you don't need to rush, because first you fit the course for the cubes before they run. This releases pressure and allows you to concentrate on the solution. Overall, it's a nice puzzle game, accessible and challenging at the same time.			"

I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this game: it's good fun and the animations are nice and fluid. Depsite the rules being relatively straight forward, you can still be up against quite difficult puzzles so it's alwways satisfying whan you get all the blocks to go in the right holes.If I had to rate I'd say maybe 8/10 You can't really zoom so sometimes if it's a long shape, you can't see all at once, but you can move around so this solves it.Perhaps including a level editor would be a fun idea?

June 4, 2015RUSH is a decent puzzle game suffering from some interface issues. Gameplay is quite simple, and unlimited hints allow anyone to progress through the game. The main problem is that you will likely spend more time rotating the camera to the correct angle rather than thinking about the puzzles. I feel like this camera issue is almost by design, as later levels push the designs to obscure as much of the layout as possible. It's a simple puzzle game without clarity in many levels. Interestingly, some puzzle elements are barely utilized or introduced (speed up/down modifiers), but the game is most certainly not getting updates to add levels using these elements.It's a short, simple, and imperfect game for sure. I was never really amazed, but it wasn't an awful experience. You can live without it, but it is quite affordable. The game can be beaten 100% in under 7 hours. I got it for 90% off if I recall, and I would recommend a decent sale price under $3 USD, considering the limited replay value.			"

												RUSH is a puzzle game made by the creators of Toki Tori, a game I also recommend.The good:-Soundtrack, like holy crap, soundtrack. It's the best soundtrack EVER. Period. Not joking, there are few soundtracks that compare to this one.-Graphics, They are nice, and run smooth without slowing down old computers.-Low requirements, you could have a computer from 1982 and still run this. (Ok, ok, fine. 1983.)-The gameplay, it's nice and has an original feel unlike most puzzle games which revolve around pushing little blocks around.The bad:-Difficulty. I'm an achievement hunter, I enjoy a good challenge, but this is H A R D. I have played for multiple hours and the difficulty, oh man. There is this one easy level I just flat out can't beat.All in all, good game.RUSH gets:If it's on saleRatings possible: (Highest to lowest)Get itIf it's on sale *If you really want itIf it's gifted to youDon't get it.

												RUSH has been on my wishlist for a long time as a low requirements game to enjoy while I'm away from my desktop (Which also means I didn't plan to run it under Windows.)Here's all I have to say: This title is no longer cross platform. Under OS X it produces a white screen with background music and a green cursor. There goes the entire reason I bought it. A similar problem is produced in the developer's game EDGE, so it's clearly an engine issue. I reported the issues within hours of buying the games, hoping maybe they'd fix it. Nothing.Do not buy this if you're trying to support cross platform developers.			"

												Decent logic game. The goal of each level one is to plan routes for cubes from spawning point to exit. Every cube has color and it has to hit exit with matching color, otherwise it keeps rolling. The player has bunch of signs, which he can place around level. Signs have different effects, e. g. changes direction of cube, stops cube for a moment, splits stream of cubes... It may sounds boring, but it isn't. Major drawback with many puzzle games is, that difficulty is sets to extreme, or that they are way too easy. This game hits the sweet spot. Levels are challenging, but not too hard. It even has very clever hint system. So, when you are stuck, it won't spoil entire solution at once. Instead it shows you just mistakes. In my opinion, there are just two problems. First is repetitive music. After while I just turn it off, it makes me headache. Second is design of some levels. Center of camera view is fixed to one location. In levels with many platforms it is hard to see what exactly is above (or below) each square. Moreover it’s  hard to place signs to right spots.			"

Rush was really fun, and if you like puzzlers, I would definitely recommend it! The game revolves around different colored boxes that you have to get into the matching goals. Unless an outside force acts on these boxes, they will continuously go straight. You are giving the minimum amount of ""outside forces"" needed to guide the boxes to their intended goals. Some of the puzzles are pretty easy, while others are pretty difficult and force you to think outside of the box (get it... because you are moving boxes, yeah?). But most importantly, they have Glados :)

												I'm not a platformer old-timer, like most reviewers seem to be. I just play the occasional puzzle/platform game that's on sale, and seeing as they're usually under a dollar when on sale, I'm open to new things. I got RUSH for fifty cents, but I feel like it was forty cents too much. After completing the tutorial, the game seems exciting at first, but it quickly gets dull and bland. The physics are very specifically engingeered so that there's almost no freedom. You must always follow their given path, with the exception of maybe three or four different levels, or else you lose for sure. Another thing to note was that before I bought the game, I noticed other people saying how there was a very bright light making it extremely hard to see. I took these people for foolish, seeing as I thought that - like most games - you could just turn down the brightness settings. Unfortunately, you cannot, and this rumor is true. I would strongly advise you don't buy this game, and if you want my opinion, buy Defy Gravity instead. (Side note: This game is an absolute Portal wanna-be, but fails miserably at it).			"

												what a boring, uninspired, bad game. You put directions on a map, click go, and cubes roll around following your directions to reach a goal. I played a game like this on CD-ROM in 1996 and there's been about a thousand in between. RUSH's gimmick is that there's multiple cubes rolling around at once, supposedly upping the problem-solving. But, lethally, the timing of when cubes will knock against walls and collide is so delicate that it's almost impossible to see without experimentation. So the whole thing ends up a sickeningly frustrating trial-and-error spam that washes out all skill and inspiration. ♥♥♥♥ this game.Although the music's nice			"

												I can't really say I've personally found this game to be enjoyable. Rush's main problem is that it's ridiculously convoluted in its puzzle solutions and design. Coupled with the fact that many puzzles have blind spots where you can't see properly, finding a solution is close to insanity. Naturally a game gets super hard if you cannot see what you're doing. I do not recommend getting this game unless you take pride in unfair challenges.			"

												RUSH, also called Rubik's Puzzle Galaxy: RUSH on Wii, is a puzzle game in which you have to guide colored blocks to their applicable exit points to complete levels.  Blocks are guided by placing markers on the ground which change the direction of, speed up, or slow down blocks that pass over them.  Later levels also offer conveyor belt markers which can shift blocks to the side without changing their direction.  Losing any blocks off the edge of the level or having blocks collide fails the level.Levels vary from trivially easy to frustratingly complex and difficult, though most of the levels are pretty reasonable.  In levels where streams of two different colored blocks need to cross, you will often end up making lots of small adjustments to the position of markers to avoid collisions which can be rather frustrating, especially when everything seems to be going perfectly only for the last two blocks on the level to collide.Overall a very enjoyable puzzle game.

PresentationOriginally a WiiWare download title called Rubik's Puzzle Galaxy: Rush, the game has since lost its Rubik's licence, being released on Steam simply as Rush, with additional stages and content. Rush is a puzzle game, in which you are given a certain number of directional signs, stop signs or split signs which you can place on the map in order to guide each cube from point A to point B without them colliding or falling off the map. Those stages are grouped based on their difficulty starting with the easy ones, and moving on to the medium ones and the hard ones, allowing you to choose a challenge fit for your experience and get better with time, allowing you to learn from your mistakes, observe how the cubes move once you've hit the green button and rearrange the signs based on what you have seen. There is no sense of advancement since there is no leveling up system and you're not really unlocking anything besides the next levels, but playing Rush more will definitely make you better at it, as long as you keep replaying the same stage, since you're not exactly learning how to play the game better, but instead observing the problems in your sign arrangement; it's more like ruling out the bad solution and eventually getting to the right one, how long it takes to get there depends only on how well you understand the mechanics.Rating: 7GameplayThe gameplay is simplistic and intuitive, offering a challenge for everyone and satisfaction to those who dare to give the hardest levels a shot. Placing signs is easy and understanding how they work is the key to solving puzzles, while directional signs are the most encountered ones, using them efficiently is what will get you through as the natural direction of the cube plays an important role in many puzzles, and combining good use of direction movement with things such as speed which can be influenced using a stop sign or a directional sign, and the split sign which will allow you to group cubes based on their color in order to send them in the right direction, all matters in the end. There is also a hint system that will tell you where signs should be placed without giving the exact order, a tool that will come in handy for those who want to enjoy the game without wasting too much time on a single puzzle. There are levels grouped depending on the challenge level, but there's nothing stopping you from enjoying all of them, as the hard ones can be approached using the hint system and the easy ones can be fun even for the pros. Adding all that up, there are more than 80 different stages, with different levels of difficulty, so there's plenty of challenge for everyone.Rating: 7.5GraphicsRush is a colorful universe, using cubes and their respective colors to create beautiful backgrounds that will often captivate you more than the stage itself. Even though all the stages respect the same rules of color and formation, each one feels unique in its own way, and successfully solving a puzzle often rewards you with a beautiful parade of flawlessly moving blocks.Rating: 7AudioThe electronic soundtrack is in theme with the game, and even though the number of tracks is limited and will become repetitive eventually, you can always play Rush with your own music in the background since there is no dialogue or information given that you'll miss if you do that. The sound effects are okay, yet nothing spectacular to support the colorful movement of successfully guided blocks.Rating: 6.5ExtrasWith all its 80+ stages including the bonus stages and the special Portal Event stages, Rush can take anywhere from 3 hours to 10 hours to complete, depending how long it takes for you to give up and hit the hint button, but even so for a 5 bucks title, you get plenty of content to play around with.Rating: 7.5VerdictRush is a must play for puzzle fans who want a little challenge, but it still provides a few intriguing levels for the casual puzzle solvers too, so there are enough reasons for everyone to give it a shot and see how well they can guide the cubes.Rating Overall: 7.1Check out the full review and a lot more about RUSH at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=355 "

												rush is a (sometimes frustrating) puzzle game with simple graphics and mechanics, yet very addictive and challenging. the first levels in easy and medium are an entertaining walktrough, but when you reach the hard+ difficulty you will notice a very steep raise in difficulty.some levels are quite easy and quick to solve, some not a very big challenge.. but a few of them are real brain crackers. ive spent hours in specific levels and at some point it got frustrating, but not in a negative way (even tho i sometimes just wanted to smash my laptop against the wall), it did rather motivate me to finally solve it. many times i was looking at the ""hint"" buttons but i was always able to resist and keep trying (still asking myself whats the difference between those 2 buttons).the game itself is very simple. the map/level is a platform purely made out of cubes with a colored coded cube-spawner and a target. the goal is to maneuver the cube(s), which start moving in a set direction after spawning, from the spawn to the same colored target without any contact between the cubes. to get this done you can use a limited number of functional plates (change direction, split, stop, shift) which u lay in the way of the block so it modifies the path the cube moves along.an interesting feature is the direction change that happens when a cube hits a wall, it will turn to the right and continue moving. at first i kinda underestimated the use of this feature and the influence on the solution *hint*.in the background of the map there is always some movement going on. rings of cubes that spin around and flying arrows etc help a bit, so your face doesnt fall asleep when you stare at the level while thinking about a solution.the only negative aspect ive encountered while playing was that sometimes in larger/longer levels, when you only fail at the end bit, you always have to play trough the whole level again and again just to see if the last turn of the last cube works now or not... that can get a bit boring and annoying but its no biggie. still at those times ive wished there was something like a speed increase.ive paid 0.44€ for rush on a sale and i feel like i have robbed the devs. i would easily and happily pay the standard price of 4.49€ for such a game, it has entertained me for 25h now already and ive just finished the hard levels (some bonus ones coming after that).value for money = just awesome.

												A fantastic puzzle game. Don't be afraid to use a little trial-and-error to figure things out, especially in the harder puzzles (and believe me, the Hard group will kick your behind). An option to skip or fast-forward the results check would have been nice, as this can drag on a bit as you watch a parade of cubes work their way around the board, but this is just a quibble.			"

												The idea of the game is nice and everything, but the lack of proper camera control it really makes it more difficult than it should be. The puzzles are good (a bit more twisted than you can at some point think it through but most of them good). The game lacks motivation to keep it interesting and make you want to play and beat the nexts levels, I think is mostly because you dont get that rewarded feeling after you complete a puzzle, you rather feel like ""oh god finally, whats next? ohh no, just.. just... (quits the game)"". I really tried to like it and go through it but I couldn't.			"

  You'll Enjoy This Game If You Like:   Colourful, fluid design   ""Directing traffic"" puzzle games   Semi-sentient cubes   Challenging yourself The first thing I noticed about this game was the fluid motion of the cubes - there's a certain oddly satisfying feeling that it gives just simply by watching them.Gameplay is reasonably straightforward and requires you to use various objects placed on the floor to direct the cubes to their goal, making sure that none collide with each other. Initial this is a very simple task but as you get further through the levels it takes a lot of thinking, many runs through to see how the cubes behave (especially when crossing each others paths) and altering your approach bit by bit until it's perfect.Despite the difficulty later on, this game never really gets frustrating and continues to be a pleasure to play.

												A very mediocre spatial puzzle game. The difficulty of the easy and medium puzzles is incredibly low such that even a modest ability will breeze right through them - probably suitable for babby's first puzzle game. The hard puzzles tend to be more annoying than puzzling. Lots of trial and error to handle the timing to avoid collisions, instead of actually thoughtfully puzzling out non-intuitive solutions.The interface could be much better too, but I suppose at this price-point I can't hate on it too much.That said, if you can get it on a really cheap sale, which is likely, it isn't *completely* devoid of fun if you think this might be your type of game.

												Rush is a simplistic ""guide the path"" puzzle game where you place directional arrows to assist objects travelling from a source to an exit.   Nothing particularly new in this mechanism.   The game looks and feels more like a tablet game than a PC game. Kudos to the Rush team for making the simple 3D graphics engine work well on PC, with options for FSAA and so on.  Unfortunately the control interface doesn't seem to be native to PC so changing the settings provides no feedback and is somewhat frustrating.Ultimately the attention to the minimalist 3D graphics are not enough to make up for the simplistic gameplay and uncertain controls, and lack of originality.   This could be done on a web browser or in flash - there's no justification for placing the game onto the Steam marketplace and asking for cash for it.   Only for die-hard puzzle game lovers, and even then, perhaps not the top choice.			"

I'm Sick And Tired Of All These God Damn Mother ♥♥♥♥ing Cubes - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Hey there, buddy. What's your favorite shape? Is it a cube? Oh, please tell me it is. Does your favorite shape have 12 edges? 6 faces? 8 vertices? Oooooooh, it better. Because I got a nice surprise to show ya, buddy.The cubes in this game. Look at them. Just look at them. Aren't they beautiful? These cubes are glorious. God cubes, cubes beyond the wildest dreams of cube enthusiasts everywhere. These cubes are the kind of cubes our forefathers strove to perfect. The kind they fought wars over. The kind that would make a man shoot his own father and slap his mom's ♥♥♥♥♥♥s around for. These cubes are beyond the kind of cubes you might be accustomed to. These are the pinnacle of human creation.You better like these ♥♥♥♥ing cubes, because that's all you're ♥♥♥♥ing getting.I swear to ♥♥♥♥ing God that's all there is. That's all that's left. Just cubes. Cubes as far as the eyes can see, little buddy. Just lots of God damn mother ♥♥♥♥ing little piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥cubes. Wouldn't you like some? Well here, have some ♥♥♥♥ing more.Rush is a game all about cubes that you can enjoy on your PC or Wii U. Isn't that ♥♥♥♥ing great? All the cubes you could ever want. 1080p, high definition, 60 frames per mother ♥♥♥♥ing second cubes. Anti-aliasing cubes. Cubes that can make your hair grow back, help your wife rediscover what she ever found attractive in you, and fill your body with youthful vigor. They'll listen to your problems, and make everything all better. They'll even let you get it in. That's right, big boy. Those glorious edges, sides, and angles are all yours for the taking.All you need to do is tell these cubes where to go and what to do. They'll be all over it. Tell them to go left, they go left. Tell them to go right, they go right. Get your cubes to the end of the level and you win. These cubes take orders. Requests, even. Just like the middle-aged Asian lady at the tanning place. Slip her a few bucks and she'll let you into the special tanning bed out back, which is actually a couple folding chairs and a towel with some nice fluorescent lighting. But that's where the magic happens.Much like said Asian woman, these cubes don't understand English. So your only way to issue orders is through placing little tiles. And you only get so many per level. It has kind of a Chuchu Rocket or Lemmings feel. You're really not doing much. You lay the orders out for the cubes, and watch them get to work moving their sweet, sweet vertices.It's a simple puzzle game, through and through. Simple idea. Simple design. Minimalist to the end. Sure, later levels can be brutal as all puzzle games can be. But the core mechanics never change. It's always just a matter of judging three-dimensional spacing, timing, and movement. Like how a really long math problem is just a math problem that takes too long to finish so you just use a calculator because you don't want to waste your precious ♥♥♥♥ing time like this game does.Just look at how many little godforsaken cubes there are. You're moving cubes around atop cubes, using cubes to guide them to the end cubes, while cubes watch from the sidelines like some kind of barbaric cube sport amidst a sprawling cube universe. It's the geometric equivalent of white people going to their cottage up north to have board game night and watch reruns of Friends. Sickening.It's actually a pretty fun game. The puzzles are sweet and satisfying, and the art style is actually really nice. Clean, refreshing, and relaxing. And they really are the prettiest cubes you've ever seen. It's visually appealing to watch them roll around.But there's just so many ♥♥♥♥ing cubes. Too many of them. And it makes me sick. It's nauseating. Watching them squash and stretch as they roll around, like little cubes of jelly. It's ♥♥♥♥ing irritating, dude. All these happy little cubes pisses me off. Makes me ♥♥♥♥ing mad, dude.You know why they called this game Rush? Because they RUSHED to get this game out and forgot to use some actual objects instead of just cubes. Ha. Ha ha.			"

												1 word: BORING! For a game called ''rush'' this game is incredibly slow paced.The game itself has a nice idea to it, a good framerate and some good graphics so i see how some people could enjoy this game but personally ifind it too boring. This is because the game is unnecesaraly slow paced. What you do is you solve a puzzle and you are rewarded by an extremely long animation and a very robotic voice saying your praise.I'd give it a 8/10 for the right audience 2/10 for the wrong one.

												Rush is a 3D puzzle game that requires high level perception as well as cognitive thinking to solve its overabundance of puzzles. In rush you used direction tiles as well as other types to guide cubes to exits. One of the top reason to buy Rush is the fact that there is no competition in this game. There is no clock to time you, there are no scores to obtain, it’s just your mind against puzzles. All these factors combined with a very soothing tune and you’re in for a very zen-like period while playing. This game hits perfection almost everywhere, the pacing is fantastic, the controls are intuitive, and the art direction is very relevant to the game. However, the game completely lacks replayability and all the puzzles have very limited solutions. This is because each puzzles have a fixed amount of tiles and in almost every scenario in Rush, you will end up using them all. Regardless, the game is very high quality and for such a cheap price replayability is a non-issue.			"

												It looks like a nice little puzzle game, but the puzzle part itself is quite simple to solve in most levels. After which you'll spend huge amounts of time desperately rearranging the traffic sign elements to solve subtle timing issues, which lead to block collisions. Because the blocks are spawned in a different rhythm in each level, you never get a feel for it. Uninspired game, doesn't live up to its promise. I'll ask for my money back.			"

												RUSH is a puzzle game with a unique mechanic and setting. It is a world comprised entirely of blocks. The idea of the game is to redirect the various colored blocks into their respectively colored ""exit"". The main rule is if the blocks hit a wall, they will turn to the right. You must use this and many other tools to move them, turn them, stop them, speed up, slow down, or use the ""wall turn right"" mechanic to get them to the correct goal.As crazy hard as the puzzles get, they still pale in comparison to the soundtrack. It's beautiful, upbeat, and relaxing all at once. Just like I said in the title, I want this soundtrack so, so bad. In celebration to the release of Portal 2, RUSH received a few, free DLC's that featured Glados, and DAMN THEY ARE HARD! It's casual in that it's not high stress and there's no punishment for losing. You just keep going until you figure it out. You can also ask the game for a hint, or the answer itself. It's cheap, it's simple, it's relaxing. Normally I'd say this is a mobile game that needs to stay off of Steam, but if they can bring this kind of quality, then they can stay. 10/10 Because it did so well what it sought to achieve.			"

												I have to start by saying what pisses me off about this game.  This isn't a ""game"".  Its a puzzle.  You have no control over what happens.  You place tiles to route rolling blocks.  After you place them you hit GO. Pass or fail.  You just watch.  I also think the idea of re-routing rolling blocks makes for a lame puzzle.  I like a good puzzle now and then.  This one has some good brain teasers.  Nay, it has some really challenging brain tormentors.  If you buy, buy it for that reason only, because there is no other.  I wouldn't pay over 2.50 for this game.  Puzzles and puzzle ""games"" are a dime a dozen.			"

												Rush is a fun, easy to learn but difficult to master type of puzzle game in which you are given a level, certain board pieces, and tasked to guide rolling cubes to their colour-coded exit points. It goes from simple and fun to very, very challenging. The later levels are true head-scratchers and insanely difficult. But there's plenty here for puzzle-goers of all skill levels, and the two-step hint system is there to help if you really get stuck or just want a small nudge in the right direction.You can't really ask for more in a puzzle game, it does puzzles really well with catchy music, solid gameplay, and clever solutions. 9/10			"

												RUSH is one of those games that sneaks up on you in terms of difficulty. It starts out simply enough- here's some cubes, get them to the exit, here's some arrows to make them go in directions. By the time you realize it, you're threading slower-moving cubes between waves of advancing ones with precision timing, tossing cubes down holes with no visible exit, teleporting around with wild abandon, and even solving a puzzle in complete darkness (check the bonus levels, it's really there). If you like puzzle games, give this a shot, if only for the catchy soundtrack.Heck, if you're going to get it, go for the whole Two Tribes pack and enjoy Toki Tori and EDGE with it.PROS:Great soundtrackDifficulty scales up nicely over timeHints for those puzzles you just can't figure outCheapCONS:No hints for the Actual Challenge levels (but then again, this was part of the Potato Sack ARG, so that would make it too easy.)Limited replay value (unless you really want to shoot for cheevos)			"

Fair warning, it's one of those games that is frustrating as hell sometimes, it's a good thing to remember to breath while playing. You will rage quit, the music will get stuck in your head from hearing it so much, you will restart many times, just remember it's a game, your monitor will thank you for not punching a hole through it.

At the easy level I thought it a bit too easy to enjoy, but don't worry, the puzzle becomes fairly hard as the more level unlocks. I had to use some help from hints. Hints may be too strong for solving puzzles since it shows where to place arrows. You can choose whether you rush the solution or think over and struggle with it. Recommended for every puzzler.			"

												I normally don't play too many puzzle games but RUSH is a solid 8.5/10 in my book.The difficulty of some of the levels is high but it's worth it when you eventually see the blocks all move correctly. The music is pretty well suited to the game as well, it has a good beat to it. The only complaint would be like others have said and that's the fact that a number of achievements are not possible anymore or restricted to certain months. Other then that however, I'd strongly suggest you pick up this game, especially considering the price ($5.49 CAD at time of writing). That being said, you could probably wait for a sale and grab it for under $2. Either way it's a great deal!			"

												If anyone remembers Chu Chu Rocket for the Dreamcast, then RUSH plays in a similar fashion: You guide colored cubes to their respective exits by placing directional switches on the field without having the cubes bump into each other or driving them off the playing area.While the concept may sound simple enough, the difficulty is all in the level design. In order to successfully pass the later levels, one must master the nuances of the cubes movements as it interects with the directional tiles and field obstacles as a majority of the puzzles require the user to time the cubes actions accordingly.All in all, it's a fun little game for the brain.

It has a similar emphasis as the former on what's essentially visual programming, and also features the latter's basic gameplay mechanic of cubes rolling around on a 3-dimensional playing field. The result is an enjoyable puzzle game that can keep you occupied for hours. While the puzzles are much less open-ended than the ones in SpaceChem and thus provide less replay value, the solutions can, at times, provide considerable satisfaction from just looking at them, with large numbers of colourful cubes rolling around in sync with each other. Recommended for all puzzle game fans.			"

												This is a decent puzzle game. It's not amazing but not terrible either. The difficulty curve is smooth, maybe too smooth. The puzzles are fair and get really challenging towards the end. Too bad the music and art is so bland, this game is seriously lacking soul.But whatever, it's 50 cent during sales, so you get some really good value for your money.			"

												This is a really fun puzzle game that feels very interactive without actually requiring any realtime (""just in time"") changes. Nice and relaxed. Plan; test. Plan; test. The feeling of getting it right on your first try is immensely satisfying, and when it's hard, the feeling of FINALLY getting it right is even more satisfying.The difficulty ramps up smoothly here, but only a few levels will really frustrate you to a raging fit. The levels have clever design, the visuals look awesome, and the sounds and music are perfect. Definitely worth picking up at full price.			"

												Rush is an interesting little puzzle game where you guide repeatedly spawning cubes to their same colored destination.  Your only form of control over the blocks is to place commands on squares that the cubes will follow.  At the beginning of a puzzle you are given a set of commands to place and must guide the blocks to their destination without them falling off the edge, crashing into walls, or other blocks which you are trying to get to their destination.  While you have as much time as you want before the blocks start rolling (don't ask me how), once they start going you cannot guide them anymore.  While many of the puzzles are at first insultingly easy (first world, doesn't take long), later puzzles will make you think really hard and will cause a true feeling of accomplishment when completed.

												In my oppinion Rush is not a good game I would even say it is a bad game (remember this is my own oppinion) it does challange you to think but only for a little bit, and you can even use hints and go back when you know how to do the level without hints. Unless you like games where you direct cubes to a hole I do not recommend you buy this game, try the demo first, but don't expect very much.			"

												I love puzzle games, but this one's not for everyone.After the greatly enjoyable easy and medium levels, you're graced with the irritating hard mode difficulty. I felt that solving a lot of the problems didn't involve skill but continuous trial and error.  It ended up overstaying its visit and without tools like slowing down, pausing, or many ways to see what went wrong. In the end, it means you're shuffling tiles, clicking the go button, and then trying agian.But that's not where my big complaint is. It has a ""Beat the level for me"" button. If you're stuck, press the hint button. Go on, there's no repurcussion. In fact, click it as many times  as you want. It'll solve the level for you with enough clicks. This might sound like a good thing, but it makes solving a puzzle so unsatisfying. You work for an answer that you can get the same results from just letting the game tell you were to put it all. And (outside of achievements) There's 0 drawbacks. In a game that gives you few tools to diagnose your problem, it puts a bandaid on a bullet wound by solving the problem for you.My last complaint is that it's just so heartless. Until you get to the glados levels (which are the best part of the game that remove the F***it button and add some flavor to the game) You're playing a game about cubes. Emotionless, boring, cop-out cubes. Minimalistic? Yes. But like modern art, if I have no reason to be interested in these cubes, they're just cubes. I'm just solving puzzles and not engaged with anything put on the screen. It's a very subjective opinion, though. If you're here for puzzles more than engagement, you'll probably like it.All in all, it's a great game that spikes in difficulty a little too quick and with a few too many tools to help you figure out problems. If you enjoy games that require 1 answer, don't mind cubes, you'll probably enjoy this game. Otherwise you may want to look elsewhere.			"

												RUSH charges you with placing all manner of signs and directions in order to guide trains of moving cubes from Point A to Point B. So in other words, it's a laid back puzzle game. Admittedly, I'm very bad at puzzle games, either out of impatience or stupidity. I made it all the way through the medium puzzles before having to walkthrough the rest of the game. That said, the puzzles are complex and rewarding, as you get to watch a colorful show of cubes after cracking a puzzle. The game really encourages a ""trial and error"" approach to puzzle solving, allowing you to tweak your solution until it finally works. It doesn't punish you for a wrong solution.While this type of puzzle design is nice, it's not very well-accomodated. If you want to test your solution, you have to run it from the very beginning, rather than being able to jump to a certain moment like a simulation. This also means messing around with the awkward camera controls. The overall visual design is bright, and some levels can take up the entire screen, making viewing a level with ease damn near impossible. Not that it hinders your ability to solve puzzles unless the game throws really complex structures at you, but it makes debugging your solution and observing the level a little more uncomfortable than it should be.RUSH's simplistic visuals may be a turn-off for some, but hey, it's a puzzle game. You add onto it some stellar music and a wide variety of puzzles and gizmos, and you've got a game worthy of any puzzle addict's collection. Unless you're feeble-minded, like me.			"

												A quality puzzle game that requires thoughtful consideration without ever becoming frustrating. The solutions are often not obvious, but they are always logical, which is key to making sure that each puzzle is satisfying to solve. Excellent visuals (for the minimalistic style), great presentation, and a catchy soundtrack make this game a complete package, and a real steal at $4.99.			"

												Great puzzler with a moderate difficulty level. Your task is to use a limited resource of different ""direction""-plates to steer a number of spawned rolling cubes through a level. No time limits, just thinking and trying out.I like the rhythms the rolling cubes produce once you start the chain reaction, every level sounds like a unique little symphony. As I'm not a hardcore fan of the puzzle genre, I can recommend this game for every casual puzzle gamer.			"

												RUSH charges you with placing all manner of signs and directions in order to guide trains of moving cubes from Point A to Point B. So in other words, it's a laid back puzzle game. Admittedly, I'm very bad at puzzle games, either out of impatience or stupidity. I made it all the way through the medium puzzles before having to walkthrough the rest of the game. That said, the puzzles are complex and rewarding, as you get to watch a colorful show of cubes after cracking a puzzle. The game really encourages a ""trial and error"" approach to puzzle solving, allowing you to tweak your solution until it finally works. It doesn't punish you for a wrong solution.While this type of puzzle design is nice, it's not very well-accomodated. If you want to test your solution, you have to run it from the very beginning, rather than being able to jump to a certain moment like a simulation. This also means messing around with the awkward camera controls. The overall visual design is bright, and some levels can take up the entire screen, making viewing a level with ease damn near impossible. Not that it hinders your ability to solve puzzles unless the game throws really complex structures at you, but it makes debugging your solution and observing the level a little more uncomfortable than it should be.RUSH's simplistic visuals may be a turn-off for some, but hey, it's a puzzle game. You add onto it some stellar music and a wide variety of puzzles and gizmos, and you've got a game worthy of any puzzle addict's collection. Unless you're feeble-minded, like me.			"

												I'm a big fan of puzzle games and this one kept me going for a while! It's all trial and error because you have to set all your tiles ahead of time and then see how it plays out. When it doesn't, you slump your shoulders and sigh, but when it does, it's poetry in motion! I love watching the colorful little blocks wibble their way home! I'd suggest it to folks who enjoy games with puzzles and bright colors and adorable rolling jelly blocks! Watch those later puzzles, though, they can get tough.			"

It may not be as visually interesting as ""Cogs"" but don't let that fool you.  ""Cogs"" uses its visuals to distract from the fact that every puzzle contained within is essentially a tile sliding puzzle.  Once you have mastered one, you have mastered them all.  ""Rush"" however gives you a simple set of rules that, when combined, lead to some complex puzzles.  The result is a much more enjoyable game experience.			"

												This one's quite a good little puzzler. It's from the guys that made Toki Tori (also awesome) and, to describe it like most media outlets, it's Chu Chu Rocket with cubes. You place pieces such as arrows, conveyor belts, stop signs and so on to guide blocks to their respective endpoints. Like all good puzzle games it starts of easy and get's fairly hard. The trial and error nature of the game gets a little frustrating and I found myself abusing the hint system far too much (with no real disadvantage to using it, why not?) That said, this was perfectly priced at only $5 and I'd love to see more puzzlers like this released at a cheaper price. The devs have been releasing bonus levels every week or so and (I think) a level editor is planned.			"

												For a puzzle game, it can be difficult if you choose not to use any of the hints, which is a good thing for people who love to solve puzzles.  However, if you're not adept at puzzle games, the hints are always available to you.  This is a great game where you won't become too frustrated, but will definitely make you scratch your head and think, so long as you don't spam the hint buttons. I highly reccomend it. Loads of fun, and can be played in short bursts, one or two levels at a time.			"

												A delightful puzzler at an excellent price tag ($5 or less in sales), Rush is an excellent indie take on Sonic Team's Chu Chu Rocket. While it doesn't shoot for the same cutesy aesthetics Rocket did or include any means of multiplayer at this time it is a homage to the tile dropping puzzle solving fun that the Dreamcast classic would be proud of. Puzzles play out in 3D with a few more rules and tools than CCR, so Two Tribes didn't shy away from adding to the formula in this worthwhile puzzler.			"

												A good way to describe RUSH would be to say that it's a cross between SpaceChem and EDGE (except, of course, that it predates both of those games). It has a similar emphasis as the former on what's essentially visual programming, and also features the latter's basic gameplay mechanic of cubes rolling around on a 3-dimensional playing field. The result is an enjoyable puzzle game that can keep you occupied for hours. While the puzzles are much less open-ended than the ones in SpaceChem and thus provide less replay value, the solutions can, at times, provide considerable satisfaction from just looking at them, with large numbers of colourful cubes rolling around in sync with each other. Recommended for all puzzle game fans.			"

												Decently fun puzzle game with good music and aesthetics, though the puzzles don't start becoming hard or interesting until you get halfway through the 'hard' level set. It's an interesting twist on the 'logic maze' type of game where instead of guiding a single cube around, you have to herd waves of cubes to their exit points. There aren't terrain-based obstacles of any sort but the cubes themselves end up becoming obstacles for each other.Most of the hard puzzles will only take you maybe 10-15 minutes on average.GLaDOS makes a guest appearance in the game (though not much of one) later on, though I don't find her lines particularly well written.

												A perfect puzzle game. There are 4 simple rules: Get the blocks from where they appear to where they need to end up. If a block hits a wall, it turns 90 degrees. If a block rolls over an instruction tile you've placed down, it will follow that instruction. If a block is obstructed or falls off the map, then the game stops and you have to rethink what you're doing. Very simple mechanics mean the game is easily learned but by adding more layers, more blocks moving in parallel, and complex criss-crossing paths, the game gradually ramps up the difficulty until the hardest levels become a complex choreography of colours dancing all over the play area. The visual and audio design is crisp and clean: enough to get the core mechanics of the game across to the player, nothing to distract away from the gameplay, while looking and sounding great too.

												Really good game! The visuals are stunning and very pretty indeed, I loved how colourful the game was. The difficulty curve of the puzzles is really well designed as some of the puzzles are a bit tricky, but you do find the answer eventually! This type of game is really great if you are the type of person who likes organisation and seeing that things are in the right place!Also the music is very funky! Liked it a lot!			"

												These were the same guys who made EDGE, right? So, why does this game feel less fun? Honestly, the style of this game feels like it'd better suit a micromanager than someone like me, who likes to go with the flow and adjust when necessary. The puzzles are baffling, and a challenge, but I personally think it'd be better if the game let you personally control the blocks like in EDGE. But that would ruin the gameplay, I know. Between EDGE, where I had loads of fun, and RUSH, where I didn't have as much fun (but was well-challenged), I'd much rather play EDGE. But if you're more of a puzzle-gamer, RUSH is perfect for you.			"

												Decently fun puzzle game with good music and aesthetics, though the puzzles don't start becoming hard or interesting until you get halfway through the 'hard' level set. It's an interesting twist on the 'logic maze' type of game where instead of guiding a single cube around, you have to herd waves of cubes to their exit points. There aren't terrain-based obstacles of any sort but the cubes themselves end up becoming obstacles for each other.Most of the hard puzzles will only take you maybe 10-15 minutes on average.GLaDOS makes a guest appearance in the game (though not much of one) later on, though I don't find her lines particularly well written.

												I normally don't play too many puzzle games but RUSH is a solid 8.5/10 in my book.The difficulty of some of the levels is high but it's worth it when you eventually see the blocks all move correctly. The music is pretty well suited to the game as well, it has a good beat to it. The only complaint would be like others have said and that's the fact that a number of achievements are not possible anymore or restricted to certain months. Other then that however, I'd strongly suggest you pick up this game, especially considering the price ($5.49 CAD at time of writing). That being said, you could probably wait for a sale and grab it for under $2. Either way it's a great deal!			"

												A great, clever game where you try and lead rolling cubes to their destination using a set of given tiles to change their directions. It starts off easy and gets very hard indeed! The game makes you think logically about each situation, but later on sometimes you'll have to think illogically/out of the box to solve the diabolical puzzles!Great fun and the absence of a timer means you can take your time to decide how you're going to solve the problems. 100% recommended for puzzle fans.

												A perfect puzzle game. There are 4 simple rules: Get the blocks from where they appear to where they need to end up. If a block hits a wall, it turns 90 degrees. If a block rolls over an instruction tile you've placed down, it will follow that instruction. If a block is obstructed or falls off the map, then the game stops and you have to rethink what you're doing. Very simple mechanics mean the game is easily learned but by adding more layers, more blocks moving in parallel, and complex criss-crossing paths, the game gradually ramps up the difficulty until the hardest levels become a complex choreography of colours dancing all over the play area. The visual and audio design is crisp and clean: enough to get the core mechanics of the game across to the player, nothing to distract away from the gameplay, while looking and sounding great too.

												RUSH is, with ease, one of my favorite puzzle games. It brings nothing groundbreaing to the table, but it has no major flaws and avoids most things I don't like in a puzzle game, the biggest one being time constraints. It's a basic game where you direct the paths of cubes in a 3d enviroment, guiding them to a path and preventing collision. The wall mechanic is a clever addition that gives the little extra depth to push it over the top, adding an unexpected level of complexity. I like the graphical choices they have made a lot, and there is enough puzzles to keep you playing for a while. The difficulty of the levels vary a lot, and should have something that will challenge anyone. There is a group requirement to access the bonus levels, which is something I'm not terribly fond of, but the rest of the game is stellar. The music is also great.			"

												RUSH is a 3D puzzle game about ""pathing"":  blocks spawn and automatically move straight ahead, and directional floor tiles must be strategically placed to change the blocks' direction and guide them to the exit.  It starts off easy but gets hard fast, quickly making use of its third dimension and adding other complicating elements like multiple block colors with multiple exits and block-on-block collision.  There's plenty of levels at all difficulties and each one puts their own flavor on the same problem.  Hints are available on most levels for those that want just a little help without getting spoiled; a courteous feature.  Overall a challenging puzzle experience that doesn't overcomplicate things with too many bells and whistles.			"
