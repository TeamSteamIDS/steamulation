												They definitely learned from the first one on many things. For starters the campaign, once you complete a mission you can go back to it any time to get a higher score or the secondary or hidden objective. The speed up button, unlike the first game it actually speeds things up, and makes that 40 waves go by so much quicker. The addition of other weapons were sorely needed, I found the bombs most useful, but the flamethrower is great as well. The dig in featue is great, but not for every situation. Unlike last time, because of being able to play any mission completed in the campaign there is no quick play. Instead you get 2 Bonus missions which are cool but not a big deal.I rated the first one 5/10. This is definitly the better overall game. It feels like they tried to boil down what they wanted  tower defence to be and refine it from the first one. 7/10 only because I feel there isn't much long term replay grab it if it goes on sale			"

												A simple and honest Tower Defense game, and that's it.It has good upgrades and a great variety of levels (desert, forest and water ones), and also have some pretty decent sort of enemies types.The gameplay is simple but it has always a second objective to reach, and it is very fun to play to complete all the goals.The sound effects could be better but the real problem is the music... It is so annoying... I played the whole time listen to my own soundtrack or podcasts.In the end, I recommend only for those who enjoy tower defense games (and for the ones with a Spotify/Deezer/Apple Music/Whatever account LOL).

												This is an average tower defense, for 1.25€ it was an OK game.If it is above the average free browser TD, it's way below the best PC game in the genre like Defense Grid or Plant vs Zombie.On most levels you cannot build paths with your towers and are limited to a few emplacements. And with only 7 tower types, some of which are only unlocked in the 2nd half of the campaign. This gives for little variations and low replayability.Basically you use similar tactics on most levels.There are a few neat ideas, the campaign plot which follow the historical events, perks, customizable towers, surprise events. But in the end they didn't add that much.15 hours to complete the campaign on medium difficulty. Hard difficulty don't add much.With all perks unlocked, the game balance is partly broken. And with the proper perks replaying the campaign on hard was actually easier than the first playthrough on medium difficulty.Decent for a low price but there are much better TDs available.			"

												This game is a hidden jewel. People that go to the store page, may think: ""Woah, mobile game on steam, so sad"", but the truth is, I didn't have much fun with a game since months ago.The game starts with a simple map, your base on one side, and enemies that come from the top. A quick tutorial reveals that you have to put different types of turrets, upgrade them, sell them if necessary, and defend your base. Seems easy, doesn't it?You only have 2 turrets in the early levels, but as you proceed, you unlock more turrets. At the end of each game, you're assigned Victory Points depending on how good your performance was, and Perks, depending if you fulfilled the requeriments for one. With the victory points, you improve the level of upgrades of each turret, and when one is fully upgraded, you have the ability for 40 victory points to specialize that turret, making it more utile depending on what you choose. Regarding the perks, well, you have 3 types of perks, and as you unlock them, you put the ones that fit you the best.The difficulty of the game is HARD. The first levels are kind of easy, but after some time, you will most likely get stressed at how screwed you are, that's when the Rewind option comes in hand. Basically, you have a rewind that you can use at the round you want, to start again that round, and delete everything you did, and the enemy did, that exact round. If you use it, you have to wait 3 more rounds until you can use it again.This game is a fun little game, great for killing time, and for improving your strategies. I do recommend this game!P.S: I got it for free thanks to Indie Gala, you only have to put your email, and you receive the code of the game for free, but I suggest buying it to support the developers!

												iBomber Defense Pacific, which I assume to be sort of follow up to iBomber Defense, continues the tradition of producing an incredibly bland and uninspired game though unlike the original this one does have some upsides to it. The first thing you probably notice is that you now have slightly more choices to make than simply where to place your turrets down. Turrets have been given the ""Dig-In"" ability which gives them increased range and firepower but limits them to a very narrow arc of fire. This is a good idea in principle but in reality all it means is that you will spend most of your time simply rotating the turret so it can fire on all enemies. Also a new addition is an ability building that allows you to drop bombs on your enemies and while this also is a nice improvement that gives you something to do while waiting for money to build up it has little impact on the gameplay. Perhaps the biggest improvement is the inclusion of a interest system. By building Radar Stations, this game's equivalent of a boost turret, you earn a little extra income each wave depending on how much money you have. This is a nice addition that encourages minimalistic builds and opens up multiple tactics for you to choose on the harder difficulties. Where iBomber Defense was the bare bones of a tower defense game Pacific manages to be the bare bones of a tower defense game with the bare bones of every tower defense gimmick out there except for a 3D FPS option tacked on. All the additions are nice and were solely needed but none of them are really added in properly and you still play the game feeling like you might as well be playing it in a browser. Although iBomber Defense Pacific is great improvement over the original it is still a game you play wondering what it's doing on the PC.			"

												I tend to hate TD games. But I'll remain unbiased in this review.This game is alright. I enjoyed playing it at least.It's a pretty decent port.The HUD is pretty clean except for the big icons for towers, they seem to be way to big and cover the entire bottom right of the screen.The options for the game are pretty bare bones. Volume controls for music and SFX only. There is a total of 22 campaign levels with 2 bonus levels. Each level can be played on either easy, normal or hard. There are also 4 challenges on each level. There is a somewhat decent amount of content.You'll most likely enjoy this game if you like TD games.			"

												OH SNAP MICROMANAGEMENT ORGY! This is a sick and twisted expansion to what was a masochistic, tedious, uninspired, and broken original. Like extreme micromanagement and clicking 6000 times per level? This might be your thing, if you also enjoy ""connecting the dots"" of the ""strategy"" the fools that made this rubbish desire. This game requires no strategy whatsoever, it's purely a puzzle tower defense where you have to build the right sequence of towers at the right times and in the right places, but now the expansion introduces a twist: NOW YOU HAVE TO CLICK ON THE RIGHT PART OF THE SCREEN AT THE RIGHT TIME TOO!! Seriously, who thought it was a good idea to add repetitive micro to this linear slog? The art style and presentation is hugely improved from the original game but the core gameplay is as broken, linear, and rubbish as ever.			"

												Tower defence games are plentiful, both paid versions and free flash games.iBomber Defence Pacific does not do anything one of the free ones doesn't do better.The most interesting concept it has is that some of the levels are revisited, with your existing defences still in place, for a second round where you usually fight a new type of threat in conjunction to the first set (e.g. an air raid).If you're looking for a good tower defence game on Steam instead go for the utterly amazing Defender's Quest or the huge and innovative Creeper World 3. If you're looking for a simple tower defence game just go to an online portal like Kongregate and search for Tower Defence games there.This game doesn't do anything wrong, it just fails to do anything special.

												9.0/10 - Strong Land and Sea Tower Defense!I love Tower Defense games and have played so many! My current gold standard for Tower Defense is Pixel Junk Monsters; this game isn't too far off that mark! I would have loved to see some online coop with this game, but the maps are well done and sometimes really challenging. The upgrades allow you to ""dig in"" which allows you to manually adjust the cannon or actively direct it. This keeps you on your toes and causes you to make some tough decisions.As you level and conquer the extensive map you can rank up which is pretty fun since this is a war game! Tons of levels and achievements are available. If you like tower defense this is a must grab.Worth the $5. I'm looking forward to putting more time into this title!

												The game is tower defense mobile port. The plus side it doesn't show its roots as a mobile port like other games and it seems they put some effort in the port.It has a decent tower variety and it has some interesting mechanics. It has a decent level design and my minor complaint is that some of the places that you can put towers aren't properly highlighted. The reason that I'm not recomending this game is because for me to recommend a tower defence it needs to be innovative in some way and this game is just competent.			"

												I normally dont complain about 5 dollar games......but, there is way to much random stuff happening around the map making it impossible to strategize on a first play through.

This alone ruined the game for me! As far as gameplay goes, I have no complaints. I love the upgrade and level system, as well as the graphics and sounds.			"

												iBomber Defense Pacific begrudgingly earns a thumbs up from me even though a ""meh"" would probably be more appropriate. The game is tower defense game ported from mobile platforms. It takes place in the pacific theater in WW2 where you fight the Japanese in land, air and sea battles. There are predetermined spots in each level where you can place defenses to repel the enemy forces (kind of like Kingdom Rush, but usually with greater concentration of hardpoints).First the positives. The game is probably the most strategic tower defense game I have played. There are inter dependencies between the turrets so you probably want to place them in certain configurations to maximize your income and/or damage output. So also need to pick from various perks (Fallout'esqe) and turret upgrades so your strategy on a given level can potentially change based on that. The game also lets you fast forward time and pause it if you wish; if you pause the game, which is slightly unconventional, you can redirect your turrets adding a strategic element (ie, ""micro"") that many other titles lack.As for the negatives, the graphics are somewhat bland, but I guess acceptable. I found it really hard to tell the difference between enemy units so it is sometimes tough to prepare sufficiently until your turrets have engaged the enemy. My bigger gripe is that this game is $4.99 on steam vs $1.99 on the Play store. Why the PC gamer gouging that seems so prevalent with mobile game developers? Sick of these companies who do a PC release as an afterthought and still charge a big premium. "

												iBomber Defense Pacific is a perfectly average TD game. It has all the basic TD elements you'd expect and no more. It's ported from mobile devices, so it's not as pretty as say, Defense Grid, but that doesn't matter much. The UI is simple, since it was designed to be touch controls, but it works perfectly fine on PC. It's not great, it doesn't do anything new, it's not pretty and you won't remember anything about it in a year's time. That said, it satisfies one's TD needs. If you're jonesing for some TD and don't have any other TD games to play (yeah, right), this is an adequate way to scratch that itch.Note: Just because this is a mobile game, doens't mean it's easy. I got my balls stomped many times because I was only half-paying attention. 5+ restarts per level should be expected (or maybe I'm just terrible at TD).			"

												Kind of an expansion for iBomber Defense despite being packaged standalone.It changes up things a bit and gets some things right, but goes back some steps in other places.In Pacific, when you select a turret to place an overlay appears showing valid positions.  This was the most annoying thing missing from the original.Pacific is a lot easier than the original too and many levels can be done with little thought except to start racking up interest asap and spamming bomb towers (which IMO are overpowered or at least the game is not well balanced with their introduction).Overall, still good fun tower defense, but not necessarily better than the original - just different.

												This is a simple but fun tower defense game. Gameplay is similar to the previous game in the series, iBomber Defense, but several improvements have been made.The biggest criticism with the previous game is that gameplay became stale after 40 or so waves in a single level, and some levels were too similar to others. But in iBomber Defense Pacific there are usually only 20 or so waves per level, and each level is quite different making for better variety in gameplay.Also, there are now secondary objectives, like having to defend an oil refinery, or having to destroy enemy bunkers. Completing secondary objectives is optional but doing so earns you points to buy upgrades. To keep things fresh now you sometimes have to deal with enemy units that aren't rushing your base! Yes, sometimes enemy units will come out onto the battlefield and start shooting it out with your turrets. This becomes especially tricky if you're trying to defend a secondary objective: Should you put your limited resources into defending your base or defending the secondary objective? Another improvement is that now you can drop bombs on the battlefield. Bombs are a limited use item that are gradually replenished over time. Since you'll only get a few you need to make sure each one counts. Should you use them to thin out the ranks of the baddies rushing your base? Use them to blow open supply crates to get extra resources? Use them to kill that enemy battleship that's parked outside the range of your turrets? Use them to destroy a target to complete a secondary objective? Use them to destroy the secret enemy base hidden in most levels to get bonus upgrade points? Or just start randomly dropping them on buildings to revel in sheer destruction? There are a ton of tactical choices to make!If you like tower defense games you owe it to yourself to check out iBomber Defense Pacific!			"

												I like this game.Being that its a converted iPad game I didn't have high expectations for it. You know how those usually go, cash shop hack job that is more focused on extracting money from your wallet than it is about entertaining you, so when iBomber Defense looked and played like a fully fleshed out game I was pleasantly surprised.Now this is a tower defense game and it is very important I get this out of the way now. Their are 2 types of tower defense games; the 'do it your way' kind where you have total freedom to mix and match your towers as the game can be beaten in multiple styles or their is, 'do it our way' kind where each stage only has one solution and you need to figure it out and this game is surprisingly both. On the lowest setting you can get away with duct taping your way through stages but if you bump the difficulty up then each stage only has one possible solution to it.I think its a fair balance, not every game can be Kingdom Rush (which I think is an amazing TD game) although I personally hate the ones with only one solution because its more like a puzzle game at that point and thier are plenty of good puzzle games I would rather play than a TD game pretending to be one.Personal genre gripes aside iBomber was clearly designed with gameplay first. You can even move the title screen about like in Super Mario 64. When did games stop being like this and remembering games are supposed to be fun? Instead they all take themselves super serious and end up a buggy mess on release instead.Storyline is WW2 but really its just an excuse plot. WW2 is as easy to pick of the shelf and use as a storyline as elves, dwarfs and cyberpunk but it gets the job done. Sound effects, yeah they exist. Okay they are fine, a bomb sounds like a bomb and a turret sounds like a turret what more do you want?Music? Strangely absent or turned so low (by default) that it seems absent. I honestly don't recall hearing any music at all but it wasn't until I started writing this review that I even noticed, maybe because I was too busy having fun.I recommend this game and if you like TD games like Kingdom Rush(as you should, because its great!) then you will enjoy this game. it even has the 'specialize your turrets' tech tree. I tried it with touchscreen but oddly that didn't work out very well as the screen is just a bit too small for the delcate precision it requests of the user and I often accidently bombed my own turrets too many times so switched back to mouse input.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												Great game !! One of the best tower defense games out there.Well thought in-game strategy, requires some well thought placement of turrets  .. spend your ressources right and things will start to heat up.Nice graphics too and over all great gaming experience. This game is cheap and well worth it's money.You can have more than 10 hours of good clean fun (on veteran difficulty) for the price of a hamburger.I highly recommend it.			"

												Yet another Tower Defense game and i belive there are more to come!Ibomber Defense Pacific is a Typical TD game and a sequal from the Ibomber franchise (which i have had the pleasure of not playing). I cant realy tell whats so amazing and diffrent from other TD games but it is a Solid TD Game.The Mechanic in the game is no more than place diffrent tower with diffrent specific skills to prevent enemys from reaching your Base! The towers you get to Place is the Turret a fast shooting but low dmg output, The Cannon with long range and heavy damage but slow, We got the bomb tower which slowly generate bombs that you can drop anywhere on the map, The Flamethrower who burns and slows enemys. The Comm's towers who increases the range of other towers and provides extra income.the Missile tower who shoots medium hige damage in an area (works best in straight lines). and the last tower the Anti Air tower.During the Missions or maps you can complete secondary objectives often killing crates or buildings on the map or defend specific objects! After the mission is complete you are awarded with points which you use to uppgrade your tower. you get more points if you complete the secondary objective and/or if you dont leak and all your towers survived.There is also a Level progression in the game where you earn some xp after each mission, the only important thing about this is that you can unlock some perks to your own benefit. The game alows you to use up to 3 perks, the perks can increase your starting money of each level or boost the defense of your tower etc. it does help sometimes and it gives you a reason to continue play to advance in rank and increase score.The Whole Game is good for an TD and the difficult level is well balanced through the game, but i dont think it is an amazing game.. the game whould be good on a mobile phone to kill time when your not close to your PC.I would rate this game 4/10... i dont like TD games!

												If you like tower defense games, this one has some novel features in it. Gameplay is extremely fun. You fend off attack waves from ground, air, and water.. Some of the cool features in this game are that there are more than one route that the enemy travels to get to you, forcing you to focus on choke points first and develop out from there. There are bonuses to blow up on the map, including secrets. All units can be developed into beefier units, but also include a feature called 'Dig In' - this allows you to opt out of 360 degree attack capabilities for a cone of attack, but with greater range. You can build bomb towers to give you bombs that can work on land or water. You can construct support towers that extend the range of units in their area of effect. There are ambush attacks and other special combat scenarios, such as enemy return fire that make the game more than just a straight tower defense game. You earn points to increase maximum capability from your towers at the end of the round, depending on how well you do, PLUS you earn perks as rewards for things like 'number of bullets spent' or 'number of times you repair'.. all of these perk progressions are tracked so you can see how far along you are until the next unlock. All in all, I would have to say this is a great little tower defense game and I picked it up for $2. Awesome!			"

												Like ""iBomber Defense"" i thoroughly enjoy these sweet Tower Defense games. It's deliciously difficult, which makes you return every day for a tower-dose.This time around in the ""Pacific"" edition, some new game-mechanics are introduced like the Player Rank part, that lets you gain awesome perks as you do well on the regular missions. Together with the Tower specialization options when towers are fully upgraded it all gives you nice personal feel to how you like to play.The bonus missions are fun, with huge open fields you place towers on to make a maze for the enemy, much like ""Robo Defense"" on Android phones.Of course i would like more then one campaign, but at the low price i'm overall quite pleased with the game and can reccomend it to all Tower-Defense lovers!

Except: The menus and the game interface itself don't register a click unless you click in EXACTLY the right place. *sigh* Allright. I've played games with this problem before. You just have to learn exactly where to click, and after ten minutes it's second nature.But wait. We're not done yet. I go to click ""upgrade"" on a turret, and instead my turret gets ""sold."" Nope.

												I seem to enjoy this more than other tower defence games. I think it was originally developed for touch-screen phones and i think they would be the ideal platform for this game but it also crosses over well to the pc and is easy to control.It uses a system of gaining xp points to spend on upgrading your unit types and you can also unlock 'perks' which can give a bonus  to  different elements of your defences.Also includes a 'one-off' rewind feature which takes you back to the start of the current round when you make a total balls-up of it.The only annoying thing is the relentless loud explosions which mean i need to turn the volume down or else i get grief from the wife but the sound effects in general are pretty good.This is recommended because it  can run well on my netbook and is quite addictive when aiming for that 'perfect' round and extra xp points.As a simple Tower Defence game this title is one of the better ones and has been well made and offers some depth and strategy. If i ever i get round to buying myself another mobile phone i'll definetly be buying this again.( i could explain why i don't use a mobile phone any more but this aint the place for that!)			"

												A fairly straightforward tower defense game.  The highlight is the upgrade system.  Each tower type can get 4 upgrades that carry through, and then 3 levels up upgrade during each map.  There are also perks that you earn and choose as you level up.  There are bombs in this one, which adds a fun and active element to each level.  The maps get longer and harder, and even on the easiest difficulty I found myself getting frustrated, so at 3 hrs in, I am taking an indefinite break.			"

												Funny little game, well worth it for 4.- Euro. Be aware though that the game is VERY casual, so even if you play on hard it will be very easy aside from 2-3 situations.You can go and hunt for perfect runs though and that gives sort of a challenge. Towers are thought trough and settings are lovely made. There's not many enemies though.Would recommend Space Run over this one for a more challenging and a bit different tower defense. Once you have that one done I'd go for this one. Would buy again.			"

												Good game nope levels get rapidly harder faster than than peter north while filming. Even on rookie mode good luck with this game, it becomes virtually impossible and down right frustrating and boring. If it wasn't so hard it would be a decent defense game, and it's not that I'm bad at the game or something, no. This game is just ruthlessly hard regardless of difficulty setting, and I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody because of it.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this gameALSO NOTE: If I (the reviewer) have played a game that has less than 1 hour of gameplay and is recommended, means that I did not enjoy it but it passed a bit of my level of expectations! Think twice before buying/playing this game(This only applies to some games that have been recommended, not all, please read above before reading the review below) iBomber Defense Pacific is a basic tower defense game, nothing unique or special, but still provides hours of fun if you are into tower defense games.For a mobile game, it's a pretty decent port. The HUD is pretty clean except for the big icons for towers, they seem to be way too big and cover the entire bottom right hand side of the screen. The options for the game are pretty bare bones.Now to the recommendation, for its full price, I would not recommend it, BUT if it is either in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game like I got it then I would recommend it. RECOMMENDED :)  Provided it is in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game, otherwise...  NOT RECOMMENDED :(  For its full price  "

												Talk about a terrible TD game. They try so hard to be different in all the wrong ways like being able to damage your own turrets with the only map wide weapon, bombs. So the turrets that are already very expensive cost a ton to keep active because enemies dmg them as well so you can not upgrade them when you need to because the income per unit is also very low. So maybe you use bombs to try to help your struggling turrets but if you do the bombs will dmg them as well as the enemy making the repair more expensive then the income.   This game is terribly unbalanced and I would not recommend it.			"

												A big improvement over the first game, but as a result it's stupidly easy.  It has some new options, new guns, but it has a feature to ""dig in"" your turrets which makes they way too powerful.  As a result, the exact same strategy worked for every stage, so in the end became incredibly more easy than its predecessor.  7/10Better than average, I suppose.			"

Ansich ein sehr gelungenes Spiel, für Leute die wenig Zeit haben ideal !English : This game is in between times a very good alternative.

												I seem to enjoy this more than other tower defence games. I think it was originally developed for touch-screen phones and i think they would be the ideal platform for this game but it also crosses over well to the pc and is easy to control.It uses a system of gaining xp points to spend on upgrading your unit types and you can also unlock 'perks' which can give a bonus  to  different elements of your defences.Also includes a 'one-off' rewind feature which takes you back to the start of the current round when you make a total balls-up of it.The only annoying thing is the relentless loud explosions which mean i need to turn the volume down or else i get grief from the wife but the sound effects in general are pretty good.This is recommended because it  can run well on my netbook and is quite addictive when aiming for that 'perfect' round and extra xp points.As a simple Tower Defence game this title is one of the better ones and has been well made and offers some depth and strategy. If i ever i get round to buying myself another mobile phone i'll definetly be buying this again.( i could explain why i don't use a mobile phone any more but this aint the place for that!)			"

												Good enough game, Takes about 6 hours to complete all stages, doesnt offer many weapons or a large variety of enemies, also lacks storyline but gameplay is pretty solid, is quite enjoyable game. Would like to have seen a bigger change somewhere in the game to keep it from becoming to repetitive but it does alright with its slow pace. Not the worst tower defense game ive played but certanly not the best. Still dont really get the tower upgrades since it doesnt show statistics for towers which i would of liked to have known rather then just having to assume they are stronger and assume which towers do more damage.
