												EDIT May 30/2015: Unfortunately, it seems the population has bottomed out, and the developers have abandoned the game. Very strategy-rich game, has lots of potential. Units have their own skill/spell tree, different combat interactions like parrying counterattacks dodging riposte, many atrributes and active or passive effects you have to all take into account throughout battle. Lots more classes/units planned as far as I saw on their wiki. Recommend to turn-based/strategy fans. It is not pay-to-win, since you get matched based on your army level - have a stronger army, then you face stronger armies. Don't have many criticisms, its already pretty complex and its only in closed beta stage.EDIT (02/06/14): Now that it is in open beta, they have changed a few things. Some positives, like more missions/training modes, balancing buffs/nerfs, unit customization such as color and naming. However, there are a lot of negative changes they have made. Particularly in regards to making the grind for in-game currency much, much slower. They've made missions restore only after 24hrs, and reduced success rate. They allow higher-leveled units to be only purchasable by real money, other than having to level them up manually. Experience gain is slower, and they increased prices for units. All in all, it isn't pay to win, but its very much free-to-grind. Like they say, you pay real money to be able to advance easier without as much grind. But the grind is very slow in this game.Will update review if they make any major changes to the gameplay/grind. Everything in-game is still unlockable through in-game currency, you can play entirely free. It is exactly how F2P models should be, but much slower grind. You have been warned, its still very fun :-) GL HF			"

												Well lets look at the negatives: #Firstly: WHY ISN'T THIS GAME ON EARLY ACCESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   &:Something I feel you must be aware of when getting this game is that it is STILL in beta. For a long time however this game was only in closed beta, and despite being officially ""released"" on Steam it is still only in open beta. They really need to clarify this!#This isn't the only game of it's type on the market.    &:Other games such as Kings Bounty and Blackguards perform similar functions and are arguably better.#This is not an OMG DAT GRAPHICS kind of game   &: I only include this detail as I'm aware there are those who prefer all their textures to be uber high              res and have some absurdly high polygon count.   #I used to have there being no PvE mode here, however they have added a more than adequate one since I started playing..#I have yet to see 2v2, 3v3, etc. modes.   &:Arguably a matter of preference I feel being able to fight along side or against multiple players would make the game a lot more interesting. #Unless you wanna drop some cash your going to have to spend a lot of time playing to get higher level unitsAnd now for the positives:#Nice, well implemented art style   &:Dogs of War uses a very dark and dirty fantasy style that may not be for everyone. I personally find it to be well executed.#Interesting Lore   &:A crucial part of any game is context. Games of this type are always far more interesting when the player can connect to the characters they control, and Dogs of War does a good job of presenting an intriguing set up that will leave you curious and wanting to find out more about the characters and the world they're in.#Solid well paced gameplay   &:The game is turn based so if you're a hard core RTS fan then this might not be for you.   &:The game has a time limit on turns so you don't have to worry about the other player stopping to eat, file their taxes, and maybe go on vacation before making the next move.   &:Also the gameplay itself allows for little in the way of a dull moment.#The game is balanced   &:The game uses an ""Army Points"" system. Basically each unit is rated based on how much they can contribute in game. This helps in match making as a player with a bunch of uber powerful units wont get paired against a nube with a bunch of starters. #Not a pay-to-win   &:Everything attributing to how effective you are in game thus far appears to be accessible to anyone playing the game without having to spend money. Not to say spending money wouldn't let you get some epic stuff, just that if you got said epic stuff you'll then be paired with other people who also have epic stuff, regardless of whether or not you are fully aware of how to use aforementioned epic stuff. So you're not paying to become more powerful then everyone else, just to skip the time it would have taken to build up the necessary in-game currency. (And perhaps get yourself nube stomped)#Lots of interesting mechanics   &:Injury system, Leveling system, Charge attacks, Cover, Race mechanics, Stances, just to name a few.#Plenty of potential   &:Looking at the wiki's and even some of the menus game mechanics is enough to tell you that Cyanide is no where near adding all the content they want to have in this game. Which is awesome considering how much they already have. Multiple game types, lots of different units, and even ways to customize them all look to be things players will have to look forward to in the near distant future.#A dev team that's DEDICAITED to quality   &:Something I just felt deserved to be mentioned. This dev team didn't just rush their release. This game was set to go into open beta some time fall 2013, yet got pushed back because the devs didn't feel it was ready. And it's not like it's impossible to play right now, getting into the closed beta is rather simple, and they seam to still have a few keys left so I recommend you check out their facebook. These guys aren't rushing this, and seeing as they've now set a more solid release date (January if you didn't notice...) it's not because they're lazy. Otherwise they would have pushed it back like half a year or something... No it's because they're willing to take there time to make sure they get it right. And I for one appreciate that.#I personally find it fun and have no problems with playing my game to get more stuff to have more fun playing the gameSo yeah... Also it's free, so why the hell not? At least give it a shot, or if you're not into strategy then look up some gameplay vids when it comes out. If you are into strategy then what's stopping you? That's all for now, please pardon my bad grammar, and thanks for reading. I really hope this helped.P.S. Seeing as this has a good chance of being one of the few reviews people see before they decide to download this game I want to do my best to make it as informative as possible. So please feel free to leave comments on how I might make it better.			"

												I was super excited when the game came out.  Unfortunately, its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness... it's based on Confrontation (not a board game, a miniatures game).  Confrontation is, unfortunately, very unbalanced.  Or was.  It ended up getting more or less run into the ground by a string of bad decisions by the owner... who knew how to make a great game, but didn't very much understand how to sell it, and how product development generally needs to bend to the whims of the market (i.e. your release schedule shouldn't overly cater to your favorite factions, and you shouldn't have models that are years behind schedule while you're releasing whole new factions of the game).Anyway, back off of my soap box... Dogs of War is also somewhat unbalanced.  Like confrontation, it's a game of super units.  And the people who *have* those super units tend to do very well vs. people who don't.  Matchmaking should, ideally, prevent this, but it's a point based system... so if I sink my points into a high level wizard and some light familiars and light-cannon you from halfway across the board, well... that's the game.  There are counters to it, such as playing Wolfen in general (because they're fast), but against undead I'm gonna win nearly every time.Like any competitive game, people that know the ""good combos"" are going to win.  Like any level-based game, people that have the high level stuff are going to win.  You can beat them... but it's not easy to do so.  Having a match-making system that worked off of player rank in addition to points would be nice, but then again, part of the issue is that there are limited numbers of people to play against... so if you only played against new players, you'd be waiting a very, very long time for a game.The bottom lin is: this game could be good.  But for it to be good, advancement can't be 100% tied to multiplayer (because the multiplayer scene is dying off).  I still have high hopes for this game, mostly because I still want to see the other Confrontation factions... but it looks like that may not be happening, and may not ever happen.  And, unfortunately, they may have tainted the name enough that if I got the money together to try and make a better, more balanced version, people wouldn't buy it due to the stigma of the previous games.  So... unfortunately, I can't recommend this game, because while it has good promises, those promises may go unfulfilled, leaving it currently unplayable.			"

												This game is essentially table top gaming without the table top. If you like warhammer you will like this. What looks like a Pay to win aspect is actually not at all. The game is worth persevering with, as you level up you can field larger armies (higher points value) like with warhammer, this is when the game comes into its own as you begin being able to personalise an army to adhere to a strategy. This is the best new game i've played in years.			"

												Meh .  6/10Was fun at the start. Building your troop learning the different skills sets and factions was great fun add that with what was when I played a helpful fun community and it’s a no brainer.But unfortunately the game quickly takes a turn for the worse were you will start to see people using the same units and strategy over and over on the same few maps and the battles tend to play out the same way every game.At this point you will have to throw some money at the game to be able to contend with the more powerful costly units and troop meta. And I am ok with spending money on a good product but I just didn’t see the Varity of maps units and the ability to change up your troop composition I was looking for. On the positive side the graphics, interface, unit movement and skills were all done well and its for sure a game I will keep my eye on and perhaps come back to if they add  more content.			"

												A typical round-based strategy game, running via Matchmaking system. It's quite a neat game with halfway good graphics and a certain rulesetting, similar to some D&D-Features (Roll a dice for succes, f.ex.). It is made smart but not smart enough. I can only agree with people saying 'Unbalanced game' or 'highs farming lows'Several examples:1.) Playing the unholy/undead faction has seriously no major benefit at all (Immunity to toxin. Yeah.). At that, they're the kind of trash-troops - Cheap but many. However 'Zerg'ing the enemys down, like undeads usually would, won't work due to the limitations of summons for necromancers. Njét. Whereas wolve-troops posses a double-attack feature. Or healing powers when playing with holy-factioned troops.-> 2.) Troops themselves have pretty balanced stats. Which is the next problem: Wolves passively having 'twice' the dmg-output than any other troop? I could faceplant to this. Some nice Knight being healed throughout the match? No problem.I believe that ye fine programmers hate the undead. 3.) Matchmaking is based on so called Armypoints: The stronger the unit - The more AP you have. Thus, anyone can meet anyone, depending on troops ofcourse. Which is certainly a grave mistake: Experienced players can and will easily outplay any newcomer.4.) One either must buy troops via real money or grind to get them. Which takes alot of time. Fortunately there's a limit for each troop in every platoon. (No zergings yo undeads.)I'd claim: Give the game more time to evolve. It's good, but not good enough - for now.			"

YouTube™ Video: Dogs of War Online review 

			Views: 5,109		

			Cosmic takes a look at Dogs of War Online, a tactical turn based free to play game developed by Cyanide studios. Get it on steam here - http://store.steampowered.com/app/219700 Follow me on twitter -...		

Dogs of war online is a free to play online tactical turn based strategy game developed by Cyanide studios. Cyanide studios themselves are a French developer based in Paris France and are some what of a hit or miss company in my opinion. While they have developed great games like blood bowl, confrontation and the highly underrated of Orcs and Men. They are also the ones responsible for the terrible game of thrones game. Please note a the time of making this review, the game although mostly complete is in open BETA and as such there are quite the few bugs and glitches to be had.Dogs of war is heavily inspired by the confrontation boardgame by Rackham, as was their previous confrontation game. The game is set in the world of Aarklash which as you can imagine is in a state of war. Three factions vie for power, the forces of light, darkness and destiny. Seeing this as a grand opportunity mercenary companies have started to spring up and as you can imagine your going to set of these companies up.Each of your units has a number of attributes such as attack, damage and parry as well as a AP value. AP stands for Army points, the way that battles work in Dogs of war is similar to popular table top games. Each battle has an AP limit value for example a death match battle with a limit of 200 AP. This means you can you'll only be able to deploy units that match or go under that score collectively. For example I can deploy my predator of blood, a Wolfen crossbowmen and a lone wolf-man unit which adds up to 167, however I cannot deploy my fang warrior as adding him to the selection goes over the 200 AP limitSo lets get down to the main focus of the game which is its combat. There are currently three types of player vs player game mode available. You have your straight up death match mode, Elimination VIP which is where you are given a unit to protect while trying to kill the enemies VIP and last is king of the hill, where you need to place units in a selected area and hold it until the timer runs out. When your not killing real peoples mercenaries, you have the option of training missions. These training missions have varying difficulties and place you against an AI.The combat itself is your very traditional turn based strategy, the movement grid is a hexed grid and  the game shows you your movement options clearly. The green area around a unit is where you can move and still do actions like attack, you also have the option to move further by going into the orange highlighted area at the expense of any form of attacking action.Attacking works on a basic formula, your units accuracy versus the enemies parry. Should you succeed damage is then worked out by your units damage versus the enemies toughness rating. There are a variety of factors governing your units attributes in a battle, things like terrain, cover, injuries, and other status' can affect the rolls. Speaking of terrain and cover, the maps are beautifully crafted. You can make use of walls, hedges and more to take cover from ranged enemies or shoot from hedges thus making your character covered while attacking. There are also blocks of terrain that have rubble on them, these areas are classed as heavy terrain and units standing on them incur defensive penalties.Two really useful mechanics in combat are the charge and pursuit movement mechanics. Charge is exactly as it sounds, your unit can charge an enemy. A successful charge will not only engage the enemy in close combat but also inflict a stun state which incurs a -1 to all their attributes. Pursuit movement occurs when a unit defeats an enemy, your able to take another action be it movement or attack another close enemy.You also have orders at your disposal in combat, orders are essentially consumable abilities that you can use on any of your units. Some orders are faction specific for example as you can see I play as the Wolfen, their faction specific order is natural selection which gives a +2 to damage to the unit for the rest of the turn. Orders are crucial to victory in Dogs of war and can be the difference between a win or a loss.Any fan of turn based strategy will be straight at home with dogs of war, even newcomers to the genre will pick up the mechanics of the game quickly and without much pain. The games tutorial explains everything nicely by actually letting you play the mechanics rather than just show you.Dogs of war is no where near perfect, Cyanide still have a lot of work to do to not only bug fix but to also ensure the correct balancing for the units as some currently do feel over powered. Combat is solid and it is a good framework for cyanide to build on as the game progresses, luckily it is a completely self published title and cyanide own the IP meaning they can tweak to their hearts content. If your a big turn based strategy fan, you'll find real enjoyment here as I did. It is also a good place for newcomers to the genre to find their bearings as the game is not too difficult and you can just play with friends until you feel ready for more challenging foes.As free to play games go, Dogs of war is by no means pay to win, though progression solely through ducats is slow and sometimes tedious, its easily done. While its a definite work in progress, there is certainly potential to build upon and I'd have no qualms about recommending this to anyone looking to play a turn based strategy.			"

												Dogs Of War is a game with extremely deep gameplay mechanics, very well balanced maps and good character design. Graphics are pretty bad, music and sound effects are nothing special, also there's no customization options.Occasional matchmaking issues, non-existing support, exorbitant prices in item shop compromise the final result as well. If you are a fan of turned based strategy and can't afford a decent game of this genre - Dogs of War Online might be worth checking out. Overall 6/10.			"

												Best summerized as a game that will only be played because we currently dont really have a good lineup of f2p turn based stat. games. its badly balanced, on a garbage engine so bad you wouldn't even believe the number of glitches it has, with a very weak stategy component, and i mean weak. though in theory you have a variety of ways to play, due to the balance, most of the units are straight up worthless, and are better left unused rather then getting essentially a cannon folder unit.Beyond this, the game is also rediclously complicated beyond my understanding (or it may very well be possible i understand it perfectly, yet the game is so buggy that i just can't even begin to understand whats intended and whats not) have a very very silly system of fighting. there are such awesome components to this game such as:Calculations that lie about you having a 100% chance to hit, and you scoring a missBetter chance of hitting your real target, by targeting the guy next to him, because reasontons of skills saying they do one thing, and doing anothercalculations telling you the wrong damage amountsometimes not being able to activate the special warcall things (like defensive stance) doing your turn after movement, but then the other 50% of the time, you can.within the last 7 or 8 months, the game has shown no signs of improvement, and actually seems to be doing quite the opposite, and getting progressively worse with each major update. i can't really recommend this game in anyway shape or form, but i can instead tell you this:Go play fire emblem, even if its the gba version on an emulator, its still far superior to the experience you'll have here			"

												Once upon a time this was a game with great promise. However the devs made a major mistake when they went into open beta and made several more like making in game money more grindy to gain, adding in mission countdown times and the like. The game had a lot of promise and could've been great. It has good strategy elements, fantastic units that actually support different play styles and different strategies based on the unit with no one 'master' unit that will win you every game.The devs have abandoned the game and after about a year of waiting it doesn't look like any new updates are coming out and the community has fallen apart.

												Too fresh to be released.If you read the game discussion topics, you will notice that most players aren't staying in the game for more than 10 days, and because of that the game has gone through changes. Still, the game should have waited more for public release.I've experienced sudden fps decrease with a good system, the matchmaking system takes TOO long to find a game, which has only one mode, the troops balancing still needs a lot of work. Wolfen units(one of the 3 factions available) are either too OP or too nerfed. They are ""heavier"" than other units which can have a similar, if not better potential, but are ""lighter"" when considering troop management.The balancing is still not good, the game has going through a lot of transformations, so I can't really say what the real face of the game is. The game still has potential to be good, but you should wait a lot more time to try this game out. Or if you do decide to play the game now, don't feel disappointed. Specially if you play with the Wolfen.			"

												I love the Rackham Universe..and very much miss there tabletop games. This game has increadible potential..however it seems to have been forgotten about. There have been no new updates with regards to content. In the game you can see other factions might be available..but in the last year nothing has been added. Games is just taking to long to add any content and i and many of my mates have simply moved on.			"

												A glorified Facebook game that somehow managed to find its way to Steam. The combat system is exellent. There is a great focus on strategy, and the composition of your army is based on points, so you're always against an army of roughly the same army value.Missions in the game, however, runs in realtime. I chose a mission a sent a unit out to complete it (I only started with 2 units in my army), which resulted in me not being able to do any actual playing before my other unit would complete the mission 15 minutes later.The inability to play with/against friends at will is also dragging it down.

												I think this game deserves more credit. I made a nice easy guide to follow along with if you have not at least tried to game. It shows the Lobby/Create Company/1st PvP.  My first match ends playing out very nice and shows the dynamics that can really turn the tides of battle.Dogs of War Online - EP1 ""Lobby/Create/1st PvP"" -

												Dogs of War Online is a fast paced turn based strategy game heavily influenced by the table top game Confrontation. It puts the player in the role of a mercenary leader, who can have multiple bands of mercenaries at his command. The game is currently in beta and at this stage offers little in the way of single player. There are 3 tutorial missions and training versus bots but then it is into the lobbies to test your skills and mercenaries against other players.I have never played the table-top game but have spent many hours playing similar games. The mechanics or 'rules' of this game are very solid and make for a more realistic and exciting game than any other I have played on computer, the kitchen table or elsewhere.Do not listen to people saying the game is P2W or a grind. The game is 100% free to play, no disadvantage, no grinding and if you manage to win 5 ranked matches a week you get from 3 to 50 cyans (The store bought premium currency). What people call grinding in this is actually just a pretty fast paced progression system.There are currently 3 armies with many more to follow: The dark path field Undead, the Light path field Humans, and the neutral or destiny path field Wolfmen. You will hear many people talk about some factions and/or specific units being imba or OP. In fact I have heard almost every single unit in the game referred to as imba or OP and all factions are described as OP daily. People cry imba/OP when they are beaten and refuse to look at how it happened. The sheer amount of different opinions on what is OP speaks volumes about the balance of the game. I personally have never felt beaten by better units, usually better play, my mistakes or simply a lack of knowledge about some units in the game.I strongly recommend this if you liked X-Com, but the focus on multiplay makes it much more rewarding. This game is turn based tactics at its finest and it is PvP. The 3 currently availiable armies offer very different play styles. After choosing some starter mercenaries you are free to customize your team build and also the builds of the individual units in your team. The only gripe I have had so far is people playing 1 or 2 games and wanting to have everything straight away then blaming their lack of skills on the games balance. On the developers side of things parts of the UI are a bit clunky and the servers seem a little wonky, at least for me anyway. (note: it would not be a Cyanide game without a clunky UI, it is like their trademark.) Another trap for new players who may be unfamiliar with the genre is that when a mercenary gets a level his/her/its cost will increase and may mean you can no longer include it in low team rating matches. Basically don't level your units until you are sure you understand the game. There is currently no way to respec levels so choices are permanent. There is no reason to pay real $'s in this so maybe respec would be a good cash only option for the devs. If you really like CoD, then this may not be for you. If you like X-Com or any other turn based tactics game then this is a must see and its free! So do yourself a favour and download Dogs of War Online today.			"

												Good idea for a game but balance is horrible. Like most table top games it has units that are over powering unless countered with the same type of units. Trouble is unlike table top games this game has no concept of mass combat (one unit fighting multipe units at once). There seems to be bonuses to units if you surround them but either they are way to small or don't actually work.The different factions are seriously unbalanced. Wolves get double attacks and triple counters but still have etremely high health compared to other factions. Holy factions get strong heals and improved accuracy. Undead get debuffs that take three turns to power up and unit costs as high as the other so there is no way to offset their poor accuarcy by fielding more units than the enemy.All in all the game shows promise but balancing issues must be addressed before they even think of getting out of beta.

												Okay so this game has alot of potential but curretly i dont recommend. The last update has been horendous... theres no balance currently as 1 faction has been completly over powered. This faction is called wolfen, there melee monsters and get 2 strikes at an enemy with 1 not even being countered...thats not all whilst they are the most powerful melee monsters they are apparently expert magicians and archers.... they can use magic move and attack twice for 3 attacks with there mages making them the most powerful or they can play harassment and move, use magic and then move again. Not only that there crossbows do the same and are incredibly cheap.latest patch = No recommendationThey also need more factions for more variety as army compositions become samey. Release more factions and try and find balance after because no doubt each time they release a new faction it will as op as wolfen are right now. Warmachine tactics is releasing with all there factions why cant cyanide. All an all its a beta but as a beta i dont recommend. if they sort out a full game then there will be lots of potential but even then they will be missing one of the main factions,,,, the cynwall elves.

												Game was decent for turn based fantasy tabletop miniatures style combat in beta. Community was dead at time I played so I did solo vs. ai and then attempted to play against other players. It's a shame really that this seems to have been abandoned. Guess they lost steam (heh) and threw in the towel because of the lack of interest/support. I'd like to see this expanded greatly and overhauled because it has potential. Perhaps they might consider making it open source or finding someone to take the reigns and continue development if they've moved on. As it stands now, I cannot recommend it. It needs a lot more added and a lot of balancing, or did when I last played. Take that for what it's worth. As always, YMMV. Too bad.			"

												I tried this for a day and really didn't find that I liked it. I installed it based on the recommendation from several people that if you liked Warhammer, you'd like this game. I feel compelled to rebut that statement. This game feels somewhat like possibly Mordheim, the old small-unit game that used a few of the Warhammer models, but it certainly doesn't have the same feel as a regular Warhammer Fantasy game. My biggest issue is that the balance doesn't feel right. I don't have a ton of data to back that up as I haven't played it that extensively, but that's my opinion. I've tried the wolves, but they're always stuck behind too much terrain for their mobility to be of use. It seems I'm playing against the undead 90% of the time, probably because they can raise troops quickly enough to blockade the mobility and it seems to be the easiest way to win presently.A second issue is that the maps feel very claustrophobic - there are too many choke points and too much terrain, IMO.A third issue is the lack of a campain or PVE. I didn't realize this when I downloaded it, but 90% of the game is focused on PVP. Once you've completed the tutorial, the only other PVE left are the training maps. No quests or campain mode, just PVP. To be fair, the game is very well done. The units are polished, the gameplay is smooth and the animations are nice. Lots of potential here. I understand it is still in development, so I'll probably check back to see if I like it again at a later date. It could be fun, but it isn't 'like' Warhammer. FYI, I do have some skin in the game and have paid money to buy a couple of units to see if that would make a difference in my enjoyment of the game - it didn't.			"

												Sadly, I have not had much time to play this game between two sessions of XCOM : EU but what I've experienced felt very good. It's a graphically pleasing game with polished gameplay, admitedly not taking too much risk but enough to give the game its own charisma. Cyanide has a long record of making a mix of both interesting (original) and disappointing games (yes I'm looking at you GoTRPG :)) but if it succeeds at not making its game a pay-to-win it will undoubtedly be a very pleasant surprise for early 2014.NOW GO GET IT !

												Dogs of War is a turn based PvP strategy game. It takes a moment to get used to if you've never played a turn based game before. Each que for a match is divided into a difficulty, each unit has it's own level of danger. This amount is used to determine how many active units you can have in your army at any time. Choose alot of weak units, or few strong units. The less you choose the more skill it takes to come out ontop. In addition to actual matches you can also send units out on timed missions if you have extra. When you start off you have to choose a faction to use, but don't let that deter you because you can have up to three factions, or armies, at your disposal. All in All I give the game an 8/10 overall score, there are different playstyles that keep the game fresh match after match, as well as different types of units for each army, each unit with their own special features and skills. Each match is a challenge of cunning and synergy, are you up for it?			"

Yes there is like 9 AI missions that you can do and all they are is Tutorial typical stuff Once you get threw that its nothing but Online player vs player and yeah you can fight your friends in friendly games but you get nothing out of it so why bother yourself Game needs a AI that you can fight to see if your Army is any good before walking into a 1vs1 and getting distoryed Fun for a Day and then no more in my books.

												As of yet it is not recommended or frankly speaking not a solid game to play. The mechanics (what's most of it from the previous patch that I've known, where units can level up,) changed dramatically. I don't blame the developers for their sudden change seeing as how most players take advantage of it and forcing other players to get a tie by running away.It is a great game as it is with hardcore tactics to keep in mind if you really want to win a match; but as it is still in Beta and have no clue of the dev's goals or the game's heading whatsoever, the game can be a bit quirky.

												If you like tactics games, and absolutely can't afford to buy a good one, Dogs of War Online might be just for you.  The graphics are choppy, yet the movement and attack animations take an enormously large amount of time to execute.  I'd be okay with this if there were some sort of ""Skip movement/animation"" option, but alas there isn't.  The result is pvp battles that could put a 10 year old on coffee to sleep, and PVE battles so lengthy that you'll wonder why you don't get any reward for them.All of this aside, where this game really lacks is its balancing and enormous range of luck that's involved in matches.  I won 12 out of the 18 matches I played, and every time I felt no sense of victory.  It wasn't because of my tactics that I won, but the blind luck of parrying and dealing multiple hits, and that isn't what I like to see in my tactics games.In conclusion, I give Dogs of War Online a 5/10.  If you can afford literally any other tactics game, then I strongly suggest you play that instead.			"

												I am a fan of tabletop games. So  i gave this a game a try. There are quest, where u send a soldier for 24 hours to get some silver. the single player figths are prett easy, but not awarding anything.Pvp is quite fun, but it take so much time, to get silver for better units. units get xp to get better skills. the balance system is good, cause each unit has points and their are limits in a few steps. so u can build an army close to an limit and u will be fine.but the figths are luck based. a good tatctic can help u to win, but u learn it fast. so it is again luck based if u win.why i not recommend this game:it is pay to win, u can try to get same with investment of lots of hours and days. So u have to start the game once a day to send ur troops to quests, and do a couple of pvp till u win, so u get all bonus silver available each day. but the progress is very slow, the pvp figths are boring and the quest are stupid.

 Dogs Of War   may only be beta, but is a great game. It is a wonderful tactical strategy game. This game reminds me of when I use to play those old strategy board-games like RISK, and Axis and Allies. This game has beautiful graphics, cool factions, and a overall awesome game. Each faction has a has a race to play. There are only 1 race/hero to select at first which then gives you the choice of starting units. There are 3 different starting unit variations. There is 1 varation that is good for beginners and up, while the other 2 are for more strategic players who want a challenge. Though you may start off on average 2-3 units you can always get more once you’ve leveled up. Also to note that the 3 factions units have their own pros and cons. This makes it that much more indepth when making an army. This also makes it so you learn units are good at what.  Though this game can be very hard or frustrating at times due to you can fight a person who you think will be easy, and yet loose horrible or by the a little.  This game makes you really think about how much hp my unit has, his damage, dodge, etc. The unit stats are very important to know. The worst thing you could do in a match is to not look at the enemy units in the placement time. Also I recommend watching carefully on matches to look for certain tactics that others may use.  Other than all the in-depth stuff the game is great. It’s free for now, but I’d defiantly play $5-10 USD for it. In my opinion it should be rated 6 or 7 out of 10. I hope to see it excel in the steam community.			"

												Years ago I actually played the tabletop this game is based on and I find they did a good job porting it. Artwork and gameplay are well done, even though it would be great to get a few more unit choices^^A few people complain about balancing (especially in regard to the Wolfen), So far I've played as Alahan and Archeron and I didn't have any trouble with Wolfen players. Maybe it gets worse in higher tiers, but personally I think that you just have to adjust your playstyle. Of course the average Wolfen unit is much stronger then the average unit of the other factions, but they're much more expensive as well (you have 2v5 games and the like). So you have to position your units in a way that enables you to attack each Wolfen unit with multiple of your own. So not unbalanced, just requiering some adjustments of your tactics!Have fun playing!			"

												Very enjoyable game, although It has long ways to go. I'd like to see how It evolves since It's too early to determined if It's in fact a good game or not.More depth in custumization, vast set of Talents and Skills, more races, and more balanced combat could help to smoth out this game. However, it's playable until You realize that the developers need more time to make it much better game.Dear developers: Please nerf the Wolves. They are too powerfull. Evey 2 out three online matches people play them since they are simply the best army and this is clutting the comunity with Wolf players. I'll try to come back in a few weeks to give an update.			"

												I like Dogs of War Onile. There are some balancing issues still going on and as with most new games its in ""Open Beta"" but I have come across no real bugs so far.Firstly DoWO is a f2p turn based strat game focused mainly around 1v1 pvp. There are solo and training missions to help you out at the start also. Currently you can chose from 3 player races basically the good, the bad and the ugly. (Humans, undead and wolfmen). This is set to grow to 9 player races. Each race has unique skills/ magic/ traits made with a far degree of imagination. You build up and manage your guild of mercenarys by leveling them up through experience earned during matches. Each match is at either 250 AP (army power), 400 AP (ranked level) or 800 AP (big crazy army power). There are 3 modes currently; Deathmatch (14 rounds at 60 seconds each round total but they dont normaly last this long), Elimination (basically a head hunter mission to take out a marked taget on the enemy team) and King of the Hill (fight for a point on the map).The game IS completely free to play as you can buy EVERYTHING with ingame money - even the ingame shop money you can earn through the ranked matches - and I do like to see a real f2p game from time to time.Overall if you like turnbased strategy games with a competitive pvp feel I recommend you try this one out "

												So far I am really impressed with this game! The way you end up paying to support them is a little strange as it is likely that you will make some regrettable decisions with the in-game currency and then just want to have what you really need immediately so you break down and just buy what you need... but it's not expensive and the devs deserve the support. If you like PvP tactical strategy, you should absolutely try it. Not pay-to-win however because of the progression of everything in the game, you will only spend money to force what you want, when you want it.			"

												I've only played for a short while so far, but I've been doing exceptionally well.  I'll be sure to update this review once I get a little deeper into the game, but I wanted to post one to raise awareness for it, early on.  This game feels wonderful.  I love the artstyle, I love the game-play.  The music is decent, too.  I've come to expect a lot from ""early release"" or beta phase games, and this one really impresses me, especially as a free-to-play.  The battles feel pretty balanced, and it really takes me back to my table-top miniatures days (Think D&D Mini's, Warhammer, Heroclix). The game isn't pay to win (it's inherent design makes it so that it cannot be, because you are always matched against someone with an army ranked closely to yours).  I see where it could be pay-to-save-time, but hey, I enjoy playing the game so much I don't feel the need to ""save time"".The one problem I experienced was with the confirmation email, which I am sure they will fix shortly.  Usual launch day errors, and all.  Sad that we have come to expect them, but alas, it didn't take long to figure out.  Like I said, I haven't been in the game for a short while so far, but I have a strong feeling that I will be playing it for a long, long time.  I intend to update this review once my opinion hardens with time.Early Impressions: 10/10  You should definitely give this game a shot.			"

												Check it out if you like pvp TBS, its not pay to win (as of feb 2014), but it is lacking in content. Currently there are only three armies to pick from, and limited maps, they plan to add more of both. Its promising but i dont see many people sticking aorund long term currently. When you have time play it for a while so you know if you are interested in it down the road when it gets more fleshed out.Its also not very optimized, and seems to run about the same on a wide variety of machines (badly). Unfortunately due to the track record of the developers its probably going to stay that way. That said high frame rates are not required in a turn based game. "

												As ive been playing both Blood Bowl and Warhammer in reallife and enjoyed it very much this game is really something that steals my hours. Definetly a game i would recommend, it feels gd to have a squad of warriors which evolves and makes the games more interesting. As it is i havent really gotten around to the big matches, but so far its a really enjoyable game with alot of different ways to plan your tactics depending on how you choose to talent your different mercenaries.Theres just some special feeling in having the choices you make on your warriors seen carried out with a succes.One of my worries about this game was wheter it was pay to win, but from my view it seems that paying only makes the grinding process shorter. When its said that there is a grinding process its not like alot of other boring games, but you grind the Ducats to buy new troops buy sending a mercenary on missions or by playing the game itself where youll encouter other players of different setups and races.There is some combinations of warriors that seems a bit OP but i feel that so far it seems that most of them can be countered. For new players i would strongly recommend The Wolves or The Human race, since the Undead seem a bit tricky to master. But maybe i just havent figured out how to play them.  "

												If you've been hankering for X-com style turn based MP that isn't completely awful, I'd check this out. Unlike X-Com, this is a MP focused turn based strategy game and MP won't be left to die like it was in X-Com. It's still in beta, so we'll see how balance turns out and if it's pay to win or not, but I find this game to be promising. Besides, the price to give a try is $0.As of now(2/17/14), all units are buyable by in game currency that you can grind or with real money. There's no need to spend any real money, but I guess it would get you units faster. Grinding in game cash doesn't seem too awful to me so far.			"

Balance is close enough to have fun games and I've not yet encountered an opponent I stood no chance of winning.What makes the game good, is that almost every time you lose, you can point down the exact errors you did during the game. Game certainly is not difficult, but requires some thinking to win fights: Most obivious thing is often not the best thing to do. Thinking actually goes much deeper than it looks like on first glance. Good balance between skill and luck.A strong recommendation for anyone looking forward to lightweight turn based tactics.			"

												I have been a fan of Turn Based Strategy games all my life. This one does nothing that another game doesn't do better. It is boring in every way with no interesting units or strategies. I would recommend you purchase a game to play instead of playing this free game. Its not worth the time it takes to download and install.			"

												With just a few hours into this game, I can say this is what Free to Play always should be.  Not pay to win, not pay to have fun, in fact, I haven't felt for one second like I'm missing out because I haven't spent money.  This is a very rich strategy game that just happens to be online, anyone who likes tactics games will fall in love with this title.			"

												I'm not sure if I suck or the game sux. I played about 10 matches with each starting faction. Won 1. lost MANY. It had nothing to do with strategy. It was the fact that I got parried or dodged. Then took massive damage from my opponents time and time again. I actualy laughed out loud so hard the whole house heard me and thought I was watching OJ running from the cops on youtube. And in losing so badly.. I got injuries. which to most dont seem too bad. but mine wanted me to have 9 cards to remove them? holy crap.. that's a lot of in game money for a beginner. So I deleted my company and made a new one... same thing kept happening. To the point where I'm scared to even buy a new unit. He'll just get injured and I'll have to get rid of him. So I'm stuck playing with the same starter army and no upgrades in sight. I think the game just hates me. If you're a strategy expert.. this might be for you and it might be great for you since it's such a pain. But if you're not a total copmlete badass.. you'll need real money to make it anywhere sadly. Which is why I have to give a thumbs down. I really wanted to like this game because there's not many out there like it. :(			"

												Overall it was just a poor experienceit is by NO means pay to win i see very little reason to put any money into the shop whatsoever because everything is for sale for ingame cash.the game itself seems fine until you actualy get into pvp wich is the only game mode btwand realize that no matter what units you have it all comes down to blind luck.every time u attack it seems theres atleast a 50/50 shot no matter what u roll it will be perried and they will counterattacki mean seriously i have 100 percent to hit and i get perried and get killed.it seems to be even worse when u are fighting the werewolves that can attack hit you and when u counterattack they perrie and hit u AGAIN..that all aside the units gain exp and level up wich is optional because they require more points to use up to a cap set by what level you are pvp in.it seems good but all you realy gain is a few lousy stats and a big points increase. wich u could really use to just buy more units and add more attacks and surviveability.the graphics are half decent and the models are ok but generici really dont know what more to say im just dissapointed i was hoping for more meaningful combat and actualy careing about my army wich i honesly cant.add equipment some stat trees maybe for unitsmake the game more customiseable so you can atleast name your units for gods sake.oh wait you can for 800 coins wich is rediculousoverall just dont bother its not worth your time			"

												I like Dogs of War Online, it reminds me of some of the table top games I used to play. The game is a solid entry in the fantasy strategy genre is most likely worth your time if your even bothering to read reviews for the game. There is not too much ""content"" right now (factions, maps, ect.) or at least as of 2/6/14. There are more factions and other content on the way that should be introduced as the beta progresses. Hopefully the final release will be popular because there are not many of these ""types"" of games end up in a good place. Here is to hoping the developers make good decisions based on player feedback and continue to improve the game.			"

												Decent balance, only a few outliers.  The game still lacks polish but if the current state is any indication of how it'll look in the future you should be very excited.  Complaints about the Wolfen should be mostly disregarded.  Predator of Blood is overpowered but manageable.  Everything else is strong but balanced for its price.  The 200 AP bracket isn't well-balanced and if you plan to stay there (not recommended, 300+ is much more fun) it's a good idea to specialize to take down the ubiquitous dogs.  Necromancer, Skull Warrior, and two Skeleton Swordsman will make short work of most wolfen with good tactics.  Play defensively.  Keep your swordsmen up front and when the dogs engage surround them with morbid puppets (don't put puppets up front, they'll get one-shotted and allow a pursuit attack) and bring in the skull warrior to put them down.Past 200AP the game is much more balanced. Wolfen are still strong but soon become heavily outnumbered with their high AP costs and encirclement negates most of their stat advantages.  When you add in the ""dogs are op"" popular opinion and the kinds of players that brings in, wolfen are no big deal.  Most players can't play them to their strengths and will just get them bogged down and killed.With any game like this the first question is always ""Is it p2w?""  Thankfully in this case it's definitely not.  Almost everything in the game is available for in-game money at a decent price.  The AP system means that wallet warriors end up stuck in 800AP with other wallet warriors.  Good game!  Play it!			"

												Slow turn based warfare with a hint of pay to convenience, I don't like it.DoW is a turn based board game that places you VS real people or you can complete missions and tutorials to gain money to buy new soldiers for your army. As you play with your units, you gain experience with them and they can learn new skills and passives, making them more useful in certain situations or banes VS certain factions. You can play long amounts of time to fill in your forces or pay real money for units and experience boosts, making it unfair VS players. Since you can get everything using the game currency, it isn't as bad as it sounds. But there is most certainly some unfair advantages online for new players and players who haven't built up a formidible force yet.The game can become a little complex for its type, making you learn the different ways units interact with each other, examples being (Bravery, Fear, Pursuit, Attacks of Opportunity and many more) that decide whether you lose or win. As a turn based game war game I am not a huge fan, but I gave it a try as it looked pretty interesting. I was not disappointed, it was certainly fun to try it out and learn exactly how the games plays, but I don't like the slow pace at which you earn currency, it would take hours and hours to build up a decent army and really get into the fun games with other people.The races are also unbalanced and one of the three are very good early game, so much so that new players have a hard time keeping up with the early game power. It evens out when you reach the higher level brackets. DoW is still in beta, so take that into consideration.It's free, its simple but complex and its interesting! Give it a try, see if its for you and if it isn't, send the file into your computers void to be lost forever.Personal Rating: 3/5			"

												just played this game for a few hrs. it started out quite fun. playing the tutorial and some AI matches.1st few games i had in muti player where also fun... untill the wolfs 100% loss rate to the god damn bloody wolfs.a unit that gets 2 atks and +2 move total of 6 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. compard to a lion infantyman which has 4 move and 1 atk. so the game goes like this. you start out placing where u want to start ur units in battle. take a few turns and try to stay out of the atk radius rdy for the defencive (because offencive would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). he then stands +2 movement from u. Next turn u can either go stand next to him and not get an atk by using sprint and losing your atk phase to only get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the face the next turn or u can retreat. so u retreat. he then stands +2 movement away from u again. eventually he gets to move 6 and atks u twice. ur then engaged. u can use an abilty to run and not atk or u can fight. so u fight cause u been running all game. his next move happens hits another units twice. its on half health. if he was lucky enough to atk the same unit its dead and he gets another atk phase with the unit that just killed your unit. so in total he gets 6 atks with 2 movement phases 2x2atk and +2 atk from one atk of oppertunity vs ur 2x1atks (which for all of u that cant count is = too 2) from your basic melee class.it takes roughly 4 atks to kill a unit. which he does in 2 movement phases.u need 4 movment phases to kill a unit. but after ur 1st movement phase one of your units is already dead because he always gets to engage u 1st. then he atks u again. this has a compounding effect as on his 3rd turn he will get 4 atks (another dead unit with another atk of oppertunity for him).its one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance issues i have ever seen. if u give a unit +2 movment its strong point is reaching the engagment and stoping archers/casters from doing there stuff. so why the hell would he give them and extra atk in a game when u kill a unit u get to go again... i had fun but your game is broken... when i asked what the hell was up with this... people in the lobby were rude and not helpfull..game had some potential but u cant do stupid stuff like this... or ur games gonna fail in the♥♥♥♥♥			"

As a Confrontation Mini's player I was very excited but again the ""Healing Card"" abuse and blatant lack of respect for the players and seeing us as only walets to grab cash from has lost my respect.

I didn't like the fact that I was timed to make my desicions, that alone made me dislike it. The real issue, at that time anyways, if you 'trhow your wallet at your screen every minute' you get what your suppose to in game, if you don't, you wont get access to anything really... I am up for elvels and skills and such, but balance doesn't mean sameness but rather ' for every strike there is a block/counter and vise-versa'. This game does'nt or didn't have that. It much how other reviews state it, just buy your way in and break the entire gameplay. That pretty much sums it up but then again, if your interested check how its changes now.			"

												The potential this game has is amazing, I just wish there were more PVE aspects.The PvP in this game is plagued by camping, the person to make the first move usually gets destroyed, so people typically camp behind cover until the opponent comes to them so they can attack them from cover. This results in people spamming ""End Turn"" and playing a game of chicken with the remaining turns. It's an amazing concept, and I recommend this game because it is very very well done, but this glaring problem is something you should think about as it will plague 80% of your games.			"

												Just downloaded the game and everything was auto set to high, went to go play the first easy tutorail but instead it would load, and then become really laggy, the textures were all over the place and the frames were so low, seems theres alot of work still to be done to this, i even set everything low and still the same, instant uninstall.

												I've been able to play many matches of this game now and I can safely say this is a great addition to the Free-to-Play category.  This game feels like I’m playing Mordheim.  You will pick a starting war band from one of the three factions and you'll hit play.  You set up the match you are looking for and you get put with a real person and engage in some great PvP turn based tactical gameplay.  You can also train and play some PvE matches/scenarios.  There is a list of PvE matches to play and have fun with.When you are done with the matches you can send your units on missions. (Kind of like in Mordheim)  You send one of your units off on a mission to gain you ducats (in-game money) and there is a chance of success or failure (unit injured).The game is NOT pay-to-win.  I have played under 20 matches and I've already purchased 3 or 4 figures with in-game money I earned from the matches I played.  You buy more figures so that you can draft a higher point army.  They give you a standard 200 point army and you build from there.If you are a table top war game fan you have nothing to lose here.  It's free, give it a try.  I think you'll like what you find.			"

												Pretty fun turn based strategy game. Uses a point based system to build armies much like some tabletop games and is quite easy to get the hang of. Strategy isn't too indepth or complex, but it has enough variety in units, skills, and spells to make you question what combinations could work well together. The level up system is also neat in that it lets you further customize your more battlehardened units. I look forward to seeing the remaining factions unlocked as well.			"

												Not a bad game at all. For one thing, it is a free game, and (almost) everything can be unlocked with in-game currency. Even then, the system gives users 'cyans' (cash currency) for participating in the leaderboard. The strategy is pretty deep - I will not say that this game was easy to learn at first. There are many little things that affect how the battle will turn out. It isn't EVE Online level of learning curve, but it can be difficult at times. Sometimes it is actually optimal to keep your units slightly weaker so you can fit other units in.The different factions are fairly well balanced for a game that is in an open beta. that being said, there are only three so far but there is promise of up to nine different sides availble.Units have a decent range of customization - you have the option to name them, recolor them, and choose talents as they level. However, leveling your units can sometimes be a bit of a grind - AI isn't the best. If you want a challenge from the computer, try fighting armies significantly larger/more powerful than your own.Overall, a very good turn-based strategy game from the makers of the Blood Bowl series. Definitly has potential to one of the better free to play experiences, at least within it's niche.			"

												Really enjoying this game atm. It reminds me of both blood bowl and Fallout - ie. using the squad's members differing abilities to overcome the enemy. What has a pretty simple layout and dynamics, has become far more tactical than I thought it would. If you enjoy small group tactics and PVP, you will dig this game.Beware, it is in beta, so there are still some glitches. It does seem viable as free to play atm. You should be able to cover the cost of injuries with the money you make during matches. So you can go pretty hard in PVP.			"

												Although in it's beta stage, the game is very promising. Very detailed, with a lot of statistics to ponder and diversified strategies to execute. However, the tutorial was a little bit challenging... not the gameplay, but I mean, was that a post for ants?

												Good game. Match-making based on army size and strength (AP) which means stronger you are, stronger enemy you face. Battle is fixed at 3 levels of AP: 250, 500 and 850? (Sr, don't remember the last). Build your army big enough to join the large scale battles.Daily missions are similar to some FB games, click and earn your rewards later with a chance of success.Note:Dogs love bone, so Undead is dogs' treat.Human tames the Dogs, sometime, maybe?Undead scares Human to dead, doesn't it?Update: They nerf Undead, now Human has Bravery and Wolf still has Attack twice a turn.

												I love the concept of turn-based strategy in your game. I feel that most opponents played wolves with a team of 2, meaning they are a bit over-balanced (8 of 10). One player played human and one played undead. Win/loss seems to be based more on a lucky initiative roll than on how well you position your offense and defense. It takes a very long time to set up and go, and the mouse cursor is slow as well.I needed to go through the tutorials more than once to get the instruction, and the controls seemed less-than-intuitive. I wished for better options to get to the 200AP total for a team composition. I think I'd prefer to have 200AP to buy attributes for my soldiers and spread them a bit for my own control/tactics/preference. Then I could have 1 really strong soldier with 40hp or 10 really weak ones with 40hp each. With a hint of intel before battles, you could design your team.			"

												This game had potential and it was a great idea, but like most free to play games, it was a complete disappointment. The game revolves around a lot of luck, races are highly imbalanced, and this is a P2W game. Don't let the good reviews deceive you, as you play your army will get injured and it's very expensive to heal their injuries. Eventually you'll go broke using your in-game currency to heal those injuries, meaning you'll have to go into battle with an injured army, making you lose more frequently which ends up giving you even more injuries. It's just a little scheme for them to force you to pay for their game. Good luck trying to recruit a more powerful army with this horrible mechanic.The tutorial is also horrendous and the way that they word the tooltips for abilities is so overly complicated. In the game there are also missions, which are equivalent to growing crops in Farmville. Yet unlike Farmville, going on a mission is pretty expensive and there is even a possibility that you can fail. You'd think that waiting a day, disabling a soldier during that period, and losing your money was bad enough, they even give your soldier a chance of obtaining an injury! I do not recommend this game, let it die off like the rest of the P2W games.			"

												The text is so small in this game that it made my eyes bleed. Protip for trash developers: If you want people to be able to read all of your boring lore that you ripped off from Tolkein or whatever, try not to use 2pt font. Bad video options, useless grindy tutorials (it's an extremely simple game; I couldn't read anything in the tutorials, but it plays just like any other bargain-trash squad-based tactical strategy game), painfully slow animations, and it looks like garbage. To top it all off, I had to go to task manager in order to quit. It runs like crap too!Pass this one up and play the new Jagged Alliance instead.Seriously, this is a joke, even for a beta.

												Found the tutorial fun, it drops you off a little short of level 10, with a max of 20 (as of aug. 12th 2014.) With a nice pocket full of gold to build up your choice in characters to use. It could really use some type of solo other than the tutorial, which each mission is a bit less then a few minutes... Going into pvp at rank 10 is daunting in the least, and I found myself unwanting to being bothered with it after a few games in a row of losing, BUT it is a tactical turn based game, so let's not cry over a few stumbled steps. Good game, could just use a bit more for the not hard core pvp nerds.			"

												Excellent idea, most of the things a fan of turn based fantasy games would fancy are there1) A fantastic lore setting (Confrontation)2) Good mechanics derived faithfuly from the same tabletop3) Nice graphics  and as they SHOULD be for a tabletop, flashy but not too much heavy for the pc     ( Sometimes you would think that you are looking at an ACTUAL irl table with miniatures)But...as tleast I understood, the game itself suffers from the lack of interest from its developers(it might be because they are developing a similar title atm)1) Few to no updates, thus the mechanics have many imbalances2) Lack of decent solo game modes or new races as the tabletop,new maps or anything similar3) Generaly the spirit to expand and maintain the game is absent I believe that if the developers will put some more interest on it and balance/expand the title, it will be a VEEE RYY GOOD! game,but now unfortounately it suffers from the lack of the most fundamental of things...Still, for a fan of fantasy tabletop settings, I think its easily 7/10but for the rest...some patience is essential (5/10)			"

												After finishing turtorial I took Holy faction (Lions) like I usually do in these kind of games and guess what, their starting units are pretty inferior toward other factions as I've noticed.Other thing I did not like is how badly the coding of a game is. I have big fps drops every time I move a unit, on quad 3.8 cpu with 660 GTX graphic card. I can run starcraft 2 on ultra and CS:GO with 100fps average, but not dogs of war tho.^^Props to the idea of a game but it's still in early phase of a development if you ask me. For a second, please imagine Heroes of Might and Magic game and the amount of units and content when it was released in 1990's, now look at Dogs of War release in 2014. Players lowered their criterias so much today and we really should not. We should not support undeveloped games people, no matter how fun on the first hand they are!			"

												So after reading so many positive reviews on this game and how its not pay to win and it has such a ""tactical approach"" I thought F it, I'll download it. First of all - The game takes you through 3 tutorials which give you page after page of very small text to read in the corner of your screen with very little gameplay, however you could see the potential in the gameplay. After completing the tutorials you are told to pick 1 of 3 factions with 0 explanation to the differences or benefits they offer. So I have my faction and still no real idea on how to play this game I look for an AI battle to practice only to find the ONLY gameplay is to play against other people over the internet. So I clicked find a game and waited..and waited and after 10 minutes it finds me a game! However it appears my opponent had been playing a lot more than me - he explained that my army was not good enough to compete against his and I would ultimately lose. He explained that there is 0 tactics in the game...the person with the biggest army wins especially in the first 5 levels as you are literally fighting in an open field.  Sadly he was right...He obliterated my army with 0 skill...right click this big guy to attack my small guy and *poof* down he goes. My only positive of this game was the nice conversation I had with this guy and how we both laughed at the fact Kings Bounty is a much better game.TL;DR - Dont waste your time, go play Kings Bounty if this type of game appeals to you. There is no skill involved and you can literally buy (with real cash) a big army and win every game.			"

												To determine whether or not you'll hit an enemy, just subtract your unit's Strength parameter by the Dodge parameter of the intended target. Then, divide your unit's Accuracy parameter by the square root of pi, remembering to factor in the quadratic formula using Pascal's principle. Take that value and the opponent's unit level and use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the hypotenuse of the zenith of the parabola. Use the transitive property whenever possible, but only after you have graphed out your Fear attribute as a factored polynomial in accordance with the Riemann Hypothesis. Solve for x, complete the square, show your work, and defend your thesis.Then hit ""End Your Turn"" and begin again.			"

												Game is broken for new players. The game play is average, at most and the wolf faction is a dominating force in the game.Basically you have to familarize yourself with all enemies because you never know what you're up against otherwise. I'm fighting my way through skeletons with my Tank and then a skeleton with a big sword hits me twice in one turn with a 20 and a massive crit, enough to 'one shot' me at full HP. Spent the rest of my game d**king around with my archer taking 2's off their knight and using my knights as fodder. Wolves get an innate 2 hit passive, which is game breaking. Not only are they naturally better at combat but they also move more places. People might say ""that's reasonable because they're wolves"" but I'd tell those people to get lost and after they've gotten lost to play this game against wolves and still genuinely tell me that you prefer some quarter-arsed realism over balancing and enjoyment.I picked the humans because they seemed most mid-ground and even the tankiest. They are dominated in every way at the start game and there is little you can do against players except hope you get lucky. The wolves need to be dampened and the undead already have MASSIVE numbers and free units. Why give them a massive c**t that can hit me for half or more of my HP that's ALSO a tank? More movement spots is balanced. More attacks is not. More numbers is balanced and fun to play with and against. Equally strong units but the ability to spawn in more is not.			"

												To my mind, the game is just good - for sure better than other of its kind (not-so-free-to-play). I'm giving it strong 6/10 and hope for better matchmaking and maybe a singleplayer campaing. Here is a short summary of what I think:+ easy to hop in - hard to master+ nice graphic design+ intuitive controls+ ""Confrontation"" setting+ you really CAN play it without paying and still have fun+ you can paint your units :)- grind hard or be ready to inject the game with dollars- system of matchmaking is unbalanced (or there aren't many players?)- up to now (2014) the collection of available units is not yet epic			"

												Time for me to Uninstall the game...Seriously now,I am deeply disappointed by the direction the dev took on this one.Starting at Patch 0.11, things went downhill for me (see cash shop)Next time I want to loose my time on some [Redacted] P2W game, I will just make my own.PeaceZero			"

												Cannot even play it - cannot create an account - no email is sent. 0/10Ok got the email.Now, what kind of game is it?It has no campaign - the staple of strategy games.Its basically pvp, where you are matched randomly verus opponents you cannot defeat.Basically if you want to win, you pick the 2 elite units, as verus 3 normal you lose every time.Where's the skill or strategy in that?From the tutorial, it looks like it's going to be a good game, shame it doesn't live up to expectations.Basically don't bother downloading it. Time to uninstall..			"

												A good, free alternative to heroes of might and magic: VI, despite having to move only one unit per turn. It'd be so much better if you could move all units... It's still kind of solid so I can only recommend trying.In my opinion, because of the ""one unit per turn"" system making the game more casual, you will not enjoy it for very long; the lack of tactics and low amount of unique unit types soon start to get to you.

												Short but sweet. Fun game, had potential, but sadly the game was abandoned fairly quickly after it hit steam. If you like Might and Magic style combat I'd say this will get you excited for a few hours, then you'll cry yourself into a coma because of how abruptly the gameplay ends and at how you now will always look back to this like it's a crushed childhood memory that could have been reality.I rate this a 9 out of 11, because I will never forget this let down.

												Ok,i'll be quick and short with this game.Actually,the game has a pretty good concept and people that like those table-turnbased games won't be dissatisfied.BUT,the game at this stage is pretty much far away from being complete.Lycans (one of the 3 factions atm) are actually overpowered and by far the best troops when i'm writing this.Humans are so-so but undead are pretty much awfully balanced,making them pretty much way less stronger than they should be and when a good player using lycan meets the good player using undeads,the undead user will be picked aside easily.Also the healing cards thing is pretty meh,you need a lot of 'em and you just can't find them without spending real money most of the times.TL;DR The game itself is good,but it need more time to grow and getting balanced,so you might want to wait some time to try this game.Let's wait for developers and their next move,cheers.

												The game looks like it could be a lot of fun to play....for some reason though, when i try to log in it tells me that i need to verify my email account and it will log me in from there.  But when I have the verification sent to my email I just get the main pic for the game and all i can do is reply.  There is no link for me to verify!!!  So hopefully that gets fixed because I would like to play the game.			"
