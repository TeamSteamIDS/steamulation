												For those of you that consider picking up this game:Europa Universalis: Rome is a game I like very much at the moment, I have not played any other Europa Universalis games and some of them might be better (after I bought the game I heard from people that 3 is better) I however do not regret my purchase since I like the ancient world theme a lot more than almost anything else set in the real world and is for me a tie with the cold war.Why did I like this game?I think It is mechanically very sound, the combat mechanics are very limited but unlike for example civ 4 I do not find it annoying to fight wars and the combat does not distract too much from what works really well with the game.    So what does work really well in the game?  The economic gameplay in the game is solid, it is less about buildings than for example Rome total war 1, however there are various other things that have an influence on the economy such the governors of the province that you can select (very much like Rome total war 1) but also stuff like the people you have chosen to take positions in nationwide politics, the laws you have passed, religious blessings, trade and the kind of civ you have( for example dictatorship monarchy and various kinds of democracies).     That brings me to something else that works pretty well in this game, Politics. The game has 5 political factions that battle (sometimes in case of civil war literally) over political control of your nation. Each factions power can grow or diminish depending on your actions, the populist party will for example gain more political attraction if either peace or war last too long, while the religious faction can grow from invoking blessings on your nation or sacrificing to the gods, but all factions grow from having representatives in important functions for (for example the research positions) the people taking these functions are chosen by you. But on the other side the factions can also influence your decisions, if you don't have the political support in the senate you can't start wars or make use of various other mechanics in the diplomacy interface.What doesn't work?The game doesn't do such a good job of explaining to you what various mechanics in the game do and how they are calculated (I for example still don't know fully how diplomatic skill is calculated) most of it however isn't that annoying and can in a way even increase your enjoyment, since you get the feeling that after your first playthrough you really got to know the game, therefore also giving you an incentive to try another one. It also isn't that bad, now after some wiki reading I think diplomatic skill is the only thing I do not really understand that I would like to understand. The game could however do a better job of presenting its information, the game could for example tell you what the traits characters could gain during events do before you need to selects them. Also I think the game could have been better if the people of your nation belonged to larger but fewer families and give you a better way (for example the family tree in Rome total war 1) to look at these families and their relations to other people in your nationIn the end I sill liked this game very much but it could have been better			"

												First of all, I'd like to say that I'm an experienced but not expert player of the Paradox Games. That means that I've played Hearts of Iron III a few years ago (and enjoyed a Communist Greece, amongst my other ""achievements"") and also love Europa Universalis IV. I saw EU: Rome on Steam and, basically, bought it to give it a try.CONS1) For a 2008 Game, Graphics should've been better.2) Not the variety of factions that HoI3 or EUIV have.3) Steam version forces you to search for the manual here. Also, the tutorial could've been better.4) Surely, not as worth as EUIV but I'd love to try something until HoI4 goes public.5) There are no mods is Steam for this game. Maybe the CD version (regular installation) supports them, but I couldn't find anything here.PROS1) Cheap. 10 euros for a Grand Strategy Game by Paradox. It's God's will!2) The ""Vae Victis"" expansion and all patches are included.3) Historical accuracy and interesting gameplay. It starts with the Invasion of Pyrrhus in Italy and the wars between Romans and Greeks.4) Variety of historical starts. From an early Roman Republic to the Civil Wars and the foundation of the Roman Empire. Yeah!5) Awesome music. That may sound stupid, but have a look at YouTube... Yeah, you're welcome.6) Don't know if it's the way the AI works, but a huge advantage of the game is that factions like Rome, Carthage, Seleucids, Egypt, Macedon and Pontus actually grow up. So, a player gets to experience the ""anxiety"" of fighting Rome in Magna Graecia or Carthage in Africa. If you're a TWR2 player, you'll see a huge difference. Factions like the Illyrians don't consume Empires in no time, like in Rome 2. You hear that CA?I don't guarantee that it'll be an unforgetable experience, but it's a nice, fun game to play, balanced enough for its kind.Have fun! God keep you all safe.			"

												My most played game on Steam, and it deserves a review.Its very indeph with loads of micromanagement, and if you happen to like the timeline, you are welcome to buy it.You can tune it to play it with unlimited time, if that bothers you.What sets it apart from normal EU games, is the barbarian mechanic.There are lots of uncivilized lands where barbarians are uprising all the time, and it takes near the end of the game, to civilize them all. If you play a nation that borders to them, it makes the game very ""fun"" and unpredictible.Also, you can have children and start very long dynasties. Its fun to watch.Combat is very much EU-like and simple. A good general is the most important thing.There is lots to know about the game, you can read on it for a very long time to understand everything indeph.Casus belli, how to play wars, the differences of the political systems and how they work, diplomacy, techtrees, jadda jadda.I enjoyed this good micro/macro strategy for a very long time.Its really hard to beat it with something like a little gallic state that battles the roman empire.But if you make it, it was an experience thats worth it. If not, you want to try again. ;)The only bad thing i have to say about the game, is that it has a nasty bug with soldier loyalty.It randomly applies it to characters that never led an army.But this bug is so nasty, it really dampens the experience.You can play around it, but it simply sux a-s-s, and its a shame Paradox never fixed it, because this is one of their very best games.

												I first started off playing startegy games using hex games, then with my first computer when I played a demo of CIv 1 for the Atari STE. Since then I have played most of the TW series. Especially countless hours on Rome Total War especially modded and yes I like Rome 2 with mods. Recently this year I have started to get into the Paradox titles starting with Crusader Kings 1. I therefore recomend Europa Universalis: Rome - Gold Edition very much. It's Ironic to think that this game has content that the recently released Rome 2 hasn't. Ok it hasn't real time battles as a TW title but I haven't missed it in this game. The depth that is lacking in the former is in Europa Universalis: Rome - Gold Edition			"

												Owning this and comparing it to the other Europa Universlais games, this one is not as in depth... to me at least. For example, you can choose a emmissary to send to an enemy country to declare war on them, which is good to eliminate bad apples in the family because they are usually killed the the enmy country. But unlike in EU3 and EU4, you can't have cabinet members that give your country bonuses ( trade does that, but it's not as interesting). But I do like this more than the other games because: 1. It's a longer game than EU3. I don't know about EU4 because I haven't ever played it. 2. The time setting is much more interesting to me than EU3 and EU4.3. Altough this game looses some features, it also gains ones. For example, the troops in your army can become more loyal to their general than their country. This means if that general has loyal units and decides to start a civil war, you have a problem. But it is not all bad, because the generals pay their troops instead of you so you get more money.Overall, It is a great game and should be bought by Europa Universalis fans. 8/10			"

												If you buy this game, make sure to download the 2.36 beta patch and the reign of the ancients mod from the paradox forums. It makes the game a hundred times better.Also, if you're having trouble installing the mod on windows 10 then follow Thypus's installation instructions instead.1 Have a clean install of the game2 copy the province_texture folder on the map/cache folder and stick it in the desktop for example3 patch to 2.36b in the rome folder4 install the mod in the mod folder5 change the name of the cache folder (in map folder) to cache_vanilla6 create a new folder named cache in map folder and then stick inside the previous province_texture that you have copy in the desktop7 then stick in the mod/map/cache folder the province_texture folder aswellAnd if you have the problem which makes parts of the map blue in terrain view then do this:""you have to follow Thypus's installation instructions and then replace everything in the rome/map/cache folder except the province terrain folder with everything (except the province terrain folder) thats in the mod/map/cache folder.""All of that should only take ten minutes to setup at the most. (as long as you don't mess up)Hope this helped your decision!			"

												I love this game, by far the best Roman game around. The rotateable/tiltable map is the best map Paradox have ever done in any of their games I dont know why they havent do it since. And the mechanics in this game are amazing - its all in here. And the colours are lovely and bright unlike some of their later games (HOI3 I mean you). Ok the city view is rope, the sprites are not great by modern standards, some of the faces look a bit daft, but the fact there are family characters in this game, like appeared in CK2, makes it very interesting. I would probably have to say overall this game is second only to Crusader Kings 2 in terms of immersion. I so prefer Victoria 2's time period mind. But unlike Viictoria 2 the whole world is up for grabs in this game, much like in CK2. You are spoiled for choice in terms of expansion possibiltiies.Definitely recommended if you can get past the rather dated graphics, although these still stand up quite well thanks to the lovely map and superb interface.

												Europa Universalis Rome is Paradox's attempt at creating a game to bridge the gameplay gap between the great but somewhat generic grand strategy of Europa Universalis and the personal management and dynastic aspects of Crusader Kings. Unfortunately this is not a marriage made in heaven and the two styles does not mix well in this game.Rome is a grand strategy game, you pick your nation among those that were around at whatever start date you chose and then go about doing what ever you please. War, trade, diplomacy, like in other Paradox grand strategy games you can play your country however you please but the game is still geared heavily in the favor of warfare. You will simply gain more and gain it faster by taking it from others.Introduced in this game is a myriad of characters that rule your cities and lead your armies all with their own traits, preferences and family relations. Unlike in Crusader Kings you don't have your own family tree in this game but instead simply try to manage your various powerful subjects in this manner. Although this is a great idea in principle it is fairly poorly executed. Managing the many, many characters available to you is a huge task that only grows larger as the game goes on and if you chose to ignore the micromanagement for too long you might have a revolt on your hands.Rome is a game that brings a lot of cool aspects together from two very great game but it is also a game that has a lot of issues with implementation and execution that makes it a chore to play at times. It is still a Paradox grand strategy and that means there is quality underneath it all but it is still the weakest one in their lineup.			"

												Europa Universalis: Rome is a game that uses EUIII engine with some changes to make it stand out as a true simulator of the Roman rule. You will have the ability to expand the most powerful empire of the Ancient Times, while keeping your domestic enemies and rivals at bay. The graphics of this game are definitely outdated, but if that isn't an issue for you, then EU:R deserves your attention. Even those, who played EUIII before, will find something new to learn here, such as the loyalty system of the Roman army. But be prepared to the challenging mechanics and sometimes quite-not-so-obvious rules and peculiarities of the gameplay. Also, it's cheap and the DLC is included.+ Excellent music+ Excellent historical correctness+ Many starting options from different historical periods+ Huge amount of strategy options to approach your empire management- The resolution is pretty terrible.- The tutorial of the game clearly overestimates the game's simplicity.That's, I think, about it. I hope you enjoy the game.			"

												So when reviews went public, this still had more ""personal note"" than anything else.So...Europa Universalis: Rome is a great game. It has the geo-political drama of Europa Universalis III, and some of the more underlying personal politics of Crusader Kings (albeit not to the extent of either). The game was built on the EUIII engine, so it's starting to show its age, and Paradox has not updated it for quite a while, to them, this game is complete. I digress, it is a lot of fun to destroy Carthage, to subjegate the classical world under your yoke and form the greatest European Empire to have existed. Or it's just as much fun to stymie the Romans and dominate the Mediterranean as a Carthage hegemony...no, ""Delende est Cartago!""			"

												If, like me, you are an armchair general and a casual mega-lo-maniac - then you will love this game. If you've played other similar turn based strategy games like Hearts of Iron(2 or 3), Europa Universalis III. Essentially they're not turn based but you can control time and pause the game. But this like the aforementioned titles is very good. The game starts around 470 AD to about 700AD and the map is of the known world around the time of Caesar. The characters, political desires and backstabbing is brilliant. It is a dramatic theatre overlayed with a nation building game. Treat your Generals and politicians well and they will look after you, if you appease the Populists too much your nation will suffer! It's not as easy as EUIII nor even HoI for that matter. While Hearts of Iron has a ton more detail and much bigger scale, the political juggling and people management in EU Rome is testing. It will keep you glued.			"

												I am typically a fan of all things Rome.  This game had great potential, however it was ultimately brought down by a lack of committment to turn it into a polished product with a truly Roman feel.  It is based off of the EU III engine with a few minor tweaks which actually add a level of confusion to gameplay.  The character system seems arbitrary and is not well explained at all. Even with several traits and families competing for Roman senate dominance it is difficult to get a sense of attachment or feeling with any of them.   Finding suitable generals is a huge task, and requires a character to hold several government positions before taking command of a Legion.  The whole feel of the game feels like a forced integration between CKII and the EU series.  With all of that said, you will spend most of your time waiting for something interesting to happen so that you may expand your Roman Empire.  Do yourself a favor, and pick up EU IV instead, which contains a great deal of Rome mods in the Steam workshop.			"

												As is typical of Paradox Interactive's ""gap"" titles, EU: Rome is not very remarkable. It is a game that could have been quite good, but was ultimately left by the wayside as its developer moved on to more significant projects. If you look at the developer's history of releases, you'll find that that it very often intersperses minor, derivative releases between its major titles. These titles are almost without exception unpolished and unimpressive, and EU: Rome fits that bill perfectly. You'll find that the gameplay is very similar to that of EU3, with necessary variations that were poorly implemented. Even the expansion pack, Vae Victis, was not enough to salvage this game, and neither were the relatively few major mods released for it. It's a shame, really, as the Roman era was an interesting time, and the foundations of this game were relatively well-conceived; had it received the necessary attention, it could have been a very entertaining title. While it may look attractive---it appears, to the casual eye, as EU3 in the Roman period---this game  just isn't very good.			"

												The game is excelent, however, it constantly crashes. Despite installing patches, running on compatibility mode, etc., playing is impossible if you lose your progress every few years.			"

												Man do I love the concept of this game! It is a wonderfull mix between EU en CK, 2 games I adore in a time setting I love most of all.... Impossible to get working though. Tried it all: patches, mods, the whole lot of it. Can't play more then 20 min if it launches at all. I really hope Paradox makes a EU:Rome 2 or something because I sadly am not able to enjoy this title.			"

												This game hasn't aged very well at all, and everything it offers has been done a lot better in both EU III and CK II. It might serve as an introduction to the Grand Stratergy genre, but at the same time might distract from it. It's smaller and less in depth than the rest of the games on offer from Paradox now.			"

												I find this game as a mash up between the Crusader King series and the Europa Universalis series and those 2 series should be seperated and that is why they are.I tried this game a long time ago and recently bought it to try it again and its smooth but can be very agitating; plus there are better games out there like EU:IV, CK2, if you have no nostalgia with this game and are coming from newer Paradox titles you will dislike this game.Funny: I was playing as Rome and fighting barbarians in the north, colonizing and the game didn't tell me anything that I SHOULD OF SEEN, I scrolled down and I saw half of Italy was taken over by a newly formed faction.

												Redheaded stepchild of greater Paradox titles, this game does features some unique features such as the Roman Senate, with factions competing for influence. It sits at a crossroads between the nation-management of Europa Universalis, and the character management of Crusader Kings.However, these little bits of good do not outweigh the basic fact that the gameplay is clunky and unintuitive when compared to other (both newer and older) paradox titles.Basically, if you have played any other Paradox grand strategy games, the mechanics are all the same, but all more cumbersome to carry out in their own way.

												i LOVE this game. One of the best paradox games out there. but it just simply doesnt run on modern systems.. i try to play it, but it crashes at sportatic times, one time it crashes as soon as i click ""singleplayer"", the other five hours into a world conquest where i hadnt saved at all, thinking it finally worked. to summarize; it simply doesnt work. the game is amazing, but the compatiblity isn't. if anyone knows a fix, let me know. i love this game, but it simply won't run reliably.

												Not a great game!It is similar to Europa Universalis IV, but somehow quite lacking in everything! The good:- Same as Europa Universalis IV, but with roman country and army name of the time- The sound and music were ok- The family tree and traits of the leaders of Rome are interesting and bring more color to the game. You can have children, friends and rivals! Some of your leaders are completely useless just like in real life! Internal political bickering from time to time is fun.The bad:- The game doesn't even work after you install it via steam. You have to fetch the latest beta patch 2.36C from the Paradox forums to make it work (hassle)- Research seems to take forever. So you got nothing to build most of the time (i tried only the earliest campaign. Maybe you have already unlocked research in the later ones). Still its far too slow compared to EU4. Also the 5 leaders you assign to research don't seem to change anything at all.- The concept of claiming a territory is still present in this game, except you cannot claim new territories like in EU4. This concept is that when you invade a territory, you cannot annex it and add it to your empire unless you have (or forged) a claim on it. Most of my diplomats time were spent doing that in EU4. In this game, it seems you can't annex a territory unless you conquer the whole ennemy territories. That's pretty bad! Some of the ennemy has 15 or more territories and becomes an almost impossible task to do!- You can colonise unclaimed territories from barbarians, but not if the strength of the barbarians is too high! So you need to wait forever for them to do an uprising and crush it to lower their strength and then colonise (Never happened after years(in game) of play). That is a very bad concept right there. - For some reason, a 2 territory empire can witstand the mighty rome empire consisting of 8 territories plus the super lucrative Rome territory(which is equalt to 4-5 territories on its own)! I swear the freakin...g Epirus had an army of 20 troops when i could barely foot 36 troops in the field. They also had an 11 trireme navy! And they managed to attack me 2-3 times with 11 troops? WTF! How could they make that much money to support their troops? How could they even build that many troops in the first place? You can only build one troop at a time on one territory and it takes 90 days for the cheapest troops, the other takes longer if you have the ressources for it. The guy had horses which even rome didn't have for god sake and elephants!!!- The game feel pretty flat compared to EU4. I don't know it's like its empty somehow.Now i didn't play the xpansion vae victus. Not sure i will play either.Verdict: Don't waste your money on this game. Play the much better Europa Universalis 4 which this game is based on.Or go play Distant Worlds, a faaaaaaaar better game than EU4 in my experience as a strategy game and its in spaaaaaace!			"

												This holds up if you are into Roman themed strategy games. This is an under appreciated game, a pre-cursor to Crusader Kings 2. Sort of a strange hybrid of EU and CK. My biggest criticism is the colonization system that leaves much of the map without any major factions at start, thus making the game play almost exclusively a battle of ancient superpowers. Another issue is the micromangement is a little too heavy. I enjoy it for the most part, but it becomes tiresome after awhile.			"

												A very challenging and well made game, which brilliantly mixes mechanics from both Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis. It presents a grand and well designed campaign, where both strategy and luck are needed to grow your nation and conquer the known world, while at the same time managing your internal politics and maintaining your empire.A definite must have for any strategist with an interest in the Classical Era.

												Europa Universalis: Rome is a Pausable Real-Time Grand Strategy Game (woah that was a mouthful) developed by the ♥♥♥♥ing awesome Paradox Development Studio. Released in 2008, the game is what would be considered a ""budget game"", basically a side project to vary from the big projects they were working on. But just because this is a budget game doesn't mean it's not good!! You can play as any major (and some minor) faction ranging from 280 BC to 33 BC, and guide the nation through all aspects like religion, politics, economy, military, etc... It has a small learning curve but by the time you learn you will be HOOKED!!Sure the graphics are outdated, but what self respecting PC strategy gamer cares about graphics?? The gameplay is a wonderful blend of high level empire management made famous by the main Europa Universalis series, and the character system of Crusader Kings II. It's an overall great game that still gets attention (PDS is the greatest game company ever, and they have a wonderful practice where they go back and update their old games out of nowhere!).So buy this game (2.49 USD on sale, so why the hell not!!) and lose yourself in the world of Rome and it's politics!!Si vis pacem, para bellum			"

												Good: -ancient setup, although I wouldn't mind one even further back in time (it would also make the factions more balanced); -old style Europa Universalis game where the AI doesn't cheat beyond today, tomorrow and the next 10 years and one big country can't get defeated easily because ""muh gameplay balance""; -unique elements, it combines a bit of CK2 style (characters) but more EU3 (country management) but unlike the latter you can declare war whenever you want; -the Roman artwork, the gfx were great for its time and genre and still look good enough, you can also see the buildings inside your cities, unlike other EU games; Bad: -not much repleability because there aren't enough countries, a big enough map or unique enough civilizations (buildings, units, ideas, religions are basically the same for everyone but with a different name although you'll ofc get elephants with Carthage and so on, depending on the resources you start out with).
