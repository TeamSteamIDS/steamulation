												I initiallly played the game back in January of 2012, so I'm sure the game has changed somewhat since I last played it due to updates, but I imagine my comments still apply. Battle Academy is a turn-based tactical WWII strategy game where you can command various infantry, tank, transports, etc across a tile based battlefield. The UI and clear presentation make it approachable for players without a lot of war game experience. Even though war is a serious subject, the story in the campaign is presented in a pretty light-hearted comic book / graphic novel style.The game has three campaigns covering North Africa, D-Day and the Ardennes. I enjoyed my time with Battle Academy. Movement, line of sight, and morale, along with detailed combat factors make for interesting battles. When I initially played the game the UI shrouded many of the details factored into combat, but the easy-to-mod data files and scripts do offer up all of the juicy bits. I actually modded the game so the UI exposed more of the factors (and I'm not a big modder, although I do have  a software development background). This lack of information was the biggest drawback for me, but more data may now be exposed by the UI without modding because according to the patch notes some more advanced tool tips were added. The scenarios provide enough of a challenge for victory with the option to try for more difficult achievements, accommodating a variety of skill levels. Ambushes and bombardments keep the tension up as you fear for the virtual soldiers traversing the open ground. Expansions, user-created content, and multi-player options should extend the game's shelf life. If interested you can visit my full review[www.oneguytoomanygames.com].			"

												Not quite Close Combat or Panzer General but pretty close.TL;DR = A fun turn based historical squad and platoon sim for beginners or veterans = 8/10.Basic tactics are well done, terrain will affect view and protection.  Dismouted Scouts, wheeled & tracked Recce Vehs / APCs (Sdkfz 234/1 armored car, Sdkfz 251/16 half-track and more) are used  to peel back the fog of war, and find the soft targets that cannot otherwise be seen until they fire upon you.   Light, Medium and Heavy Armour options exist, (M5s, Shermans, Fireflys, PNzr II. III, Panthers, Tigers, Jagdpanthers, Marder, Hummel, British Matilda 1&2, French FT-17 Lt Tk, R35 Med Tk, Char Bis & Somua 35 Heavy Tk, Italian  Autoblinda 41 armoured car, Carro Armato L640, Fiat 3000 and more) to soften up Infantry or take out opposition vehicles.  Then infantry of several types (Scouts / Engineers / Waffen SS / Paratroops / FJ / Commandos / Rangers / Flamethrowers etc) may attack against a wide variety of AT / MG guns and other Inf.  - There are many, many more unit types - however - the widest variety of units may only be accessed by buying several of the DLCs. Some scenarios have onboard indirect fire i.e. Mortars and Assault Guns, some scenarios have offboard Artillary / Naval Guns / or Airstrikes (Stukas, Hurricanes, P47s), there is as well some AA & SPAA.  Most every scenario and campaign in the main game and DLC is played from the Allied side where one can pfight as US/ UK/ and Canadian units - there are as well a few Axis scenarios and a short campaign where one can fight as the Germans against mostly the French and UK. The commercial scenarios are pretty fun and plentiful -  however the DLC price hit for each new campaign is a bit of a downer.  I liked the scenarios / campaigns but there is way too much nickle and diming for my tastes, (the mod scene is however very active with a large # of homebrew single and multi-player scenarios). A fairly gentle learning curve starts things off easy for noobs and although it may be too easy for vets, it soon ramps up so that one has to use realistic tactics to crack differant tactical problems.  Commanders will soon be wondering where to spend or save their scenario options like medic points (reviving injured soliders), leader points (to rally squads with low / broken morale); as well most campaigns let you earn and spend scenario points to buy new units or upgrade your combat team's resources. Gamers raised on fully-3D games may not like the graphics, but for what it is and what it should be compared to I liked it's simple and effective style; the terrain and units were easy to discern and therefore orient yourself on the ground and to the enemy. I do however wish the camera controls were a little better. In the end not quite as detailed tactically as the newer Close Combat games, nor quite as addictive as the old PGen series, but still a good game with plentiful scenarios.  As is the game will keep most grognards entertained and still fun for new players. - Fun:  8/10- Historical Interest: 7.5/10- Ease of learning, continual challenge: 7.5/10- Replay Value: 6/10 (if you don't mind using the editor to make mods then 8/10)- Presentation / GUI: 7.5/10 (I like the comic book intros & transitions...)- Value for your $: 7.5/10 (good game but don't nickle us with each DLC being so short.) == Overall: 80%			"

												Solid war-game that brings the hobby into the 21st century for both new players and old. No longer do I have my cardboard chints to push around, but a more visually enjoyable set of troop counters. This game is perfect for those unfamiliar with the war-gaming experience and has plenty of battles to work through. Even experienced grognards will find this game rewarding.  The game was developed with the help of Historians to make sure the tactics, scenarios and the firepower represent that which was fought in WW2 battles. Battles are influenced to some extent by your performance.  It has a following of players who have also developed custom scenarios to play solo and multiplayer.  The game is completely scripted which allows you to create your own missions and scenarios in a rather simple and effective way. I recommend it as a fun and entertaining war-game.  "

												As an old-time wargamer who used to create his own armies out of plastic model kits and figurines, I have to say that I really like this game. It reminds me of the old beer-and-pretzels games that I used to play back in the day. It makes sense that the game was built this way considering that it was originally commissioned by the BBC (yes, that BBC). That explains the graphics and the square grid maps. I know it looks like a Litchtenstein painting. Get over that. It's quite a good game. This is simple, get-to-it wargaming. Are some of the scenarios easy? Yes, but others (especially the customs mods) can be a nice challenge. Also, don't forget the multi-player options. Remember, it's wargaming. Not war.  "

												The BA series will appeal to the WWII gamer who appreciates a balance between ease of play, graphics and depth of strategy/logistics. Quite easy to learn the basics of BA, takes a bit of experience to utilize the various units to the their maximum. The strategies are important if you wish to do well and keep your units alive, yet, not too large of a learning curve. Graphics are somewhat  ""comic book"" in nature, not in a derogatory way at all, quite like them. Perfect for getting into a scenario quickly, finishing or playing as long as you like, saving, and coming back later.If you are looking for very in depth logistics or cutting edge graphics, this isn't the product for you. For relatively low learning curve, fun graphical content, great sound effects, many types of units and terrain, you can't beat the BA franchise. Would love to see Slitherine produce a campaign version of this product. Perhaps with enough interest we could convince them.			"

												It's as good as mentioned in the store page: ""Approachable, absorbing and visually impressive yet detailed."", BA is a mixture of really simple look and well balanced content.At first glance, BA looks very simple, so simple that you don't even consider it a tactical game. While in actual gaming you find out that BA consists of almost every elements you need in a tactical game.It's good for both new gamers and experienced gamers.			"

												Battle Academy is one of those titles that you'd consider buying, if it doesn't have the in-app-purchases that nickels and dimes you for additional campaigns and whatnot. Set in a simplified version of WW2, you move units on a square grid. Youa re primarily taking the British side against the Axis powers, Italians and Germans, and the initial campaign is in Africa, where you take the Desert Rats and the Matilda tanks against the Italians and later, Rommel's Afrika Corps. The battlefield is 3D, albeit with very clunky camera controls, and it's likely that this was a mobile game backport (as it's also available in the App Store for iOS)  The idea is your unit have 2 movement points and 2 shooting points, spend them wisely. Flanking the enemy is good, as hitting the enemy at their strong armor will cause a ""deflection"". But the general idea is simple: medium tanks against light tanks, light tanks against infantry to suppress, suppress hidden infantry then attack with your own infantry.  There are 3 levels of difficulty, and ability to allocate your own force mix before battle, as well as fog of war. The overall mechanics are very simple, and thus, is only suitable for noobs who needs handholding to the genre of wargames. Veterans will likely be turned off by the simplified and somewhat cartoony feel, constant onscreen reminders of certain game mechanics (which may be due to me playing in easy mode) and overall in-game playments.

												Well I can only describe this as a fantastic good ol' fashioned ww2 limited turns strategy board game with excellent sound effects and grahics. Bought it at xmas for £7 and its gotta be the bargain of the year. if you enjoy ww2 stratergy arcade type games you will want this. Theres plenty of missions plus more from users you can download via the game. If they were only this good in the early noughties life would of been good. Have not come across any issues graphics or sound wise, Playability wise theres three levels, installs and runs great straight out the box. you can zoom in and outta the map for better effects or for those commanders who like to see all. Great fun 4 everyone !			"

												Took me a very long time to realize that this comes pretty close to the old Steel Panthers games.Steel Panthers used to be my favorite game - in the latter nineties - and I've missed that gameplay a lot, until..Battle Academy looks different, but the basic gameplay is pretty much the same, especially if you choose the top view.The in game graphics are ok, far better than the majority of rehash wargames, but far from cutting edge. The gui is ancient. However the game play is great, and although Battle Academy is easy to learn and enjoy, it has enough challenge to cater for more hard core wargamers. Note, the game is not about realism, however the tactical gameplay is fun.Unfortunately BA doesn't come with a skirmish mode, but the core game and dlc offer plenty of play time.Battle Academy 2 is even better, with its fine tuning, Eastern Front armored clashes and a skirmish mode which ensures replayability.Nevertheless I can highly recommend the original Battle Academy, but be sure to get the full collection as it saves you a lot of money.

												This is a great little game. It is one of those games that finally allowed me an access point to all those RTS titles I have in my Steam library. At last a game that teaches you strategy while steadily amping up the difficulty level. The graphics are surprisingly detailed yet fun at the same time. There is a huge variety of missions especially if you get the complete pack. There is enough complexity to also keep more experienced wargamers interested. I was really surprised at how good this game is. My only negative would be the rather steep price especially for the complete game, given the fact that for all intents and purposes it is a souped up Ipad port. However it is done really well and if you are willing to shell out you won't be disappointed and are in for hours of replayable fun!			"

												This is a simple but challenging World War Two turn-based strategy game that's surprisingly better than Panzer Corps because the enemy doesn't receive unlimited reinforcements, doesn't have twice the numbers you start with, and the probabilities aren't stacked massively against you after the tutorial. There are so many campaigns to choose from, and for British grownups there's a happy reminder of ""Warlord"" comic and the games of toy soldiers we played as children. For ""serious"" wargamers, it's the price of travelling to set up your models, fanny about moving them for six hours then putting them away again and going home afterwards. As someone who's been playing wargames for thirty-five years, I give this little gem nine out of ten. There are one or two things that could be improved (such as speed of movement), but in general I believe that this is great fun for everyone.			"

												I won't go into a description of what the game is, as so many reviews have and the store page is self-explanatory.To all those gaming ""snobs"" who turn their noses up at mobile ports, but like this - remember, this was an IOS and Android App before going to PC.As such, and this is something I like about mobile ports, is that the presentation can look like a graphic novel in it's briefings and story telling. The units themselves are almost cell-shaded, but stopped short of the black borderline. They look great and behave well.This is similar to ""Panzer General II"", but only in how units are represented and that it is a TBS. Someone mentioned ""Steel Panthers, but not even close. Nor is it ""Close Combat"". Not as Hradcore as ""Panzer Corps"", and at a far smaller scale, it is closer to HexWar Games releases. If you play on EASY you will have an easy tie of it, losing no untis and winning but that will get old very fast. NORMAL to HARD is a must for longevity of interest.A word about the DLC - over-priced, as Slitherine and Matrix only know how. They are good though, so get them in a Steam Sale.Overall: 7/10			"

												it's not a bad t-rpg. However, it has some flaws that I'd rather not recommend it unless it's on very cheap price. I would rate it neutral, but there is no option unfortunately. It has a unique experience of how to use infantry, because if they are out in the open, they will be gone pretty quick. Learning how to take care of infantry is essential. Considering that the title is based on actual battles during World War 2, you get to learn few historical facts which I appreciated. Generally speaking, defense has more advantage than offense. Don't be fooled by cartoon graphic. It will be challenging time to time. The reason for down vote. The graphics and UI did not age well. The movement of units and camera is very awkward as well as the animation. The sound effect seems out of balance. Some sound too loud when some are too quiet. The music may become too redundant after awhile. you may unintentionally click a unit to move when you were just trying to drage the map. The unit designs are too cheap. If few graphic values were improved, this may have become more classic, but it lacks to be a PC classic on my standard. Also. the DLC prices are over priced. When it's on sale, the dlc is more expensive than the core game if I remember correctly and it is unacceptable from my perspective. I do not know how long each campaigns are, but I highly doubt if they exceed the main core campaign length. dlc is optional purchase so I will conclude my further complaint about the price, but I won't be purchasing any of $60 dlc and $20s on sale but even that is over priced. While I did certainly enjoyed some aspect of the title, I cannot recommend it due to I would say un-finished-mobile-port to PC graphic decisions.			"

												Two things right off the bat.  1) The game is Awesome !  and 2) The tutorial is Absolutely Horrible.Yes, no typos there, but lemme take a moment to elaborate.  Let's get the tutorial out of the way.Okay, so the tutorial's out of the way.  No, I'm really not kiddin', there's almost zilch, zero nada in the tutorial, and it's set up in a very odd way, with lotsa buttons to attempt to click that do nothing and no helpful guide to any advanced strategies or tactics.  I'm sure there are probably some very helpful guides out there for all those things, but they are definitely NOT in the tutorial.At any rate, I found I could and did learn all I needed to know by going selecting the first campaign at the top and just plunging into the game headfirst.  There was quite a bit of trial-and-error initially, and the game doesn't give you a lot of 'prestige-type-purchasing-power' like you may be used to in games like Panzer General or Panzer Corps.  In fact, once you're in a battle, there's NO accrual of prestige or ability to purchase new units, etc.  You only get options to do that at the start of the missions, but before you throw in the towel on that being a horrible idea, I'll  explain.You'll get a select # of units that are coming on each mission w/o fail and at no cost.  You'll also have a limited amount of purchasing power to add key beneficial units as you see fit, and there are also limitations on just how many of each of those useful units are available as well.  Part of the real challenge in this game is making sacrifices on what you'd RATHER have and what you can AFFORD to have ... these aren't always the same thing.  Example: I'd RATHER have 2 25pdr arty units, and there are 2 available, but I need to have another Sherman Tank instead, or I need another engineering unit and a transport, etc.  You'll quickly start to learn to 'make do' and discover just how much use you can milk out of units you might otherwise completely disregard.It gets better.  The first few missions are pretty easy-breezy.  Then it starts to get tougher.  Then it starts to get A LOT tougher !  At that point, you'll start to think 'there isn't any way I can complete this mission given what I have at my disposal !'  And about the time you think that, reinforcements will start to show up !  I found the pacing of my need for more units vs the actual arrival of new units to be almost hand-to-glove in the first campaign.There are a lot of things to learn, tactically, that will improve your odds of winning.  You'll pick a lot of these up as you play.  Or you can probably track down a guide to learn more about them.  I'm probably running outta room on this review!  Best of luck if you get the game, and Happy Hunting!			"

												Battle Academy is a fun turn-based tabletop tactics game that reminds me of my old hex-map, counters and dice days, except BA does all the die rolls and result table look-ups for you. Don't expect sprawling maps or dazzling graphics, this is a minimalist game, but it's great for a few minutes of fun at the end of a long day when you have neither the time or the brain cells for an evening-long gaming slog. I got mine on sale and think I got a good gaming value for the money. If you're intruiged by WWII armor combat and your gaming time is limited, I would recommend it.			"

US Rifleman have an advantage over British and German Riflemen thanks to their Garand semi-auto rifles.The Panther tank has excellent front armour, but very poor side armour.The cost is a little extortionate, especially for add-on packs.

												At first I didn't think much of it, but it's not a bad game. There's plenty of units to go around and I like the environments too, (Of the first 3 campaigns, the game and the DLC are overpriced. I got them on the Humble Bundle) before every mission you get some base units, you have extra points which you can use to get additional units, like more of a specific type of tank or infantryman, like the AT infantry who are good at taking care of tanks, the regular infantrymen who take care of enemy infantry for you, I don't think the germans are playable with the base game (Other than in skirmish?) but with DLC they might be. If you're gonna buy any DLC you might as well but it all for 20 euro rather than buy them all singularily for 70 or so. That's a straight rip-off. The base game offers some challenging missions, and offers the battle of Normandy, Africa and the Ardennes. All from the side of the Allies.Overall it's a good turn-based game which is sadly overpriced. I don't know what I'll do when I finish the main game's campaign but I'm thinking of buying the DLC for 20 euro.			"

												A very solid turn-based WWII strategy game. The campaign missions are varied and challenging, and there are no noobs in multiplayer. Every scenario will test your knowledge of WWII era units (infantry, armor, special forces and support vehicles), and  how to effectively use those units on the battle field. If you dig the Civ and/or X-Com series', this is worth a look!			"

												Purchased this from Slitherine a year before it was on steam so I've played it for many hours.  Not the best strategy WW2 game I've played , but it is tactical level combat and I will say movement is very critical to survival, so unless you love getting Rekt by Ai , dont rush around the map trying to take objectives to fast without scouting.

												It plays like an old style Avalon Hill board wargame.  I like this game since it has the fog of war and is very easy to play.  Some of the newer games are too complex and do not recreate the feel of battle with the panic when something goes wrong.			"

												Easy to learn, quick and fun. Has three levels of difficulty.  If you dont have time for a grognard level game this will give you your fix. Fights remind me of tthe Panzer General series of games but on a smaller scale. Sqiad and tank level.			"

												This game is great to play. Strategically is quite realistic as tanks can't see into cover locations, s you have to coordinate your tanks with the infantry to advance safely. Otherwise you mught fall into an ambush and lose your units!Artillery barrages are quite real to, laying waste into large areas and hitting random locations within them.The graphics are OK and it's great fun to hear the italian soldiers swearing (in italian) when they get shot at.The only downside is the UI - you can't exit the game between battles, and then you can only exit to the desktop, it would be nice to be able to exit to the main menu. Also I don't see any bookeeping in the campaingn level, each campaign is just a series of missions which you can play in any order you want.There are 4 campaigns more a couple of them in DLC should you want to play more.Overall it's a very nice game, although it could do with a better UI.

												Fun little game, but beware the limitations of any turn based system: mobile units such as tank destroyers do not transfer well into turn based system as their entire purpose for existing was to never get into a stand up fight.  Allied tanks in general are lacking in their only historical advantage, numbers.  Graphics are good and it's well styalized, but not the greatest choice for RTS veterans.			"

												AHHH! What could I said about this wonderfull game? I first played it in 2012 and I was amazed by the game in general. Multiple detailled unit, no life point (like in real life), a great turn-basede game. The problem was that I didn't buyed it (it was illegal and i'm not proud of it). Now, when I heard that the game was going on steam, I was obliged to buy it.This is a must-buy. So hurry up, maggot!			"

												I absolutely love the games Slitherine releases and Battle Academy is one of their best product. Pros;-After playing this many hours on end I still have not completed all the campaigns it has to offer, meaning there is tons of content.-Easy to learn, hard to master. In other words it's easy to learn how to play the game since it only requires the use of the mouse but there are loads of variables in game that make it hard to effective right off the bat (which occurs at realistic difficult, it is definately the difficulty setting you want to stick to)- Replayability in the form of Normandy skirmishes + allied special assaignments + axis special assaignments + if you want to restart every campaign from the beginning upon having completed it.-Sound effects are pretty good in general, love the sound of machine gun fire, rifles shooting, infanrty yelling in their native tounges telling you weather they are suppressed or retreating. They could of done a better job on tank guns however.-Satisfaction is garenteed when you manage to claw victory from the jaws of defeat, or when you destroy superior german armor with weaker allied armor-Tanks have realistic armor values, strongest armor up front, weak on sides, weakest at the rear. You can pivot units on a tile so that they face the enemy with their stongest armor.-Different ""power ups' per level ranging from carpet bombing, to strafing runs, arty strikes, to Medic (being able to heal one dead troop in an infantry squad), to resupply (resupplying AT charges on infantry units that have used them up) etc.-Different maps with different terrain layout in each level-LOS mechanic which is fair, if infantry, Fixed AT are in buildings or bushes they are invisible until they fire repeatedly or are spotted by other infantry. Scouts have longer LOS than other units but aren't that great in combat.-Game braking bugs are non-existant (or rare idk if any one else has run into major problems but my version has run smoothly since I installed it)-scenarios are not too long nor are they too short, about 20-25 mins per scenarios (there is also a save feature if you want to save the current mission you are playing)Cons(some may be pros for certain ppl):-Graphics are hit n miss for some. Meaning some won't mind how it looks while others will find it a bit trash. They're not next gen but they're not that bad. -Power ups mentioned before like Arty strike, strafing runs , bombing runs do not show which tiles they effect. You need to guess where it's gonna hit and place the markers infront of advancing enemies so that they run into the effected area. Some may take serveral turns before they land which is something to consider.-Certain sound assets arent great i.e. tanks fireing, tanks engines, truck engines etc.-Ground forces focus only, you'll never get to fully control Air units or Naval units (you only get to call in air or naval support, you can't control fighter squadrons or ships)-No base building, you only get the units you choose at the start + reinforcements after several turns(in certain scenarios)-In game UI isn't great could definately use more work.-A bit too easy on lower difficulty, and even realistic is a medium challenge at times it does get a lot harder in campaigns like Sea Lion and Market Garden.-The Game is very pricey to get all these expansion campaigns I suggest you wait for a sale since it's with all the campaigns that the game truely shines (it's lack luster in content in vanilla I found)Conclusion: If you enjoy wargames this is deffinately a no brainer,  if you're new to war games Battle Academy is just as accomedating. So pick it up on sale and you won't regret your purchase!			"

												If you love turn-based tactics, this is the game for you.  Units are reasonably realistic, with strengths and weaknesses that reflect their real-world counterparts.  Battles and campaigns are intriguing, fun, and easy to pick up for an hour or two when you have time.  There are a number of user-submitted scenarios to increase your play time, and many scenarios offer configurable TO&E.			"

												I believe that this may be a mobile port.  No matter.  Surprisingly deep turn based war strategy.  TONS of scenarios.  The base game has a bunch, and there are dlc scenarios.  My favorite part about this game is how quickly it moves.  No long winded animations that take forever.  All troops move and act quickly.  I have only played a handful of scenarios so far, but they were good.  well thought out and historically accurate.  Customizable troop loadout with pre battle hiring.  If you are a srategy lover, especially turn based tactical games, this is worth a look.  If slitherine puts it on sale with all the dlc go for that!  Hurry, they dont't always do sales.			"

												For those considering purchasing this game:1) TypeBattle Academy is not an RTS and it is not a traditional (that means turn based) strategy game either.  It is a mix.  If you find that there are themes in both types that appeal to you, then this game may be quite pleasing.  However, because it is a mixed breed, the game most likely will  not satisfy hard core gamers of either type.  2) Type: historical accuracyThis game is a game based on historical events, the second World War.  While nowhere as near as historicaly accurate as a game like Panzer Corps, this game is much better then what you see in most history-based strategy games, especially the ones from this time period.   For example, don't expect to see game play including the Soviet Union nuking Nato powers, Russian soldiers executing Western Allied soldiers (like downed pilots), ect.  3) ViabilityThis game has so much content!!! The series also has two games, not one and the first game has more content then most series do. 4) FunThis game merges really fun, creative and innovative mechanics while keeping the game historically accurate and realistic.  I highly recommend this game to all WWII history fans/gamers, and recommend it to the rest of the gaming community.  This is not the best WWII strategy game out there, not even close, but it's well worth the price tag and will appeal to larger portions of the gaming community.			"

												I am suprised. Long time I didn't play such balanced and nicely created game. I am old wargamer and I recommend this to all wargamers. It reminds me old days with Steel Panters II and also Panzer General a bit. There is only one thing I am not sure of. Angle of view for units. Sometimes it happens that I engage tanks from back or side and they are still able to see me and shoot at me. Tanks have poor visibility against infantry and this factor was not really taken into account. However fantastic game....9/10. Will buy also DLC megapack for sure.			"

												This game reminds me of Panzer General, but in a more simple setup.  The developers have done a good job researching the various units and operations, but buying the main game and all the DLCs can be a tad on the pricey side.  If you are on the fence about the game I would wait for a sale, but I think it is well worth the purchase.			"

												Purchased the full kit and I am quite satisfied on the whole. The following is a simple list of positives and negatives followed by a brief assessment.Positives-Low hardware requirement means that this should run on just about any device-Strategy that is relatively easy to pick up but with plenty of depth once you learn more about each unit and the different types of commands-Each unit feels different with their own strength, weaknesses and capabilities-Lots of different scenarios (with DLC) that offer a lot of game time and variety-Perfect for the busy individual with its server based turn system in multiplayerNegatives-The speed of units moving after executing a move or waiting for the opponent’s end of turn can be a bit jarring-Sound bites of units moving, firing or (gods forbid) screaming etcetera, range from very average to almost insufferable and can take a bit of getting used to-A repetitive music track that can be a bit boring when you notice itAssessmentA true thinking person’s WW2 strategy game that is perfect for the determined individual whom wishes to earn or prove their tactical prowess. Would recommend to lovers of the WW2 genre and turn based strategy that want a good challenge.			"

												Battle Academy is a good strategy game. It has a bit of Panzer General and a bit of Steel Panthers in it, both games which was (and still am) a huge fan of.It takes you through nicely designed battles in several campaigns. The units are well rendered, and the game offers hours of intense strategic fun.Having said that, this game could have been much much better - you cannot carry your experienced units forward from battle to battle, and the choices and options are very limited.Finally, I bought this quite cheaply off Ebay for about £4. That is a fair price to pay - it is certainly not worth £6.99 for each extra campaign that you have to buy additionally. If they offered all the extra DLC for £5-10, it'd probably be worth it.  "
