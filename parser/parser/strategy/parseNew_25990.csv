												An old classic, pretty sedate until later levels when waves of ratmen come at you one after another. I owned the original years ago and was excited to see it on Steam. Still fun, and great for a nostalgia trip.			"

												Here's the dilemma with Majesty: It's one of a kind and the gameplay mechanics are very charming. On the other hand, it's brutally tough, it's unfair, and its quests suck hard. So even though I recommend it, I only recommend it to those who like extreme challenge.I love the idea behind Majesty, and I'm very sad that its levels were designed by masochists who have no idea what difficulty means. I like tough games, but they need to play fair. Majesty doesn't. Majesty enjoys sending hordes of tough enemies at you 30 seconds after mission start. Majesty enjoys directly targetting creatures at your certain structure (which of course must not be destroyed), even though you don't have a direct control over your heroes and the only thing you can do is rely on your luck or save/load approach. Have you ever seen eagles primarily attacking buildings? Well, in Majesty you will.The overall problem is that even though you are not given a direct control over your heroes (which is absolutely great and I love it), the developers do not make the rest of the world consistent with this ""simulation"" approach. So, although some creatures just wander around, there are waves which doesn't and it doesn't make any sense, except for artificial difficulty.If you want to finish this game, essential isa) carefully reading a manual, or some web guides, because a lot of important features is not properly explained in-gameb) slowing down time whenever there is a fight ('<' and '>' shortcuts)c) saving a lot, unless you want to repeat the whole levelEven if you all of that, you'll need to repeat some expert levels at least once, because you'll need to learn what special events happen when (e.g. at the beginning of the third day, there is a wave of dragons targetting your elven lounge). And some levels have just one or two possible solutions and it's almost impossible to complete the level otherwise. You'll need to look at YouTube to see how to complete it. There's no other way.It would be really great to have a Majesty-like game with a reasonable and enjoyable level design. Unfortunatelly, it hasn't happened yet.			"

												If you've never played a pen & paper RPG in your life, and would like to know what it feels like to be a game master, then Majesty: The fantasy Kingdom sim will give you a taste of how it can feel.Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim is an old RTS (originally released in 2001) where you don't have direct control over your units. Instead you need to treat your units like you were the quest giver from an RPG, in other words, you need to bribe them into doing whatever you want them to do.Graphics & soundThe graphics in Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim was considered to be sub-par back in 2001. The HD edition does not do much for the graphics, other than zoom out a bit further, and it's still not exactly a looker. That said, unlike many 3D games from 2001, the graphics in Majesty has not aged much. The detailed 2D art looks relatively appealing, far more so than the crude 3D graphics in many of its contemporaries. In terms of sound, Majesty won't set your world on fire. A single song loops in the background, and after a while you won't even notice it. The sound of units attack each other or peasants building things is not anything wrong write home about either. It works, but it's not great.   On the plus side, the voice acting is entertaining. A Sean Connery impersonator reads the mission briefings with enough conviction for it to work, and he also acts as the announcer during the missions. The game would not be the same without this voice actor, and it helps giving it a lot of personality. All units have their own voice lines as well, and they do a good job at conveying the personality of the units.StoryMajesty does not have much of a story. You're the king of Ardania, and it's your job to make it prosper. Each individual mission does have its own backstory though, and while they are not ""good"" in the traditional sense, the mission briefings can often be quite entertaining to listen to.GameplayIn Majesty it's your job to build a typical fantasy village/town. You start with a castle, and then you build the kind of buildings you often see in fantasy RPGs, like market places, warrior's guilds, rogue's guilds, temples to different gods, dwarven workshops and so on. Most buildings are used to recruit heroes, while some offer services that the heroes can use, and at the same time generate some much needed money that you then can use to build more buildings, or recruit more heroes.   The heroes have wills of their own, which often aligns with their classes. A rogue is a greedy coward, so he's easily attracted to bounties, but if the going gets tough, the rogue will run away. A paladin on the other hand is brave and selfless, and while try to protect the weak, so she will go out and slay monsters on her own. A wizard is bookish, and prefer to read books in the library rather than fighting, and thus might need a really big bounty for him to take notice. There are plenty of different heroes, all with their own strengths & weaknesses, and some are mutually exclusive (sun worshipers won't work with moon worshipers, and paladins won't work with necromancers), so deciding what heroes to use is a strategic choice you need to make for each level.   The heroes also gain experience and level up. Fighting enemies will always give them experience, but certain heroes also have their own activities that will make them level up. A ranger that is exploring the map will for an example gain experience that way. This makes keeping your heroes alive really important.    Sadly the game is not perfectly balanced. Some heroes are better than others, and it's really easy to fall back on the same strategy for most levels due to this. Paladins for an example, while expensive, tends to be really powerful and thus are a better investment than necromancers.    Most of the game comes down to managing your economy. As long as money keeps rolling in, you can recruit more heroes, build more buildings, and cast certain spells. These spells are the only thing you can use to directly influence a fight, and they tend to cost a lot of money. But money spent on keeping your high level heroes alive tend to be worth it.   There's no linear level progression, instead you get to chose from almost any level right from the get-go, with only some levels requiring you to have beaten some other levels first. All the levels are randomly generated, based on certain parameters for each level, so there's plenty of replay value, even if the level layout can often feel a bit generic, due to its randomly generated nature. Majesty is also not a very hard game. Between the core game and the expansion, there are really only 2 levels that can be considered ""hard"". Many levels give the illusion of difficulty, but as long as you don't panic or give up when things look bad, victory won't be far off.Final thoughtsI love Majesty. Yes, it's a game with its share of flaws, but it's really fun to watch the heroes try to accomplish things. As someone who used to play pen & paper RPGs, I recognize the behavior of my old gaming group, they used to be just as bad at noticing the obvious as the heroes in Majesty are. ;) Fun is actually how I would describe the entire game, because while it might not be the deepest strategy game on Steam, it's one of the most entertaining ones. So if you like strategy games or RPGs (be it CRPGs or pen & paper RPGs), make sure to give Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim a try, you won't regret it (and don't forget that you can increase the game speed).

												I remember buying the demo at a scholastic book fair in elementary school. It was one of my first games I ever played and I've gone back and played it many times since. It's such an interesting design, and one of my favorite games. I wish there were more like it. I can't recommend it enough. The dated graphics may throw some off, but they're decent enough, and I prefer them to the (terrible) sequel's 3d graphics. It has flaws, but is pretty darn fun and doesn't take itself too seriously.I actually only managed to beat the game in it's entirety (without cheats) recently. Many of the levels are reasonable, but it also boasts some awesome challenges. While it may seem impossible, the only truly unbeatable level is ""Legendary Heroes"" if you don't think outside the box.Such a steal at 80% off!It also has some great cheat codes, and I wish more games had imaginative codes like it.

												Wow. This game is so cool. There are no other games like this around, which is a dang shame, because this really was an awesome idea. This old game still holds up against more modern strategy games and is definitely still unique over a decade after its release. Buy this, its such  steal at this price. Support it so a decent sequel may be put into development. I just wish my freaking wizards would suvive to level 3.			"

												Majesty was released in 2000 and did away with what most people knew about the rts genre.You play the role of a king, but unlike most other strategy games you don't directly control your units. You can construct buildings, anything from guilds, to guard towers, to marketplaces.From the guilds you can recruit heroes, but they have a mind of their own, so to get them to do what you want you can place bounties to explore parts of the map or to kill and destroy enemies and buildings.Heroes will level up, and will buy things from the marketplace and other such buildings using gold they get from bounties, killing enemies, or finding in chests on the map.You can level up buildings to improve them and to be able to research new things, such as better armor for your heroes to purchase at the blacksmith, or new spells for your wizards to learn at libraries.Overall Majesty is an interesting rts, which Majesty 2 couldn't quite live up to.

												I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR YEARS AND JUST RECENTLY BOUGHT IT ON STEAMMy Mother bought me this game when I was really young (around the age of 5-6) because I loved the RTS game ""Age of Empires"". That Roman War game we got from our Kellogs Nutri-Grain Cereal (on a side note: Best marketing scheme ever. Nutri-Grain will always be my favorite cereal because of it) that I enjoyed summoning a bunch of Cars equipped with Rocket Launchers. Since this looked similar, and the man in the shops said it was, she bought it in hopes I'd enjoy it.I had mixed feelings with Majesty when I first aquired the game; I couldn't control where my people went and it was a lot harder than Age of Empires... even with cheats. As I grew up, I didn't have the best time in school (blah blah blah) so I spent a lot of my weekends and afterschool time in a cold room with only the 'family' (let's be real, it was mine. No one else used it because it was for 'nerds') Windows 2000 to keep me company. I listened to music, wrote a fantasy book - which was fueled with inspiration from Majest, Deltora Quest and Pokemon - and played MAjesty. As I grew up, I used cheats less and less, I began to enjoy the challenge a lot more.Years later I torrented this game onto my Compaq computer to play with for nostalgia sake in 2013, and loved everything about it. Nostalgia aside, this game is actually one of the most unique RTS games out there. It's nothing like Age of Empires or Starcraft, it's different. You can't choose what your NPCs do, or where they go. That's their job if they want armour, if they want to go potion shopping, or if they want to explore. You got to set rewards in the void of the unknown and on your opponents. That adds a challenge like no other to me, and for that I really enjoy Majesty although I don't play it much anymore.The soundtrack is bliss too. Even if you're not going to play it, at least give it a listen. It's beautiful.Thanks for keeping me company Majesty when I was younger xx			"

-Quick Review-Majesty Gold HD is advertised as ""The Fantasy Kingdom Simulator"", and that pretty much sums up the genre: Fantasy, Simulation, and Strategy. Majesty was developed by Cyberlore Studios. Majesty was released in 2001, Majesty Gold Edition was released in 2002, and Majesty Gold HD was released 2012.Before people start typing up comments: the version you're getting covers all the predecessors, originally Majesty only had the bottom half of the levels you'll see in the single player game, Majesty Gold Edition included an expansion for the ""Northern Expansion"". Majesty was re-released in an attempt to be more compatible with windows 7 machines, two additional quests, and other minor bug fixes and improvements.  I'll elaborate on this later in my review, my apologies for making the -Quick Review- section too long.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Greetings Majesty! I am your cryer, I've been with your family through multiple generations, and..... What's that? I see... Yes... mmhmmm.... Sorry to cut the pleasantries short Majesty, but the kingdom is in ruins and only you can fix it, because you're the only one with the almighty power to instruct the peasants to build stuff!By this point, most people are used to being the only competent operson in video games that can issue orders, and in strategy games it's typical practice. On that note, Welcome to Majesty! A game where you don't control any characters, npcs, avatars, etc directly!""Woah, Woah, Atratzu!"" - I hear you exclaiming. - ""What kind of game are you ever talking about? If I can't do my 360 no scope's, or press A to jump, I don't think you're really talking about a video game."" - Well never fear, my dear reader! I shall teach you the way of Majesty!Gameplay: You play from the perspective of the ""Majesty"", you have 3 types of serfs: Tax collectors, Peasants, and Guards. You have some control over these characters, but you can only issue commands and they'll follow (except guards, they only patrol. But don't worry; their AI isn't that bad they're zealous zealots for you.). In addition to serfs, the Majesty can issue several different commands, you can set bounties, order spells to be cast, and set building foundations (which the peasants will then go build).That's it! I've actually covered the only powers the Majest has... crazy huh? ""Stop baiting us, Atratzu. You only write reviews this way when you really like a game."" Wow! What a bunch of astute reader you all are!We next move on to the mechanic that will MAKE or BREAK the game for you: Heroes. There are many different types of heroes, and I'll spare you a 'tutorial-review' explaining the differences, mainly these are different types of AI creatures running around and doing their own things. But as the Majesty you have some say in what they might do.For example, say you have a blacksmith, and marketplace, if your hero has enough gold, he or she might purchase armor upgrades, or potions, or both if the hero has enough money. But which will the hero prioritize? I don't know, you'll need to watch them!In a Way I feel like a Queen Ant (Don't look into this analogy too much, mmmmk? It's too late isn't it. *sigh*), I set up my nest, and then all my little babies run around doing stuff. While I myself am quite boring, I get to watch and see the adventurers the little ones are having!Before someone dismisses my obviously nostalgia blinded perspective, the game challenges you by giving you different objects and restricting certain buildings to be built in certain missions. You might need to beat a mission using only archers and warriors. In one Expert-Difficulty Mission you cannot build ANY-GUILDS (You need to build guilds to hire heroes): you can only hire heroes and pray to the Ardania gods that the Monsters don't melt your kingdom before you can explore enough to get help! So in a way, you could say Majesty is a combination of a ""puzzle"" and ""strategy game"", with many randomly generated elements.

Achievements: There are no Steam Achievements for Majesty Gold HD. Sad really...Price: Majesty Gold HD is priced at $9.99, actually... I think I still have my Majesty Gold Edition CD somewhere around my still packed up game library in my apartment. Majesty can be a pretty big time sink, since there's a lot of RNG going on in the background, which might make your play through more difficult or easier, you can easily sink more then 10 hours into the game, thereby making the price 1 dollar per hour (my value system is: I like every dollar to go towards an hour of gameplay.)*Multiplayer and Optimization I don't normally care about Multiplayer, but I've noticed a handful of negative reviews complaining about it, and a lot of forum posts asking for help setting it up. Honestly I never cared to play multiplayer, it seems that some really tech savvy people in the community have come up with methods to play multiplayer, I'll include some links to articles if you want to do some reading and downloading to get it working. (It does seem that playing on a LAN would be easiest and the least painful, but not everyone has that option)Regarding Optimization, Majesty Gold HD may be more compatible with windows 7, but it sure didn't show up on my computer (I begrudgingly upgraded my gaming rig to windows 10. Don't get me started; I hated windows 8.1 on a desktop more), I had to make changes to the launch of the game so I could stream it over twitch, and get it into window mode. I've poked around and saw there are other suggestions for optimization, you can chose your favorite.Regarding the windows 7 optimization, I downloaded Majesty HD to my Win 7 laptop (Which is getting kinda old), Majesty Gold HD worked beautifully! So at this point I can say this much; Win 7 it works fantastic, Win 10 it works but not nearly as smoothly, and may require file tweaking or launch editing. (the Launch Edits that I did were: ""-useddblit -blitmovietobackground -w"" without the quotation marks)


Overview Map - Uploaded for the review

			This is the overview map, everything above the clear mountain ridge is the northern expansion that was added to the game after Majesty: Gold Edition.		


Conclusion: I think it's pretty clear I love this game, as I mused to myself over twitch: ""Part of my love definitely comes from the flood of memories when I played it in the summer of my high school years, remembering the summer vacations away from school playing Majesty Gold Edition and listening to the radio... mom coming downstairs telling me 'DON'T YOU DARE SPEND YOUR WHOLE SUMMER INDOORS'."" *sniff* brings a happy tear to Atratzu's eye.It's clear *I* love this game, but the real question is: Will you? The good news is that Majesty has been on sale for 75% off in the past, so you can wait until it's pocket-lint-price before trying it out. But if you're a very careful spender, you'll want to remember the key points of my review: You don't control, or do anything very direct. You Build, you cast spells. You're basically playing Fantasy Sim City. If that sounds fun, try it! If it sounds like a pain, might want to skip it.Majesty has aged, there's no doubt about that. Has it aged well? I think it has aged decently so far, because the sprites are more cartoon styled, but this game definitely isn't for everyone. I would suggest Majesty Gold HD to anyone whom enjoys older games (I should start calling them ""seasoned"", sounds more sophisticated!), strategy games, puzzle games, and fantasy game genre's. But, if your purchase will hinge on multiplayer and you're not willing to go through the work and jump through the hoops to get it... skip it.Thanks for reading my review!*This is not a standard category added to Atratzu Reviews, but was found necessary to add for further clarification for the Majesty Gold HD review.

												One of the reasons I recommend this game is the fact that it differs from other strategy games. If you're a casual strategy player who doesn't want to control every single unit or gather resources manually then this game is for you. Majesty is mostly focused on which buildings you make, especially during the start of a level. The heroes will explore  the map on their own. They fight and gather items, and if the enemy they're facing is too strong they flee. They also upgrade their armor and weapons automatically but only if you build a blacksmith and research the upgrades. That means you don't have to worry about anything except making the right buildings. If you feel like ordering the units to search a specific location on the map you can add a bounty flag which will make the units move there to get the reward.By the way, the music and voice acting is amazing.

												Majesty called itself ""The Fantasy Kingdom Sim."" It's a fair title as it's a bit of it's own beast. It has city/kingdom management. There are monsters - and heroes, which you hire, to deal with them. The thing is, you don't control the heroes. You entice them. With bounties. It sounds a bit obtuse, but it's actually quite enjoyable. It's a constant balancing act of upgrading structures, researching technologies, and bribing heroes with ever greater sums of cash - which they then spend and you re-absorb through tax collectors.There's a good deal of inventiveness in the game - and quite a bit of, essentially, altered perspectives. The situations are familiar to strategy players, but the approach is novel. Keep in mind that it's an older title. It may have some... hairballs as you run it. The graphics are dated, but they honestly didn't bother me. If you're interested in something a little different with a fair amount of inovation, you're in the right place. Addictive and fun, Majesty combines the best of city-sim-lite with the rewarding chaos of herding cats.			"

I loved playing it when it first came out long ago on Windows 98.  :P    Amazing game really.  The HD update isn't all that great, all they did was change maybe 2 lines of code.  HAH.  But it's still a great game.For anyone having any issue with the game,Right click the game in your steam list, click properties, go to ""betas"" tab and select Beta 1 from the dropdown list.  It contains directx9 rendering method which fixes a lot of issues.It also gives you access to steam workshop for the game with downloadable quests made by players and other mods that players (like me) have made.You also get the tools you need to make mods yourself and new quests.

												Majesty Gold HD is an unusual game with an unusual history.While it's billed as a Fantasy Kingdom Sim, Majesty has most of the trappings of a conventional RTS. However, it does stray from RTS convention in one major aspect and that was enough for its developer, Cyberlore Studios, to have considerable difficulty finding a publisher even during the great RTS glut of the 90s.To fully appreciate Majesty, you need to talk about RTSes in general. Now, the term Real-Time Strategy itself is a little generic -- Crusader Kings II, for instance, is real-time and it is a strategy game but no one would confuse it for an RTS. When gamers use the term, they're referring to very specific types of games -- games like Blizzard's Warcraft II and Westwood's Command & Conquer, the two titles released in 1995 that inspired the RTS glut.These games required both speed (measured in actions per minute) and efficiency (through optimised build orders) and you needed tight control over proceedings for both. Control was important to such an extent in those 90s RTSes that your army would sit idly while the enemy was marching close by simply because you hadn't given your troops the attack order.Majesty's major deviation from RTS convention was to give its Dungeons & Dragons-inspired units autonomy and personality. Your units weren't manufactured goods and you didn't have total control over them. You barely had any. Instead of commanding and conquering in this game, you cajoled and hoped for the best. To entice your ""heroes"" to do what was required of them, you provided them with financial incentives attached to flags. You'd plant a Explore Flag with 200 gold to encourage exploration of that distant area of the map or plant an Attack Flag with 400 gold on the head of the Troll assailing the marketplace. This indirect approach could both be delightful (when the ""heroes"" performed unexpectedly heroic actions) and exasperating (when the ""heroes"" demonstrated precisely why sneer quotes were necessary).Majesty charmed enough gamers with its unusual approach in 2000 to warrant an expansion pack the following year and Majesty Gold bundled both together in 2002. By 2007, the game had sold an impressive 500,000 copies. While there was enough demand for more Majesty, Cyberlore once again had trouble finding a publisher. The developers sold the rights to Paradox which then tasked Russian developer Ino-Co to work on the sequel.Released in 2009, Majesty 2 was an honest attempt to improve the design but the designers erred in giving the player greater control over the heroes. In doing so, the designers brought the game closer to conventional RTSes rather than taking the design further down the sim path.It's perhaps telling that Paradox felt compelled to release an updated version of the original three years after the sequel was released. More remarkably, Majesty Gold HD was patched five years later by a Cyberlore developer who's apparently working on the game in his free time. Something about Majesty does seem to inspire loyalty and affection from everyone who's encountered it.The key question, however, is whether anyone who's unfamiliar with the game could be tempted to play it today. The visuals are dated, the interface primitive and the core concept -- the ""D&D ant farm"" -- has been expanded upon by the likes of the brilliant Dwarf Fortress and its derivatives. All things considered, Majesty Gold HD's appeal today would mainly be to players of the original looking to revisit an old favourite.Yet there could still be a place for a Majesty 3 or a spiritual successor to the series. A Sim D&D with Majesty's eccentric charm might strike gold even in today's cluttered market and if there's one lesson Majesty has imparted, it's this: when there's a sufficiently large financial incentive involved, someone will come along to claim that flag eventually.Recommended for: anyone whose preferred pronoun is ""Your majesty.""

												Sim/RTS is a strange combination but it works here.  You can build buildings, recruit heroes, set bounties, cast spells, but you can't control the characters directly.  It does take a bit to learn because the idea is so abstract so you have to just try things to figure out the best strategies.  This game is reccomended if you are looking for something different.

												Majesty combines city-building, RPG and, most of all, strategy aspects into one satisfying and thoroughly unique package. Instead of building up an army and marching your soldiers to destroy an enemy’s base, you have to construct a small town around your castle in order to ensure that the heroes you recruit have all that they need to be successful. Heroes can’t be controlled directly, but their actions are a reflection of their class (e.g. Rangers like exploring, Rogues like to steal) and of the rewards banners that you put up. You have two types of banners: attack banners and explore banners that will reward your heroes with an amount of gold you set for attacking a monster or monster den or exploring a location, respectively. While this may sound hard to juggle, it really isn’t and Majesty does a tremendous job of creating missions that are both challenging and fun.One of my favorite games of all time, I can’t tell you how many hours I spent playing this as a kid. Coming back to it years later to replay it on Steam just made me a remember what an amazing game this is. Every strategy fan should add this game to their collection!			"

Given the lack of depth many modern games currently have, Majesty may still be one of the best sims available.			"

												Although titled the Fantasy Kingdom Sim, this game is in fact an RTS. It's an RTS that subverts everything regularly present in the genre, and doing it with a great sense of humor to boot. Instead of troops you have heroes, and that distinction is huge. Rather than amassing an army and micromanaging it directly, you hire individual heroes who usually aren't keen to throw away their life for the crown - you can't give direct orders, but instead you provide incentive to these heroes and hope that the price on the head of the monster you want dead outweighs the allure of a day in the local tavern.

												The concept of the game is great.Be in control of a kingdom, but not in control of the heroes.Sure the graphics are dated, but I loved playing this when it first came out, and keep coming back to this game every now and then.Want a part of the map explored? Put a marker down with some cash on it, and someone will take care of it.Swimming in cash, but your heroes are broke, and under-equipped? Put a 4000 gold bounty on a rat, and watch them stimulate the economy fast.It does get trickier on the higher difficulties, but once you've got the hang of it, it's both challenging and rewarding. It's worth checking out, as well as the second installment of the series.			"

												Note: I am writing this based on the Gold HD Edition, which doesn't have a store page. I have ~30 hours in that, not 15 minutes.This game is great. Yes, it's a little dated but still, to this day, bug fixes are being released. I think that's awesome. I love these older strategy games (AoE, the older Civilization games) so this game was the perfect match. The music is catchy and works with the whole 'fantasy, medieval' setting. I find the premise of the game to also be quite amusing; instead of playing as a hero, you are able to act as a soverign, creating and building up heroes for their adventures. All in all, a great older strategy game that has a completely different way of going about its gameplay. 10/10 would recommend.			"

There's also a skirmish mode where u can make your own custom game which adds a lot of replay value. The HD version seems almost identical to the classic version except the adjustable resolutions, and I think there's an extra mission or two thrown in. I have to say that my favorite part of the game is the sounds, the music, and the voices! They are awesome! I highly recommend this game!			"

I bought this game because I read reviews which say that Majesty 2 is worse.It is an old game, from 2001, which still works on windows 10 but with some problems.First you have to know that you have to install the HD version.But the review can be only written for the original old version. So I had to install both in order to leave a review here.I experienced some minor problems so far: If I alt-tab, the window is resized and shown with false colors. I need to restart the game to repair it. after playing more and based on comments, this is a feature: There is a mission where elves are your enemies. However, because they are normally your allies (units you can produce) they can enter my market to buy healing potions. First I thought that is a realistic approach :) But later when I placed a reward on their buildings, to encourage my fighters to destroy them, they also attacked their own buildings. But if they meet my units, they recognize them as enemies and they fight each other. I cannot say if this happens always because I noticed it only at the end of the mission when the bounty was increased and I was about to finish the mission anyway. Rogues can loot the gravestones of the fallen enemies. However, I got three rogues looking to my Mausoleum like hypnotized cats because they detect my buried heroes but cannot reach their graves. Again this is not a game breaking thing because it is cheaper to resurrect your heroes with spells before they are placed into the Mausoleum or if you have the money, you can save the game and by trial and error to resurect the one which was targetet by the rogue. Then the rogue will loot the living hero and  will continue with other activities.The game seems to be difficult until you learn how each building and spell works.I tried to play it and I gave up, possibly being pulled away by other games.Many months later I tried again and now I like it.I recommend the game for those who like strategy games where your units have their own will.If you have doubts, buy the game on sale, as I did.edit: added the bug with the rogues			"

												The question is not ""do I recommend this game"", the question is how much do I reccomend this game.This is incredibly difficult, as I've been playing Majesty, and the Northern Expansion, since I was five. Though I have less than 100 hours on steam, me, as well as my family have probably clocked in thousands of hours into this game.When I found it was on steam, I was overjoyed and overwhelmed with nostalgia. I got it straight away, and got through over half the game within a couple days, when I realized it had steam workshop compatability.THIS. CHANGED. EVERYTHING.I wondered how this happened, and it turns out that after 17 years, the original Dev from Cyberlore Studios is still actively updating the game to work on newer systems (as it wouldn't normally work on newer versions since it's older than half my brothers.) It also allows for mods to be implimented into the game, which will either add levels, or that will change mechanics to a point. Unfortunately the Worksop has not been active for some time at the time of writing this. However, when you're reading this, it could very well be thriving.This was my first ever RTS game, and one of the first video games I ever played on the computer (that wasn't a kid's educational game). I highly recommend this game for any RTS fans, and because of the updates and mod possibilities, I reccomend this to just about anyone.Note: My nearly 100 hours are in the beta, but steam is stupid and doesn't show it.

												Steam installs two versions of this: the modern one and the old one. I actually have over 12 hours on the modern one, which is not linked to this product page.I never played this when I was younger and I still like it. It's a good game. Basically you're the king of a kingdom and instead of controlling things directly, you control what happens by creating buildings such as guilds for heroes and marketplaces, creating heroes from those guilds, and then creating rewards for tasks for those heroes that they may or may not pay attention to. Basically, placement of buildings, micromanaging the research, production, and upgrading of different things, and planning on a high level are what wins the game.Pros:- Funny dialogue from characters.- Different missions that require you to approach the game's mechanics in different ways.- An interesting set of buildings with unique mechanics.- The game is challenging but always fair. I have been attacked by dragons in the first 30 seconds of a mission and pulled through just fine.Cons:- Dialogue repeats too much sometimes.At first, it seems like the heroes don't do what they're supposed to, but you'll see that this is logical. If there is not enough reward, the task is far away and the hero is caught in the middle of something, or the task is too dangerous to get to alive then there is no way that it will get done. This game is all about setting up things in just the right way so your heroes can succeed.One of the better games I've played.			"

												I grew up playing this game. It's a lot of fun. Not having direct control of your heroes can be both fun, and frustrating. On the higher difficulties, you can get destroyed relentlessly and have no real way to get out of it, but on lesser difficulties, the game can get too easy. Unfortunately, once you beat a map, you'll probably find yourself wanting more, but once the main objective is complete, there's really no reason to continue that map. The game has a lot of replay value, for a 16 year old game.			"

												I love this game. I played it way back when it was on a CD, and it was one of the first strategy games I ever played. The nostalgia is so real. When I saw it was on Steam and it was upgraded a bit visually, I knew I would have to play it again. It can be a little bit picky when playing with some settings (especially game speed) but overall it's totally worth a try. I have a series on Youtube of me playing it. Check it out here:

												Majesty is unique, but if there were other indirect control strategy games out there, it wouldn't get such great reviews. I played this game when I was a kid over winter break and had a lot of spare time to waste in randomly regenerating maps just because things went wrong.These days, my time is more valuable. It's very annoying when your heroes make stupid mistakes like not attacking the ratman who's chasing your tax collector with 2000 gold right outside your palace, or when the dragon attacks you on day 2 or 3 before your palace is even developed and you don't even have a shot at winning unless you get very lucky right away with wizard blasts making contact as they dodge the dragon's breath.Also, the game really isn't a ""Kingdom Sim"". There are early peaks in how quickly you go through the tech tree in Majesty, and don't have anything left to do. You can build several Fairgrounds with Royal Gardens and Temples all around for fun while using the cheat to spawn waves of rock golems and dragons, but eventually, your heroes reach incredibly high levels, so nothing can challenge you. This usually happens within an hour or two of playing a mission, so the replay value is very small aside from completing scenarios.I bothered to write this since I got this game in a bundle with Majesty 2 just to see how that game is. Ultimately, the only reason to buy this is if you're just that curious to see what the game's about.			"

												Majest is a great real-time strategy game. It allows you to build and level up your buildings using the money you earn from trades and exploring land. You do not directly control any of the units or AI characters in the game but rather influence. You can set explore/attack flags out on the map an offer a cash reward for them to do it. They will attack on their own but the flags never fail. This game can at times be slow so be sure you have patience when it comes to waiting on the characters to do what they are asked to do.			"

												I used to own this game a long time ago, but sadly I lost the disc. Now that the game was so cheap I just had to buy it. It even comes with an expansion to boot.This game is a little gem in the world of RTS. Your subjects, or ""heroes"", cannot be directly controlled by you. What you can do is order building, recruit heroes and research services your little minions can use. You can also place bounties and rewards to try to affect them. Your task is to keep your kingdom safe and functioning, and of course watch the taxes trickle in.It has it's limits, but it's a charming little game with lots of challenges. Some of the missions are really hard to beat. Since the game is so old (year 2000), you might experience some issues. On my system I've experienced some crashes, but fortunetely the biggest crash problem has a simple remedy, allthough a bit sad - to configure the game to run without bgm. Also, refraing from using alt+tab.I really urge you to give it a try. Big bang for the buck.			"

												This game is just as cool as I remember it being all throughout my childhood. When I was real young, I got the disk, then I lost it. BUT EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE STEAM SALE ATTACKED!Super fun Fantasy RTS RPG feel; it starts out slow, but it gets pretty intense after a while. You don't don't directly control the characters, but that's a good thing in this game (if that makes sense).By the way, the reason I don't have any time with this game is because I'm playing the HD version, which comes with this package, but doesn't have a store page itself.10/10 - I can't put this game down!

												Really loved this game when I was younger and I still do.  But my second time through here I've noticed some massive shortcomings as far as the difficulties and artificial challenges of the quests.  They don't really pose any actual challenge and you can win pretty easily if you follow certain steps and get lucky.  This is not my idea of enjoyable gameplay.   The custom scenarios are quite fun however, and it is nice to watch the kingdom develop.  If you're going to try the quests however I'll warn you right now, you usually just end up exploiting shortcomings in the game to beat the levels.  Massively dissapointing that they did that.			"

												I played this a lot when I was a kid. It's definitely a lot of fun, and for the most part it's pretty easy to get the hang of. My only regret is that it takes a lot of effort to get this game to work on a more recent system, and even now, I have yet to make it happen. 10/10, would love for a compatibility patch.			"

												Really loved this game when I was younger and I still do.  But my second time through here I've noticed some massive shortcomings as far as the difficulties and artificial challenges of the quests.  They don't really pose any actual challenge and you can win pretty easily if you follow certain steps and get lucky.  This is not my idea of enjoyable gameplay.   The custom scenarios are quite fun however, and it is nice to watch the kingdom develop.  If you're going to try the quests however I'll warn you right now, you usually just end up exploiting shortcomings in the game to beat the levels.  Massively dissapointing that they did that.			"

												Majest is a great real-time strategy game. It allows you to build and level up your buildings using the money you earn from trades and exploring land. You do not directly control any of the units or AI characters in the game but rather influence. You can set explore/attack flags out on the map an offer a cash reward for them to do it. They will attack on their own but the flags never fail. This game can at times be slow so be sure you have patience when it comes to waiting on the characters to do what they are asked to do.			"

												Sometimes your kingdom falls. Sometimes a hero, freshly recruited, slays a dragon. Chance is a governing element of this game. Maybe you have recruited all the warriors in the land, but they decide to spend all their time gambling rather than monster slaying. It can be frustrating, but, in the end, this game is loads of fun. You get to manage a kingdom, hire theives warriors, and wizards (and many others), and set bounties. Then sit back and watch the slaughter. Or spend all of your treasury on spells to controll the action a little more directly. You will not have a reason for regret if you pick this up for $5.00 or less.			"

												Majesty is a wonderful, unique hybrid between strategy and city building games. The gameplay primarily consists of constructing buildings, hiring units, and researching while the rest of the world behaves on its own accord. Players who get bored just observing the game can adjust the game speed, and there are a number of methods to interact with the world (beyond posting the occasional bounty) by researching into a variety of spells to cast directly onto the field. The graphics are dated, especially with the intro cinematic and menu, but I still find the game asthetically pleasing. The game itself is broken down into a number of different missions, and has a random map generator to draw out the longevity of the game even further. The game's difficultly curve can be a little steep, as it starts off almost boringly easy and ends up being fiendishly hard, and the steam port of this game crashes for me periodically, but if you see it on sale, it's definitely worth buying.

												Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim is truly a classic and extraordinary game. I have fond memories of playing it as a child, many times doing so for hours on end. The game brings with it a sense of wonder and magic and introduces you to fantastic lands, courageous heroes, and frightening monsters. It is truly one of a kind.Where Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim shines is in its gameplay of indirect hero control, where instead of simply telling your subjects to do this or that, you provoke your heroes to action through offering bounties and rewards for completing tasks, offers which they may or may not accept depending on their individual temperaments and strengths. This feature adds a certain depth of strategy and difficulty as well as oftentimes bringing about frustrating situations - it really allows for unique, individual gameplay experiences and provides certain replayability value.Adding to the replayability value of Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim is the Freestyle Mode. In this mode, you are free to set up your own starting conditions and objectives. In addition, the Freestyle maps are randomly generated using a seed, allowing different landscapes practically everytime.Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim is an excellent game and is well worth the price. I recommend this game!			"

												Majesty, the local Steam client offers nostalgia!  I played this game for years when I wa younger, and now all of the heroes and ratmen are mine to love and hate again!  In a world where your money is power and your heroes do whatever they want, you'll watch anxiously as utter doom closes in on you from all sides... and is defeated in the most desperate and unexpected ways.  Watch a rogue grow to the highest level by simply being greedy, watch healers come back to life again and again because of their crazy passives, and watch rangers react realistically and flee from skeletons - arrows pass right through those ribs!Dated, but still very worth the time.

												Simple to learn ""RTS"" in which you create structures and hire varied heros. However, you don't control any of the people's actions, and can only guide and give some minor aide. Different hero types have different goals, and this leads to great depth in the game. You have plenty of early available scenarios to work out different strategies for the huge difficulty curve in the last unlocked scenarios. Setting up your own scenario is also very fun and where I sunk the most hours in when I first had this game many years ago. The sound effects, one-liners, and music can either aggravate or charm, as they WILL be repeated. In a niche within a genre that's mostly about organizing large forces, Majesty allows a slightly more hands-off playstyle that allows focus on the broad strokes. It also gives the player enough broad strokes to play around with to keep the pace active.			"

BUT EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE STEAM SALE ATTACKED!Super fun Fantasy RTS RPG feel; it starts out slow, but it gets pretty intense after a while. You don't don't directly control the characters, but that's a good thing in this game (if that makes sense).By the way, the reason I don't have any time with this game is because I'm playing the HD version, which comes with this package, but doesn't have a store page itself.10/10 - I can't put this game down!

He produced a small stone from his loincloth and frantically beat the wooden frame of a building. It was completed within seconds. But, alas, Bimpo was too late to seek refuge in the building--the birds had felled him in one hit from their monstrous talons.

												Majesty Gold is a great old game from the like 2000 or 1999. Basicly you are a ruler of Ardania a kingdom wich seems to be endlessly plagued by monsters, demons, and glutonus elves. This Game plays great, pretty addictive, and unique. My only real complant, the quest get reppeitive and the multiplayer dosen't work unless you run it hamachi. So in conclusion if you've ever wonder what it was like to be the king instead of the knight, and want a cool new city builder/ RPG/ fantsay game you should get this edtion over normal majesty, and definetly over majesty2, wich is TOTALY broken.

												So, lets go back to the early 00's. I was a wee little boy, and enthralled with my dad's collection of games. I decided to grab the one with the cool people on front, and enjoyed the experience. Near the turn of the decade, I downloaded it off ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and played it like that, because I couldn't find a physical copy. (Suprise suprise, the Torrent ran better than this Steam version) years later, I checked Steam and found it. Little did I know, my childhood was about to be ruined. I am glad I only paid 2 dollars for this. It's a lackluster port at best. Maybe it's what I am playing it on, maybe it's better, if you're running it on an old machine. I don't want to downgrade a PC, and I shouldn't have to. This is one of my all time favorites, and I am sad I had to deal with it like this.Edit: Well.. Moved out, and it runs well on the PC I now own. Haven't tested LAN multiplayer adequately nowadays since I am with console players, and not siblings who have laptops.Also bought Majesty II cause it looks fun.\o/			"

												I used to own this game a long time ago, but sadly I lost the disc. Now that the game was so cheap I just had to buy it. It even comes with an expansion to boot.This game is a little gem in the world of RTS. Your subjects, or ""heroes"", cannot be directly controlled by you. What you can do is order building, recruit heroes and research services your little minions can use. You can also place bounties and rewards to try to affect them. Your task is to keep your kingdom safe and functioning, and of course watch the taxes trickle in.It has it's limits, but it's a charming little game with lots of challenges. Some of the missions are really hard to beat. Since the game is so old (year 2000), you might experience some issues. On my system I've experienced some crashes, but fortunetely the biggest crash problem has a simple remedy, allthough a bit sad - to configure the game to run without bgm. Also, refraing from using alt+tab.I really urge you to give it a try. Big bang for the buck.			"
