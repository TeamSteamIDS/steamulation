												I remember when World War 2 games were king back in the old Medal of Honor days; To such a degree that people were sick of them, no matter the quality, like they are now of Military Shooter X and its various clones. Well Company of Heroes took the WW2 setting and built a fantastic, modern RTS around it. What they made is easily one of the best RTS games ever, and maybe even the best game set in WW2.			"

												I love this game. I love it so much. But first the basics. Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game in the times of WW2, directly after the D-Day. It features 1 campaign for vanilla, but you can expand that number by buying the really good DLCs. But the best about this game is the mp. All the factions (America,Commonwealth,Wehrmacht and Panzer Elite) are really well balanced and if you loose, it's only your fault. Every faction has 3 different trees of abilities, but you can only choose one per game. The abilities reach from little boosts or infantry drops to V1 Rockets or mighty king tiger tanks. Thanks to the ""new steam version"" the mp still works and many people are still playing it (up to 4000 people peak, source Steamcharts by 21st of february), so there's no reason to not get it. Thanks for reading and i hope you endorse this little review of me. ^^ And now go ahead, scroll up and buy it. I'm not kidding, go, there's nothing more to see here.			"

												(Something to quickly note first - Don't let the amount of time I have put into this game misguide you. This review was actually meant for Company of Heroes (New Steam Version) which I have put over 120 hours into but for some reason, you cannot do reviews of it and can only do reviews for COH itself as well as its two expansion packs.)Alright, enough dilly-dallying. Let's get this show on the road.When it comes to games that try to capture the hard, bloody and steely conflicts of World War II then one game usually comes to mind (my mind that is) and that is Company of Heroes.A game I would easily consider to be one of the greatest RTSs of all time alongside the likes of Age of Empires II, Rome: Total War, Men of War and Dawn of War (So many wars!). I would also say it is one of my own personal favourite games of all time. Set in the western front of the European Theatre of World War II. Company of Heroes sees the US Army (As well as the British Army with Opposing Fronts installed) and the Wehrmacht (As well as the Panzer Elite {Waffen SS in reality} with OF installed) battling each other for the control of France and the Netherlands in the numerous conflicts and engagements of that era.Company of Heroes is a game that just does so many things right when it comes to strategy. It has a user friendly interface and easy to learn controls which are key to any strategy game in my opinion – both real-time and turn-based – and gives a really realistic and striking depiction of the war. It has easy to understand game mechanics and it is quite literally a blast to play as it takes little time before the action begins and gets intense real fast when there is so much happening at once in devastating and explosive fire fights.When it comes to its gameplay, it seems fairly simple enough. You start off with a single building for a base and a group of engineers (your builders in the game), a big map to explore and expand into as well as using what resources you can secure from the area to use so you can try to build up your base and call in what units or support options you need to attain victory, such as infantry, paratroopers, special weapons teams, armoured cars, medium and heavy tanks, artillery barrages, P-51 strafing runs and V1 Rocket strikes etc. It’s your standard RTS mash up.This game is the epitome of how a strategy game should play out; rather than just the usual strategy game method of having larger numbers than the other guy (Although that certainly helps in this game). COH requires you to utilise your given surroundings, putting soldiers in buildings and environmental cover to give them an edge in the fight while also attempting to use your units special abilities like throwing grenades and sticky bombs or using flamethrowers to try and maximise enemy casualties. Maybe trying to exploit certain tactics like flanking maneuverers, suppression of an enemy squad, going around the back of an enemy tank and hitting it in its vulnerable sides and rear armour or trying to hold onto a strategic position with well-placed fortifications, traps and emplacements. That is what real strategy and tactical prowess is about and COH does it beautifully. This means that you must be cunning and always planning for the unexpected, always being one step ahead of the opposing commander. Be ready for when the enemy comes charging at you with everything they have while calling in whatever long range assets they can muster against your forces.Graphics are decent, they may not be all the way up there when compared to the likes of StarCraft 2 or the Total War games but they do the job as far as I’m concerned and still hold up pretty well to this day. When you see an artillery barrage devastate a patch of land, turning it into a series of craters while a nearby squad of soldiers gets blown apart (literally) by the shrieking shells all the while screaming that “They don’t want to be there, they just want to go home, man!” then I would definitely say that the graphics and audio department have very much done their job to the nth degree.There are problems with the game though. The AI is questionable at times with enemies running entire platoon sized forces into fortified positions without trying to soften up the defenders with artillery or anything first, more often or not I saw the spamming of the same unit over again from my AI controlled enemies also while not trying to diversify their unit types to counter any certain units I had. The AI also cheats sometimes, knowing exactly where to call in an artillery barrage on your units despite that the fog of war would prevent them from knowing their exact location. The campaign(s) are quite scripted and often don’t present much of a challenge, even on the harder difficulties. It’s not a perfect game by any means but I still recommend it for all the good I have mentioned above and hope this review can help your perspective should you think about purchasing it.On the side as well, I just want to say that this game has some of the best voice acting I have ever heard with soldiers spouting some really emotional and funny dialogue with professional voice talent provided from the likes of Steve Blum and of course, dear old Nolan North. Somehow the creators even managed to work in some humorous fourth wall breaking dialogue as well, my favourite having to be from a British Infantry Section, “Excuse me, sir, would you mind not clicking me anymore?” or “Oi! Get your bloody hands off the mouse!” And if you do ever think about getting Company of Heroes then I highly recommend that you download the Blitzkrieg mod which amplifies the game like 10 times in terms of gameplay and player choice, making it even more gripping and awesome to play.So there you have it. Sorry about the length of this review but I simply had to put down what I liked about this game, which unfortunately was a lot….sorry. Have a good day, sir or madam.Quote of the day - “We’re f*cked, crew! Command is drunk again!” - US Artillery crewman.			"

												Most Innovative RTS Game of all time.Company of Heroes is unlike any other traditional RTS games. Many have tried to innovate the RTS genre, but none that has been more successful over Company of Heroes. Relic has always been in the forefront of innovtive RTS experiences, But I have to say CoH is their ultimate masterpiece, not even its sequel, can beat it.Everything in CoH is realistic without compromising balanced gameplay mechanics and fun. I have yet to see a new RTS game to beat this game as of this writing.In CoH, massing units do not work when a horde of infantry is halted by single tank, or even worse: face a hail of mortar strikes. Your seemingly unstoppable tank column can be put to a halt with well placed gun enplacement in a superior position  . Simly put, you cannot steamroll to victory in this game like you would in any other RTS games. Technically speaking CoH revolves around tactics, resources and base building is still a major mechanic in the game, but superior maneuvers and positioning is everything. Resource management is a zero-sum tug of war as the only way to secure more resources is to hod more teritorries, the more territories you hold the harder it is defend. The units are consisted of infantry squads or singular tank units. These units are very accurate to its real-life counterparts,  a US rifleman squad armed with M1 Garrand rifles will defeat KAR98-wielding german counterparts at medium to close range, but the opposite happens in long range engagements. Heavy Machine gun emplacements provide supressing fire that reduces the target's ability to fight or maneuver well. Long range artillery is inaccurate but deadly when it lands home - tanks are impervious to anti infantry weaponry giving them free reign to dominate an opponent with no proper anti-tank response. Furthermore, as the game progresses, every action in the battlefield earn you commander points which allow the playerto level up and gain access to special units, powers, or even superweapons such as the V1 Rocket strike or even call out powerful german Tiger Tanks. This allows the player to adapt apidly varying battlefield conditions.There are many more innovative gameplay mechanics such as Directional cover, retreat mechanic, triage, battlefield destruction and many more. It also has a very compelling single player campaign - long enough for you to grasp and master these mechanics. And if that isn't good enough for you, gimping and gore in this game is fantastic. Nothing more exhilirating and satisfying seeing your opponents army's flying limbs and smoking scrap by a well placed artillery barrage.Coh is an absolute get and an instant timeless piece - I seriously doubt anything coming out sooner or later will top the bar this game has set so high.

												First, I wanna say that if you do not already own this game, buy it. It is definitely one of the best RTS games for the price.  The Campaign takes place at the beginning of the Normandy D-Day invasion, and is really immersive.  I really enjoy playing the multiplayer skirmish mode with my friends.  The graphics, by todays standards, are a little lacking, but the game more than makes up for it by having a good story, a great interface, and excellent battlefield mechanics.  I have never played a WWII game that is better than Company of Heroes.PROS:-Good in-game interface-Great Battlefield Mechanics-A wide variety of units, which make for interesting battles-Good, in-depth story-An excellent multiplayer skirmish modeCONS:-Graphics are dated by today's standards-DLC units can be overpowered-AI can be extremely frustrating (They do spam you with overpowerd units)Overall, Company of Heroes is an excellent buy.

												Company of Heores... wow where to start. This game is truly amazing. I remember when I first played this game. I said ""holy sh*t, this game was made in 2006?"" This game has a very fun campaign with about 15 missions. Command the US Forces landing on the beaches of Normandy, then the Airborne Infantry. This game combines realism with fun arcade style gameplay. There is so much to do in this game; upgrade your riflemen to have BARs, give your Shermans Mine Flails to get through minefields or build a machinegun nest to keep sneaky Germans out of your base. The other great thing about this game is after you beat the campaign, it doesn't end. Multiplayer, skirmishs, 2 huge DLCs and a German Army to command in skirmishs or multiplayer.I would easily pay 60$ for this game now. 10$ is a steal.			"

												The benchmark for all RTS should be, and have been, set by this game. Beautifully crafted mechanics and an attention to detail make this game phenomenal, the maps are varied, some are large, other like Achelous River contain various chokepoints that will make you scream as you watch your Shermans be blown up as the bridge collapses. The modding community has also had its hand in making CoH fantastic, my favorite being the Blitzkrieg Mod which makes the game brutal and glorious. All in all, a fantastic RTS, one that everybody should play and one last note:""JESUS CHRIST CONRAD TIE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING LACES""			"

NOTE:Also see my:Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts reviewCompany of Heroes: Tales of Valor reviewTL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Company of Heroes is a 2006 real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ (RIP). The game boasts an authentic World War 2 RTS experience with a squad based infantry mechanic, tactical and strategic map control, realistic armored combat and intense battles that will leave players at the edge of their seats.STORY (No Spoilers):Much like other World War 2 video game stories, Company of Heroes lets you take the role of an American army company called 'Able Company' who takes part in some of the biggest operations of the allied forces such as D-Day and the Falaise Pocket.PROS:+ Great graphics that looks good even in today's standards;+ Great sound effects;+ Amazing voice acting that gives life to the battlefield (probably my favorite PRO);+ Dark humor from the units “Main gun is out, we're screwed, we're screwed!” - Allied tank when the Main Gun is disabled and low on HP “I don't want to die...in FRAAANCCCEE” -Wehrmacht Soldier when low in HP;+ Intense action packed combat;+ Great atmosphere (A PRO I rarely put on an RTS title);+ Great core game mechanic;+ Faction versatility: Each faction has 3 'branches' where the player can adopt different bonuses to better suit their play style; and+ Fully destructible environment that leaves the battlefield deformed after each match.CONS:- Low quality textures when zoomed in (probably because of the game's age);- No melee or close quarter combat like Relic's other series 'Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War';- Relatively long load times; (Patched)- Occasional pathfinding problems;- No Axis / German Campaign; (unless you bought the expansions)- AI could use some improvement; and- Relic Entertainment Account (DRM).CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Excellent game mechanics, great graphics, environment design and voice acting makes this game one of the most authentic experiences I have ever gotten on a World War 2 RTS game.WORTH IT?:It is a MUST BUY for RTS and World War 2 fans whether at full price or on sale.If you're interested in the game, then I highly advice the 'Complete Pack' (which includes the original game and the 2 expansions) to have the full Company of Heroes 1 experience.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Note: Do not let the 0.3 hours fool you. I purchased the complete pack on Steam that contains the original copy, which I had a non-steam copy that had over 100 hours, and the new steam version. To play this game, you have to install the new steam version, which I have 40 hours on.Company of Heroes is a great game set in World War II with Nazi Germany and the Allies. It is a strategy game with a overhead camera in-game. The game features six different campaigns if you own the base game and all expansions. Each campaign allows the player to either play as the British, Americans or Germans through a rich storyline. For example, the Invasion of Normady campaign is self-explanatory. Each specific campaign has a good story that cover various aspects of that timeframe. For example, the Liberation of Caen campaign has missions such as attempting to take Hill 112 prior to the invasion of Caen to help the allies with supplies. Some campaigns are better than others such as Tiger Ace and the Invasion of Normandy compared to ones that do drag including Operation Market Garden. I got about 35+ out of all six campaigns. All in all, all campaigns are good enough to hold the interest of the player and are fun to play.The graphics are really good for a 2006 game. The sound is perfect to what the game is about and the setting it is portrayed in. The dialogue is varied and is strong to negate the feeling of repeatitive dialogue. The gameplay is really good. There are multiple relatively minor glitches including the pathfinding system and the population system that add up over time that affect the overall approval rating of the game. All in all, these four catagories are positives.The multiplayer is excellent. There are various modes tha help with variety in the game from the Operation Stonewall mode to just normal 1v1, 2v2, etc. The population of online is at a reasonable amount currently. Nothing more to say, just a typical multiplayer that excels.Overall, an excellent game. The campaigns are diverse and entertaining, the multiplayer is superb and the graphics, dialogue, etc. is great. There are some minor issues as I said with the gameplay but it doesn't hurt the game that much. Highly recommended game. 9.5/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												Company of Heroes  is a strategic hard and pure, clearly intended only for those players who eat and breathe tactics lead. Accessibility is close to zero, but those with the necessary basics behind who have the courage to jump into the fray will face a work frighteningly accurate and deep, which abandons the simplifications to propose semi realistic battles and forces them to calculate the perfection every single move. You want the war on pc? Here it is, has arrived. And that you be able to survive or not, you can not bow their heads before the skill of Relic.			"

												Pretty awesome game; came out a decade ago, but still a lot of fun to play. The online community is still active and if you want to play against other players, you don't have to wait long for a match. The single-player campaign puts the player in the major American operations during the Battle of Normandy (if you don't know about it, think of the movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the TV miniseries ""Band of Brothers""). All in all I'd say that this is a must-have for lovers of RTS and/or games set in WW2

												Why I bought the game: Huge RTS fan, followed the gameWhat I liked about the game: This is an amazing game, it was so good in fact I bought it twice, one disc set and another no steam for convenience. This game broke the build up a base and stomp routine, you had to pay attention to individual battles, and it's fantastic while doing so. The music and graphics at the time in 2006 were top notch, and you had to have a nice pc to run this game on full settings, the destructible environments blew me away, watching shells bounce off enemies tanks, or ricochet off the ground and into your own team, watching the ground scorch over time, and trees up rooted by tanks. Even writing this review makes me want to play right now, i've put over 600 hours into this game easy, and multi player is edge of your seat action the whole time, constantly changing strategy.Two primary modes, destruction and king of the hill esseintialy, resources are spread out on maps and you must take them with units, keep them and hold them.What I didn't like about the game: The game stopped updating and CoH2 was dissapointing, this has nothing to do with this game though this game is must own. Would I buy at current asking price of 9.99? Must own game, all time favorite list.**Disclaimer**I would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant. The current date of review 12/5/2014.			"

												Company of Heroes is, quite simply, the best RTS I have ever played - I would even go as far as saying that it's one of my top five favourite games of all time. The visuals are excellent in spite of its old age; though there are several mods available that improve upon these for those of you who enjoy super close-ups of your units.The campaigns are enjoyable and offer a solid amount of single-player gameplay. However, I personally did not find them to be particularly replayable. The meat of the game is in the excellent skirmish and multiplayer modes, which offers up a huge range of maps - though there are only two game modes (point capture and good old fashioned annihilate), no two matches ever come out the same. The scale of the action is just right; small enough to allow for tactical squad gameplay while being large enough to feel like an actual battlefield, unlike Dawn of War II (which was oddly enough inspired by CoH).As for mods, there are many very high quality ones available. Want the Eastern Front without the pain of CoH 2? Sure! The Trenches of the First World War? Of course! More 'realistic' gameplay, North Africa, shedloads of new historic vehicles, weapons and infantry? There are mods for all of that. There's even a mod for German prototype supertanks and exploding donkeys with rocket launchers strapped to them, if that's what you're into.In short, Company of Heroes is a superb game that I cannot recommed enough, whether you're already into RTS games or looking for your first one. It has given me dozens of hours of entertainment and I am sure that it will provide dozens more. As it's a relatively old game now it's very cheap for what you get; so there's no reason not to buy and install it right now!			"

												Literally reinstalled the Old Steam version to play for 1 more minute and write my review. Here goes.So, to better understand my review I have to give a little about me.I am a history buff, and a HUGE World War 2 enthusiast. From televised media like games, movies, documentaries and interviews, to written literature like stories and reports. Since I was a wee little tyke I've been taking in and absorbing as much as one can about this bit of history. Strategy/RTS games are my favorite genre and to finally see a World War 2 game executed on this level has my heart exploding from the rooftops of sheer excitement and nostalgia. The amount of depth and complexity in this game still astounds me. I need to position my armor right to score critical hits, I can move my rifleman squad on to that previously occupied PAK 38, and use their own weapon against the enemy team. Cover comes into play. There is just so much here to love, compared to the right click to win of other RTS.I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												Definitely one of my favorite RTS games.The Company of Heroes series offers many great campaigns to enjoy, different factions and a true to history feeling.The Squad-based strategies are easy to get into yet are challenging to use correctly.Upgrading and equipping your troops with specialised weapons is an essential part of the game, and the balance is nicely achieved; you can counter the biggest tank rushes if you use the right units, use cover or hide in buildings.Great franchise, amazing value!

												Remember old strategy games, where you would just amass more units than the enemy and because of that you would win the game in the next attack? Well, ""Company of Heroes"" is not that type of game. In this game a simple move can change the whole outcome of the match. You don't have to amass thousands of units in order to be strong. Actually, the game can support very few units per player. But that it the beauty of the game, because with the units that you have (this game includes infantry, armor, light armor and emplacements, such as artillery etc) you can make smart moves and change the tide of the game to your favor. You've got to use your units. You've got to use the environment. You've got to use your brain!The game includes 4 factions (2 in the original game and 2 in ""Opposing Fronts""), all with their unique set of units and abilities. All of them have their own strategies to lead you to victory. I believe they were all carefully made, are absolutely balanced and very interesting.The single player includes 6 campaigns (2 in the original, 1 in opposing fronts and 3 in tales of valor), which are absolutely outstanding. You can never get bored by those campaigns, simply because you don't have just to destroy the enemy's base or defend your base against the enemy's attacks, but you sometimes control only the units and you have to make careful decisions in order to execute a mission. The game itself makes you live the moments! I mean it! You have to try it!The multiplayer is also fantastic. The main idea of it is that you have to defend some key points and the enemy starts losing points until their point reach zero (starting at 500). The multiplayer system has the ""Play now"" function, which finds you a game almost instantly (even in the new servers, I'm now encountering no problem at all). You can also create and find a game in the standard way, but automatic mathmaking saves you the trouble. Your stats get recorded and you can download a replay of every match that you play, making easy to find any mistakes that you've done and improve your strategy.Do not be afraid of the recent move to the steam servers. I bought the game 10 days ago and by the time this review is written I have encountered zero problems. I'd like to congratulate  the company for doing so, because most companies would have just quit the project and let it die. By this move I had the chance to experience the game, too, because I bought it a little late (better late than never though).I haven't regret having bought this game. It is a unique, once in a lifetime game. It's one of those games that I will be speaking about when I get older and have nostalgia about. Simply the best strategy game I have ever played.10/10			"

												Company of Heroes is probably one of the best RTS games I have ever played. The excellent single player campaign is probably one of the best RTS campaigns I have had the fortune to play. In addition the multiplayer is top notch and highly addictive. But probably my most favourite aspect is some of the awesome mods available. The Blitzkrieg mod is probably one of the best, the game is almost entirely reworked which presents new challenges and a ♥♥♥♥ load of new units to build and conquer with.Final Score: 90/100			"

												Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game from THQ and now published by SEGA. Company of Heroes takes place in 1944, Europe, when and after the Allies launch the Operation Overlord.Company of Heroes has good gameplay. You build your base camp and fortify it before assaulting the enemy base camp and destroy it. Infantry unit can take cover on walls, fence or garrison themselves in houses or any other buildings that garrisonable. Unlike many other RTS game, infantry in Company of Heroes is a force to be reckoned with. They can be upgraded with better weapons or even be equiped with anti-tank weapons to engage armored vehicles. Vehicles and tanks also has unique damage system. Their engine can be blown off, immobilizing them. When vehicle unit finally destroyed, they can be ""out of control"" that they will hit something and explode. Each faction has 3 unique command tree with each command tree has its own special ability.Graphics of Company of Heroes is beautiful on its age. Explosion effect, skies, muzzle flash and weapon tracers are amazing. Animation are even more realistic as it can be. Infantry will act based on the battlefield situation and the state of the infantry, like when they are pinned down or retreating. Smoke and fire effect is also great.Performance of Company of Heroes is quite bad. Most of the time you will run the game just fine, but sometimes you will encounter sudden stutters or even lags even on advanced computers. The engine still need to be optimized. AI performance still quite good regarding this, and will give challenge on harder difficulty.Overall, Company of Heroes is amazing real-time strategy game with advanced graphics and decent style of gameplay. With a bit more optimization, the game will be even more amazing. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												This is an RTS game that focuses on tactics. No need to worry about managing resource gatherers or constructing a base just so. It can all come down to whether you time a flanking manuever correctly or keep your tank's heavier frontal armor directed toward your enemies AT guns. Every death matters, you can't just throw your units away as you might in many other RTS games. It's a game that's fun to play around with, but a huge challenge to master. The campaign is fairly long and varied, but multiplayer is a rush, just don't underestimate your opponents...			"

												Probably one of the most indepth RTS games ever made. The game not only has an intense multiplayer but pretty nice features for an RTS. You pick between the Germans or the Allies in this game. The German you can be the Panzer Elite or another branch of their military or you can be the Allies which are British and Americans. The game has 3 specialities. Air, Armor and Land. Each have their own special skills. The environment is destructable, so mortar strikes and air bombings cause the terrian to change. You can blow up buildings or even use the buildings as cover. You can literally zoom into the battlefield so close that you can see the troops bodies blow up to pieces. The animations are very realistic and it actually makes you feel like you're watching a real life scenerio of WW2. In short- This is one of the best RTS games you can play... It has multiplayer, and a type of multiplayer that you can win no matter what.. Use your brains, strategize, and fight your way to win. It's a 10/10 game and a must buy for any RTS fan!			"

												This is a review for CoH New Steam Version(You'll get it when you buy this game, New Steam Version is the way to play this old game, so that all element on the game would work)I generally suck at RTS game.I think I can count on finger, how many RTS game I played and truly enjoy.I still suck on all of themCompany of Heroes is a RTS game that have element of building production structure and training your army. Upgrade is researchable, and each of your army unit may have an ability.Compared to other similar game like Man of War or Sudden Strike (I have minimal experience with those), CoH is lot less complex on unit micro management.CoH instead play out on the flow of battlefield, where your units are, where the enemies, what should you do after engaging a skirmish. Getting to know this is the way to win, at least thats what I (who sucks at RTS) thinks.CoH have a lot of war element detail on a less unit-management game style. Infantry might get suppressed when they're in no-cover area, vehicle might be damaged on a number of parts that might hinder their performance, and iirc building that's on fire will have it's health decreasing as time pass by.A faction have doctrine subtrees, where a player can specialize on what tactic it brings on the battlefield.The range of infantry and vehicle the player can used spans from the early WW2 to almost the end of the period.It's generally a land combat type unit you can control. Fighter plane exist but only  as a form of commander strike ability.Playing against other player is great, but those who prefer to spend a free time stomping out CPU/AI enemy will find good time battling them out.The vanilla game plays out really well, and if you're already bored with it, there are 1-2 mod out there that brings out new way to play.I recommend to buy the CoH Complete Pack, one that have CoH and its 2 expansion, Opposing Front and Tales of ValorThe full price might shy people away from this 2006 old game, but a discount will help alleviate this.Up to 50% cut is considered a good deal for me, with what the amount of hour you'll dump to this game.

The graphics and sound editing brings out the grittiness of the game, especially when your troops are facing enemy fire and are ""getting the ♥♥♥♥ pounded out of them"". I've had to replay scenario after scenario until I find a strategy that sticks, The game excels where many others fail.Playing this franchise has been a pure joy and I haven't even touched the other DLC/mission packs.The game is worth the full price and right now it is a STEAL for 3$. Buying the entire franchise at its current sale price of 30$ is definitely worth it. 10/10			"

												A WW2 strategy game that has stood the test of time with its excellent set of expansions and an ongoing mod scene 10 years later. A base building, objective based strategy with plenty of skirmish style combat. The campaign is well constructed with a selection of different style missions ranging from an all out assault on an enemy occupied city to disabling a V-2 rocket facility with a detatchment of Highly trained Paratroopers.The Skirmish multiplayer mode is great for small/mid-scale battles that can last you anywhere from 1/2 an hour up to a couple of hours depending on your choice of scenario and map.  The base game seems fairly broken looking back now after being spoilt for choice on the realism and variety that the 'Europe At War' mod offers. But I would time and time again recommend that you enjoy the base game first to appriciate just how far the game has come.Check out the EaW mod, some people have had issues with it but I haven't had many so check it out for yourself.

												An absolutely essential edition to your library if you fancy RTS or WWII. This game highlights focused strategy in an amazing way. You are required to be quick and responsive and need to worry about where your guys take cover, where they're shooting, where they can go. Never have I found myself so closely attached to my unit as I find myself when it comes to my men in COH. It's strategy on a small focused scale that still requires you to look at the big picture.The main thing that might throw you off is probably the outdated graphics during cutscenes. Don't let that detract from the great experience that is this game.			"

												A thrilling, brutal, astonishingly intense  action packed affair and the best RTS I have ever played. Set during the most bloodthirsty conflict in human history COH is an astounding effort from beginning (the ferocious Normandy D Day landings) to end. Its the sense of realism which makes it stand out from the rest.  It's a sense of realism we see from the  individual bullets tearing up chunks of dirt and smoke from slowly disintegrating walls as your men clambour for more stable cover all the way to watching entire tank battles engage in titanic apocalyptic skirmishes and  listening to the sound and fury of artillery barrages and the resulting unbelievable carnage. COH is a sensory experience which leaves you shell shocked and obsessing for more. Sound is a vital part of the game which adds immensely to the sense of wartime immersion. Along with the aforementioned, there are thousand of lines of written dialogue for the units ranging from the humorous comments about the enemy from jaded and cynical riflemen to the panicky, terror stricken screams of tank units aware of their pending annihilation.  Multiple factions are available, each one with a different overarching philosophy from the blitzkrieg geared Wehrmacht to the artillery and defence focussed British. Within each faction there are several skill trees or individual philosophies to focus on. A fully researched out army can gain access to powerful missile launching ranger units along with heavy artillery pieces which can cause immense destruction from long distance. It's as savagely fun as it sounds. The missions are varied and include but not restricted to search, destroy and hold based objectives with each step involving access to more advanced units and vehicles. There are clandestine missions involving the locating and blowing up of long distance rockets to defending a hill under heavy attack. Regardless of the scenario you are guaranteed hours of intense gameplay leaving you feeling as though you just partook in a deadly game of desperate attrition, tactical assaults and bloody death. As stated, a truly landmark game which as stood the test of time amazingly well. A true PC classic which everyone must experience			"

												Company of Heroes blends several newer concepts of RTS (such as squad control and effect of terrain) into a single game . It removes resource gathering of traditional RTS games , and replace it with capturable resource points and victory points , which forces players from both sides to constantly fight all over the map . The graphic is good even by nowaday's standard and the sound effect / voice acting are great . The single player campaign will take some time to complete but the real fun lies in Multiplayer once you get used to game mechanics , a match against an equally skilled opponent can usually last over 40mins , its very intense and even more satisfying if you manage to defeat your opponant . Overall this is probably the best RTS I've played and I highly recommend it			"

												so after putting about 600 hours into this game (the new steam version) i can only give you a list of pro cons and things to rememberPROS:           + fairly good graphics when compared to other RTS gmaes           + dark (still funny) hummor EX:"" i don't want to die.... IN FRAAANNCCE- low health werhmacht soldier           + action packed (somtimes extremely frustrating) combat           + critical vehical damage system EX: main gun, engine destroyed and tracks being blown off           + diverse factions which all have 3 branches that provide extra commander and unit abilities aswell as units or              groups of units asertaining to the specific branches purpose EX infantry armor airbourne and (british) artillery           + additions of two new factions in DLC which is also a con because you have to pay for them but also adds new               campaings           + british are great a great addition to the allies           + panzer elite are a great addition to the axis           + both the british and panzer elite can counter each other with their own units and branches            +cheap pricing and alot of replayability with mods for the core game EX"" europe at war blitzkrieg               battle of the bulge and modern combat. (you could get a new triple A game for the price of two             company of heroes complete packs and still won't offer the replayability that CoH has) and now to do the part i like the least the consCONS:           -path finding problems          -occasionally the AI goes full retard and doesn't really build many defences and puts them in terrible places which            isn't part of going it going full retard thats just how the AI rolls, it does place mines around capture points though          -british can be OP when spaming emplacements especially 25 pounders          -panzer elite don't have a decent buildable medium tank like the Panzer IV F2 and up instead it gets the F1 which           has less armor and a short barrel 75mm gun which has terrible armor penatration but can at least kill stuarts.          -panzer elite players who are smart can use bergertiger recover tank to recover panther battle groups after calling            in more to get ridiculous numbers of panther tanks while going over pop cap (it is a viable strategy but it's costly             and takes alot time)In conclusion if your a RTS fan and like WW2 this is a great game for you and you'll probably want to go with the complete pack but you can get the base game for $10 or €9 and if your still not sure you want to spend money on it there is a free demo. I strongly recommend this game due to the (as mentioned before)  great core gameplay replayability and mods avaliable for the game that can give it an entirely new flavour like BOTB and modern combat or just make the core game it self harder, more extensive or both like europe at war and blitzkreig(yes i do know there are ALOT more pros than cons and thats because it's a solid game but those cons can be game breaking and yes for you veteran players i know i left some thing out but if i included everything this would take up more space than 4 brit players on semois and the people who are reading this and don't have the game wouldn't have anything to find out them selves)			"

												I remember having played this game for the first time when it was released. Being a fan of RTS games, especially the ones released by Relic, there was no way I was going to let this one go. It wouldn't be an understatement to say I was literally hooked from the word go. No RTS before or since has been on the same level as this. The single player campaign was just brilliant. If I had to point out a weakness, the only one I can come up with is that it’s a bit short. I just couldn't have enough of it. But it's not a perfect world. Relic’s competitors can maybe come up with a 20 mission campaign with mediocre results, but this one gave you 13 that were nothing short of brilliant. They were varied in terms of gameplay, offering multiple methods to achieve the objectives. It has been ages now since I last played it, but I still have fond memories of some of these missions, which I had played over and over, on every difficulty setting available. Some of these include a mission where you have to destroy a V2 missile base with your paratroopers, a mission where you have to hunt Panthers in a bombed out town, another hard as hell mission where you have to defend a hill, each amazing in their own right. It was revolutionary on many fronts too, when it came out. The graphics were on par with the best WWII themed shooters of that time, which was no mean feat by an RTS game. But most of all, it was the complete redesign of the multiplayer battles that initially came as a rude shock to me. No turtling anymore! Can’t have 20 defensive positions around your base, sit back, churn out an army, and then go after the opponent. If you want to win, if you want resources, then you will have to move your men out on the battlefield. To the frontlines, no retreat! Oh, but you could retreat if the ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan. These new design features to the basic gameplay probably changed the mindset of many an RTS gamer, who now had to pick his battles, maneuver his units effectively, capture resources, and go on to win the day. A benchmark had been set, which was to a large extent carried forward to the Company of Heroes 2 game. The initial game only had two sides, the US and the Wehrmacht (Germany). And yet, each game was compelling, almost always arriving at a nail biting finish. I still have fond memories of some 2v2, and 4v4 games that I played against friends in a Gaming zone. Although by the time I came on Steam, it had been a year since COH2 had been released. Although the ability to play COH2 online with people from around the world, testing my skills, and making use of everything this platform had to offer was the initial reason why I joined Steam in the first place, there was no way I was going to let the original COH slip by my collection. Pretty soon it was on sale, and I grabbed it along with all the expansions. If only there were steam achievements to go with it, I would have played it again right then. One day soon enough, I probably will again for the umpteenth time, when I finally give in to the dark whisperings of nostalgia. Company of Heroes is for me, and the reviews will prove it, one of, if not the best WWII RTS games ever made. There probably will be none like it. The gameplay mechanics, the design, sound, production, graphics, etc. are all top of the line. If I could ask the developer for one thing, it would be to make another expansion for this. For any of you who are fans of the WWII genre, just get this, and thank me later.9.5 / 10			"

												Company of Heroes is the rope that strings together the classic structure and ressource based RTS and THQ's new style capture points and ability based RTS that is best personified in the form of Dawn of War 2.Company of Heroes manages to mix the two styles quite well, particularly the presence of structures makes the blend between macro and micro much more smooth than in other THQ new style games where it's all micro.The graphics are strong and the music is decent. The single-player campaign is well made although the storyline and cut-scenes are something I could do without.Company of Heroes is a good game, by no means a great game, but a good solid title that can be thoroughly enjoyed by any fans of the genre. The multi-player does get a little stale however.			"

												This game is a must have if you are a fan of WW2 games. As an RTS, it allows the player to view the battlefield from various angles and elevation. The units are very authentic and the gameplay, although will seem slow for an average gamer, the time that creates the feeling of an actual war like scenario and put you in the commander's seat.The storyline is also good and if you cross check with the actual evvents of WW2, the missions are pretty much the story.I also have the DLC's for this game and their expansion packs Opposing fronts, and Tales of valor are equally good. After all these years, the game is still one of my favourite.The game will actually encourage you to know the units inside out and that will actually help you win the missions.All in all, a must have, very positive, educative, and an amazing game.

												Wanna hate your friends? Have them play Company of Heroes multiplayer with you. It's still one of the best RTS games ever made. There's few games that feel as vicious and personal as Company of Heroes. You don't just kill the enemy infantry. You use propaganda to force retreat a huge clump of expensive heavy infantry, timing it in tandem with a V-1 flying bomb attack on their base that vaporizes them just as they arrive.There's no units that serve a redundant purpose. The abilities are also very strong regardless of which faction you pick, especially compared to CoH 2 and you'll be hard pressed to blame the game balance for a defeat. There's also extensive options for bot matches and a pretty decent campaign if you don't do much offline. Absolutely worth it.			"

												*NOTE: Review is based on my 30+ hours in the ""New Steam Version"", which is not listed in the Steam Store.For a game made in 2006, Company of Heroes (and its expansions) still holds up well today. The game still looks pretty decent for our current time, which says something about how well made it is. The environments are very well detailed though the models don't look all that great (by today's standards that is), but that's acceptable as it is an RTS, where players would be looking at the whole map more than getting up close and personal with the units. This game is not just a looker too, it sounds great as well. The units all sound very unique and have their own lines, plus some hidden (and quite funny) ones when you click on them too much. The sound effects are also great and really immerse you in the battle at hand. In terms of gameplay, CoH is no slouch. The AI is pretty decent and can sometimes surprise you, though it does do stupid things from time to time. Many systems and mechanics are also present in this game, such as Cover & Suppression for infantry, Resource Sectors, and even positional damage for vehicles. Besides that, both the Americans and German Wehrmacht differ between each other and confer to different playstyles. On top of that, each faction also has a sub-faction, in the form of its Company Commanders that have its won unique set of abilities and perks. All of these mechanics and systems help in adding more depth to the game, and also makes it all that more enjoyable to play.The Campaign progresses linearly, but its also quite well done. The story of Able & Fox Companies are pretty decent and the missions are very enjoyable, though the difficulty of the missions increase quite fast. Each mission also offers Awards, which are only gained by completing special challenges in the missions, which can range from easy to hard depending on the player's skill level.There are, however, some negatives that must be mentioned about the game. The game is quite heavy on the micromanaging side, so it might be a bit hard for newcomers to the RTS genre. Besides that, only the Americans get a campaign and only two sides are available in the base game (Opposing Fronts fixes this by adding in two newAllied and Axis campaigns, plus two more factions). Also you can't match the same sides against each other, such as Americans vs Americas, or vice versa. That being said, it does not hinder the game from being an amazing title.In conclusion, Company of Heroes is a very good to amazing game that all RTS fans should play, as it is not just fun, but immersive and deep too. It is recommended to get the Complete version, as it adds in 5 new campaigns and 2 new sides to the base game's already solid Americans and Wehrmacht. And for the price that its being sold now, its pretty much a must-have.			"

However I will give you a warning, multiplayer in this game is bassically like this, if you have less than 1000 games played and 500 wins, then your a newb and you'll probably be kicked. Another thing is that there aren't many online games, there is rarely 20+ games availible to join, but hey, you could always host.Skirmish mode is amazing, the AI actually seems intelligent and knows how to evolve to fight you.The campaign is lots of fun to, but I think that anyone that plays this game can agree that the only thing they really play when they go on is skirmish or multiplayer.

												One of the best RTS out there In my honest and best opnionThis game is well worth the price. Nicely balanced. works great. Hexalots of fun, Multiplayer works, as well as dozens of mods. and best of all, you don't need no DLC to enjoy the base game. and the base game is only 7.99! (thats like 2 commanders for COH 2) Speaking about the DLC's they add a ton of extra. 2 new playable factions, with their respective campaigns, The british and the panzer elite(opposing fronts) and as well 3 mini campaigns (tales of valor)No need for pointless commanders costing 3.99 here. (looking at you company of heroes 2) Seriously recommended for anybody who likes a good RTS			"

												This is an RTS of pure genious design. The maps are well done, with plenty of natural cover to take advantage of and the campaign is both intense and full of surprise moments where you suddenly find yourself having to fall back to previously taken areas. The AI does suffer somewhat from moments of herp derp confusion and directional orders to vehicle like the Panther and STUH's can suddenly become ""BONZAI CHARGE STRAIGHT INTO THE ENEMY'S AT GUNS!"" but overall the game mechanics are solid and for the most part balanced between the 4 factions. My personal favorite is the Wehmacht and Panzer Elite for a number of reasons but one of the biggest reasons to love playing the Germans are the Nebelwerfers. Seriously those beasts, although they may seem rather unweildy and insignificant, can turn a battle around in seconds. If you have a line of them outside the enemy's base it's game over. It really it a personal triumph for Relic in it's own right that 10 years later it's still my personal favorite RTS even surpassing C&C Generals, a game I played religiously for many years until I picked up this game a few years back.

												Few games can revolutionize an entire genre of gaming, but ‘Company of Heroes’ is one of them. From the high-quality next-gen graphics to the unique style of RTS gameplay, Company of Heroes should be hailed as the definitive RTS game.It's a brilliant combination of incredibly deep real-time strategy, beautiful presentation and innovative features that make it one of the best gaming experiences of 2006 to date.There's just the right amount of micromanagement to start without feeling like you're ""fixing"" bad AI by controlling every single movement.It’s a gritty Second World War caper that loads the gaming experience to the hilt, leaving players battered, bruised and thoroughly stirred.

												IMO:If you're interested in a World War based stratigy game than this is the game for you.This is not something like ""Men of War"",""Total War"" and ""Wargame""..Those games that i mentioned above this. Are more Vehicle based,which i mean with is that its not really detailed as Company of Heroes (CoH).In CoH you can build bunkers,AA Emplacements, AT Emplacements,...and they are really detailed and nice modeled models..While in other games you don't..The controllers are fairly easily.. to learn,but there is a tutorial for the people who arent known with these control's..It has an awesome campaign,the maps are well done,the voice-overs are awesome.You can unlock more ""campaign's"" by buying the other 2 games of Relic:""CoH: Tales of Valor"" and ""CoH:Opposing Fronts"".While you are playing you can unlock a few units for the multiplayer..like ""The tiger 205"".In the rewards tab>Vehicles you can disable these unit(s)..Factions:Allied:The BritishThe AmericansAxis:The WehrmachtPanzer EliteYou can have more factions by downloading mods on ""Moddb.com""I can recommend this game its awesome but not for everyone...Sorry for my English and for this weird review <:			"

												2015, the game is almost 10 years old now.... and yet it still feels great. the game looks and plays like a game that is half, maybe even a quarter of it's age. sure, it does have it's problems, like i currently have some kind of grahical issue, still allowing me to play, but i can't see any details or any troops at all, atleast i have multiple PC's, still letting me play it :). I like to use this game as something to calm me down, after playing another game which frustrates me a lot. it's very satisfying to build up a whole assault, and then just unleash it on the enemies. I haven't tried online, so i can't say if the online is any good, but i have played the majority of the campaign and a lot of skirmish battles. I also played most of the ""Tales of Valor"" campaign on my old computer a few years ago, but i unfortunately couldn't save it. TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THE GAME: just note that the majority of battles aren't quick, in both campaign and in skirmish. I personally have had battles that have gone for 6 hours+, so it's definitely not a ""might just play a little"" game, if you want to play and complete a battle, you will have to put in a few good hours.

												I am only a little over an hour into the game when wrighting this review for Company of Heroes, but I can already reccomend it. The maps for each level is huge so it can get a bit chaotic when you have more than one Company at diferent parts of the map. The A.I is a bit challenging exspecially when their is a lot of them but the game gives you so many abilities that you have many options to defeat them. For $20 you are getting a whole lot of content as their is a lot of missions in the campaign.			"

												Company of Heroes is far more than just another WW2 RTS. It's one of the best RTS's ever made.It's gritty and realistic in its depiction of violence, but at the same time, it's funny from the soldiers' spontaneous lines. It's tactically complex with flanking maneuvers, defensive advantages, and special abilities, but easy to pick up. It's brutally difficult with its extremely tough AI, but ultimately isn't frustrating. The campaign is phenomenal, and the expansions are well worth playing (though Tales of Valor isn't quite as good as Opposing Fronts), so if you're an RTS fan, you owe it to yourself to play this.

												Game is awesomeI have played many RTS games such as the classic Command and Conquer series or Starcraft. But none of them got me soo hooked like Company of Heroes. The multiplayer is soo good, even to this day you are able to find lobbies to play this game even though COH 2 is out. The campaign on the other side is kinda boring.9,5/10			"

												Company of Heroes (CoH) is literally a ground-breaking real-time strategy (RTS) game that is set during World War II. The game plays with a heavy-hand in squad-based maneuvers, but it also features large armored units and unique aerial strikes which are limited as earnable powerups. The setting and the presentation of CoH is incredible compared to most modern-day RTS games given the quality of the maps and all the interactions that can be seen in the environment from mortar strikes to building sandbags on the spot. The drawback to CoH can be its constant micromanaging as you struggle to earn resources, build an army, path your units to destination while gathering intel on your enemie's whereabouts. However, each game can be quite satisfying where your strategy can shift given your choice of specializations (armored, infantry or engineers).			"

This game has shown how fierceful WWII used to be, probably the best WWII game.

												I reccoment the Normandy campaign, the rest of the expansions I tried them and they are really crap. Like a ""Hero"" mode or really quick and empty...Also the Normandy campaign at some point like 3\4 of it becomes really repetitive but it is still fun and accurate from historical point of view or at least respectful. The way instead of how paratroopers in other campaign are treated or how germans are ""rendered"" with a strong cultural bias and german accent like we were still culturally all in the berlin wall era, is really terrible and actually my negative comment is for the gameplay of the expansions.I rate positively the main part.

Some with large maps and story are really nice.Make sure to play this game with at least 1 gb videocard and at least a good processor.

												If you are fairly new to the RTS genre and want to play a game with hardly a learning curve, this is the game for you. If you're experienced with the RTS genre games but love WW2, this is also for you. This game pits you in multiple campaigns containing missions from anything from full-on armored convoy ambushes, stealth missions, to delivering supplies to a certain location. The mechanics of the AI however, are very frustrating at times. Example being, if you're trying to get your squad out of a middle of the road under heavy MG fire, sometimes they refuse to run and just decided to lay there, and your squad ends up dying rather than having a chance of survival for future encounters. The tank movement is a bit gritty aswell, when it comes to rotation. The tanks seem to back up when you don't want them to. Or they will rotate their rears where you do not want them to be vulnerable, and your rear hull armor/engines will get end up getting blown to bits. Besides these two small things, I have found it rather amusing that when one of your units get set ablaze, sometimes they will run towards an enemy squad and attempt to spread fire to the enemy units. Also if you have the Minesweeper attachment for your shermans, you can use it to tear away the limbs of your foes as it is just a bunch of spinning metal blades.Everything in this game is both good against certain things, and weak against others which makes this incredibly balanced, and you find yourself producing a wide variety of units and forming many kinds of tactics. What i love aswell, is that you can position your MG teams and mortars in a specific direction, and they will attack anything in that view which makes it super easy to attack and defend certain areas on a map.I truly enjoy this game, with the combination of epic soundtrack, explosions, and people screaming. 10/10 "

												Fantastic RTS. Probably the best ive played since starcraft.(not that im comparing the two) Great little WW2 history lesson packed in there too. Looking forward to finishing the (sort of ) historically accurate campaign in this one but I think  the sound effects seemed to make the guns sound too modern though. And the announcer wont shut the F up...like yeah I know what the krauts are doing and where they are doing it!  No need for the play by play. Great game though, I have not gotten into Multiplayer for it but I will say the singleplayer hooked me in easily. The graphics are a little dated I think, and even with a system that decimates the requirements.. I kept having some stuttering when panning over the battlefield here and there..( was not smooth panning like in starcraft) possible optimization issues or my operating system. or that I'm using  1440p  and 144hz monitor.. anyways: highly recommend this one. Came with new steam version,, which I have to use, but I cant review that one, so its here under the standard version.			"

												Where do I begin... Well, lets kick this review off by me saying this, I enjoy playing this game whenever I get on. This game is very enjoyable each time I hop on. But there are somethings people who will be getting into the game. #1. You will get ♥♥♥♥♥ if you've never played this game.#2. If your win/loss ratio isn't at least above .500 expect to be kicked for being a noob.#3. Learn the factions:A. Allies- Overall under dogs compared to the overwhemly German Factions of the Panzer Elite and Wermacht. One way to beat the axis, is to at all costs stop them from producing tanks. Get good infantry such as Rangers, or upgrade your airborne.For Britain, I like producing my Sherman Fireflys, and basically using Artillery. B. Axis- My favorite faction(can you tell by my name?) which has the best tanks in the damn game. If you can get panzers with a good amount of infantry to support your tanks call most of the game GG.Overall Grsde of the Game-AIf your new don't expect to automatically get in a game and whoop some butt. Chances are your going to get kicked. Play up to 100 Skirms with the Computer then begin playing more Multiplayer. If you have any questions feel free to comment.			"

												Company of Heroes is a very interesting twist on the status quo of stratagy. It's fast pace, yet very tactical. Instead of massing units like most ofther stratagies it often requires deploying the right troops, and sometimes knowing when to withdraw instead of dualing it out. It's single player campaign attempts to be emotional, and it does have a realistic side. Unlike Men of War's mechanic of cover however, the troops sometimes like wandering else where when fighting, proving to be annoying if you want them to stay put. The diffrences of three factions, yet being the same is also very interesting.Bases in this game are less of an influence then in others, and in some missions you have no base. The sit coms are nice, and some twists in the campaign is also fun. One problem I have is that there is no way to kill a unit you don't need, or need to remove to get more population, forcing you to suiside it instead...which...ehh... The second problem is that some missions carry over items, buildings, and units from your last encounter on that map. Although interesting, it makes it very difficult to transition from what was once a defense to now an assault. All your MG enplacments are now not as useful, and you end up with rather odd (but funny) situations. For example in the brittish campaign against the german airfield. The second part had me constructing defenses and had my command vehicle on one of the trencthes I had built in the prior mission...it was funny but somewhat troublsome.I got this game on sale and felt like it was a good buy. It might be worth full price, so pick it up if you need something long to acomplish.			"

												Certainly one of the 2 or 3 best RTS of all time. Much better gameplay than CoH2, though the presentation has a lower quality. The gameplay is less convoluted than for CoH2, which is the main flaw of the second version. It is an absolute must. The only problem is that for multiplayer battles, you must use the Steam version. The Steam version is buggy and deserves a patch. For singleplayers, there is no problem, use the non Steam version which is included.			"

Most annoying thing in the game is mortars and.... that.... one.... same..... line..... from.... AT guns...... ""AT SQUAD UNDER FIRE"" I swear i have heard that 3 times in 5 seconds.

On the other hand it's a little expensive because if you buy only a game without DLC you can play 1 campaign.You have to buy 2 DLC to unlock more campaigns.The DLC's are expensive so I would wait for sale,you should definetly get them on sale.Great game in general much better then CoH 2.

												One of the very best II. WW RTS games on the market. Company of Heroes offers countless hours of Campaign, Singleplayer and Multiplayer gameplay.The campaign leads you together with the American Army through France towards Germany and let's you reaply some battles of the second world war. While not being always historicly correct, the campaign is incredibly fun to play and offers a challenge to dedicated players on a higher difficutly.The single player consists of the just now mentioned campaign and the skirmish mode, where you can play with and against AI players on different maps. The Multiplayer Part is the same, just that you can play together with other human players too. What does the skirmish offer?You can play either Germany of the USA and build infantry, heavy weapons, armored cars, tanks, artillery, bunkers [...] to conquer territory & ultimatively destroy your enemy.  To do that you have to build a base, research upgrades, conquer waypoints and logistic spots. You gain ressources thanks to those and can build/upgrade whatever you desire.   The variety of units is totally ok and there are countless strategies on how to win a round. The different commander perks which you can choose ingame add new ways of tactic too. You can drop supplies, call in air support, ask for veteran tanks [...]  The graphics are top notch. If you are not satisfied with the allready existing one you can even use a few HD mods to imporve them even more.  This leads to another topic: Mods. You can download and install free mods to add new maps, commanders, armies (russians, eastern armies [...]) to add even more variety and fun!  I totally recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games in the WW II setting! 10/10			"

												One of my favorite strategy games. This game is fun and even challenging in a good way. This is for people that like challenges and use of strategic thinking. This game have it all: infantry, special infantry, light vehicles, tanks and most coolest thing: artillery. If you are playing against good opponent you can't just win with one of these playing styles, you have to combine them and use wisely which is what makes this game fun and challenging. This game is something in between the Dota 2 and realistic strategies like Men of War.Pros:+Lots of possibilites and styles to play+Good graphics for such an old game+Well designed maps and 4vs4 maps +Amazing and fun voice overs and sounds +Simple and easy interface+Game effects, explosions, smoothiness Cons-Not enough 4vs4 maps and other maps aswell-Can become unbalanced teams in multiplayer, sometimes host of the game does this on purpose for an easy win-Need more players overall in CoH multiplayerRecommended to people that like challenges and use strategic thinking. Also to those that like wars and it's history and just overall anyone who plays for fun and enjoys battles. "

												Overall one of the top RTS games of all time. CoH provides unparalleled atmosphere for an RTS with fun game mechanics. If you like strategy games in even the slightest, you owe it to yourself to play the single player campaign. Multiplayer is very refined as well - offering more depth and requiring less ""build order memorization"" than SC2. The only problem I had with the game was the arbitrary mission design (in a few cases) where gameplay was artificially inflated and unnecessarily frustrating, but this was the exception and not the rule.

												This is a game for fairly serious RTS players only. There are a large number of factors and tactical considerations to ponder, and a majority of the maps are not really fair. I would warn players that many would find this game tedious and boring if they are not in the right mindset when playing the game. You have infantry and tanks, as well as everything in between. The objectives are dynamic, in that the game presents them in a way that does not seem like the entire mission is ""go here and kill everything along the way"". Progress is generally slow, and the game tends to rush you. The pathfinding is a bit suspect. The satisfaction is not.There have been times that I had to quit playing to keep cool since the game likes to suggest that you do stupid things and then scold you for screwing up. It is really annoying when it YELLS at you to do A, then A is obviously going to end in death.The expansions are more of the same.

Balanced statistic can help or fail. This game is so fun in campaign and in coop and multiplayer events like tank battles or capture the terretory. To sum up its ideal to play with your friends.

												Fantastic RTS game with excellent replayability. The game basically allows you to experience all of your favourite WW2 films from a commanders perspective. Though the scale of troops and battlefield map is relatively small, there is a variety of tools and toys you can play around with. The single player campaigns are addictive. A good single player game needs to have a well-polished story and character progression, here gameplay is well balanced with story which makes completing objectives interesting. I haven't played Multiplayer, but I have a feeling that the multiplayer aspect is where this game shines and the single player is good for a quiet weekend or for casual players who just want a little bit of fun. RTS and war fans MUST play this game.			"

												The game's really good.Doesn't lag badly (mentioning this since mah laptop is getting old n' dusty) and the game's also challenging.A single mission can easilly drain your time as you progress in the campaign.However it is challenging it's also only one campaign,and the adds in the game for the expansion sets are a sore in the ey though, and discourage you,unless you think it's actually worth it.Furtherwise there's loads of detail in the game, however I didn't dare to put the graphics any higher in case it would start lagging.As low graphics already look good, I tested the game with highest settings too, yet that lags for me but that's reasonable,the game looks amazing but yet it doesn't really bother me as the gameplay ultimatelly makes this up.Other than the brutal difficulty and the in-game adds for the expansion set 4.5 / 5			"

												This is without a doubt the best combination RTS and World War II game I've ever encountered. With expansions, this offers so much potential in terms of strategies, and the weapons seem for the most part historically balanced, albeit with some units being one offs in real life. Company of Heroes gives HOURS of game play with relatively simple to learn, but difficult to master, controls; one well played game can go for 4 hours against similarly skilled opponents. If you like RTS games, and see this up for sale, or in some deal, it would be doing yourself a favor to get this game.			"

Made by Relic when they were still owned by THQ (THQ is now defunct and Relic was bought by Sega). it utilizes the same engine as the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II game. Use artillery, call in air support, control squads of infantry and heavy support weaponry, build defenses, tanks, snipers, rocket launchers, etc. The multiplayer networks are a bit weird now that they've been transferred over from THQ to Steam, but it's still very worth a try.

												In my short (if 70+ hours at the time of writing this can be called ""short"") time playing Company of Heroes, I've learned something.For one, Dawn of War II makes even less sense to me now.For two, Relic outdid much of the RTS genre in this title. Mixing in rich tactical depth and an expanded strategic metagame, I'm astonished that StarCraft is still the most popular strategy game out there. Directional cover, resource-based abilities, and directional armor management of tanks are just a few points that come to mind that separate this game from others in its style. While it may be somewhat difficult for the inexperienced to pick up, Company of Heroes still offers what I would believe to be a very high skill ceiling, something I simply cannot call a failing.Graphically, the game remains very impressive. Ragdoll physics, high-fidelity models, and a masterfully crafted audio component all function together well, possibly even better optimized than its counterparts despite all this. While I understand that the game has been out for some six years, I've encountered little - if any - bugs in my time, all of those I could truly count as results of my own modding endeavours.In short, there's not much bad I can say about the game. While the campaign felt simple and even routine at times, it was still a pleasant experience. With modding capabilities and a map editor packaged with the game, third-party support is most definitely there.If you enjoy strategy games, there's simply no way I could not suggest this game. And at only $10 USD, a shoestring budget will hardly get in the way. While newcomers to the strategy genre may be better served starting with a simpler game such as the aforementioned StarCraft or a Command & Conquer title, the game's tutorials still offer a good starting point for veterans of classic RTS games and beginners alike.

												Let me just say right now: This is the best WW2 game I have ever played. Battles are glorious and (For those fellow DoW fans) This is nothing like Dawn of War, Sure the core structure is similar but everything is different. This game requires you to be constantly on the move, you cannot camp your army at your base until its fully upgraded because the Axis/Allies WILL dominate the map and they can be ruthless. As soon as your spawn you'll want to send out troops to gain land by capturing control points (Strategic points) These points are far more important as they give you Fuel (For cars etc) weaponry (Upgrades). Although at times I think that the accuracy of guns should of been increased, the game is fairly balanced. 9/10 - It's just a shame that there aren't more factions to play as (US and Germnay for Vanilla game, British and Panzer elite for Opposing Fronts DLC)			"

												Not the greatest or the longest campain but it puts you through serveral interesting challenges. The real fun in this game has to be in the skirmishes they are absolutely amazing. In the beginning of the fight your troops will hide in behind sandbags and in building for cover. Coming to the end of the match your soldiers will be hiding behind broken halftracks and tanks or in craters made during a menacing fight. The cover system is unmatched by any RTS I have seen yet. Best RTS i have ever played hands down.			"

Fantastic game, definitely worth every penny.Ooh, don't invest in the sequel, though.

												I have much more time on this than listed on Steam.  Believe the hype - this game is as great 10 years later than when it was initially released.In many ways this is a throwback to when C&C games were still great, but adds more to the genre without adding too much.If you haven't played an RTS game this is definitely the best one to start with (namely because getting C&C Red Alert to install must be a nightmare 20 years later).

												As a casual player, games like these really ought to have a pause game feature so we can assess the situation at our own pace and issue orders while in pause. I'm talking about single player mode ofcourse. The AI always uses distraction tactics that can make it very hard to get a good hold of what's going on soon enough. (EDIT: After 30 hours of gameplay, it occurred to me to google up the hotkeys since I suspected there must me more than the game shows us. AND THERE ARE. The game menu does not list the keyboard bindings and so I had no idea that the pause key could actually pause the game. This isn't indicated as an option on the gamplay HUD either :/  )While it truly is a fun game. It comes with it's fair share of big bugs. The biggest was that the game would always start in windowed mode. There is no setting in the options that can change this. I had to look up the issue to find these solutions :Solution 1: ALT+ENTER worked once. Solution 2: The one that worked so far is:- go to Documents\My Games\Company of HeroesOpen Local.ini with Notepad.Change the line'screendevice=DirectX10 rendering device'To'screendevice=DirectX9 rendering device'Save and start COHBug #2: The halftrack vehicles are supposed to be APVs. We should be able to load personnel into them, and you can... ONCE. You load one group into a truck and that's it for the rest of the level. (EDIT: 20 hours of gameplay and I now find out that this happens once you upgrade the half track. Which is a shame really. )Bug #3: The save game function is faulty. It does not save the game properly most of the time. If you choose to load a saved game, instead of picking up where you left off, it will start from the beginning of the mission. I thought this was done purposely by the developers. But it doesnt always work this way. This means I have wasted a lot of ime in being forced to restart the game level. I'm a risk averse player, which means I like to take my time and set up a flawless defence. This takes up a LOT of time. So being forced to restart a level because of a chink just upsets me.			"

												This game was nothing else than brilliant. It gives you a perspective that no other game does. Me and my friend Jonny played this game all the time. We spent hours on it and could not think about missing out on a game. We used to support each other through battles and always joked about the lighter things. It was some of the best times of our life not counting on the whole war and all. We fought with honour and courage like no other men. During one battle we were side by side; surrounded by advancing German troops. Our gunner team was hit and we had no suppressive fire covering us and the advancing enemy was drawing close. Soon they were around us in a horse shoe shape. Me and Jonny fought with fire in our hearts, victory in our mind and fear in our eyes. We held off the advancing enemy troops with our machine guns and snipers but that's were it got worse. Panzer amour was coming up the road and we had only our bazooka which would not do a thing to it. At this moment me and Jonny faced each other and gave a look that would only come from a man who knows that the risk he is putting to save his country has just become real. Despite from this we kept on fighting; holding of the enemy advance but whatever we did we could not hold on for much longer. We knew that for one of us that this trench will be our final resting place. We took a few seconds to rest to contemplate our lives and what we are proud of and what we regret. We fought on and on, not letting up. I kept turning to Jonny for reassurance making sure that he is always there. We held off the attack for another 5 minutes.But at that moment my worst fears had become true. I heard a distinct ping sound and as I turned to him all I was greeted with was a dead body. At first I only thought that someone had taken Jonny's place and was killed but on closer inspection I feared the truth. The sinking feeling was like a dagger in the gut; a feeling I would never want to feel again. And at that moment I held him in my arms, in a way that would seem to save him and I wept like a baby that had just been born. During this the enemy advanced to our trench and saw me cradling this body which had no meaning to anyone anymore. To my luck these Germans took pity on my and spared my life but at that moment I wanted to join Jonny in the afterlife. I went through denial, saying to myself ""You can't be dead, you can't!"". I even tested the existence of God. Why would God take a good man off this earth when there are people who exist such as the SS. Then I came back around to the Germans pointing rifles at me when they proceeded to fall to the ground. The sound of Spitfires filled the sky and the advancement of allied forces took control of the battle.Jonny was only 2 minutes away from living but as war goes, 'a man must lay his life for the greater good of his country'. And for so many other men this was just a dot in the progress of war. And who will remember Jonny. Not for just a man but for who he really was. The only way to find this is through war so the bond between soldiers is stronger than any other. He will be remembered for who he was but I will remember for who he is and who he will always be- A true hero.So yeh. This was a pretty good game; I give it an 6.5/10			"

												I don't play RTS games often, (and if I do it's only for single player) but out of the few that I have played the games from Relic are damn amazing. In a similar way in which I loved Warhammer 40k: Dawn Of War, I also adore Company of Heroes. Major difference when compared to Starcraft or AOE is that you control groups/squads of units instead of single ones. Game utilizes terrain composition and environment to an extent that I haven't seen in other RTS games. On the other hand though it's clearly strategy > development game.Pros:- great influence of the map environment in a gameplay- well balanced game in terms of unit perks/skills- interesting single player campaign not only about ""just destroy enemy HQ every single time""- allows to come up with different strategies to get a win- nice physics- with all expansions provides an entertainment for a long timeCons:- at some point feels a bit repetitive as there's small unit variety and same base development every round- graphics are ok for 2016, but those engine-rendered cutscenes stand out a bit...

												Following the legacy of Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines and Fallout Tactics, and rivaling World In Conflict, this game is for those who enjoy managing small squads rather than massive armies. If you mourn the fall of the RTS genre, check out this flagship of the ""RTT"" genre.			"

												This game is still incredibly fun after 10 years. Very well detailed, well written, and fun RTS. I've completed every campaign at least 5 times. The almost fully destructable environments are something you just don't see in even today's games. The only gripes I have are that it's almost too easy (certain missions are virtually impossible to fail), Snipers are VERY OP, minor AI issues, minor pathing issues, & no Achievements (came out before Steam made those).I've seen it go on sale time to time for about $2.50. For that price it is a can't miss.Highly Recommended. "

												One of the still standing RTS games from the old era. Empire Earth is dead, Age of Empires is dead. Long live Company of Heroes! The RTS system used in the Company of Heroes gameplay is vastly different from the other popular RTS of its era. It is highly recommended to go through the tutorial (as I did not the first time I played it) because the way you control and create units it is based on squads, and that gives the gameplay a lot more dynamism when you are openly battling the other factions and taking territories. The graphics are quite amazing, with destructible environment. You can even zoom in to see each of your units! Gameplay-wise this is a highly strategical game in which the occupation of territories actually holds a real value, compared to other RTS. So remember to have one or two squads around the corner ready to surprise the enemy, as they may not be expecting you to have rigged with explosives the bridge their tanks are in! This is a highly replayable, highly entertaining, time consuming RTS. Before I bought it in Steam I had the disc (oh, such times!) and I had some pretty amazing, long lasting matches which sometimes had to be called off because well... we needed to eat and let the sun outside hit us. Either way, in 2017 it still is a terrific game to be playing, either this one or the sequel, but keep up the support for this series!10/10Buy it, play it and don't regret it.			"

 Company Of Heroes 2006 Genre: Rts, HistoricalActivity: MinimalWorkshop: NoDLC: YesUser reviews: 96% positiveMetacritic 93/100 Brief Description A semi-classic genre defining WW2 Real-time-strategy game with a sequal which means its not as active anymore.  My first impressions I recently got this game for $3.24 and honestly, I don't regret it. I got into the gameplay with the first hour of playing. There are so many play styles and game modes. 4v4, 3v3, 2v2, 1v1 with an assortment of AI difficulties, 60+ Maps, 2 gamemodes and many unique factions to choose from. I chose to do a full tank squad that consisted of 10 tanks that would dominate. The commanders options are pretty cool but get old quite quick. Pros 1. Great gameplay2. Multiple units to play with3. Wide varient of maps4. Battles5. Single-Player/skirmish6. Replayable7. The graphics have aged well8. Commander mode (Air/Infantry/Armoured focus modes)9. Cheap10. Amazing unit strats and commands Cons 1. Crashing is common2. 16 gig download but 7.6 gig download for the new steam version?3. Only 2 fractions without dlc4. Multiplayer is slightly dead5. Annoying camera controls6. Strange money system7. Tedious gameplay that can drag on if something stupid happens8. Fullscreen is bugged9. CoH 2 is out and only a bit more expensive ($8 price difference)10. Tanks dont always follow commands Overall I love this game due to the amount of maps and units. I personally give it 8.4/10 Extras  There is a HL2 mod that is basically a reskin of this game. Lambda wars, at this time the game is in Beta so it isn't finished obv, alot of things with be getting added such as Vehicles, more units and more factions. So far its combine vs rebels. Also its free!Its really cool playing from the perspective of a rebel/combine commander from the Hl2 universe.Also, hl2 being based in the future means more advanced tools such as invisible scanners, headcrab launchers, dark matter cannon, striders and more strange futuristic weaponry/items.Get it here  "

												Hey it's great fun to learn the game and play it. I spent about 100 hours going back over and replaying levels. Sadly, just at the end I get almost through the last level and the game freezes and complains it can't find som bug.dll file or something. A bit frustrating not to be able to finish it. Still, nothings perfect.			"

												This is an outstanding strategy and tactics game! You never know how a battle will end and the battle can swing back and forth at a moments notice. Every little detail counts in this game, as simply facing a machine gun a certain direction can have it either hold off waves and waves of infantry or become easily overrun by a single squad of riflemen.Units are also a great aspect of this game, as every faction has tons of unique and individual units, and each army feels completely different from the others. These units all complement each other very nicely, and no sole unit can win the game. You must use your units to work together to defeat the enemy.Visually and graphically this game is very pleasing as well. Graphics are nice and detailed and the terrain is fully destructable. Sound is also great in this game, with especially great voice acting for all of the units keeping the game from becoming completely dark and depressing, with units occasionally cracking truly humorous remarks.Overall, this is a great game for anyone who likes strategy and tactics, and if you aren't sure if you want to get the second one yet due to it's still high price(although it is just as good as this game but even more improved) this is a great game to get into real time tactics.

												i HIGHLY recommend this game, probably my favourite RTS game of all time! In the game, you choose between 2 sides: the United States or the Wehrmacht (German), and if you have the DLC for the game, you can also choose: The Commen Wealth or The Panzer Elite (which is pretty much the regular German team, but with different and/or more tank options and less infantry). The game includes a Singleplayer Campaign (which is expanded if you have the DLC), and great Multiplayer gameplay, with a bunch of maps to choose from, some maps being small for 1v1 matches, and some being massive for 4v4 matches. another thing really good about the multiplayer is most of the time the community is really good (of course, every once in a while you run into that guy who thinks he runs the show). ALSO, if u do happen to get bored after a while of playing the same thing over and over, there are LOTS of mods to choose from, for example: Modern Combat mod, Eastern Front mod and the Blitzkrieg mod. To sum it all up, excellent game! ARMOR IS GOOD TO GO!-------10/10 Shermans			"

												Wow, where do I start with this masterpiece...Company of Heroes is a game that's hard to categorize. A hybrid space sim/racer/fps/jrpg didn't seem doable, but Relic Entertainment somehow pulled it off. The gameplay requires a lot of skill from the player, but rewards smart play more than most modern games. The boss fights are all brilliantly executed, and the puzzles are a perfect balance of challenging and enjoyable. An edgy, thought provoking plot about modern imperialism and its effects on the geopolitical landscape in the year 2045 could easily have fallen flat, but writers Steven King and Neil Degrasse Tyson have managed to create a terrifying dystopia in which anything seems possible. This gives Company of Heroes a heightened sense of terror and surrealism that sets it apart from the rest.I only have a couple of complaints. The graphics on level 3 definitely need some tightening up, the 3rd fetch quest you do for the ""Horse"" character becomes a bit tedious, and the all-rap soundtrack felt a bit inapproriate considering the serene environments, particularly in the hell level. This isn't enough to put a damper on the overall experience, though. Solid gameplay and a cartoonish aesthetic coupled with whimsical minigames and a surprisingly deep sandbox mode make Company of Heroes an easy GOTY contender. The boss fights are all brilliantly executed, and the puzzles were the perfect balance of challenging and enjoyable.Raccoon/Turtle			"

												Really fun game, realistic story line and overall a good game. Can't really get bored of it until you have completed the campaign and played the skirmish mode alot. The missions follow the Normandy Invasion. You are a group of airbone troops who have landed behind the beaches on 6th June and fight the Nazi's to liberate France.8/10			"

												It's not my favourite game in the genre but it's a very solid RTS that does almost everything in the right  way. The only limit form my point of view is that the game is too oriented toward MP and I'm not interested in that kind of experiences.Vote: 7			"

												This game may be 10 years old by 2014, however, this is a game I highly recommend. Despite its age, this game will never get old or boring, Its simply, an excellent game for the dedicated RTS gamer or newcomer alike. PLEASE NOTE: After the switch to the Steam Servers, there have been problems with the multiplayer games such as Sync. Errors booting you from games and etc.-Use the New Steam Version of COH to play the multiplayer and receive updates, don't use the original Relic version if you wish to get acess too these.			"

As if now, only USA and england are playable. And the Axis has nazi germany and another nazi elite force. Bc of this I think its most fun to play with your friends. That, is really fun. 9/10 Very good game.			"

												Wow, where do I start with this masterpiece...Company of Heroes is a game that's hard to categorize. A hybrid space sim/racer/fps/jrpg didn't seem doable, but Relic Entertainment somehow pulled it off. The gameplay requires a lot of skill from the player, but rewards smart play more than most modern games. The boss fights are all brilliantly executed, and the puzzles are a perfect balance of challenging and enjoyable. An edgy, thought provoking plot about modern imperialism and its effects on the geopolitical landscape in the year 2045 could easily have fallen flat, but writers Steven King and Neil Degrasse Tyson have managed to create a terrifying dystopia in which anything seems possible. This gives Company of Heroes a heightened sense of terror and surrealism that sets it apart from the rest.I only have a couple of complaints. The graphics on level 3 definitely need some tightening up, the 3rd fetch quest you do for the ""Horse"" character becomes a bit tedious, and the all-rap soundtrack felt a bit inapproriate considering the serene environments, particularly in the hell level. This isn't enough to put a damper on the overall experience, though. Solid gameplay and a cartoonish aesthetic coupled with whimsical minigames and a surprisingly deep sandbox mode make Company of Heroes an easy GOTY contender. The boss fights are all brilliantly executed, and the puzzles were the perfect balance of challenging and enjoyable.Raccoon/Turtle			"

CoH is one of those few memorable strategy games that puts all others of it's genre to shame with it's dynamic game mechanics, impressive visual and audio (considering it's back from '06), and enticingly realistic scenarios.  A must-have for any fans of the more well-known RTS games such as Age of Empires, Starcraft/Warcraft, and Warhammer.

The game is broken into 4 factions, 2 if you dont have tales of valor ( Which I reccomend getting ) and has many units, it is amazing in my opinion.Also I checked the second games reviews, it doesnt look like people like it much.

Stick with the Company of Heroes (New Steam Version) as it has improved visuals and funtional Multiplayer since Relic Online does not work anymore!

												Company of Heroes is an amazing RTS. Relic has done a great job with this game and has set the bar high for future RTS games. Company of Heroes has a lot of attention to detail, adaptable play, and fast action. Has completly destructable enviroments. Can't say much other than that the game has addicting gameplay and detailed visuals. If you're a RTS fan I would highly recommend this game.			"
