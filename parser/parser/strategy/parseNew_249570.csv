												In this current state The Castle Doctrine is dead. This game lacks new players which every MMO game needs. At the time i'm writing this review, only 20 houses are available, and almost all of them are the experienced players so it's almost impossible for a new player to get used to it. In my opinion, it's developer's fault, who thinks this game doesn't need sales. Just don't buy it.			"

												I've had the alpha of this for a long time, so I've played it much more than my Steam account would suggest.  I love the concept of this game.  It's really a great idea behind it.The problem for me is that the game itself has trouble matching up to that actual concept.  I don't think this is the developer's fault at all.  He clearly has tried to balance the game as much as is possible.  It's just that it quickly devolves into a sort of class system.  If you've got a ton of money, you can protect your house amazingly well and do some incredibly intricate work.  If you don't have a ton of money, you're pretty much screwed, because you can't protect anything well at all.  And the problem here is that being able to get more money depends on robbing some other houses of people who do have money... meaning that you're up against near-impossible traps and schemes.And another issue for me is the family mechanic.  Having a family prevents you from doing some things for protection because you need to have a clear path for them to escape.  But as soon as someone kills your family, you're actually in many ways BETTER OFF, because it means you can make even crazier traps.  The amount of additional income they add just doesn't make up enough for the amount of people who will die trying to rob your house if you're able to make some of the more deadly setups.Again, I don't think that any of this is the fault of the developer.  There have been a bunch of updates since the first alpha that have attempted to improve this situation.  Unfortunately, it almost seems like it is a limitation in the concept itself - one that takes all the fun out of it for anyone who is starting out.  I really wanted to like this game, but I just haven't been able to despite checking in after many different versions/updates.			"

												In the games current state, I would not recommend it. There is absolutely no help for you once you jump in the game, no tooltips or tutorials whatsoever. There is a user guide which was very helpful to me, but I don't think that people should have to rely on guides to figure out the basics of a game. It's all pretty much trial and error for noobies, and can be very overwhelming with all the different types of blocks and such, especially when you have no idea what any of them do. While trial and error is good and all, when it's the only way you have to learn the game's mechanics, it becomes quite tedious. I also think some of the games mechanics need to be reworked - such as dying in your own home. In order to finish booby-trapping your house, you have to reach your vault yourself, which I think makes perfect sense. However, if you die while testing out your defenses, you start over from scratch. Sure it makes sense, but I think the player should just simply be cut a break here. How are we supposed to know if a certain trap works if we can't test it ourselves? There's also a five minute rule. In which if you are inactive for five minutes, the game kills you off; this happens even if you are testing your own home. As far as I understand the developer is frequently updating the game so I'd advise waiting for a few patches to roll out before trying this game.Edit: After playing a bit more of the game I'm starting to realize how broken it is. Rather than using clever traps that require the robber to think in order to break into the vault, I'm finding most people just use simple game-breaking tactics that make it pure luck if anyone succesfully robs you. An example of this that I've seen quite often is making columns with walls with a door at the end of each one, behind one door is their vault, behind every other is a pitbull ready to bite your face off. That is just one of many examples I've seen, which makes robbing other people's houses nearly impossible. This game is a great idea and I hope the developer can find a way to fix these issues, but until then this game is not worth your money.Second edit: The game can certainly be fun, after doing some research on traps, tools, etc. via the wiki and understanding the game a bit more it became pretty addicting. I still would not recommend this game because robbing others houses is just simply too hard. There's many cheap tactics you can use and in most cases I find myself either stepping inside someone's house, turning around and leaving, or walking around a bit and end up dead with everything I worked for lost. The addicting/fun part of this game for me is building my house, then watching people attempt to run through it, while killing my family in the process. Robbing others is just way too risky, and about 99% of the time will end up getting you killed. As a lot of others have mentioned, there is also a huge level of unfairness depending on how much money you have. I think that as long as the people on the top of the list don't get themselves killed from robbing others, then they'll just stay at the top from people trying to rob them (you get a bounty reward when robbers die inside your house). These giant maze-like houses become literally impossible to break into after a certain point, when just one false step can end up being fatal; and with dozens of doors to choose from, it's pure luck if anyone were to ever succeed. Definitely could use some balancing - for starters I'd suggest raising the measly $2,000 starting cash; even an extra $500 would be enough to make a difference. Whether it be more money to defend your home, or buy tools to break into someone elses, or have more in your vault to attract robbers attention to get their bounty, or more money for them if they successfully rob you - the more money that goes around, the better. As long as it doesn't go to the rich scumbags, haha.Feature requests: Due to how often you die in this game, it would be nice to have layout saves, which would be especially useful for the start of the game. There's not a whole lot you can do with the beginning $2,000, so once you find a starting layout that you like it'd be nice to not have to build it over and over again each time you die. It would be useful for the end-game as well, and maybe the developer didn't add it in because he didn't want people to use the same layout each time, but I know that a majority of people will find one they like and stick with it rather than going through the trouble of coming up with a new one, if the developer wants them to or not; so a layout feature would just make it less of a hassle.Secondly, because of how hard it is already to rob peoples houses, I don't think that you should lose every item in your backpack if you make it out alive. Dropping the items to make room for their cash in the vault makes sense.Third, improve the search at the menu. As of now you can only search by name, and the list is sorted by richest to poorest. Add some more filters, such as ""people who robbed you"" or ""sort by poorest"", even the option to search by money rather than name would be nice. Obviously the people with the most money will have the hardest houses to break into, so if you're starting out you could try breaking into some low/mid-tier houses instead.Lastly, a hand tool when building your house. When making a mistake while building you have to flip through the different items/blocks/animals and re-place them where you want them. It would be much easier and speed up the process if I had a hand tool that allowed me to just pick stuff up and drop it somewhere else, which could then be doubled as a tool that let me select multiple items by dragging a box, and moving them all at once.

												Good idea, deeply flawed execution.  You are not given enough resources to protect your own meager safe, nor go out and rob someone else's.    I have a feeling only those who have been playing a long time have been able to experience the intricate trap building that should be accessible to every player in this game; and is in fact the primary allure of purchasing The Castle Doctrine in the first place.  For new players, however, the game is simply a race to rip off someone else whose stash is as equally completely defenseless as yours.    For new players, this is not a thinking man's game.  You don't spend your time solving puzzles and building.  Instead, you leave your ""castle"" empty so you can attempt to rip off other new players, as they too cannot afford defenses.  While you are out you're hoping you aren't ripped off from someone more powerful or equally desperate, so you can put together some funds.  Improving your situation isn't possible in practice.  You are barely even given enough money in the beginning to properly wall off an area, let alone build a simple logic trap, or electrified door.  Needs balancing.			"

												I bought the alpha a few days ago before it was on steam, I have to say I didn't think much of the game at first till I started to learn more and more about it, it seems hard and complicated at first till you fail a few times and then you are off improving your designs further each time. One of the coolest features of the game is the security tape system which allows you to see your house being robbed, where weaknesses are and what you can do next time to improve upon it. This is more akin to a roguelike where you only have one life, things can get rather tense very quickly and it draws you back again and again! .. this is one of the best games I've played this year.. mind you this review is written in January!

Since it's release, the playerbase has fallen apart. I was so excited for this.

												The Castle Doctrine had a very nice thought, yet was terribly executed.For one, the game is hyper-realistic. when trying to get to your vault by testing your traps, you can actually die by your traps. And I mean literally die, so you have to start all over again. even the smallest change to your house will make you test it again. Another thing is that you can give your wife a shotgun as a defense, and she will kill you.Next, there is interface. While playing, I felt very, very enclosed. no real menus, you only get to see one kind of screen, and most of the time it's just black darkness. It alwas uses re-ocurring colors like grey, orange, dark cyan and black. it seems very bland and boring to just look at.Graphics aside, we are onto gameplay. My gosh, is it hard to even take a step. you start off in house with your wife and kids and $2000. You can either use the money to build your house, or you can use it to get robbing equipment. Oh, and by the way, the main premice of the game is to rob people or steal robbers' bounty. You can go to the list of countless people and rob their houses, but you know you can't. Somehow, someway, everyone on that list has figured out the perfect way to protect thier house and get tons of ca$h. So how do you win? You can't. You'll try , but after about 5 minutes you realise that no mattter what you try to do, it's impossible to get more than your base $2000.To sum it up, The Castle Doctrine is not worth half it's price. It's badly made, which will make you expect much more. But no, I pretty much told everything in this review. I thing the price for $16 dollars asking for waaaayy to much, so it should be down to $5. Anyways, the promotional sale was literally the only discount ever on this game.It's literally in the announcement. So if you have $16 to burn, do NOT use it here. Please use it somewhere else. Thank you.			"

												Stay far away from this.  It's really hard for me to call it a game, to be honest.  I could write about how broken the progression is, or how buggy it is, how awfully coded and designed it is, and how people are hacking it to pieces essentially destroying the entire purpose of it being an MMO, but I feel those subjects have already been covered enough by plenty of other people.  What I would rather discuss is the price and its relation to what the product is actually worth.Everything here feels like an experiment, from the ""game"" itself, to the pricing, to even the developer's lifestyle, and really in the end the customer as well as the health of the community are the ones paying the price.  The developer's ""anti-sales"" stance means the community will only die over time and never flourish.  For a ""game"" that trys to promote itself as an MMO, it means a unsustainable fanbase.  Anyone joining at this time will surely find only the super hardcore players and an even smaller window of opporotunity to learn the mechanics and to get better, from an already overly harsh learning curve.Want to suggest anything at all and provide feedback?  Well, apparently unless you've put in hundreds of hours of gametime, the community and the developer want nothing to do with you, and will freely attack you and assume even the tiniest suggestion means you want to turn the entire game inside out.  Ask to streamline the learning curve in anyway and you'll be accused by players that you are a terrible gamer and can't handle the (bad) design, or that you're just wanting permadeath removed (Like I was accused of).  It doesn't matter that a large majority of games I play and love most are brutally challenging games with permadeath as their prime feature (games like Spelunky, Binding of Isaac, FTL, etc), in their eyes I wanted permadeath removed.  I even saw the developer personally tell his players that were hoping for more from it that ""the game's not for you"", which just seemed rude and completely self-sabotaging.One could argue that this ""game"" is okay in the end, just like how you could squint your eyes hard enough to make a whale into a supermodel, its a neat experiment concept in theory but really what brings this down is the price.  There are players who do enjoy the game so it is possible that you will also.  But it's just a question of whether or not you're willing to put down the $16 to find out whether or not this experiment fits you, which is a big pricetag for a ""probably not"".  The game is nowhere NEAR worth $16, there are $1-2 iPhone/Android games that are almost twice or more what this game offers.  I love experiemental games, I love when developers push the boundries of what defines a game, but usually the price is adjusted and recognized for what it's actually worth. I read the developer first tell new players to ""put more time into it before judging it"" which is fair, but then I saw him say to another who did put the time into it and still didn't like the game that because he had all those hours that he should consider it being worth the price.  I also read a statement from him saying that there are players who put hundreds of hours into his game, and therefore that justifies the pricetag.  But I could play with my own rectal filth for a thousand hours, and that wouldn't make it worth anything more then what it actually is.			"

												The Castle Doctrine has two basic game modes; in one, the player constructs a sophisticated system of traps to protect their valubles, and in the other, they atempt to overcome the traps of other people.  This was a solid game premis, but is unfortunately spoiled by extremely unbalanced and difficult gameplay.       In general, although the game effectively conveys what Extra Credits refer to as 'mechanics as metaphore', it would  be nice if the game were actually fun.  Unfortunatly, the game far too effectively convey's a sense of hopelessness, depravity, sadness, and poverty by essentially wringing the player for effort - one can spen hours building a good home, only to die and instantly loose everything.  Or they can die over and over and over again trying to break into other peoples houses only to find that their princess is in another castle - I mean, that person didn't have any money anyways.     In summary, if you want a game that will make you feel sad, want to give up, or hang yourself in front of your children (and yes, that is an in game option), this game will convey those feelings with extreme prejudice.

												I was really excited about the idea of this game.  The author did a good job of providing a sense of ""hype"" to those of us that enjoy old-school looking and brutally difficult games.  However, in no way did this game deliver what I had thought it was going to be.  The author often touted how he doesn't believe in Steam sales and I thought that was respectable so I preordered to get a small discount.  Big mistake.  It's rare I regret game purchases, but this is some major buyer's remorse here.  This game is about as bare-bones as it can get.  It's esoteric, which I can enjoy (in, say, Dark Souls), but to a fault.  You have to spend time designing a trap for your home and you have to be able to pass your own trap in order to ""set it"".  This is sensible, since we obviously don't want people to make impossible traps.  But that doesn't really prevent the creation of ""impossible"" traps.  It's very easy to create a set of traps that are 100% guess work and one step in the wrong direction and it's impossible to escape.  At the end of the day, this just isn't a fun or good game.  It looks, feels and plays like a high-school project.  I absolutely do not recommend this game to anybody.			"

												The Castle Doctrine is simply one of the best MMO's out there. You get to create your own house however you want it, in an attempt to kill anyone trying to get to your vault or your family. While house design is difficult at first, as you keep playing, you become more and more adept at designing tricky deathtraps for robbers. And it really is fun to see a robber directly into your trap.Robbing is also an integral part of the game, however. Those robberies of top-valued houses can be incredibly tense, and the feeling when you somehow manage to pull it off and snag $50,000 and a painting is incredible. However, you have to keep in mind that permadeath will make you lose your enire house from a single misstep. So be careful!The only thing I don't really like about this game is the time commitment it requires. This is the type of game where you need hours on end to build up to a succesful house, which can sometimes be frustrating when you have the money to build a nice house after you successfully rob somebody, but you don't have the time. However, that shouldn't discourage you from buying the game. It's absolutely one of the best out there, and well worth its price.			"

But please make this game free already so the community can grow and thrive, then (if you absolutely have to), when it's at its peak you can pull the plug and demand your (at this point) ridiculous $17.99 (for a 100% dead game).  Everybody reads reviews and nobody will buy this in its current state.  If money is what you're truly after then make it free temporarily and then you'll eventually get your way because everybody will want to buy / play it when there's thousands of houses to burgle.			"

You would enjoy building your house and make a maze of deadly traps to watch via tapes later to see how people died only to enrich you further. But what you see now is a handful of people playing with a high priced game. The time I spent on it originally was well worth what I purchased it for but when the community is dead on a solely multiplayer game there's no way to recommend this game. What the dev needs to do is extremely slash the price for awhile to inject more players into this game. Until then you'll see the same type or reviews, fun but no one to play with.			"

												Basically, if you enjoy banging your head against a wall, this might be the game for you.I had ""fun"" while the pre-launch real money contest was on. Probably won't play it ever again now unless there's another contest like it. I say ""fun"" because certain parts of the game are fun, but I don't think there's incentive to make me actually WANT to play the game without real money dangling there as an incentive.Don't get me wrong, it's an incredibly addictive game, just for all the wrong reasons. For example, my labyrinth of a house took a number of hours to make during the last day of the contest, which I HAD to do all in one sitting as leaving it alone half finished would have certainly lost me all of my resources while I was away. This wasn't the first house I'd fully decked out either, so if it weren't for the real money incentive, I wouldn't have even have got this far.Then come Steam launch night, a new burst of enjoyment came from watching new players dying in my house and from some easy robberies on their new houses. However, that same night, albeit after I'd gone to bed and left my house alone for a few hours, one of the worst (but most well funded) robbers I've ever seen tore through every single cerebral trap in my home, along with most of the walls, doors, dogs and children just because he had 100 of every tool on hand.After dying trying to salvage and repair the intricate maze that took so long to make with my funds now at zero... what's the motivation to start again? I mean, what's the point in making a masterpiece of a puzzle when someone is just going to set it on fire as soon as you go to sleep? Do yourself a favour and don't even try to make one in the first place.			"

												Tiles can't rotate!Game lacks any explanation of how any tiles interact.Fan based wiki pages I found were a chore to navigate through.Is this game early access?Seemingly significant learning curve with no ingame support for picking it up.A frustrating 12$ purchase, would've felt not cheated for 5$.Recommend passing this up for Starbound, Minecraft, Terraria, Dwarf Fortress (Free), etc if you have caught the building bug.Idea is neat though. Try harder.			"

												Do NOT buy this game! At this point, anyone that buys this game is being robbed. The game revolves around being able to steal items and money from other people to build up your own defences. Sounds good right? It would be, but the few people that are still in the game are near impossible to rob with the crap items you are able to buy straight off. You are able to rob less than 20 people at the moment. These remaining people range from being so easy that there is no reward, or a complex structure that will kill you if you make a single mistake, there is NO in between.Back in this games golden days, this could've been an entertaining game. It had an interesting concept with only one problem, it RELIES on people playing the actual game! there are no NPC's that you can rob for a small ammount of cash, and there's nothing to get you off of the bottom of the food chain. You lose the game the second you click the buy button.			"

												I'm not sure how many of you will see this, but here it goes... I imagine you're asking yourself ""do I want this game?"" and having second thoughts after reading a handful of negative reviews about how ""dead"" the community is.This, DOESN'T MATTER. there are active players and they will be enough, trust me. In the brevity of time I spent on the game it consumed me. It was the only thing on my mind until I accidently killed myself and walked away.I was always checking if someone had attacked me, had they succeded, improving my defenses, repairing damage done. It is incredibly addicting, you have been warned.Within two weeks I had spent 77 hours on this game, it may have been just one week... I can't really remmeber. I would have Castle Doctrine open on the side while I played other games, checking every time I finished a game of League of Legends or Hearthstone. Had I been attacked? What happened?The message I'm trying to tell you is that while there might not be too many people running around, they are there, and you should be afraid. Just because you're not online doesn't mean you can't be attacked. As well as the fact that this game can be insanely addicting, (it was for me).... Oh god writing this review... I've been drawn back in.*Edit* The game is always hardcore, you die, you start over from scratch. The game isn't afraid to drop you on your head and let your brain spill out. You died verifying your own defenses? Start from scratch, died trying to rob someone? Start from scratch, somebody killed your family, stole all your possesions, and now you have no reason to live? Suicide and enjoy starting off with a new family. a new safe, an empty house, and 2k (scratch, square one, however you want to say it).			"

												I loved this game for about... an hour or so, because it was new and interesting, but playing it for 15 hours allowed me to see everything. If you gear up, enter a house and leave through the same door you walked in, you lose all of your tools. Amazingly unrealistic there. A powered door cost $240, while the crowbar to circumvent that powered door costs $2400. Pricing is terrible in this game. Drugged/unconscious pit bulls will kill you if you step over them again. The most common types of houses are:Players creating intricate mazes that only they know the path for. Causing you to run through and commit to paths from the very beginning, only to find out after you've committed to several paths, that you actually took the wrong one. So you die, lose your house, and any tools you had go bye-bye.Houses with multiple-multiple-multiple-multiple choice paths for you to choose. Also forcing you to commit with each turn, once again only to find out that you've gone down the wrong path. You die again, lose your house, and lose your tools.Combination locks. !@#$ing EVERYWHERE!!! We're going to force you to commit(again) by passing this powered door, pressing this button and the powered door closes behind you. Then have you guess a 6-12 digit combination, ALL of which are sticky pressure plates which are surrounded by concrete and steel walls... everywhere. You're not getting out. You might as well suicide.Entering a house(which has very little money as far as the list is concerned). The house seems cheap, being mostly wood and all. Force you to commit down a certain path only to find out a few steps later that there's steel and concrete everywhere. Well !@#$. This could be fixed by using smaller houses and the camera staying centered on your character.When you see the same garbage everywhere, and everyone pretty much does the same thing just because it's 'that' effective... it kind of sucks the fun out of the game for everyone except for those watching the 'security tapes' and laughing their asses off at anyone attempting to rob them and dying.Lack of the ability to save a layout in the game for a $1000-1500 layout that works until you get a little more money. The  inability to sell your current house objects once you've proved your house was 'fair'. The camera does not stay centered on your character and some people take advantage of this. I'm sure everyone who buys a game expects a certain amount of fun to frustration ratio. This game has been %10 fun to %90 frustration.The player-base is going to suffer hardcore with or without sales. Why? There are going to be players with a ton of money, and no one trying to rob them because you have no new players and you don't make the game fun enough to keep playing. Or simply because everyone is afraid to lose all of their high value stuff by dying. This will cause a stalemate in the game between any of the high value players. If someone whom has a ton of money tries to rob someone and dies or someone actually manages to rob them, they're going to stop playing because they don't care to take the incredible amount of time and effort to build up their castle like they did previously.But hey, what do I know. I'm just another guy with an opinion. I want my money back, and I want this game off of my Steam library just as much as Dogfighter.			"

												I don't know.  This game has a metric assload of potential, really.  But I find that I enjoy the intro video more than I enjoy the game itself.  You start out so far behind everyone else you can A) spend all your money and suicide bomber yourself at the homes of the wealthier players until you manage to heist some of their♥♥♥♥♥♥ or B) You can attempt to make your pittance go as far as it can and play the waiting game where you make money incrementally from your family over time.  Hoping someone will try to rob you for the handful of change you have and maybe die in the process, leaving you more money.  Balance is nonexistent in this game.  People established already prior to your purchase will almost always have homes that will defeat you.  They are the angry middle finger of an uncaring God damning you for your hubris.  I would honestly rather have my money back, and that's really a first for me with my games on steam.			"

												The Castle Doctrine has been out for a year, and it's dead. The developer's statement ""Sales screw your fans"" means simply that this game has not seen any new players and any old players have long since stopped playing. This game requires players to be worth anything. Right now it is a ghost town. When it first came out, I would have certainly suggested a buy, but that's when there were people playing.I ask, what is more important for your customers: making sure the game they purchased stays relevant and populated, or ""screwing"" your fans with a sale later in its lifecycle?Don't buy this game.

												I'm a fan of difficult, tense games that don't try to hold your hand. Sadly, this isn't so much a difficult game as a discouraging game. Don't get me wrong, I like the premise a lot, and I enjoy the idea of playing this game with friends, trying to guess whose house belongs to who, with all of that kind of fun social dynamic attached when you finally penetrate a house's defenses. Sadly, playing the game as presented on the public server is an exercise in pointlessness.To begin with, the game has extremely far beyond frustrating game flow that actively discourages experimentation to a degree I can't really explain very well using words. Despite really wanting to like the game, I was done after the second day of ownership. Experimentation of any type, with your own house's design or with exploring those of others, is 'rewarded' by completely losing the house's entire design if you make any mistakes whatsoever anywhere, either in its wiring or in negotiating the house's solution. Despite well-matching the game's design philosophy, the fundamental reality of this situation is that you will spend over 95% of your game time rebuilding nearly identical houses with the almost no money you're forced to start with.The ease of death is really overstated, it's very easy to avoid dying provided no one with an entire inventory full of guns and saws really wants your money. That said, after rebuilding the same house for the fourth time, I lost pretty much all desire to look at anyone else's houses. And, of course, if you make a mistake wiring your own house and end up in your own trap, well. It's time to start over. Unlike a 'roguelike', instead of being able to pick the game up immediately when you die and try again doing something fun like exploring an unknown cavern and collecting loot or what have you, you're forced to rebuild your entire house once again from literally nothing. If this review is starting to seem repetitive, that's because that's what the game is like.In conclusion, one gets the feeling that the game was primarily designed for people who are unemployed, don't have kids, and probably can't be bothered to cook for themselves, or generally do any of the other things that people value their time for. Like writing reviews.			"

												This game is really close to being great in my opinion, but as it currently stands, I can't really reccomend it. The game suffers from a couple major problems in my opinion. The first is that the risk reward ratio of robbing a house generally just isn't worth it. If you really commit to trying to make it through a house, you are far more likely to die than you are to make it through, the survival rates on most the listed houses back this up. The fact that you will fail to rob the house is not the problem however, the problem is how harshly you are punished for failing. You lose everything, your house, your money, Everything, and have to start the game over from scratch. Because of this, nobody ever wants to try to rob anyone else once they have a decent amount of money and a house established. 99% of the people who try to rob you have just started a new character and have not yet invested any time in building their own defenses (you can tell they are brand new because they are only worth $200 bounty if they die to one of your traps). The strategy tends to be to spawn a new character, spend the starting $2000 on robbery gear, and try to rob a house that has around $10k and build your house with the money. After that you don't rob houses anymore and you just sit back and watch people try to rob you. If the game were to make failure less punishing I think things could be a lot more interesting. I do think having permadeath in the game is probably a good idea because it leads to people building new traps and whatnot, but I don't think permadeath should be the punishment for your first failure. I think that with each death players should have to pay an increasing sum of money, starting low but working up to large amounts, and if they can't pay then they suffer permanent death of their current character. Perhaps the amount increment would drop over time as well so you never reached a point where the cost was so high a character would never try to rob a house again. I'm not sure my suggestion is the perfect solution, but I really do feel that the game would be considerably more fun if players other than brand new characters were trying to commit robberies as well.

												This game has an amazing concept that is close to working, with a few problems. Imagine this, a game where you design base defenses and attack other player's defenses, and if you die (either on your own or the other players... yes you need to navigate your own defenses) you start completely over.It's a really fun game, but the problem is how you get money, by having people attack your base or attacking other people. To be any degree of safe you need to buy items to go attack people, which costs money (that you don't have in the beginning). If your base gets raided you lose half your money and all your items (which consists of most of the money if you are killing people with your defenses). People will also attack you when you are logged off. The amount of items people will bring as well as their commitment to attacking is based on how much money you have, so you need a powerful enough defense to defend against the level of player willing to attack you. This takes constant monitoring because if you don't return to your house every so often, the money value will increase past the level of defenses and people will destroy your house and you will be worse than square one.So I would only recommend this game if you want to constantly monitor and be wary of your house, as this escalation will continue even when you try to 'log out'. It was fun for a while, but after I realize there was no way to 'turn off' the game to take a break from it, you can't play this game unless you're willing to commit.Here is an example of what the game plays like----------This is how I got a really super powerful house, and how I lost it:I got lucky and broke into several low level houses with a couple low level items, and got enough money to make a fairly powerful house. I sat this house at the ~3k value range (by spending all excess money on improvements) allowing people to continually die and upgrading every 30 minutes. You need to continually upgrade to keep the value lower and prevent people from breaking in with more items.Once the house was powerful enough I sat it at the ~30k value range - people were now breaking in with a LOT of items, but my house could stand up to them! Well, after several hours of letting people break in and upgrading I logged out - thinking this would make my house inaccessible - and went to sleep. Later that day I logged in and found my house has reached  over 300k value (woah), but someone broke in and stole everything, leaving me with half my cash money which was around 3k gold (most the value was in items), and also having to fix all the destruction to my house (which stays when someone is successful). After fixing the problems I had 300 gold left, which does not attract anyone to break in and die.Since I had no money to invest in items and noone was dying I tried raiding low level houses without items, but most of the ones I ran into were ones similar to mine, obviously a lot of money was sunk into them but they had very little cash reserves likely due to someone raiding them.I ended up dying by accidentally walking to my own pit in my own house after trying to make my house easier to break into to tempt lower level players... time to start over.-----Every time I start to get the ball rolling I hit a random snag here or there: someone finds a way to break traps I didn't think about, I accidentally fall for a trap I think I'm being safe about, I accidentally die in my own house due to having to run my entire defenses every time I make a change, etc.Each snag does make me a better player, but also makes me have to start over again... and without good luck (or maybe a friend who can go die in your house) getting that ball rolling is difficult.

EDIT: This review is obsolete. It describes what the game was like when the community was vivid and bustling (it was a very fun game back then). Nowadays almost no one plays this game and the few houses that remain are very much unbreakable.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In order to enjoy this game you need to accept it's rules:*There's not going to be any hand-holding, you're supposed to learn how to play the game by trial-and-failure. Some of the best experiences from this game come from experimenting by your own initiative and gradually learning better methods to build and destroy trap systems. Tutorials would only ruin all the fun of learning by dying or getting robbed.*This is not a puzzle game. Don't come in with any illusions that you are going to be able to simply figure out the solutions to other players houses by using your smarts. Efficient homes are designed in such a way that their solution cannot be seen and if you try to take a guess the odds will be staggeringly against you. In order to defeat a home what you really need is to make the best use of your available tools in order to disable the houseowner's traps.*There is a big gap between the experienced players and the newcomers, but it's a fair one. There is no 'leveling up' or gaining 'experience' for killing enemies here, the only thing that separates the veterans from the noobs is the very things that The Castle Doctrine is all about; tactics and deception. The players who are up in the top are there solely because they know how to manage their risks and have figured out techniques to build houses that are very hard to penetrate. You won't stand a chance against the home of a top player before you have learned how to scout and hold a sizable wealth of your own.*This game requires patience. You start with only $2000 and that will not be enough money to build a house that will make you reasonably safe from other players. In order to build a decent house you need use your starting 2k to buy tools and rob richer players, in this process of trying your luck against the rich you will die (a lot), but you need to keep trying because eventually you will succeed. Then, after your success, it's time to stop dying and start seeing other players die in the deathtrap that you have built for them.*This is a frustrating game and you need to be careful. Due to the permadeath mechanic you can lose everything that you have worked on due to one single wrong step. This rather harsh rule actually makes the game far more interesting and tense, it means that every time you defeat another player you get the knowledge that he has been completely ruined and additionally it means that you become afraid of your own house because every time you make a modification to it you are supposed to go into your own deathtrap and reach your safe in order to prove that what you have created is solvable, during these 'self-tests' you can die. You will feel in your own skin how this machine that you have created to kill other players can be extremely dangerous even to yourself.*Your family is supposed to be a burden. Just like in real life, eh? In this game you play the role of the father of a stereotypical white american nuclear family in the 90's, you have the duty and responsibility of protecting them. Other players will try to kill your wife and kids because they are a weakness and killing them can make your home more vulnerable.*The goal is just to stay alive. There are really no overarching goals in this game other than trying to survive and rising above other players in the charts. However, all homes eventually fall. Even if you make a house so good that it kills practically every burglar that enters it you still cannot avoid attracting the attention of the more skilled and well equipped thieves and once those guys set their sights on your home they will take you out... Unless you can take them out first, but for how long can you keep others from emerging?If you can accept those things and if you refuse to rage quit you're going to realize that The Castle Doctrine might quite be the best multiplayer out there. Also: Visit the official forums, we have a nice community and it's fun to share your gameplay experiences there.			"

												This is a great game, but you really gotta go into it with the right mindset. Your going to get crushed many times. Your family will be killed. Your defenses will be destroyed. Your going to walk into houses and see dogs that kill you minutes later. You should expect your character to last until you logoff at best. That being said it is quite fun building mazes and puzzles to thwart players. You need to think like a robber and try to trick people into walking into the traps on scouting runs. The most fun I have is seeing how far I can have somebody walk into my house before they see the dog that beats them to the entrance.  Robbing is quite fun as well, though I must admit the because I lack skill/ am a chicken I am more of a murderer then a cat burgler.			"

												If this game was about $1 I would say go for it maybe at that price the community would come back to life. But sadly this game is $16 and the Developers have long ago abandoned it along with it's entire community. The Idea of this game was really great and I enjoyed it greatly but it had a very big flaw in the game where it was extremely hard to get more money except for waiting for new players to join and not know how to play and steal their stater 2k. If you some how got lucky and had tons and tons of money you would end up making this crazy impenetrable fortress of timers and traps that no one could ever break into. The Poor would stay poor and the Rich would get richer. I greatly enjoyed the satisfaction of making a maze full of traps and watching people try my maze along with finally breaking through a house but it was very rare it was either rich people or broke people and the Developers did nothing about it and let the game die and kept the price for the very low developed game very High. This game is impossible to play with out other players and it's dead don't buy it unless it's $1 for that faint chance they try to save this game.			"

												Brilliant concept and really enjoyed playing the game. HOWEVER, the game needs a player base (its not a solo game) and active player numbers are very low. The developer has already moved onto other projects and while the price is still high then I cant recommend. The prices should be reduced to encourage a higher player base, or like me, you may feel you have been robbed both in and out of the game!!			"

												Not to sound like the proverbial hipster, but this game became garbage the moment it hit Steam.  Or maybe it was a few updates prior to that.I've been a long-term Jason Rohrer fan and enjoyed Castle Doctrine up until a certain point.  Like a lot of games - comparably Rust - you need to devote a lot of time to CD, but also be aware that all that time can be robbed from you by a more experienced/wealthier player.You build a house with the starting cash of $2000 using the various tools that are given to you all in the hopes of protecting your family (expendable) and your cash (expendable, but you really want to keep it safe).  It's almost like game design within a game.  You need to find a way to exploit any potential thief that enters your home on a meager budget, and then hope that when they die/give-up, you can upgrade your house with the items that they (hopefully) left behind.I used to compare the building experience as ""psychological"" or ""anticipatory"".  While building your home, you needed to think like the robber and predict their every move.  With travel happening on a four-way plane, there's not many choices.  Will they open this door or the other?  Will they break through this wooden wall or the metal one beside it?  Anticipating the players' actions can be beneficial to your own progresss in CD.The downfall of this game were the players on the wealthy spectrum.  They've built systems utilizing floor-pads that need to be pressed at the right time, in the right order or maybe not at all; and the wrong move means you die or the door (out of many doors) leading forward will be perma-locked.  There can be so much going on behind the walls of some of these houses that it's hard to just guess.  You can brute-force it, but the only people capable of that are the people you're robbing because they can afford to buy all the equipment necessary to break into ANY home.  Even your measly $2000 fortress.  THAT'S why this game is broken.A VERY strong ""do NOT buy"".			"

												Very interesting 'game' here. You create a puzzle for other people to solve when they are breaking into your house. Depending on what tools they bring with them and how good they are, your traps either kill them, or they steal your money.Probably too hard for most people, but if you have experience with Electrical Engineering/Computer Science you may find this amazingly addictive. Think of it as an MMO version of the old ""Spy vs Spy"" game from the 80s.			"

												I'm going to be clear on this. I love this game, but the dev doesn't, he has taken a very ludacris marketing strategy that has ruined the point of this game. The dev has decided to never market his hidden jewel MMO again, so now we're stuck with the 17 players that still remeber the name of this game, and I can tell you the exact situation of every home.*9 players are struggling to survive, with under 500 dollars.*2 players are in a mediocre situation.*1 player is in a upper-middle class situationand there are the 4 players that are litteral kings/queens with over 15k and combo-locks and movement puzzle galore.Remember the days when we punished players for going after our wives?Yeah, me neither.

												What a waste of money, would have payed 2$ but not more. The worst thing is not the lack of graphics or content though. The game is very tough for beginners, basically you cannot build any useful defense with the start money. The gap between the noobs and the ""pros"" is huge, so it ends up being pure luck either you find someone with no house at all (also boring to rob) or someone with 100 pitbulls, the latter being in the majority it seems. It's not even much skill based, you just have to be rich enough to put all those dozens of dogs to sleep or shortcircuit all these electric floors that the rich people spam in their houses (ok, I admit the skill lies in acquiring the money to fill your backpack with enough tools). The weirdest thing is that you are better off with your family dead, so you don't have to leave a completely open path for them to escape...			"

												I am a big fan of Jason Rohrers games. The Castle Doctrine is one of the darker ones. If you think about playing it bear in mind you will start over and over again, no matter what. If you don't like games without constant progress, something that sticks you probably will be very unhappy with it.This doesn't mean it is impossible to win a lot. The odds to succeed even in a single robbery are pretty low and one wrong step will make you start over from the beginning. This game is amazing for people who are fine, maybe even enjoy losing a lot. If you are not that kind of person, you should probably spend your money on his other games. :)			"

												In short: A multiplayer only game with no players. Don't buy.One of the most dissappointing games I've ever played. The premise isn't even that bad: set up traps in your house, foil the traps of others. However, the way the system was implimented leads to nothing but tedium and frustration. High level players had mountains of cash to build over-elaborate deathtraps, exploiting every quirk of the game mechanics to make houses that required knowledge of what objects were placed OUTSIDE the walls of the house to complete, as things like dogs would run around in the yard, totally unseeable, pressing switches and unleashing hell unless you knew exactly how to dance around to get them where you need them. And this does not even include the ""fun"" designs players could begin making when their family had been killed, allowing even more freedom in how they set up their dungeon.The effect was that new players quickly became frustrated and left, which dried up the pool of houses that you could actually be reasonably assured to complete, meaning that the game had literally no point unless your intent was to just feed the players sitting in their palacial death-mansions. This was not helped by the absurd price of the game, and the devs bizzarely principled stand on only having one sale ever. They clearly value their game to a very high degree, but that pride seems to have ultimately hurt the game.The game now has an average player count per day of around 0.5, and the peak players in the last 30 days was 2. This is a multiplayer only game that has half of a human being playing daily and never more than a couple at one time. It no longer functions as a game.			"

												The Castle Doctrine is a highly original video game filled with challenges for even the best chess players. The gameplay is split between two tasks: building defenses to protect your vault and your family, and raiding your neighbors' houses for money and tools. The layers of planning that a good home defense require are extensive, and numerous strategies exist for both creating and overcoming creative traps.The economy of the game is intelligently designed- players begin with enough money to build basic traps and buy tools for raiding. The tools, in essence, are used for destroying traps- and the more expensive the tool, the better the traps it can break. Balancing your funds between upgrading your own security and breaking into others' houses is a challenge.The tricky part comes when you have to test your defenses. Any defense you build must let someone (hypothetically) reach your vault without any tools. (It should be noted that it does not have to be possible to reach the family unarmed, so as long as there are no traps in their path, one could line the hallway to one's family with pit bulls.) Unfortunately, it is possible for someone's house to become impregnable when it is raided- mobile creatures (such as pit bulls) could end up in positions that guarantee that no one else gets through to the vault. In addition, a vault that has been raided becomes empty, and reaching it no longer grants the raider an escape. This is part of the risk inherent in robbery though: it's always possible that someone else has screwed things up for you to get their own share of the loot.There is one major flaw in the game, however. When testing your own security to prove it can be breached, accidentally triggering a deadly trap kills you, forcing you to start over. You can test these traps with various devices that indicate electric current without harming you, but it can be a pain when you have to start fresh because of a small mistake in building your own house. This part of the game seems unnecessary, as it only punishes players who make dumb mistakes designing their defenses, and the punishment is death.All things considered, The Castle Doctrine is a great game if you want a fun, challenging robbery sim that lets you play both sides.

												Highly addicting base building game like youve never played before. The mechanics of wiring up traps is like nothing ive done before. The game needs some better tooltips to describe what does what, so in other words the learning curve is steep. but once you get it down you will be having a blast coming up with traps and refining them more and more until you have your perfect starting house that will earn you the big bucks. your house is always live, meaning even when you turn off the game, you house is still very much vulnerable. your family is vulnerable. when you leave the game your character is essentially leaving the house. you start to actually feel emotionally invested. how can i leave my family and money alone. i have to get back and make sure no one broke in. i have to keep strengthening my defenses. but inevitabely you will be robbed for everything, and have to commit suicide/restart. everyone does. even the top of the list millionairs die in a matter of days. its part of the game. the game cant be seen as permanent in any way. you have to embrace the constant restarts. and keep trying to best your last house's highest earnings. The Castle Doctrine is best played in the mindset of high scores. Many people dont realize this and get very frustrated with the game when they keep having to restart. Overall id say this game is a MUST try at only $15. youll never play another game quite like it			"

												Even though this is a kind of totally different experience from most any other game on Steam, it is not particularly special except that it is within Steam's library of games, which makes it a semi active community. That is, you build a decently devious house with some dead ends and electricity for cheap death traps, with the safe behind some random door. After a day, perhaps 3-4 people will have died in your house, giving you a bounty of about 100$ or more each, which you can then spend to further extend the size of your trap er I mean house.If you want to have fun, you have another approach to take, which actually benefits the new players. You can choose to spend your money on *gear* and go try to break/pillage houses. The reason this game is relatively dull is because, apart from its most elegant graphics and tutorial (not), it actually punishes you pretty severely when you die; you have to start completely over.The point is, that there is no clear victory or progress. When you do rob someone, then immediately you have to secure your safe into a more safe position, upgrading your fortifications and making the way to your money more confusing and deadly. If you are idle for 5 minutes, you automatically leave the house, making it vulnerable to attack. Sometimes, you can find an easy 2,000$ by finding someone who has not built anything but instead left their house for any reason.I could recommend it, simply based on how it is kind of logical, kind of puzzle-y, and so forth, but the absolute truth is that it just isn't your typical entertainment, and it somehow makes you wish that the general idea was carried into a more complete game, with upgradable room to build your house, a second or third story, the option to have a turn-based or real-time kind of interaction that lets you decide between buttons or reflexes, and a bunch of other really quite interesting things that simply are not done. On the point of inspiring creativity, it does actually create a space for puzzle-craft. Where it fails is simply that it could be more visually appealing, it could offer a greater variety of tools for defense and offensive style of play, it could allow for coordination and teamwork rather than a strange list that magically ""knows"" exactly how much money is there, and therefore takes all the mystery out of things. Despite all of that though, with any of the things I mention, the game itself becomes something other than what it is. It feels like you should be able to put money in a hundred places rather than in the big obvious safe.			"

												I'm sorry to say that this is a game I can't recommend. When I first saw this game in alpha, I thought, 'This looks rather enjoyable.'I'm sad to say this is not the case.First off: This game is not n00b-friendly. The amount of starting money you recieve is shockingly low, and is barely enough to make a half-decent defence system, and you need to learn the game inside-out to understand how to do that.Second, please, please PLEASE don't price your game like this. If your game is sure to get massively popular, and has a decent amount of content, then I'm perfectly happy to pay extra after it comes out of it's early stages. This game is neither famous, nor does it have nearly enough content to make me satisfied with the price of $15.Gameplay gets boring, frustrating, bla bla bla bla bla... I could go on all day. This game cannot and will not go far. I'm guessing it's going to die out because of lack of interest.			"

												Create death mazes and compete in them to steal and keep cash, upgrade your death maze, and hope your family can survive.While it's an interesting premise, the implementation is a bit annoying - if you don't continually play the game, someone will crack your maze and loot your gains. Tools you spend money on are lost with each play, rather than being consumed as they are used only.It was a good diversion for a while but hasn't stayed at the top of my picks to actually play in the long run.While making a good maze will protect your stolen gains, it is just as easy to make a really lousy maze that is tedious to play - in that case, most players that make an attempt will merely leave.Testing your own maze can kill you, also ending your game. A bit punishing if you are making a very intricate maze, which you need to keep afloat.While it is fun for a while, expect that eventually you will have seen most puzzles people can cook up and it will get old.Can play casually over time, most runs are pretty short.

												The core mechanic of this game is essentially building and attempting puzzles; and that core is fantastic. I really enjoy planning and laying out my house, and (to a lesser extent) I like trying other peoples houses. Unfortunately this enjoyable part of the gameplay is surrounded by some really frustrating and boggling mechanics. The permadeath means that once I've finished setting up my initial house I can't risk going out to rob others' houses as I'll probably quickly die thus wasting the time spent on my own house. So I build my house and leave it to be robbed by others and see how well I did. Unfortunately people will quickly turn up with a backpack full of tools and smash a path straight through my house. Once my house is inevetibly robbed I'll have no money left and will be unable to perform even basic repairs to my house, let alone improve my design. So I must go out and rob other houses or commit suicide (effectively equivalent options).I really think this game would be much better if it removed the permadeath and a lot of the money mechanics, and instead focused more on the puzzle aspect perhaps including leaderboards and tallies for houses/thieves.

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/the-castle-doctrine-first-impressions/The Castle Doctrine is a game about burglary and home defense. It’s technically an MMO, although don’t expect to see another player whilst playing.You’re tasked with robbing other players homes while setting up defenses at your own home to prevent these other players from stealing. The concept sounds nice, but it simply doesn’t work. You’re given a very small amount of cash to start off with, certainly not enough to purchase tools to rob others and protect your own property. Instead, beginners are forced to steal from other beginners in the same situation, with little to no defenses in place at their own homes.In order to steal from other homes, you’ll need some tools to get through the various defenses they have in place. You have little money as a beginner, so don’t expect to be robbing the worthwhile homes. Now, maybe if there was more cash available, you’d actually be able to stand a chance against other players and actually be able to progress in the game. The game is fun, yes, but it’s simply too unfair for me to continue playing it.It’s very difficult to get into the game, but if you’re lucky, you might actually be able to score some money off of other new players and be able to set up some reasonable defenses.

												After hours of playing, I realized the biggest flaws of the game. First of all, it's extremely unbalanced and the starting money the game gives you is absolutely not enough. The game itself begins on a cool concept, but a tremendous amount of mistakes makes it barely playable. And even for the few people who will manage to play it correctly, it won't even be fun for a long time... Last but not least, the game is 15€ ! I know it's still not really high if you compare it to some high-priced games today, but those high-priced games at least can give some fun for more time ! With that money, you could buy much, much better games.While the developers surely had tons of very interesting ideas, once those ideas went into the actual game, it all became a huge mess and surely isn't at all what the developers did intend to do. When I feel like a game disappointed me so much that I wish I never bought it, that's a pretty bad sign, because that's very rare. And I felt that with The Castle Doctrine. I just feel like I wasted money, that's how frustrated it makes me after hours of playing !Also, usually, a lot of games have a single player mode. While this game directly states it's going to be multiplayer only, when a game doesn't have a single player mode, then the multiplayer one really has to be ace. Seeing how this one is flawed and frustrating (and not for good reasons), it doesn't justify spending ""so much"" (for a minimalistic game, I mean) money into it.When I say it's not frustrating for the good reasons, let me explain. In a game like Dark Souls for instance, when you die, it's frustrating. While you lose your souls (the money and experience of the game, which is very important), you do not lose your whole character, meaning that there is an overall progression that can be hindered by those deaths if you are not careful enough, but at least, in addition of being frustrating, it's rewarding. In the Castle Doctrine, I never felt rewarded at any point, even after robbing a high-valued house successfully. Because I could barely make myself a decent defense (and seeing how many griefers there are in the game, it barely counts unless you are REALLY rich)How to sum-up if you didn't felt like reading all of this ? Frustrating and not rewarding, boring, expensive for such a minimalistic game, and the game doesn't match up to the concept. Definitely, I couldn't recommend it to anyone. Watching videos of it and looking at the concept is just filling your head with illusions, seriously.			"

												This is the worst $12 I have spent on a game. Most of the time you spend building traps for your own house. There is no 'how to' for constructing and wiring up your house, and the perma-death is a pain because if you die in someone elses house you have to start your own house from scratch again. If you want to buy a perma-death survival game...buy Rust.			"

												This game is hard but the pay off is amazing. the feeling of watching annother human fall into your trap and force them to suicide. and the feeling of utter loss when you make a stupid mistake and get your self killed by a miss step. the stakes are high.			"

												The game's concept is very interesting, and is what drew me in at first. I bought this game expecting to build a fortress to defend my wife, and my money. Little did I realize that 95% of your time is spent building your fortress. Don't get me wrong, this is the most fun part of the game, building your house. But in the time that I've played, about an hour or so, I find myself not building new designs, but repeating the same design. Why? Because if you die to your own design, you have to start all over. Now, permadeath is great and all, but it's really frustrating to ""test"" your own home and be killed by some flaw you overlooked, and have to restart. From scratch. The game is tedious, frustrating and incredibley boring. I've spent no time even invading another house, because I was testing mine.The worst thing about this game so far though, is that when you complete a test of your house, it immediately makes it available for people to rob. This means that if you were testing with lights and chihuahas, then you're basically screwed. So you lose a couple hundred bucks, right? No big deal. Wrong. Then you don't have enough money to put grates in your house. And since you will just repeatedly get robbed, have no other choice but to commit suicide.Again, I stress, the concept is very interesting and would be a fantastic idea for a video game... Sadly, this game just doesn't hit the mark. I only reccomend this game if you have nothing better to spend $12 on.			"

												I have played this game for 21 hours so far... I give it a 5/10. Please read on to find out why!In the beginning...At first, the game starts out very cool. You're new to everything. There are a lot of tiles to play with. The best way to learn how to make something, is to venture into someone else's house and die. ""Clever..."" you think to yourself, ""I'll use that trap!""After awhile, you learn how things work, so you set off to create your own house. With $2000 starting cash, you don't have a lot to work with. You don't want to spend too much making your house, because the left over money will be what people see, and they won't bother to take the time to try and beat your security for a measly $250-$500.Really, you only have $600-$800 to spend to make sure you attract burglars. Not much in fact. A guard dog costs you around $300. Electrical stuff is cheaper though.To attack, or not to attack...If you decide to venture out and attack others, you can buy tools to help you. The tools let you bypass specific types of security measures. Run into a dog? Use one of your sleep-laden-dog treats. Be careful though, you only have as many as you purchased. And other things like that. Every trap component has a counter of some sort. If you attack someone's house, and decide that their design is just something you won't beat, and you will die trying, you can leave through the front door. However, if you do so, you forfeit all items you purchased to help you break in successfully. If you happen to make it all the way to their safe, you get money, but that is money minus what you spent on tools to make it there. Generally, one way or another, attacking another player, who understands how the game works (which everyone does sooner or later) will end up costing you money because it is hard to break into a decent house without tools.If you happen to become successful a few times, and have built yourself a little stash of money, or you're fortunate enough to have some people attack you and die trying, you will then have enough money to start building some really cool traps. The side-effect of building your own nice house though, you stop attacking others. You won't be looking to die turning some corner 10 seconds into a robbery and then have to start over completely.When you're poor at the start, spend $1000 for tools, and attack a house with $3000. You will come away with more than you started, though it may take you 20 tries to do so. A  bit tedious. When you're rich, or you've built your house, never attack anyone again.ConclusionThis game really has a lot of cool concepts.Pros1. Permadeath is really neat because it gives you a good risk-reward factor. 2. The traps and tiles you can place add a lot of variety and allow you to create some really cool things. 3. All houses are user-created4. You get to solve puzzles, one section at a time (through fog-of-war, you only see what your character can see)5. The more successful you are, the more you can build.Cons1. Expect to lose, lose, lose, and lose. There really is no way to win. You will die eventually, no way around it, unless you get so much money that you can build an entire fortress within your walls. But then at that point, there is no reason to even play the game any more. You don't want to risk venturing out and losing everything. Your money keeps growing because people want to get a piece of it.2. You cannot build, what you want, how you want, until you have enough money to do so.3. The risk of getting money at the start is very high.4. All houses are user-created. This is generally a good thing. Player made content is fun. However, because of the high risk-reward of the core design of the game, you will see the same cheap and easily duplicated puzzles that without spending lots of money on tools to destroy the house itself, you can never beat.5. There are some bad UI design flaws that hurt you. Want to review how someone attacked your house? You can do so, but while you are reviewing, others may attack you. If you have a lot of money in your house, it may be impossible for you to get in it to fix what others have broken, or even change the design. You cannot even look at your house while it is being broken into. I constantly have the problem of attack after attack without being able to get in my house and fix things.6. No way to save/load your design. You can use an online builder to create and save a design, but you will be reconstructing it in the game piece-by-piece, no zooming in or out to get the big picture.Final ThoughtsBut this game executes these great concepts poorly. It may be that that all of these concepts are actually executed well by this game, but all of these concepts put together just do not work well. The game gives you a great feeling at the start, it's a lot of fun to explore it all. But once you see how it all works, it's like discovering who the Wizard of Oz really is. You'll be handicapped at the start to try and make money so that you can design a cool intricate puzzle that in all reality, only you could ever solve on the first try.So what is the point? Where is all the fun? It's not here. Once more people get tired of the game, and I honestly think they will, the game will fade. It's been stated by the creator it will never, ever, again be on sale. At a cheaper price than it is, say 75% off, lots of players could be introduced to it that would get a kick out of it for awhile, and give the die-hard-masochist fan base some fresh meat to play with, but without it.....dead game			"

												The game can actually be very addictive in a very bad way for some people.I played this game for over 140 hours, but all you do in this game if you don't want to risk robbing other people house and die and lose EVERYTHING as i did is make your house and wait for people to rob it and die in it.Then with the bounty you make your house even more deadly and awesome and so on until the inevitable happened you will ALWAYS end up killing yourself on your own traps and lose everything or some random guy with a millions worth of tools will come in your house and no matter how badass and amazing your house traps are he will DESTROY everything all your walls, traps and even kill your family if you still have it at this point so in the end you lose your house no matter what and you have to start all over again.The graphic are bad, but it's okay since it's a small game, but there is no real music or sound effects which is bad...Some people might be offended by the violent nature of this game like wifes and kids murdering, but seriously... There are way worse game out there with horrible gore scenes, personally I didn't mind the violence or the fact than your only way to make money is to kill or steal so in a way there is no good guys everyone is evil in this game... So what?If you actually enjoy merciless rogue like game this game is for you!But really unless the game get better with a lot of new improvement and have some mercy like you cannot die testing your own traps and so on I will never play it again even if i was actually very active on the forum and in game...This is sad since this game does have a lot of potential.So I do not recommend this game because...1: The gameplay is lacking not enough stuff to actually do.2: The game have no mercy. (Losing everything is inevitable.)3: The game is unfair. (People can bring 200k worth of tools to simply destroy a 50k worth house for fun...)4: No in game music or sound effects.5: To many trolls.

												The Castle Doctrine is for lack of a better way of explaining it, a massively mutiplayer puzzle game. Your goal is to concoct a house that will kill anyone foolish enough to enter attempting to get to your vault. If you desire, you have the option being the fiendish buglar perhaps stealing all the wealth your neighbors have worked hard to conseal.You will either love it this game or hate it. Everything you do is a risk and you could loose everything with one misclick of your keyboard, you'll find this exhilarating or utterly frustrating. Personally I love this game for one reason, it forces you to improve, unforgivingly so. Although I enjoy this game I couldn't recommend this for the same reason I like it, it has a very steep learning curve if you die at any point in this game you will loose everything you've worked for starting fresh giving you either more resolve or a deeper hatred of yourself for spending 15.99. Bottom line unless you have an iron will, save your money.			"

												A game about the futility of security measures, and the brutal permadeath is worth a couple of plays. It ends up being about how much you can steal before your security is eventually broken, and the limitations placed on the player ensures your security is beatable. The fact that you are automatically a man defending your wife and children and money is very telling of the limited philosophy behind the game.

												This game is a very interesting experiment which I believe will spawn more games like it in the future. There is no need to describe it because the description on the Steam page is spot on.The developer has made a truly difficult game which in no way holds your hand. You have to rebuild your design each time you die, so right off the bat it encourages you to be extremely careful when you enter other houses.My only problem with the game is it allows building of very complex mechanisms through its wiring system, which might not be a bad thing, but I just can't get over the fact that it is actually impossible to walk through most houses using your wits to defeat the traps alone. You need to use tools to brute force the certain traps which are just (lucky guess to get through) traps.I suggest this game because it is something very different than anything I have played before, and a think most will agree. It is a ruthless game which is in no way simple, and you will die, and you will lose stuff you worked hard for, but the challenge will keep you going, and you will get smarter and better as you play.

												After abit of poking from friends (a big thank you too Yorkie & Griff) i decided to get past the basic graphics and give this a go.I must say I had been intrigued by the concept from the start and if your totaly honest with yourself it appeals too our dark side of griefing other players.there is no team work co-operation bargining trading guilds leagues ..... its just you, oh and the loving wife and kids. Who strangely dont seem to matter as much as your money when your robbed. I've watched many a UTube vid where father arrives home and the missus and kids have been brutely executed in all the glorious 8bit detail and he casualy walks past their corpses lamanting about the money he has just lost and thinking of how he can upgrade his security. Life goes on I guess.The game is deceptively simple to learn but hard to master. I had a good understanding of what needed to be done within half an hour but then I found myself working on my house for the next 3 hours trying to get the right balance of false sense of security for anyone wishing to come into my welcoming home and death around every corner for said person once hes taken 10 steps. Then theres the carrot, sure you could spend your $2000.00 starting cash on everything barring the kitchen sink (please note there are actualy no kitchen sinks in the game at this time) but whos going to try and rob you if their risking death for 3 bucks. That $2000.00 start up money isn't looking as generous as it did 10 seconds ago is it.Happy with my death house from hell with a nice little carrot of $638.00 I headed out to partake in the second part of the game robbing everyone else blind. So after taking 11 steps into my first house ready to rob the rich and give to the poor, namely me, I found my self well and truly screwed. All I can say Mr Francis Dukis' wont have to feed that pitbull for a week due to the abundance of my carcess it threw around the place. I had just discoverd the joys of my first permadeath! House gone , Wife and Kids gone (probably went off and married pitbull Dukis') my money gone and 3 HOURS of REAL LIFE GONE!!!. So back i went to my new life and started all over vowing to never die again ... yea right.Overall this game is very promising the concept is fantastic and dark. I would like to think they will expand the crimes you can commit with the end result a dystopian society like in the movie ""The Purge"". If you do not know what this movie is google is your friend.No doubt there are a lot of traps and equipment to be added to the game but from what i've read the developers are extremily commited to the game wanting the finished product to give the best possible gaming experience to us, the guys who pay the bills.If I had one grip it would be that there needs to be something implemented sooner than later so you actually care what happens to your family instead of them just being cannon fodder.I feel the game is a solid 7 out of 10 at this stage of development.So get past the 8bit graphics (I did) and buy this game you wont regret it, it is only going to improve from here.Now if you'll excuse me I must go and have a meet and greet with my new family ....... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ permadeath.

												The concept and design of this game often cross into brilliant territory. I haven't had a game make me feel so clever in a while. I spent the first few hours of the game meticulously setting up my maze of traps that involved making some cats flip some switches that activate some electric floor panels behind any potential intruder. I found myself engrossed with the idea of trying to create something to outsmart another player. It worked... and worked again... yes I thought, this is marvelous.Then someone cut down a wooden wall that led to my family, shot down my wife and brutally clubbed my children to death. Oh my. I wrote down his name with some idea of revenge planted in my head. Then I thought about it and realized this game was leading me down a dark path. I started working on my house again...This isn't to say that I don't think the game has some issues with balance and some other areas. I find that you want to often save a fair amount of money on a new life to make yourself a nice juicy target for some burglar. This is odd I thought to myself... I want people to break into my house. Without them I'll have no income... unless I go out and rob other people. I tried to rob other people but I soon found that other people's deathtraps rely heavily on presenting you with so many paths you're bound to fail at some point or another. Without tools you'll have no way to escape from a deadly situation, but I spent most of my money on my house... and tools are expensive. Essentially I found that the game presents you with a paradox of sorts. While it wants you to realize that being a robber or killing people in your house isn't a good thing, it doesn't really give you any other option. There is no honest living in this game, you either steal lives in self-defense or you go out and rob other people's houses. Still though, through all of this I still would recommend this game. The thrill of trying to outwit other players is too satisfying of an experience. I'm not sure I've ever really played anything quite like it. It's tense and everything feels weighty. It's really something how this game creates such a cynical atmosphere.			"

												You start out innocently enough, You fortify your house with a complicated series of walled corridors and electrified death-traps to such a degree as to make the Korean DMZ seem lacking. Content that your family and vault are safe you set out to scout the neighbourhood and perhaps find a lucrative vault to crack into so you can expand your own defences even further. You die, twenty seven steps into the house to the jaws of a previously unseen pitbull.In the span of minutes you lose an hour of hard-work in a game where every action you take is deliberate, and no consequence is random. You respawn, you rebuild, you go to sleep. Thirteen hours later you come back to find your house compromised, your wife murdered, and your vault broken. You carefully examine the security camera footage of the heist and analyze the weaknesses in your own defence.You kill yourself, you respawn, you rebuild, you optimise. You begin to learn and understand the intricacies of the components within your traps and the human element attempting to circumvent them.You kill others.You begin to apply what you've learned to the traps of others, you learn how to identify them, and how to break them. You die. You Learn.  "

It is one of the only games on my Steam library that I wish I wouldn't have bought.I was brought in by the alpha version in Let's Play videos, but once I got the game: it was nothing like it was in the alpha stage. Only way to succeed in this game is through exploitation. It is currently unbalanced and broken.Again, concept is great, but this version needs A LOT of work for it to be worth buying.			"

												I had over $14000.  I was trying out some new electrical shenanigans and replaced all electrical grids with indicator lights........... at least I thought.  It was 1 AM, I wasn't paying attention and fried myself.  It wasn't even supposed to be the real test run. That's when I realized that I love this game.I love this game.  It absolutely fascinated me.  I'm having fun just buying $2000 worth of tools and making a suicide run through a $50000 house.  I love picking up tricks of the trade from houses that get me.  It's worth the price of permadeath to learn a new trap.This game is awesome.  My first time getting robbed, a man got my safe.  My next robbery, he came back and killed my wife with a gun for about $900 (The gun he killed her with cost $1200).  Since then, I've gotten robbed 3 times out of about 150 attempts.  My wife has yet to get killed again :).This game is amazing. Well worth the buy.It's not for everyone, but I think a lot of people will enjoy it.  Check out some youtube videos on it.  If you enjoy watching the videos, then definitely get the game!			"

												As much as I'd want to recommend this game, I can't. It's horribly skewed against new players, and the gameplay contains a broken mechanic. You have a family. You're supposed to keep them safe, and that provides an incentive to leave an open escape path. Most people leave their families right at the door and let them get killed. Then they don't have to worry about them, and they can make codelocks that are simply 1:1000 chances of getting the loot/dying which simply can't be beaten.			"

												This game is honestly one of the most challenging and rewarding I have ever played. The learning curve is pretty steep, but once you get some basic techniques sorted, the game becomes so addictive it's mad.You can spend days trying to map out a high value targets house. Slowly adding more and more information, and being completely stumped at how a trap works. Suddenly, you might realise it. You suss the trap.And although you know it's probably the first of many many traps before that fabled vault, the thrill of solving it is amazing.And you may want to take depressants before going all the way to the vault, because I swear down you might die of exhiliration once you get it, and all the work pays off.Also, you can watch people die by doggy nom nom. It's fun.			"

Sadly the game has died and it is imposable for any new players to get into the game due lack of players and when you start a new game, experienced players with lots of cash/tools will come in to your house and bugger you over quickly. I don't see the game coming back untill the developer adds in some sort of system to stop high/rich players from straight away accessing new houses who can't defend themselves.			"

												In The Castle Doctrine you must construct your 'house' to prevent intruders from possibly killing your family, but more importantly, your stash.Sounds pretty neat, huh? Well... There are loads of easily abusable mechanics, such as the ye olde hide an instakill dog behind every door except one, and there are about 30 doors to choose from. Or how about the 'actually cheat' tactic? - there are some houses that are literally unbeatable because the owner cheated in some way, pretty crafty!The game suffered from these flaws, the population never really took off, and the people that were even playing (84 in February 2014) quickly dwindled off and did something more worth their time.By May of that year, the game's population averaged 8 players, and by 2015, 2 people were playing per month, likely the top 2 houses that were just impossible to raid.Here is a steamcharts link to the game, I would bet $10 at any given time there is no more than 1 person playing. http://steamcharts.com/app/249570 "

												Absolutely innovative play-style. It's like an MMO ""Chips Challenge"" with a level builder, with perma-death and an intriguing moral dilemma. The learning curve isn't long for the basic mechanics, but... Actually competing with the players that are good? That takes a while. I can't yet design a castle that lasts overnight, and I can only make ~50% more than starting cash, which degrades the experience. I'm hopeful the developer will eventually tune this so that newer players get a further opportunity to really participate, but... It's currently somewhat irksum and agitating. I say ""I recommend this"" but... Mostly I recommend the innovation and the interesting mechanics, but... not the actual experience. I'm torn.			"

Posted: May 8, 2014
												I'd like to start by saying I heard about this game via YouTube and the series i watched was incredible enjoyable. I decided to give the game a shot since it looked at the very least decent. I picked it up while it was on sale and using some tips from the series I watched and reddit I made a simple house with a commitment trap and a electric floor lock out type trap as well as gave my wife a shot gun. I went out and got lucky with a few houses that had been broken into but not robbed... this is where I noticed one of the first major problems, if your wife is alive and you have a decent amount of money her death is enough for some people since they'll get half and any damage they have done to your house will remain (whereas if they die it gets fixed). Death of the wife seems to be higher up on some peoples lists if they can afford a gun, (guns have a range of 2 spaces whereas your wife's shot gun has a range of 1) and as such people will ""dance"" near the entrance or search for your family to get them to make their way to the door. I've also noticed that people will occasionally just enter someone's house to mess it up and kill a family member, probably in revenge for stealing their money. So, after I had some decent cash and upgraded my home significatly I let it sit for a while to see how many people I'd kill, and what I'd get with my house. for the most part I'd have people entering the house, taking 2~5 steps then backing out once they saw a commitment trap or a dog, or even just a door... the only time I'd see someone stay longer is if they had a full bag of tools that usually cost more than my savings, and even then most people wouldn't stay in very long and even would back out before they robbed my house. When someone finally successfully robbed my house they also killed my wife, leaving me with a broken home and absolutely no money. At this point it was virtually impossible for me to ""recover"" as most houses that I would go to rob had only a few dollars in them and were too risky, I ended up just starting over, which leads me to another major flaw... the prices of just about everything. All robbery tools cost hundreds of dollars, most effective house defense stratagies cost thousands in total, and the most effective are also incredibly cheap feeling as they are mostly combo locks after a commitment trap and the wrong combo permenantly locks you in the house while locking off the safe forever causing you to have to suicide. I feel if you were given some materials to build and rob with at the beginning of a ""fresh start"" and you kept your materials after surviving a hosue 2000 wouldn't be a bad starting point but as it stands it's barely enough to protect anything. Also normal doors can't be locked... which is just silly to me, the game lets you buy an electric locking thick metal door for a few hundred dollars, but we can't find a simple lock for a door. the purpose a lock on a normal door could hold would be to waste a ""movement turn"" breaking the lock(no tools, just slamming into it with your shoulder or something) and causing everything/everyone within a certain radius to notice someone's in the house. It could also act as a way to block off your family (they'd have keys) so that they don't need a very very obvious escape route, as mentioned int he video they need an escape route that's 100% obsticle free (aside from dogs).Originally there was a ""salary"" that your character and your wife(if your wife died it was just your salary) would earn while you where away from the game (more the more time you where not playing) to suppliment stealing and house defense, it also made more sense that you where out of the house when you where getting robbed that way. But they took it out I assume to controll the money flow of the game and as a balancing attempt... but I think it unbalanced the game more than it helped and it made it so that there is truely no recovery from having your wife killed and your house robbed (barring getting lucky as hell while robbing someone with more than $50 and a broken home...Some commonly used traps/deturants that can be considered ""cheap tactics"" include: ""leaps of faith"" where they have an open trap door that you're supposed to assume a cat/dog will activate and close as you step onto it ""Commitment traps"" such as an electric grill flooring or an electric door that locks/turns on as you pass it so there is no turning back and it's pretty much get the money or die trying scenario.""death traps"" there are many of these that are usually hidden behind commitment traps and literally force you to die, a simple one is to hide a cat around a corner behind some glass and cover the floor in grills so it looks like a simple commitment trap, but once they turn the corner they scare the cat and it hits a switch frying the person on the plates, another variant is the same thing but uses a small dog to run towards you.""Dog traps"" basically dogs behind doors that lead to no where, again when paired with a commitment trap this can be deadly...So many ways to trap people in this game, some are super easy to make, some are very expensive and most are not effective by them selves and require at least a few to protect your money.Overall this game has a great concept and a decent execution, but it has some major flaws and some major balancing issues.As it stands I would not reccomend this game. I think it needs to be improved in many ways before I'd say give it a shot, especially for the $16 asked for it, if it was maybe $5  I'd say give it a shot and if you don't like it... hell at least it'd only be $5 spent.

												In a nutshell, a brilliant idea, but execution so awful it's obvious it's the developer's first attempt at making any manner of a game, with possibly little to no experience in the field of game development even in general.For instance, it's entirely possible you spend a good 30-40 minutes wiring up a house to your liking for the very first time, and then you decide to test it out, because the game requires you to.So, you of course test your traps, let's say the electrified floortrap to see what it does, whether it's some sort of humorous zapping animation or something else. What this actually does, is instantly kills you for good, and permanently deletes any of your previous effort on the house.The game has no way of informing you about any of this, and the only way to find out is experimentation. There is no manual, there isn't even a wiki.There are other glaring issues, such as the obvious design of going with a multiple choice lottery where only one of a 5 dozen switches opens the vault, and all the other are lethal. You obviously know which one to press, the chances of an invading player knowing this are neglibly small. Protecting the family is a pointless matter by design, as there are no reasonable ways to protect them whatsoever. Why? They require an entirely trapless (and doorless) way out of your house. There are 3 familymembers. There are no turrets or any sort of traps like that, and the dogs are a joke to dispose of.Such a shame; the idea is worth developing for, but the execution is lacking on all grounds. Please do not waste your money or time with this.Also, i'll just leave 2 figures out here:Sale price: 14,99€Size on HD : 2,2mbThis should tell you how much effort has gone to this game at large, as opposed to how much is being asked for the game.I'd personally rate a similar game, ""The pay-to-win quest for mediocre loot"" above this, and it's obvious how i feel for that one.

												Everyone says the community on Castle Doctrine is dead, but there a still a good number of active people that arent structural engineers. People not buying the game because of the ""dead community"" is completely contridictory, the community would grow if people actually bought the game and played, and this would likely bring back some of the older players as well (which im sure some are thinking, thats okay, we dont want the engineers coming back designing houses so elaborate that not even the creators of the game even understand how to get through, but really there is no time advantage on castle doctrine. 1 mistake and your at square 1).Anywho, i highly recommend this game to anyone intrested in buying, the community currently isnt very large but new member could easily fix this problem. The learning curve is rather small, you'll build your house, you'll get eattin by your own pitbulls. The game has a built in note pad type of thing so you can write down the way through your maze, or the combination of switches to disable a door. If you stay sharp and play it safe, and remember how to get through your own house, then you will thrive. "

												There are a fair number of negative reviews of this game. If you're expecting a fast paced game this isn't for you. The game has an incredible amount of depth. If you're willing to put in the time and experiment with different layouts and devise new traps this game will pay you back ten-fold. Is it worth $16? Well, I'll admit $16 is a bit steep. This game would certainly be worth $10 or less for anyone. However, I'll stick by what I originally said and say if you want a fast paced game go elsewhere. If you're interested in devising clever ways to trick people and figuring out others traps then this is the game for you.It's a shame the developer is in a ""never discount"" mode. This would be fine but the game is a tad bit steep in the original pricing model. (FTL & Don't Starve are far more polished and have never cost more than $15)			"

												Hey I'm just writting this basically to offset the bad reviews and because I really think this game deseves more attention. People who've bought this game aren't sure what to think of it because this is really something new. The lack of a community right now is unfortunate but again this is something truly unique. I've played pretty much every art game which has come out in the last couple of years from obscure♥♥♥♥♥♥which isn't even worth mentioning to all the games you're sure to recognize 'gone home', 'depression quest', 'disforia', 'dear ester', and other. All of them are laughably bad. All of them have terrible diologue and stilted or sometimes nonexistant gameplay. The have no impact on the player because they're made by stupid college ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The Castle Doctrine dosen't subject you to two hours of walking and then read you a pamphlet about gender studied it allows you to proceed like you would in any other game and as you build incresingly elaborate traps and purchase incresingly brutal supplies the true intent of the game becomes clear. its a thing of beauty and it will disturb you. Sell your starseed pilgrim season pass and buy this game it's really something special.			"

												This game is so intense! I had bad impressions at first, but when I had people dieing in my house those impressions changed. It's horrible when you get alot of cash that just makes you a bigger target which is fine, but I would first like to upgrade my house from all the people that died while I was away, like setup a resting point because you'll be having people with alot of tools now entering your 2,000 dollar house now with 5,000 left over money from the bodies, thier tools will cost more then that house and sometimes even your vault amount which is dumb of the player or maybe he/she just doesn't like you.When you rob somebody make sure to be on your lucky day because you'll need it since sometimes not even tools will shorten your odds unless you bring like 100 or so each which is alot of money. I'll mostly be robbing the poor since I can't risk my life against people that know more about traps then I do.The wiki for this game doesn't make much sense on what things do (well for me), I just prefer videos most of the time. The price does seem crazy since this is a 22mb game, but it's addicting once you really get into it.Last thing I will like to mention is the great idea of the game how it's similar to The Epic Quest for Epic Loot on defending your castle against other players. Also (New topic) what the developer said about how sales hurt your fans, I know people would disagree but I happen to agree even if there will be issues about it since not that many people know about this game, but on how other games are like I just bought a game at full price then later it went on sale 75% off the next day or week or so, which was upseting since I'm cheap and impatient, I would like to be spending less, not having to wait and how that effects launches for some. However for console gamers don't need to worry about it since there aren't alot of huge deals on them. Lastly how the price should go up after a few months or years or so at that stoping price point after slowly raising the price showing players not to wait for a sale since it pretty much is.Overall I rate the game a 7 since there are still few problem that need to get looked over so I hope for future updates for a better experience and for other players as well. I recommend players who have time, patience, and luck to try out The Castle Doctrine!			"

												Worst game in history, don't spend your money on itEdit: The people who downvoted this comment are probably the makers of the game. Read the other comments, this game is basically dead and had been so for quite some time before they put the game on sale. Problem being, this game is gridlocked by players who have been playing for years, so when the game went on sale a while back, a bunch of people bought it at a discounted price and quickly realized they'd wasted that money and the developer of this game basically just pocketed whatever they didn't have to give to Steam and the IRS without ever trying to fix the problem. If you buy this game, that's who and what you're supporting. Just some information for those seeking it.			"

												;( I really, really know what i'm saying.This game just sucks, i watched videos and i though i would like it but no, i don't.For the first, the price. It's not worth paying 15 euro (or whatever currency you have there) for this. IF it would be 5 euros or so, then it would be better.For the second, there is just a few players soooo... yeah, this is an MMO so it should have thousands of players but it just have 50 or so i guess...For the third, it gets really boring really fast and that's why it's not worth so much.For the fourth... the graphics, i did not expect it to be super ultra new generation graphics or so but it does not even fill my whole screen!For the fifth, it's MMO so it can't be cracked. -.- So you don't have a third choice (only two, buy or don't buy) like ""go install crack and try it before buying it"".For the sixth (did i spell it wrong?), the developer does not take care about this game (yeah i know, wtf) so it does not get better in any way.Why? Why did i buy this s**t? ;;;;((((			"

												This is a very clever, unique and interesting game but I can not recommend buying it. In short description you build a very complex system of traps to defend your home and on the other end you attempt to break into other peoples home. Sounds great. Most houses are realistically impenetrable. The game of defending your home has been “beaten” and the best strategies are easy to copy on the web. Death in the game in permanent and you lose everything.    From some quick forum reading it seems like the developer is kinda done with the game for the time being.

												This game is fun becasue its very easy to protect a house and its fun to watch robbers fall for your traps. What I dislike is How the game does not have much PLAYERS. (Not saying it will be like this forever) But what I also dislike is how some off the game futures aren't really being used or aren't in the game due to less players or players hogging everything about the game. When more players are on it It cant be hogged because that = MORE Robbers = more houses = more fun. So this game is good. But this game needs to be worked on for awhile and once its done ALL THE Game futures will be up and running and it will be easier to play and bring in more players. There should be more players. But The other players complaining Are complaining about Either you loose everything or its not fair or not a fair price. What you do is you keep trying to build a better house before. Go look it up on youtube. You'll see them enjoying it. Plus at first I thought ehh Not many players. I wait one day and my house has been robbed but LUCKY my traps worked. With all the money I managed to make a better house. I went to see other houses and I copied there traps. Copying traps is easy. Its easy to copy. Basic traps wont work much so you need to really know how to play this game. Its really fun. TIP - Make sure your house is worth money or people wont try to rob it! But Really you should play the game. Even if its hard at first you start to get the hang of it. My house is tricky and hard to pass. Even if you come with alot of tools once you already gone far in you wont get out. Its fun to watch people die. It may seem there aren't alot of players but I got robbed at 1:30.AM and he died. It was funny And in a day You get a long list. BUT MAKE SURE YOUR HOUSE IS WORTH MONEY. But this game is fun. Dont listen to anyone who says a bad review. There are bad sides. Some people complain about the point of the game itself. Which is stupid. But PLAY IT. Its really fun!!!			"

												I love this game. One false move and you are dead. Not big surprise. Player base is pretty small. If you like tactical and logical games and can deal with permadeath, this is a pretty great game.Unfortunately, there are no players right now, so I can't really recommend it. It comes with a server set-up though, so if you want to set up your own server with friends that's available.That's the only reason I'm not recommending it, because I really dig the permadeath.The source code is also there too, so mess around with it if that's your thing.

												This is a cool social gaming expiriment but there's little to no game here. I applaud the devs for the creativity that went into this title, but it's not fun for me. You use trial and error (or google, I guess) to try to figure out how various tiles work. You then place them in your house to protect your safe and your family. You then leave your house and attempt to go rob other houses. Death is permanent. Essentially the way the game _seems_ to be played by successful players is manipulating trap logic and little exploits that the new player really has no way of learning without throwing themselves against traps and dying over and over or finding the solution online. There's no real advancement or sense of completion apart from the painting mechanic by which you can show off your leet house-burglaring skills. Just not my cup of tea.			"

												If you've made it this far you know that the concept for this game is really, really good. Unfortunately, the execution is mind blowingly bad. First and foremost of the problems is the fact that you have to completely rebuild your house after each death, and you cannot go to other houses without doing this. As a result the game will be building house setup, dying to another setup, rebuilding house, over and over again, each time manually. This gets old very quickly.Another issue the game has is its learning curve. It is a very brutal game to learn. This compounds the first problem.Balance in the game is not stellar. Since each profile can only have one house set up at a time, it becomes impossible to test out new traps without demolishing your current house. In addition, the one-house setup encourages folk to just camp out once they have a nice house built, and not go into other homes. They have nothing to gain and everything to lose.Now imagine none of those problems exist. The game is still bad because it is an mmo built around player interaction and almost no one plays it, ever.			"

												the game is a interesting one. It is fun as well as rage inducing at some times but every game has you rage at some point. The only real problem with the game right now is the lack of players. I hope this changes soon. The best part about the game is watching the misfortune of other people trying to rob you or when you rob some one who's traps have killed many and they have tons of money. There is perma death in this game, thats where the joy of watching some one die to your traps comes from but also the rage of dieing to some one else's traps.over all its a good game in my humble opinion.and to all the bad revews you telling people not to buy it becuse there are not anywhere near as many people playing as there once was are going to keep it like that with what your saing. the game is not bad just not many people are playing it and your revews are makeing it harder for more people to play this fun hard rogelike game besides there are enough players to rob its not like there is only 2 people playing			"

												Highly Recommended.  A game of ""Hide you kids, hide your wife!"" Craft puzzles and traps for burglars, while venturing out into the world to do some burglaring of your own.  The permadeath may frustrate some, but I feel it gives all your actions that much more tension.  Do you go down one more hallway, looking for that big score, risking everything you've already gained or do you decide to quit now, play it safe, and find an easier vault? "

												If I had to describe the game in one sentence, it woudl be a mix between Dungeon Keeper, Minecraft, and Chess.  Don't get me wrong though, this is me simplifying it. Everyone is a burglar. Everyone is trying to rob everyone else whilst trying to prevent it from happening to themselves. You start off with $2000 in which to boobytrap your house however you see fit using vicious dogs, pits, electrified floors, and more.  Once you're satisfied that your money - and family - are protected as well as they can be, you get to go and 'visit' other peoples', seeing if you can spot a weak link in their carefully constructed plans, cutting your way through with saws, or throwing drugged meat to dogs, but be careful. Everything is dangerous, should you step on electrified flooring, get shot, or fall down a pit, it's game over. Whilst you're out plundering to the bestof your ability, they get the chance to do the same to you. Should someone attempt to break into your house, you are able to watch their movements, to spot the weak points in your plan, improve upon it, and repeat.The catch? While you are given tools to break into other houses, when testing your own, you aren't allowed any - and any mistake in testing could cost you your life. It is fair to say that The Castle Doctrine is an unforgiving game, especially to new players, and (at time of writing) there are many improvements that need to be made, there is something adictive about it.Some might question why I likened the game to the three that I did:Minecraft - the wiring in this game is a lot like 'redstone', wiring up pressure plates to lower drawbridges, or to turn off some harmful device. Dungeon Keeper - you are building a trap that other people have to plunder. The only difference is that this is harder, as you have to make all the traps yourself.Chess - perhaps the most 'wrong' from the list, but I think it fits. The game is turn-based. For every move you make, the enemies in the house are allowed to do the same. The game currently fails in a number of areas; wiring can be a bit of a nuscience, along with having to ditch all of your equipment after breaking into someones house, even if you don't steal anything.

												You will die in this game. A lot.I bought this game several months ago when it was still in its very early stages. I have then spent a considerable amount of time with it and -boy- what a ride. Castle Doctrine is a very cruel game in which a single misstep may prove fatal. You can even die in your own house and when you do you lose everything and must start from scratch. Nevertheless, the game still sucks me in with its atmosphere, clever mechanics, and especially the sheer thrill in watching people die by your traps.  I can't recommend this enough. It is very unique and one of the best game purchases I have ever made. The Castle Doctrine is simply put (for me), a masterpiece. Now, back onto rolling the tapes....Edit:This game is definitely not for everyone. You will either love this to death or hate it. Simple as that.			"

												So I picked up a game called The Castle Doctrine (Named loosely after the same law). The concept is simple, use $2000 to design a trap-ridden puzzle house that protects your vault and your family while providing a completely unhindered exit. You play against people who enter with 2 problems, 1. Death if they hit a trap and 2. If they leave, they drop their backpack containing all of their stupid expensive burglary tools. You can do the same to others. The idea is to design a home that shows opportunity, for example, a small search area, while being defended enough to prevent someone from casing the place then coming back with appropriate equipment. It's a lot of fun. Not quite worth the $15 ( Got it on sale) yet because it is a kickstarter game it's incomplete. But it is functional and is too simple to have many bugs.

												I have played some of Jason Rohrer	's previous games, namely ""Passage"" and ""Gravitation."" I found it interesting that they were made as ""art,"" designed with metaphor/symbolism or whatever and intended to make you think. Beyond the ""art"" part though, those games didn't really have compelling gameplay, I felt like I was playing them to discover the message, not because they were fun. I got this game because it sounded fun, and it is. Whether it was the developer's intention or not, this game makes me think in the same ways his ""art games"" did, in addition to having fun and compelling gameplay. I am having trouble expressing the way this game makes me feel and think about the themes it brings up. Its complicated and I think that's the way it should be. But at the end of the day it really is a fun game. A successful heist feels like a real accomplishment. Watching the tapes of your intruders falling prey to your traps is gratifying. And when you die or get robbed it feels really crappy... but then you have nothing to lose, so you might as well get back to robbing people :)			"

												For me this game was not fun. I had only 2000$ to work with and when you die, you start over. This ammounts to hours and hours wasted building mazes and traps, only to die and have to do it all over again. what's worse is that once the family members are all dead you don't have to worry about blocking an exit path, which is horse♥♥♥♥♥♥  The people at the top have so big of an atvantage it's not even funny.In fact, I spent most of my time afterwards trying to just ♥♥♥♥ over most of the higher wealth houses; just cuz.

												I like this game now. It has a very steep learning curve. To success in this game, you actually needs to build traps that surpise people. Its not enough to build rock solid security, people will avoid it. What you need to build, is security which will look harmless, but which will surprise the burgular. For example, ""fake commit gates"" that actually are traps that kill the player if he hasn't defused the trap first with some switch or combination.Forget robbering as a new user/respawned user. Make surprising traps, and once you start earning money for tools, you can get out robbering.			"

Despite all that it's touches of puzzle game, tower defense and its yet to be discovered traps and mechanisms make it fun to play.

												This is a -fantastic- game! But BE WARNED: IT IS PUNISHING.You will probably get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the first time you build up your home, and die either by folly in setting up your own traps, or by falling into somebody else's cunning trap. There's much delight in designing a house full of nefarious traps, but oh will your nerves shake when you have to run through it all yourself, constantly wondering if you made an error in your design. Getting good at robbery takes time. You have to learn what to anticipate, know what tools are best to bring, hone your instincts, and like any robber have a little luck.But nothing as quite as satisfying as successfully burglarizing somebody's home, especially if it's a -big- heist. We're talking $50k+ here.Bought this game back in Alpha when it came out, and it has undergone some substantial changes, and improvements.My ONLY gripe is that robbery tools can now be stacked. So it is possible that somebody with a substantial amount of wealth could by so many tools that they can reach a vault with absolute certainty. Then the real question is, does that vault have more money than the tools were worth??In any case, I HIGHLY recommend this game.			"

												I think that this game embodies what a 8bit game is supposed to be. I think it brings out the worst in you because one wrong step and your house resets. Or when you come back to your house to find your family dead its one of the best learning moments in games I have seen in a long time as when you watch the video tapes and you see a whole new way of getting to the same that you didnt even know existed or the heart stopping moment when you are one move from a dog and you are contemplating how to escape. Overall I think that this game is well worth it and that it will become a great steal at the current price.			"

												This game -- It is a brilliant idea and extremely addicting. It is not for everyone, so please read the following before you decide to buy the game. Firstly I want to state that all the critics giving this game a bad review should not be allowed to even rate a game like The Castle Doctrine. I mean this with no hate but if your job is to quickly play a game and write a report about it, day in day out, then you will NOT be able to appreciate a game that involves thinking/learning such as this.Short summery: You are given a house with some money and you build traps to keep other players out. Afterwards you have the choice of either logging off and waiting for people to die(get money) or break into your vault, or invading someone elses house. Once someone breaks into your house you can actually watch footage of how they do so. The amount of people in the game is very active. Once I build my house, people normally bite within minutes.If you have played Minecraft and enjoy the 'engineering' aspect of the game where you build and wire items together, you will enjoy this game. At first the amount of items may seem overwhelming but the learning curve is small. Once you have given the game a chance, and come to appreciate that every single house you enter is the fabrication of someone elses individual imagination, you will LOVE the game. The amount of traps and mazes that people create is AMAZING. It makes no difference how long you have played, you will always be a student in this game. You cannot ever master this game because there will likely be someone that will figure your design out -- that's the point of the game!The game lacks a tutorial for good reason -- this game is for people that like to think/innovate. If you enjoy games that are linear, hand things out, or have safety nets, then you will not enjoy this game. The punishment of failure is very large and you will die a lot at first, however you are given all the tools to test your designs at will. If you dare to copy someone elses design, expect people to have already seen it(you better add a new spin onto it).Recommendations: Play around with all the different types of items, or watch a quick youtube video on how they work. Then go into other peoples houses to explore, and die, and die, and die, and die, and die again. You lose nothing as a newbie so check out how some other people are creating houses. Then create a simple house and watch how someone robs you. If you fail, recreate it and improve on the design -- simple as that.Personal tactic: I fill up my backpack with saws in order to try and rob someone as a complete newbie. I break into a house that is worth more than the starting amount of money and try to saw my way through as much as possible, minding traps. If I reach a vault then I will likely double my cash, and then create a house from scratch with more money then I originally had. If I die, I respawn and repeat the above until I crack someone's house. Along the way I see cool looking traps and try to replicate them. ONCE I build a house, I never rob anyone. I logout and wait for people to die to my traps, and then build more and more.			"

												Permadeath!  Its hateful.  Not savig your house is hateful.  Strangers clubbing your family to death is hateful.  Suicide because you are trapped by electrified grills is hateful.  This game was hateful.However, I stayed on past the 10th death - I can now create a new house in about 10 minutes, and it kills strangers.   My wife is now armed, so bring it on with your club you swine.  This game is the purest 'strategy' game I have ever seen.  No armies, and I guess its more like a tower defence.  But, in-fact, its a puzzle game, and a very fine one so far.   I really want to kill enough strangers to be able to spend some of that cash that starts to build up.  I really want to drug those enemy dogs so I can steal your stuff.   Its a great little game if you like puzzles and you can get over having to rebuild your house.  I now take picures of my finished house - both so I can get through it myself and so I can rebuild it if need be.  Things like saving houses should be part of the game, so I hope that gets added.  If you like games and you have the cash then give it a try...so my house can kill you.			"

My house (after 24 hours of being live.  has 114 attempts,  44 deaths from other players being stupid and falling for my traps. and one guy has sucessfully  stole from me.  and all you need to escape this house is alot of water. :)			"

												This game is perfect for: hardcore gamersGod where do I even begin. As always I’m going to write a very detailed review, try to resist spoilers as much as possible, but a decent review would be hundreds of pages in length.This is always a giant sim world. By sim I mean it’s one player, but the world is so realistic, so detailed that it’s more of a simulation then a game. When you talk to NPC’s, even simple merchants, it’s not a simple press button and trade with them. You can do that, but you can also say “hows buisiness” “how do you get your supplies” “what’s new around town” etc. A lot of times they will have a misc quest you can do for them. You interact with them just like you would a real world vendor. This is how it is with every friendly NPC, and there are thousands, maybe tens of thousands of them in this game.The in game world itself is probably like 50-200 square miles. And that’s just the outdoors. There’s a couple hundred dungeons, shops, buildings, etc that you can go into, that total into millions of indoor square feet. One dungeon I did last night took me almost 3 hours to complete, and I explored less then half of it. You can spend weeks in this game exploring alone. See that mountain in the distance? In the real world if you really wanted to you could get to the top of it right? Same goes for Skyrim. This isn’t Fable, or some other RPG that has set paths. You can run over rocks, jump EVERY fence (not just select fences like fable) jump off a cliff (unhealthy choice) etc etc. If you could run through it, over it, or around it in the real world, you can in this world. In general you can’t grasp cliff sides to rock climb, but you can find a way around.as always, it has so much to offer. Most games have one main story quest that takes a few hours, to complete, and a handful of very short side quests. This game, the main story alone takes days. There are four big factions who offer so much content, you might as well consider them 4 more “main stories”. So technically this game has 4 main story lines, all of them are gigantic. It’s intimidating to say the least, you could have 100 out of thousands, maybe tens of thousands of quests, and it’s hard to decide what one u want to do. The main quest rewards you with money, which is very useful. Anywhere from spewing fire, freezing an opponent in place, and special ones like making a quick sprint, and later the ability to summon a dragon. As well as unique weapons, gear, companions, etc. Then again there are side quests that award you with the ability to become invisible (won’t say who, keep spoilers minimal). As is the case with most games it is so overwhelming at first, that it’s not very fun, but it grows on you. The more you get into the game, the more you find it impossible to turn off the computer. Most games simply B-line to the end. The campaign or main story can take maybe 10 hours tops, even on the hardest of modes. This game takes days (as I said) and has plenty of interesting twists and turns. Also to the fans, there are plenty of references to other games.Now some info about the character. This game has a very customizable character menu. If you played Starbound, then you should have the general idea of what it’s like. On many points it has more detail on facial creation than Starbound, on other points it has considerably less. In the end I prefer the face creator in this game much more than Starbound. It’s a lot better looking, and it’s more user friendly. Rather then shaping the nose, it has like 50 presets for the nose, which you can then decide to shape how you want. I like this a lot more. As always there’s plenty of hair customization, eyes, lips, cheeks, jaw bones, eye brows, fore head, ears, skin color, skin complexion, etc. Aside from the fact that there are “more options” some new features include war paint, battle scars, and body type. For males you get 3 body types, slim, medium, and buff. Of coarse as a cool dude I went with buff. As for the females I didn’t check if it’s a anorexic chick vs Helga, or if it’s maybe “bust” customization. This system applies to NPC’s as well. It’s not always the same exact body, just slightly different skin color, and a different head/face. There’s plenty of body variety. The kids look a lot better two. They actually look like children, rather than shrunken down adults. There’s no one fat or “fluffy”, kinda hurts on the realism, but the increase in variety is a nice new detail.If you have played Monaco, then note this is from the creators of Monaco. Monaco also got tons of awards, but it’s so old that if they said “from the creators of Monaco” all but true fans would be like “what’s Monaco?” So trust me this is EVERYTHING IS AWSOME, and some good stuff from Monaco. If you remember in Monaco, there are finishing moves that would be in slow motion. If you got a headshot, it would be in slow motion. In this one there are finishing moves. They don’t always happen, but when they do they are cool. The variety of them is relatively low, I think I’ve seen maybe 8 different finishing moves, but they always make you feel like a badass killing machine.			"

												Very intelligent, creative and freedom offering game. Possibilities within game mechanics are endless all tho I would have liked to see more electrical gadgets to use in security systems, not nessesarily deadly but movement hindering or tool consuming traps by default, something that just makes the player unsure but doesnt instantly scare them away. Also the large use of combination locks by player community is unimaginative and game brakeing for most non-tool and modestly tool reliant players.Tools are well balanced to traps and every situation can be countered with right set of tools so the game never leads to impossible situations if prepared right. Permanent death adds to stress when there is much to loose and player is facing hard decisions. I would say its an awesome game.			"

												This game needs three things to be changed in order for the developer to make a lot more money, and for the game to rebirth into an enjoyable experience for its supporters (players/customers) 1: change the game mechanic that makes it so when a person robs you're house and drugs your dogs they wont stay in the same spot they were drugged, and the house is changed from what it was originally when the owner does a toolless entry to the safe (some houses are absolutely UNRAIDABLE due to this) 2: The family members are worthless to players because it makes the defenses harder to make and provides no benefit to being alive (Make the family worth more by adding in more money from family's income everyday/  make the family automatically repair house after it was robbed {less family members = Less repair/ more time to repair fully}) 3: let the game go on sale so you will get more players to make the game be more whole/ playable which would save the game from haveing less than 15 players in total....  (side note you can make paintings cost real currency like the bids start at 25 cents and can go up from bidders)			"

												I hope you never loved your wife.  She is as good as dead.  This game is fun, especially when watching the fools who enter your house and die to your traps.  This game is both very easy, the least skilled players die, and very difficult, the most skilled players simply bypass all your hardwork.  I would recommend it though the price is a bit steep.P.S. who else thinks the game would be better if instead of dying to traps you simply were sent to the hospital with some penalty of money?Or at least being able to save house designs, so when you die you don't have to build every thing one block at a time.It seems most of the heat this game is getting is from the issue of starting from scratch.Robbing houses is also not always a solo job, and I would like to see the ability to rob a house simultaneously with a group, and divying up the loot at the end.The game is good, but it could be better.

												As far as games go, this one has a seriously steep learning curve. Understanding how things work, that's one thing. The real challenge, however, is trying to put it all together, because a good portion of how well your traps function is based on psychology, and on that note, there's no way it hell you can know who's gonna break in, or when.Highly recommended game, 10/10.

												this game in my oppinion is the pinacle of 8-bit burglary/home defense games (yes those are a thing)it has some cool graphic a huge selection of things to make for home defense like a trap door that is a leap of faith and paintings that make your house more valuble why because it gives u som awsome cash			"

												I wanted to say that you might enjoy this game, its pretty cool, but i feel that i wont play forever.EDIT: At first I recommended it, but well this game is dead and its developper dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about it. Some people (like me) has paid 20$ for this, but now there is like 8 people playing, what a shame for an MMO game...			"

												Good concept, good delivery. Simple but complex. Fairly difficult to start out. After a few days of lucky playing, built a menacing house. Ended up paying the full 16 bucks for it, which is a little high (should be 10 bucks flat or less). It's certainly worth playing, and I would recommend it! 9/10!			"

												This is an interesting game - I suspect that with some tweaks it could be amazing. I never really got into it; it seems like one of those games super nerds would love - as a means to prove how genius they are. I died a lot, it needs some more features. I suspect it will get better with future updates. I have not played anything else like it - it's a clever idea and it's not that pricey. Won't put you in a good mood though - unless you are really evil.			"

												Most people are not good at this game due to the lack of tutorials. And that causes most of the haters.Yes, when I spend a hour building my house, but then get killed by my own traps, it causes me to rage and not to play this game for days.And it has $2 walls.10/10			"

												Game is D E A D, so DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!! Even if people still played enough, luck was rewarded far more than skill or logic.			"
