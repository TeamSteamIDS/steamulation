												Compatibility problems aside,The Entente Gold is a fine game for those who seek games related to The First World War.All factions have uniquely modelled buildings and voicelines in their native language.(Russians speak russian,Germans german,and the soliders of Austria-Hungary speak hungarian)The levels are HUGE,which makes maneuvering with larger groups of soliders.The game lets you controll almost two thousand men on map/player.The soundtrack is memorable.From the graphical standpoint,the game is plain mediocre,or even bad.(depends on how tolerant you are about graphics)Overall,the game is worth picking at it's realtively low price of 1,99.7.8/10 "

												Do not buy this game.An excellent looking game for those interested in the Cossack/American Conquest style engines, HOWEVER:The game simply will not work on newer operating systems, i.e. Windows 8. The developers have no interest at all in responding the these concerns, rather content to milk each new purchaser for its garbage price of $0.49.As someone who used to play this title, I am dissapointed in the Steam release, dysfunctional as it is.

												Ok for the price, this game is great! Sure it’s not that smooth and the controls are kinda wonky. But other than that it’s pretty solid. The AI isn’t too bad and the Historical accuracy is quite impressive.  It has enough variety unit wise to make for a nice mixed combat. Not to mention it has both air and sea units.  The graphics aren’t the best, but they will do. I don’t see why any strategy enthusiast shouldn’t play this game.			"

												Real-time strategy title with the rare setting of the Grand War. RTS where you need to collect resources (like wood, oil etc.), build towns and watchtowers around them, scout the map, and only after that spawn a massive attack on the enemy base. Just like it was in the RTS by the time of ""Warcraft 2"" and ""Dune: the battle for Arrakis"". In the setting of 1st World War, with  planes, warships and so on...But it was released about 15 years ago. Which means the game is dated quite badly, like the most of the RTS of that age. Many of modern PC users will not be able to start the game properly. That you can easily see from all the lot of negative reviews on the ""Entante"" just here on the store page.So, why, of all things, I'm still recommending the game? For two reasons.For one, if your hands and head aren't made just for eating, you CAN tweak the game and actually play it on the Win 7/10 (dunno about Win 8, but who use it now, anyway?)For two, there are maybe less than five strategical games for that time of history. And all of them but stunningly weak ""Battle of Empires"", are quite old. Well, don't get me started on the ""Battle of Empires"", just check the reviews on it for yourself!So, if you're interested in the game's setting, and know the deal with RTS of that era - I'm still positive that you can play it just fine (after some tweaking, and сoming to terms with some unavoidable glitches).The mark is 6/10. Could have been higher, would the game was ready to play out of the box, but now, alas, you really need to start from tuning part...			"

 This game may not work on your machine so beware! The Entente is a Real-time strategy game revolves around World War I and is based on the military events from 1914 to 1918. Players must gather resources that include food, wood, iron, gold, oil and electricity to create and feed their nation and armies of World War I.The game runs on Cossacks game engine, and is similar to Cossacks/American Conquest series in some ways, the game is overall very unique and fun but has compatibility problems with new hardware and operating systems.Pros:-Good old Isometric graphics similar to Cossacks/American Conquest games.-Each nation has its own fairly accurately represented style of architecture (Something very hard to see in other games, most games use the same re-skinned copy/paste models).-Good World War I atmosphere.-Good sounds and music which fits well in WWI period.-In-game tutorial, commanding units, developing economy, using tactics and strategy.-Five nations to choose (Austro-Hungarian Empire, Britain, France, Germany, Russia).-Campaign for each nation and some extra missions.-Skimrish mode against AI.-Wide variety of units, buildings and technology.-Specialized units that is specific of each country of the era.-Challenging AI, playing on medium difficulty feels like hard, AI actually uses tactics-In-game encyclopedia included (Museum) , which is good to have one.-Would run smoothly on weak/old systems.Neutral:-No widescreen support (Not a big deal for me).-No peace time option in skirmish mode like in Cossacks/American Conquest series.Cons:-Compatibility issues, the game is likely not going to run without problems on new hardware/Operating Systems, (works on my Win7 64-bit Laptop but not on my desktop PC with the same OS and superior hardware).Overall the game is challenging and fun, I played years ago on Windows XP (outside of Steam), had issues too, but the one on Steam is (Gold) which is v2.0 so in theory it should work better than the old retail version, and that is true because I tried Disc version of The Entente: Battlefields World War I, and it didn't run on Windows 7 even with after patches. I'm recommending the game to anyone who likes RTS and WWI, especially if you also like Cossacks/American Conquest series, but keep in mind the game might not work on every system, so think about the risk.The game is fairly cheap, $1.99 in the US, 1,99€ in Europe, £1.59 in UK and less in other countries, if you're a fan of RTS and old games then get it, you can keep it to play later on some weak system that is built for old games like me.There are some tweaks and fixes that might fix your problems, don't forget to read pinned threads in the community hub, I would have not recommended the game if it was the same version as the old retail one, but this one (v2.0) actually worked on Win7 64-bit, unlike the retail version I have doesn't run, so if you really want to play this game then you have to give it a chance.I'm guessing the problem is occurring from newer graphics cards and processors but graphics cards is my first guess.My laptop specs: ""The Entente Gold"" (Works).HP G62-Intel i5 460m-First generation Intel HD Graphics-4GB Ram-Windows 7 64-bit UltimateMy Desktop PC Specs: ""The Entente Gold"" (does NOT work).-Intel i5-2500k-GTX 770-8GB Ram-Windows 7 64-bit UltimateCossacks and American Conquest series running perfectly out of the box on almost every known system (Except maybe Win8) I believe it is not hard to do the same for The Entente Gold.I am kindly asking developers to release a patch to fix compatibility issues with various systems, please fix this game because it deserves more attention and fans. The game is a hidden gem, if it ever works.  "

												Works just fine on my laptop (windows 7 64 bit, Geforce GT 540M, widescreen). Original version I had worked great on Windows 98, but used to crash terribly on Windows XP and flickered badly, this one works also has some minor flickering in menus, but nothing too serious. Widescreen support doesn't exist, but that's really not that much of a surprise. Multiplayer seems to be down, it was powered by GameSpy if I recall correctly, so it's not a surprise, I guess. For those who have issues - install directx version suggested in forums, use compability mode and don't forget it's a game from era that is kinda hard to play on modern PCs without tweaking, as developer can't really give you a DOS BOX and just emulate old hardware.Gameplay wise it's a great strategy surviving the trial of time well, especially when there are not that many WW1 strategies out here at all. It is lacking trench warfare so it's impossible to call it realistic, but otherwise amount of troops on screen and the variety of the game is really impressive.			"

												The game runs on Windows 7. The menu flickers a bit like some old games do- I think it's a GDI problem or something. The resolutions you can choose are all 4:3, no widescreen, 1600x1200 is the top one, though I'm going from memory since the screenshots/steam overlay don't work.When you start a game there's some really nasty graphic corruption on the screen- black blocks and/or tiles randomly in the wrong place. If you scroll the screen off then back again it fixes it though and doesn't seem to happen again in the level.Levels are huge and there's buildings to make and resources, very much like in AoE,AoM etc.			"

My tank will stop them all, literally slaughtering everything in a very large range. How to stop a tank? Well, with another tank, or 100 canons, or a bomber.However, game still have glitches for the new operating systems. New, I mean everything after XP.

												The Entente is a old-styled RTS based on rarely-used WW1 setting. It was released in 2003-2004 and was made by same people who made Cossacks, on same engine as well, unless I am mistaken. And now it was rereleased on Steam.You will notice that while in Steam it's called Entente Gold, in the game itself it shows ""v2.0"" and intro was edited to say ""Entente II"". It's not clear what was changed. I remember somebody on Steam noticing it and saying that some sprites were changed. Like they were working to remake it, but then gave up.And sadly, it wasn't changed enough to be made compitable with newest Windows. While it may work fine on Windows XP, anything newer will have bucket and half of troubles, bugs and glitches. Then again, you aren't likely to progress past ""frozen mouse"" anyway. So you will have to look around Steam forums and guides a lot to fix it all. To try to fix it all. Having ended up using Voodoo emulating software of sorts, I still would have low FPS in this game. Well, it was fine, but only when nothing was selected. And you have to select buildings to order 50 more soldiers, you know. And some people seemed to fail to make it run properly even after trying all solutions. So, be careful. This is the main reason not to recommend the game.Oh, yes, no Widescreen. You can set it, but it will just will crash the game.No idea how mutliplayer is in this game. Actually, when I clicked on multiplayer option, it was showing nothing aside from mirror-effect. You know, when screen places frame on top of each other when there is no background. Leaving only trail of mouse. It could be because I didn't fix it fully. Or it could be because v2.0 changed things or possibly deleted everything related to multiplayer, including menues.I didn't play much of game because of it lagging on my laptop after fixes. Just few random map battles. It's quite a standard old-school RTS. Even WW1 setting doesn't bring much to it, no trenches to be found there. Having few recources types may be scary, but you just put needed buildings on top of nearby recource pools and then send remaining workers to work near windmill. And well, being 2D engine in beggining of 2000s, it means that it sacrificed 3D looks for sake of having tons of units at same time. And it's spammy, alright.One of the more interesting things in it is how your main force, soldiers, are mass produced. In masses. Quickly and cheaply, filling your screen up. But they die like a fly when met with any defencive. While power and recources and time needed to produce better units grow geometrically, so to say. You can make basic soldier every few seconds. Or take half-minute to produce machine gunner. Or few minutes to produce artilerry cannon. Which hits good but misses 90% of time, so it's better used on center of a town. And has firing range bigger than vision range. Doesn't stop unit AI from shooting. Or you can take 20 minutes to create a tank. And the most powerful units are naval ones, taking no less than half-hour or more to complete. Hm, perhaps it's realistical, seeing how history makes a big deal when a ship is lost. It does make water maps take forever when you need a water transport.But then again, looking at players on YouTube and looking at AI, mass-produced soldiers are still the thing to do. Sure, a soldiers die like a fly when met with guard house filled with machine gunner. What it means is that you have to create 10 times more soldiers and zerg rush it down, watching them grenade everything. It's also faster than producing heavier units.And seeing how multiplayer does not exist here, AI isn't all that great either. No, it's hard. Until you figure out the game. It's just that his main tactic is massing soldiers are and sending waves after waves at you. It could use more variety, really.Well, it's quite a curious old-school RTS. Or mass producment of basic units while wasting 30 minutes to build something bigger. I didn't spend enough time to say for sure if it's bad or good one. But seeing how it may or may not run even after fixes, you should avoid it.			"

												The only reason I wouldn't recommend the game is it is really hit or miss as to whether or not you'll be able to get it operational on your system.The game mechanics are alright, nothing mind blowing, and it plays very similar to Age of Empire in my limited play time.I'm not going to sink anymore time into though, as I'm one of many who have an issue with the game not rendering some assets, mainly the buildings aren't visible for me. Others have issues like the game not even running, and while I normally take those kinds of complaints with a grain of salt, reading through the forum shows this game is rarely a simple install and play with everything working as expected. If you're the patient type who doesn't mind doing some work arounds to get things operating as intended, and you like an Age of Empires type game, then give it a shot. Otherwise, stay away.			"

												Entente is one of those under rated games in my opinion. I played this a lot a few years back, and the entire Great War setting is something i feel needs more games. Not to the extent of World War 2, mind you. So graphicly, its old. From the same vein as  Cossacks and American Conquest (Both games sit in my game pile, proudly i might add) There is problems with it running on modern machines. I am currently running it on Vista, aside from a few annoyances the game runs fine. Even though the game is said to work on XP (and older) and 7. If you like games such as Cossacks (Cossacks two lovers, sorry its more like Cossack one) or American Conquest. Put some money down and play one of the finest World War 1 strategy games.			"

												Well honestly, don't buy it. Unless for extreme nostalgia sake - which is why I got it. It's pretty broken. I loved this Entente when I was younger and loved playing it, one of the few World War 1 RTS games out there. The problem I have is this game uses FPS to judge game speed. If you want to run slowly you're going to have 12-18 frames per second. Not to mention the GUI. When up on your screen it halves the already poor frame rate.  It goes up to 35 frames if you turn the speed all the way up but then if you select a unit the menu appears and halves your framerate again.The colours are disorientating and can making you feel sick after a good hour or so. The resolution is screwy at best. They are weird to begin with, I'm not sure but I think they're for 4:3 monitors. I'm going to say don't get it if you've just stumbled upon it and thought it seemed interesting.If they just made a HD version that got rid of the resolution and framerate problems I would reccommend this game like crazy.

The developers are well aware of this problem, but they don't seem to have any inclination to fix the problems that I and many others experienced. So, if you want to burn two dollars for a game that doesn't work, then go right ahead. Otherwise, steer clear of this game until you hear that the developers decided to do something to fix it.			"

												Bad. So bad. Doesn't run on Windows 7 (of course Steam won't tell you that) and will be nothing but a waste of money if you buy it. If you really want it, wait until GOG makes it avalaible (and accessible) on modern PCs. Probably the last game you'll ever want to buy if you have Windows 7 or 8.			"

												I have a decently good computer that runs on Windows 8. And I found this game to be literally unplayable. Unfortunately I couldn't so much as start the game without having some severe crashes that both times I couldn't Alt+Tab my way out of the frozen game, and even if I pulled up the task manager using Ctrl+Alt+Delete I couldn't access it. So both times I had to do a hard shut-down on my computer to exit out of the game. I tried multiple methods to get the game to work and nothing works. I do not advise buying this game since all it seems to do is crash. It needs at least a patch to make it compatable with my OS, and as it is currently this game was a waste of money.Do yourself a favor and don't get it until they patch it. The fact this game was just released and isn't compatable with modern computers isn't just frustrating, it's irresponsible.			"

												This game is fun and all, but as it stands the major issues that the game had as a retail version are still apparent. The most I have been able to do is start the game and go through the menus. As for gameplay, havent been able to play yet, due to a constant graphical error that presents itself everytime you start a campaign or random map etc. Over all if you have 2 bucks to spend you might as well grab it. Maybe the devs who posted this will work on a fix or something to actually make it work, but I have my doubts.			"

												I bought this game on Steam to see if it's as bad as I remember.It is.Gameplay: I am familar with Cossacks, but this completely throws all sense of balance and playability out of the window. Campaign maps are just random blobs with very poor scripting, little of the objectives make sense. Historical Accuracy: Laughable. Bears a passing resemblance to the 1st World War at best. No Trenches, campaign maps again bear no resemblance to reality, some ridiculous unit choices. Media: The menus are graphically awful, and the music makes my ears bleed.			"

												A friend of mine got me into this game and after fixing all the crashes, I can't seem to get enough!The key is to run it in Windows Compatability Mode to get it to work.  Let me dump one way (I use a different method to make Steam do it) of easily doing it:WARNING: This game will not work if run through Steam. It only works through compatibility mode with Windows XP Service Pack 3.THE FOLLOWING METHOD IS ONLY PROVEN TO WORK IN WINDOWS 7.Launching the game:1.Right-click game in Steam Library.2.Click Properties, then in new window click on the local files tab.3.Click 'Browse Local Files'.4.Windows explorer should pop up with the game files. Right click on Antanta.exe (shown as Antanta). 5.Click properties again, then in new window navigate to compatibility tab. 6.Tick the box where it's description is: Run this game in compatibility mode for.....7.Select Windows XP Service Pack 3.8.Click apply, then launch Antanta.exe or play through Steam.9.Your game should boot properly with minor graphical bugs (which go away and are only in the levels).

												This is a quite challenging but still fun game in the old ""Command and Conquer"" RTS vein, but with the level of historic detail it should be compared to the ""Cossacks 2"" series. The interface is fairly simple as are the graphics, but the visuals maintain the game's historic accuracy (the differences between national uniform). It can't be compared to the ""Blitzkrieg"" series for graphics, and it's somewhat behind the ""Battle of Empires"" mod for ""Company of Heroes"", but for the price there's quite literally hours (if not weeks or even months in the campaigns) of game play with thankfully little frustration for the junior leader or even the veteran RTS player. A well-trained AI is built into the game to manage your civil or military war effort for you so you need do very little, unless you really want a challenge. Then you should fully expect General War in all his aspects! Finally and thankfully the game doesn't just park itself in trench warfare-you should expect what really happened in 1914; the dawn of twentieth-century warfare with all the associated horrors. Good luck, everyone.			"

Which thats why i said its not worth 1.99 becuase if its not complete when it should be its not worth anything.  Hope my review helped and they update the game soon?			"

												Its not often you find a WW1 RTS game. And the game realy does its best to look ww1. The game favors mass waved and turtle tactics. To new users, this can be a shock, especially when the enemy attacks with waves and waves of troops. Gameplay is reletively simple, infantry are you core guys, cavely are good scouts, and the rest support you infantyr and cavelry. Just like WW1. The music is interesting, though nothing to write home about. Armies are similar enough that no one army is overpowered, yet each army has a style that makes them unique.  Now, here comes the problem. This game is infamouse for not working on new systems. It is recommend to use an oldersystem with this game. If not, you may have to toy with the files in game. To some of you, this might be fun. To others, it can be hell. Another problem with this game is that, despite being ww1, there are no trenchs to be seen. Yes sad, but we can't have everything. Overall I would recomend this game. But Buyer Beware, be prepared for problems if you are using a new system. DEVS will not help you. Until a fan patch is made, best to play on an older system or find a home remedy to get the game to work.			"

												Buggy but working  sort of remake, best played on older systems like XP and before that even but it might just work on your OS if you're lucky. Oh, forgot to mention it's based on the Cossacks engine, but surprisingly Cossacks and American Conquest work fine.			"

												Its old, and shows it. The sprites look nice when they aren't glitching. Its a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get to work on a modern rig (Which you no doubt have) I got it to sorta work by running it in compat mode Vista and switching to an intel integrated graphics card instead of using my default nvidia. I can't really recommend this game. The only thing it really has going for it is it's time period. WWI but you can't build trenches... in WWI a war which seared into the public memory the Horrors of the trenches, the inhumanity, insanity, and indifference of the bombs. All in all no, maybe 10 years ago, maybe if you really like vintage games, maybe if you have a nostalgic longing to play it, but not if you are looking for a world war one game, and not if you are looking for a game that will definitley work on your PC.
