												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT DOES NOT WORK.STEAM SUPPORT WILL NOT HELP YOU(supposedly because it's a securom issue which is ""third party"")The game has Securom DRM with limited activations, which is bad enough.But the key steam gives you isn't even valid, so you can't ever play the game.Steam Support directs you to a dusty web forum for support.End result: You got screwed out of your money, and despite multiple peoplereporting the same issue to steam support they still sell the game on steam.

												Do not purchase.  Hopefully you are reading this prior to buying the game and not after like I did. If you purchase this you wont be able to play it anyway.  so even at $0.99 it is a waste of money. Burn the dollar if you want to get actual entertainment value out of it becuase you will not be able to play this game as the CD keys are mostly broken and you will spend hours of your time trying to get a dollar game to work only to have it not.As the users her have said steam does not give 2 Sh*ts about the issues with their games and will keep on happily taking your money for a game that doesn't work and they will do nothing about it it.  Being that they are too big to fail and one of the only viable options out there, F*cking over a small percentage of the community doesn't really matter to them as it wont have any impact.So do yourself a favor, no matter how fun the game looks, don't purchase it, be sure to read reviews before you buy things and game on!

												Can't play it cuz the code that steam gave me for the game doesnt work, Securcom says its steam, Steam says its not their problem, thats the code they were given; so i'm stuck with a game i bought from STEAM that i cant play - because STEAM can't resolve the issue.  Updated 6/3/15:  @my couch...   Yes, I was using the CD Key.  SecureRom does not accept the CD Key given to me by Steam.  I used both the ""Copy to Clipboard"" method as well as writing it down and keying it in manually to attempt to activate my game.  Neither method work.  I get the same Activation Failed issue.  The SERIAL was not found in the database.  Most likely the SERIAL has been entered incorrectly.  I""ve contacted Steam - they say contact SecureRom - I contacted SecureRom, they say Steam gave wrong key.  I sent screenshots to Steam of my key and error pages and they say its a valid key, but neither company is willing to correct the problem. Honestly, I purchased this game from Steam, I expected them to either assist in fixing issue or refund my money so I can get the game off my library list (I was hoping to try to purchase/download a new version with a new code) but can't download another if it is in my library. So, no Age of Booty to play.NOTE:  by repeatedly downloading and trying to install this game, I've noticed that STEAM counts that as ""Played"" Time so my attempts today at trying yet again, added more time to what is displayed as Played.  Be careful with that NEW STEAM REFUND:  refunds only with < 2hours ""Played"" time.			"

												I buy a game on Steam, I expect to be able to install it as many times as I like, however with this game I found out it uses Securom and you have a limited number of third party activations.  Once I got past all the cd-key entering BS (there's a screen where you can't copy & paste), I come to find out multiplayer doesn't work properly, was hoping they had fixed it by now. Maybe I'll get lucky and it won't activate again if I uninstall it again.			"

												Age Of Booty has SecuRom + limited times of activation, on top of the steam drm. Do I have to say more? Sadly I have seen it too late and hence threw one buck out of a window with buying this crap. Ah well. Do yourself a favor and stay as far as humanly possible from this messy XBLA port of DRM loaded bs game. Ugh. (Or gift it to people on your friendslist you dislike during a steam sale. Whatever floats your boat xD Just do not ever -- and I mean NEVER EVER -- actually buy it in the intention to install it on your system to play it. Nope. Nope nope nope.) TL:DR: If there would be a prize for the best combination of crappy, poorly done ports and intrusive (like registry deep) annoying, sh*tty drm for a game, Age Of Booty would win it. By far.			"

												There isn't much of a game here, but I'm going to review it anyways.First off, this is another Capcom game that uses Securom, but unlike Dark Void before it, it doesn't suffer the Securom fate of not finding the cd key in their database.  But thats about all the 'good news' this game has going for it.The game uses Gamespy for it's multiplayer, and well, it doesn't exsist anymore, so you can't play the multiplayer and considering what little single player there is, there is pretty much no game left.  There is seven tiny single player missions.  None of them are really good.  There is a few different difficulty levels, but playing the 'campaign' through on easy, there wasn't really anything there that made me want to challenge myself on harder difficulties.Don't buy this game, don't make the mistake I did.

												I have yet to defeat the first Boss battle; SecuROM. I've tried countless tactics and even resorted to looking up cheat codes.This is a prime example of how not to do DRM. I am a big proponent of good DRM when it is used as a function to benifit both the developers and the consumer (Steam is a great example). When DRM offers consumers no benifit, and becomes an onerous task such as with this game it defeats the purpose of the DRM. It is games like this one that encourage otherwise willing and paying customers to resort to pirating the game just to rid themselves of the challenge of an otherwise simple task; launching the game.-999/10 - Would not DRM again.

												First of all: i don't know why this game is so underrated. Yes, you can't play the multiplayer part, tho, but right upper the ""Add to Cart-Button"" is a Note, that says, that the multiplayer is not working and the game only supports single player mode.To the game itself:I've just finished all of the 21 challenges and thats enough for a game that cost me just .99 Pens.Ye' arrrrre a Pirrrrrrate an' have to capture towns. In each Challenge you will fight against other Opponents, Sometimes you're alone with your ship and there are 3 other Factions you have to battle against for the Towns and Resources.The Resources are gold, trees and grog/ale/mead.You need the gold to build on captured town to an Stronghold with 2 Town upgrades for each town.When an Enemy captures your town the upgrades just vanish for the enemy and for you, so if you re-capture the townthe town will start at defense-level 0 again.The grog is for ship upgrades, like power of your cannons, speed and armor (self-explaining).I recommend this game for people who wants to play some funny game for a little break.Yaarrrr, an' ye' forgot t' tak' ye Grog!██████████████████████████████████▀▀▀░░░░░░░▀▀▀███████████▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀███████│░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░│█████▌│░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░│▐████░└┐░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░┌┘░████░░└┐░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░┌┘░░████░░┌┘▄▄▄▄▄░░░░░▄▄▄▄▄└┐░░████▌░│██████▌░░░▐██████│░▐█████░│▐███▀▀░░▄░░▀▀███▌│░█████▀─┘░░░░░░░▐█▌░░░░░░░└─▀████▄░░░▄▄▄▓░░▀█▀░░▓▄▄▄░░░▄██████▄─┘██▌░░░░░░░▐██└─▄█████████░░▐█─┬┬┬┬┬┬┬─█▌░░█████████▌░░░▀┬┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┬▀░░░▐█████████▄░░░└┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┘░░░▄████████████▄░░░░░░░░░░░▄█████████████████▄▄▄▄▄▄▄█████████████████████████████████████			"

												As other reviewers have commented, don't bother buying this.That said, if you want the detailed explanation, here goes:Once you get passed (if you ever do) all the bologne regarding the SecureRom & CD-Key enforcement, you'll come to a menu that has only two working choices: 'Challenges' & 'Help and Options'Challenges (also known as: we couldnt call it single player because there is almost NO content) are rediculously short and (suppoosedly) teaches you the merits of multiplayer -- even though there IS NO LONGER MULTPLAYER...Help & Options explains how to use the Map Editor, which you can't use without logging into the Gamespy servers (which no longer exist), as well as allowing you to change your resolution and choose between full screen or no.This is arguably the best feature of the game in it's current state. Yes, you read that correctly, changing the resolution of the game is most fun I had in 'Age of Booty'.Since the game is no longer purchasable on Steam, you're -- yes you, reading this! -- in luck because you don't have the luxury of wasting hard earned money on this title.I on the other hand did waste my green on it & have set-up a Go Fund Me account to recoup my losses on purchasing this absolute piece of garbage software.You can find my Go Fund Me at: {LINK REMOVED}https://www.gofundme.com/givemebackmymoneyyougamespyporkpiesPlease give me your money so I feel better, Cheers!

Pretty much, especially with a friend.The bad things:Does the fun last long? Not really; you can play for 3-4 days max, then it gets quite boring.Can you make maps? Yeah, but the AI and the tools are kinda limited (you can make maps similar to regular maps; crazy inventions won't work out), so you can't be too innovative or creative.Will the game improve at some point/have a smartphone port someday? Well, not really... I expected it to happen, but it just didnt. :(TL;DL:If it has a HUGE discount, you can spend a dollar or two on it (price of a slice of pizza).Otherwise, don't bother with it.

												Short answer: Great game IF AND ONLY IF you use some server to emulate GameSpy.Long answer:The game by itself is very fun, and requires coordination on a fast paced strategy. Single player game can be quite frustrating as you depend heavily on AI to cooperate with you, and it probably won't requiring many trials to win even easy maps.Unfortunately multiplayer was heavily damaged by GameSpy shutdown, and the game feels broken if you're not authenticated on a server, as you can't even use the map editor. Also, the best part of this game is the multiplayer, and that will require a third party server to authenticate. Do not buy the game unless you're savvy enough to use a GameSpy emulator. I used qtracker with my friends and we played smoothly over LAN. It worked great, we had great fun. Totally worth the R$ 1.69 and the fiddling to make it work on a different server.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I had read on the forums that they fixed the issues, and that it was now playable.  This is NOT true.  The game CTD crashes to desktop the moment you start it.  Capcom doesn't care, and neither does Steam.  I've lost faith if both companies.  Apparently there is no refund.			"

												Honestly, I'm kind of T/Oed. I am relatively new to Steam and my naivete led me to assume that they would only sell me functional working products. Boy was I wrong. I see a SALE and a game I used to love playing on XBLA for only ONE dollar!?! Too good a deal to pass up! ""click"" Wait a minute No Multiplayer??? No MAP EDITOR??? So not only can I not play online with friends, I can't even make a custom map to do skirmishes with the AI !!! I'm stuck with the some 25 campaign maps, which I beat in under half a day!!! The saddest part of all this is the fact that I most likely would have never purchased it if it hadn't been slapped in my face with a SALE sign on it. This is not a retail store; you cannot liquidate your crappy inventory for a few bucks to some dumb schmuck on the street. Please take this game down! You are discrediting what the game used to be.

												Basic idea is simple and entertaining for a while. Uses SecuROM DRM (limited amount of installations) and the multiplayer is not available because of GameSpy shutdown. The single player consists of 21 missions labeled ""Challenges"". They start to feels tedious after a while and at the later levels winning is determined by your AI allies, who can be decent help or totally random. Some could argue that this reflects the multiplayer experience. Cannot really recommend a broken game.			"

												2105-05-16 Capcom sale. I gambled the 99 cents and I'm playing the tutorial now.  It installed despite the warnings in the older reviews.  You need to copy the Serial key Steam gives you and type in a CD key that appears right on the opening page. Duh, stupid and archaic DRM but no problem. Like the Store page says, it's Single Player only on PC now. The old reviews are right about GameSpy dying and Google doesn't find anyone who picked up the multiplayer fumble. If you search for yourself, you might find references to an Android mobile version but I only found an Apple AppStore  advertisement that says ""Currently only available on iOS."" Apparently, console versions exist or existed but I only have a PC to play on.Gameplay: The Store's ""About This Game"" sums it up. I've found it, the tutorial at least, easy to learn and easy to play. It's more than 99 cents worth of fun.			"

												The game works for me. Steam should give you a 16-digit alpha-numeric code when you purchase. Put that in the Securom (grey pop up) box in the blank line. Don't worry about the other long code (25 or 30 chars), it's generated by them to verify the game. After successfully going through this process once, you should be good. It won't happen every time you launch.The Gamespy servers are off, so there's no multiplayer, leaderboards, or map generator, which does suck, but you'll be able to get a dollar's worth from the 21 pre-built scenarios.If Steam could somehow separate the Gamespy servers from the game, even just to open the map generator, that would add a lot. Single players could generate their own maps and choose the number of AI players and win conditions. Is that remotely possible from a programming standpoint?			"

												// Age of Booty an RTS Game: //// Schuitje82 - Small Review //I love this game... why... the soundtracks are amazing.... :DIt's a simple RTS game because of the way it plays.You just move a boot around and with a simple click you conquer island and beat your enemies.Between battles it’s possible you need to recover at your main base or need to get back for some upgrades. So it’s not about who get’s first and winm no it’s about how you play the game.Game support many stages pre-build stages and gives a small variation to the game.Sometimes you play against 2 CPU’s or yu have a CPU as a friend who helps you with the battle.Or there are many island to conquer so you run between them to defend and keep them yours.I’ve played this game many hours on console and makes this game less fun on PC is that it has no local co-op multiplayer and the online servers are offline.So keep in mind this will be a singleplayer game only :( It's a very fun and addictive video game with a few options to play with or against the PC.Only downside is de securom security activation as the key you need to enter first time use.I hate this because we have steam :) …Score 6.5 / 10.== For more reviews go to www.gamegrin.com ==== Please don't forget to like my reviews ==			"

It is not the greatest game out there by far, but I purchased it for one dollar so i am not upset at all. The big thing i read was that the game does not work. I started the game up, typed my 16 digit key code in and the game started up. It asked to type it again and the game started right up. I plundered the first mission and won. The game seems very short, especially since the online is no more. For the price I paid, and the game DOES work, it was worth it. I would recommend this game for the price i paid, but for no more that that due to how short and lack of online.			"

It is a bit simple for my tastes, so I tend to play other games, but I keep thinking I should come back to play this one for a while.  I like the simplicity of roaming the seas, capturing and holding ports, and generally just taking over the map.  It is real time, but has elements similar to board games.  You can spend resources to upgrade your ship or the defenses of individual ports.  There are some team maps where you are partnered with AI team mates.			"

												I played this game on Xbox quite a bit and this is the same game.  However, the control settings when setting up a Multiplayer game does not work well on PC.  The Slider bars hare not well implemented in this game - it needs to be patched and fixed, but that's unlikely to ever happen.  The other downside is Gamespy-enabled matchmaking.  I wish Stream would have moved this to their own matchmaking hosting, but that may be asking too much for a 5-6 year old title.  For a buck and a quarter, these problems are somewhat minimal.			"

												A fun, relatively simple strategy game definitely worth checking out while it's only $1.24. I wouldn't say it's worth the full $4.99, but opinions vary. You control a pirate ship and along with your ally ships (who you do not control), you try to take most/all of the towns on the map, depending on the victory requirements. Neutral ships carry curses, which are similar to spells in Age of Mythology. Curses can send a whirpool under an enemy ship, plunder resources from the enemy, and other effects. You manage three resources -- Gold, Wood, and Ale. These are needed to upgrade your ship. Cannons, Speed, and Armor can be upgraded. Your towns can also be improved to help defend themselves, and this becomes more important to tip the balance in your favor on harder maps. Overall, an enjoyable game for casual strategy fans. I have not attempted multiplayer, and have had no trouble with the DRM like other reviews.			"

Some big cons though, as GameSpy is dead:-Multi-player doesn't work.-Map Creator doesn't work.-Leaderboards don't work.So if you're going to buy it, buy it for the 21 pre-set levels for 0.99 and no more.The lack of in-game music is kind of odd, but i just play my own.

												Jogo muito bacana, estratégia, você tem que desbravar os mares, conquistando e atacando os navios rivais. Olha, é simples pra caramba viu, os desafios são bem feras, :D ! Depende a partida, demora, o que é ótimo. Recomendo !			"

												Age of Booty is a fun little game where you take on the roll of a pirate who has to go do various missions with little back stories. I think it's pretty good fun. Each little mission only takes between 5 - 20 minutes. They also aren't super heavy on the story or action type stuff so setting it down for a few days/weeks and coming back isn't a problem. It's a nice downtime/need to kill a few minutes game. I definitely recommend checking it out if you haven't yet.			"

												This is well worth grabbing, and with a lot of players, it could turn out to be a real free-for-all! Although it's real-time strategy, it's not at a rushed pace... but you've still got to keep your wits about you if you're to come out on top :)			"

												Strategy/action game...again, little gem.Each map doesn't take long to play, but is quite exciting, even the computer controlled allies seem to be not that bad to play with. One of few pirate themed games that I actually enjoyed.Can easily recommend to anyone.			"

												DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME.IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN A GLORIFIED TUTORIAL.The game in it's current state consists of 5, short and simple scenarios - all of which designed to teach you some new mechanic of the game. Isn't even worth 50 cents, as the multiplayer is COMPLETELY DISABLED. There is no way to even play LAN games. IGNORE THIS TITLE!!			"

												Most of the game's functions don't work, it is dependent on services that are out of business.I actually played this back when they were still on-line, almost all the play value was in MP (I didn't do much) or DIY levels (which I did a ton of).For some inane reason, custom levels won't work without the dead MP server.Pretty much complete waste of time.

												I was one of the ones fortunate enough to get the game working.Unfortunately despite playing it on a machine with 12G of Ram and a decent graphics card, this simple game plays at a stunning 5 fps at best.It takes 15 or so seconds to move just one tile rendering the game pointless.			"

												This is a fantastic multiplayer adverserial game and deserves to be repaired, but alas, Capcom is not interested.However there is a LAN fix which will restore the fun to your local LAN.http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/gs_login_server.zipThis link, courtesy of Svond, contains a gamespy emulator and instructions on how to use. Be aware that one of your LAN buddies will need to be ip-network-router savvy to understand the instructions, and the procedure fix it did require some router option settings fiddling.enjoy and goodluck.

												A fun casual experience with simple controls and just enough complexity to keep you busy for hours. You can upgrade your ship and your port cities defenses. There are other 'hero' units on the field that can stir things up as well. This used to offer a multiplayer experience through Gamespy. Sadly, that feature does not work anymore. Do not purchase this for multiplayer locally or over the internet.			"
