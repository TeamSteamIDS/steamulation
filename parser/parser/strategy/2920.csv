												This game I like for how fun it is to blow submarines up and try to be stealthy but I warn you this game is really complex and takes some time just to learn how to tell if something is friend or foe but int he end its always fun to make a flying torpedo hit something so try it at your own risk :).Edit due to its just a short review, long in depth (submarine joke) one below.Sub command is a complex simulation game made by the people who made Dangurous Waters,Fleet Command, and 688(I) Hunter/Killer and when I mean complex I mean complex. Don't get me wrong it is a great game involving tactics, stealth, and a realistic sonar. Now there is a small campain that revolves around the 688(I) sub, the Akula and the Seawolf but I found the side missions better because they offer a wide arrange of diffrent missions and circumstances. Things that people not like about this game is the fact that its hard to read the sonar or how to acually fire a torpedo correctly, but when you acually hit your target it feels so releiving its almost something to celebrate for, though if you hear your coms say torpedo in the water and you see more blips on the sonar you start to get cold and stiff. One final thing is that this game is a precursor to Dangurous Waters so it is best to learn how to use the subarmine here because dangurous waters dosent have a interactive tutorial and you eiter have to be overwhelmed or watch videos the game wants you to watch, so its a good thing to know 6-8 buttons on the screen so you can just figure out the 2 you need. All and all this game is a great game and if you get multiplayer to work its fun freaking out your friends by firing torpedos at them and making it miss by a inch, I would buy this game and give it to a friend if it was like 49 cents or else I would buy this game for me if it was 10 or under (which I have).

												While the graphics are dated, this submarine warfar simulation is the real deal. Game has a lot of depth (pun intended) and there are several different mission types that offer a lot of variety in gameplay.			"

												Sub Command is one of the dying breed of submarine simulations on the PC, where you command one of 3 submarines trying to accomplish various missions against various enemies while trying not to kil civilians. The graphics are not that good, but then in a sub you don't really get to look at the outside. Instead, you are looking at visual representation of sound, how to interpret sonar signals, and when to employ your weapons optimally, from cruise missiles to anti-ship missiles to torpedoes to mines. And this game can be hard, as hours can go by with nothing happening, while you attempt to chase down one bit of sound that may or may not be your illusive quarry... If you have an interest in the genre, this is a must-have, despite its age.			"

												This simulator is confusing at first, and I thought I didn't like it, but then I actually read the manual. RTFM, guys. Once I  did so, the game was fantastic and intense. There are some bugs in the campaign, but it is really good, anyway. I also reccomend Fleet Command. ProRealistic damage and weapons and shipsSensors follow the laws of physics (mostly)The campaign is fun and engaging, even with issuesIt rewards skills, not just spraying torpedoes all aroundFor 1998, graphics are quite good, but really, who cares in a sub simLong missions can be really intense with the threat of sudden death!Finding and classifying enemy subs is really satisfying, and then sneaking up on them....The war is happening all around you, with ships fighting eachother and planes shooting eachother down above you.Con...The map can get really confusing with lots of unknown contacts and the auto crew kinda sucks at figuring it out for you. Do not get this game if you are in to instant action and cant be patientIt helps a lot to have basic understanding of naval warfare. Try fleet command first, or read about it.Dont play this game if you hate having to understand lots of little technicalities (like how your periscope breaks over about 10 mph /knots) "

												I don't think I can add too much more to the other reviews - I thoroughly concur that it has to steep learning curve, remains challenging even after you know what you are doing, and has really high replaybility potential if this kind of game is your type of thing. If, however, you are the kind of person who gets hot and bothered about humorous bugs every once in a blue moon, this game might not be for you. Examples include aircraft flying backward, aircraft flying at impossible altitudes (6.2k feet, or ""flying"" underwater), and NPC submarines suspended in the air. Not that I'm complaining - it makes for quite an interesting screenshots library. Would recommend 12/10 (the extra two points are for the photo ops due to the bugs) - and not being sarcastic.			"

												After playing 688i Hunter/Killer, I was looking forward to the sequel.To summarize:The good:1)  More features than 688i.2)  More controlable subs (Seawolf, 688i, and Akula).3)  Each sub has it's own campaign line that shares the events of the other 2 campaigns.4)  Much better tutorial, though I still don't get the manual TMA system with the dots and the ruler.5)  The Navigation Screen (Map Screen) is much better, as I can classify each target.6)  Classifying a target with sonar is much easier as well, now having a filter.Most annoying glitches:1) Lets start with the big one, this didn't want to run on windows7.  Minimizing it basically crashed it, most of the time it wouldn't start.  I ended up having to run it in windowed mode via -windowed steam parameter and set my screen resolution to 1280x720 16bit 60hz to even view it halfway decently.2) Frequently hit the bottom when trying to ""Hug the Bottom"".  I had to turn auto sonar off as it would constantly change the bearing point that I was trying to classify to other bearing points as it ""automatically searched"".The Bugs:1)  Campaign is almost unplayable from bugs.In campaign mode, I find I have to do the missions 2-3 times each before it properly checks things off.  For example mission 1 for russia, I launch the seal team within 2 miles of checkpoint, didn't register.  The third time I tried it, while sitting on top of the checkpoint, it worked.  The next couple missions same thing, very frustrating.2)  The new 3d overlay is visually nice but when I click on one it blasts the noise the ship would make, way too loud, and I can't control it specifically.  I ended up turning that feature off because of this.Overall:I would say overall this is an ""ok"" sub game with more features than 688i, but it fails hard due to bugs as many games did back in the 90's.  I would much recommend 688i over this one if you've never played either, but it's hard to go back without the new features of this one.			"

												A leftover from a bygone era...when simulators were great.I played 688i for the first time underway onboad USS LaJolla ""many"" years ago, and I have to say Sonalyst did a great job.Sub Command just continued where 688i left off.  To compare the graphics to a more modern game isn't fair as it was created years go.  The game play however is top notch.Absolutely nothing good happens 'quickly' on a submarine.  Attacks take time to prepare, you have to track and identify contacts and it isn't easy.  In the 'real world' you have multiple Sonar Techs and a Sonar Supervisor pouring over multiple displays, you have Fire Control Techs tracking contacts, you have the Officer of the Deck putting the picture together...in the game, you take on all of those roles.If you want to really get an idea of what it's like, turn off every bit of assistance and crank up the difficulty...and grab a cup of the worst coffee humanly possible.  Prepare to take at least 6-8 hours to go through a mission, and now you're almost there.This game (Sub Command) and 688i are always on my PCs, I can't help but play them when I feel 'nostalgic', hour after hour in a control room rigged for red working side by side with some of the best people you'll ever meet.  Once you have the controls down, it really is a great game, and if you do understand ""how to drive a boat"", that knowledge pays off.I honestly can't recommend this game highly enough, and it's as real as you can get and still release it to the general public.

												Got this in a bundle deal with another game, and if I hadn't, I would neither shed tears or lose sleep over it. Might work as a nostalgic trip for someone, for all else I recommend turning a blind eye to this.			"

												Not so much a game as a second job: you can let the auto-crew do much for you but let's face facts: the appeal of this game is how much it demands from you. Want to work out the firing solution for the 89cm ADCAP torpedo manually? Of course you do, this game was written for you.The plotline (nasty Russians go to war with the USA for some reason) is not really developed - I'm halfway through the US campaign - BUT the opportunity to play the campaign from the Russians' perspective is a very welcome, plus you have to re-learn the entire control system, this time using the metric system.Not entirely sure why there are two US boats unless driving a clapped-out piece of junk like the 688i appeals to your inner masochist, but there is much much content for the player who's prepared to do some homework. Bonus: you can start the war early by murdering Russian/US ships and the game just lets you go ahead and do it.7.5/10, would surface through polar ice again			"

												The AI is too un-coordinated regarding ships crew for targeting etc.  On auto crew or manual targeting just seems too hard. FYI I'm a FC2 Fire Controlmen, we launch the missiles and guns on sub/warships.  I'm a CIWS RAM Operator.  I'm a deadly killer and this sucks.   I owned this game back when it first came out, I think I hate this game now.  Go play Silent Hunter Online, free to play.			"

												The graphics are not anything like they are today. It has graphics like minecraft. And the game has no usefull tutorial I could find . If the game did not crash on me every 5 secounds I might consider playing it but it's to unstable for me to finish a single task on any one of the modes.			"

												As an earlier review said, yes I bought this game just to put me on a nostalgia trip. My mom bought me this game from the Goodwill when I was like 13 and had no idea how to play it. To this day I still don't know how to play it, but I REALLY wanted to destroy the oiler in the tutorial mission that I was never able to do when I was younger. And I finally got my long awaited revenge, so now I'll probably never touch this game again becuase it will require you to read the manual for about 6 hours just to understand what the tutorial doesn't tell you. Super complex and not for anyone that likes slow games.			"
