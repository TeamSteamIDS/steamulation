												I am a pretty, pretty princess!  When trying to become Queen I got stabbed, shot, poisoned, burned to a crisp, and rule 34ed Japan style.10 out of 10, would die again.Long Live the Queen is a Visual Novel game that, instead of trying to simply win the hearts of others and fall in love, you try to survive the horrors of royal life with your head intact.  Of course, it doesn't help when everyone is a bloodthirsty murderer who's only desire is to bring forth the death of a fourteen year-old girl.  Seriously, what the hell is wrong with them?You take the role of Princess Elodie, who needs to be trained to be a proper queen because Disney dictates that no princess is allowed to have a living mother.  You end up making all the decisions because your father is a lazy bum who's shirked off all of his responsibilities, but for some reason won't let you have your mother's keepsake.  The kingdom is a mess, everyone is evil, and no matter what you do you just can't seem to save this poor little traumatized girl.The mechanics of the game play on themselves in a bit of a cycle.  You can upgrade Elodie's stats; which can increase slowly or rapidly based on her mood; which is based on events that have happened; which are based on your choices as well as her stats; which are upgraded accordingly based on her mood; which is ba-- ah you get the idea.  This means that every decision, even the first one, can drastically affect how the story unfolds.  No two games are alike, unless you purposefully do everything in the exact same way every time.  But that's boring.Because of the above mentioned do-it-all-the-same concept, you can technically beat the game as many times as you like after you find out how to do it once.  But beating the game is not where this game shines.  Sure, acquiring the crown and becoming Queen Elodie is a grand event in itself; only if you get there (because you will die, and die a lot).  But one of the greatest things about this game is the ability to make different choices every time and see where it leads you.  Find out what is down each path and discover what you can and can't get away with.  And more importantly, unlock all the outfits because they're cute.  Proper wardrobe is the pinnacle detail between ratty princesses and pristine queens.All in all, it is a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone.Wait... you can learn magic?  HELLZ YEAH!			"

												The first time I played this game I died fairly deep into it because I had not properly leveled decorating like a good princess.  It only got better from there.  I tried a perfect princess, died.  I tried a warrior queen, died.  I tried a mix, a little Sansa a little Aria, I died.  By the time I finally won the game I had sunk invading fleets, executed half my family and awoken something evil in the dark and deep, and I was beloved by all those still alive.Simply put the game is amazing and you should get it.

												Despite its girly appearances, the game involves a lot of strategy, and thinking to help the princess live, gain reputation, and overall being a great queen. You make choices that effect the story and various paths to discover and explore (Its possible to complete the game with nothing in combat). However, one event at the end can not be changed no matter what choices you choose which causes the game to be somewhat linear. The music was diverse and amazing in my opinion and helped set the tone of the game depending on the situation. Gameplay could have been better for example more scenes, and backgrounds. If you enjoy visual novels, this is a great game for you. However, I feel the price of the game is a bit too much for the amount of gameplay and would recommend waiting till it goes on sale if you plan on purchasing the game.			"

												This is a game of trial and error, educated guesses, and mood management. If any of those three things sound unappealing to you, you may want to stay away from this game.Have you ever played a visual novel? This game resembles one. Half of the game is background images with text boxes on top of them, and the other half is menus. However, this is not a visual novel. The story is very light in this game, and forgettable. This leaves the gameplay to keep you interested:Your princess has a large number of stats, ranging from singing, decoration and dancing, to swords, polearms and archery. You increase these stats by assigning two classes each day. At the end of a day, you choose from several different activities, which alter your mood.Her mood is important because it directly affects how quickly you increase skills during the daily classes. The ""depression"" mood happens to increase the ""decoration"" skill faster. Increasing skills is everything in this game, because it runs on a set schedule of story events. These happen at the same time and start off exactly the same, but the way your princess reacts to them depends entirely on how you've chosen to raise her skills. This is the mood management I mentioned. You are often asked to choose an action during story segments, and these can alter the story greatly - or instantly kill you.The educated guesses and trial and error come from that, and of the fact that you cannot possibly predict when you will need a particular skill. Your princess will randomly be stabbed, poisoned, etc. and if you don't have the right skill high enough, that's all folks! The fun of this game is from starting a fresh game after each death, and planning how you will raise your princesses' skills this time to accomodate the story event you just died on.If this doesn't sound like something you would enjoy, I would have to advise you to avoid this game, as it is ALL it has to offer. I personally got about ten hours out of it, and I'll probably go back for more someday, but this kind of experience may just not appeal to you.			"

												This game looks super Anime and pretty thin on actual gameplay at first. Then comes the killing.You will die. Somehow or another, you will get your beautiful princess skilled up in Dance or whatever, fail a check, and take an arrow to the chest. Or get killed by poisonous food. Or stabbed by a crazy person.While it's not some fantastic hack-n-slash game, this is a basic text-based, skill-sheck game that is highly addictive. Even after beating it once, you'll want to go through again to try a different way of building up your princess and her skills. It's really a graphical novel with a strangely addictive, violent twist to it. Become a master of espionage or a ruthless, tyrannical queen! Kill, kill, kill!Well worth a look, especially if you can get it on special.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Long Live The Queen is an indie visual novel sporting the anime art style with the choice and decision system of a political intrigue game.You play as Elodie, a 14-year-old princess who is to be crowned Queen of Nova. Play the game of politics where assassinations and threats of death are a daily occurrence. Be a skilled diplomat, a military leader, a powerful sorcerer or a little bit of all in your road to the throne.PROS:+ Art Style: -(This is subjective) Having the anime look will have the ""you either love it or hate it"" effect from people. Some people like it, some people don't. I personally like it.+ Planning Ahead/Consequence System: -This game does require the player to plan in advance by having a massive amount of attributes and skills that can be learned and mastered in a very limited way. Different players will have different skill sets depending on how they play through the game. Thinking ahead is a necessity to stay alive.+ Mood System: -You can only advance your skills through tutoring and schooling, unfortunately however, how well you level up and progress is dependent entirely on your character's mood. (example: Anger = Gives bonus to lessons with regards to Military and Weapon Expertise but has corresponding penalties to Royal Demeanor and Expression.)+ Good Difficulty: -Easy enough to learn but hard to master. I takes at least 2-3 playthroughs to get a general feel of the game but multiple playthroughs are recommended. This game requires experimentation and attention to detail to effectively win.CONS:- Way too short: -I finished this game under 5 hours in my original gameplay (including deaths, and restarts). This game is suffering from the same flaw as I saw on Recettear since the main campaign is just too short. I think the developers could have added more complexity in the game as well as extend the campaign past your coronation period. It would have been nice to continue playing as the ""Queen"" after said coronation.- Events not Random: -Though some events are triggered only by specific skills you possess at that time, all events relating to the main quest are virtually the same. This actually encourages the player to learn from his mistakes and try not to do it the next time around. Note that deaths in this game are instant game overs.- Not as Deep as I thought it would be: -I expected a level of political intrigue including empire management, army management, family and court management, but unfortunately this game only delivers the basics of those.CONCLUSION:GOOD BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE. I personally am satisfied with the game so I'm going to RECOMMEND it. Patience is a very important consideration if you are planning on buying this game. If you're the type who doesn’t want to do a lot of thinking and just want a casual experience, this game is not for you. If you're the type of gamer who likes life-sims, visual novels and enjoy choosing your own adventure, then this is game deserves your attention.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

Note: Don't be fooled by the lack of hours on record as I have played the game offline.You might not believe me if I say this, but if Dark Souls had a visual novel translation, this game won't be far from it. You will die, and die, and die all over again. (unless you cheat and search for walkthroughs/guides, of course)Game DetailsGame play: Basically a story-driven visual novel with multiple paths that often lead to your character's demise. Most of the time, things will be different depending on the choices you make and the parameters you build as the story progresses. This is where the visual novel-feel kicks in. You save, die, maybe replay from the start or from your save, change a few patterns, then die again, think of relying for a guide and feel miserable for spoiling yourself.Graphics: Cutie-ish interface and outright anime-style character designs. Some of the fonts and the menu buttons doesn't feel right to me as I would prefer cleaner, crisper finish, but then again, this game is made to make a cute appeal to its gamers. I mean, have you ever seen a cuter way of interpreting a ""death by tentacle"" scene aside from this?Audio: Serene piano BGMs hit me hard on the spot, and there are tons of them to hear in this game.The VerdictThis is a very well-made visual novel that has the anime style charm and a very deep story that is thoroughly translated through a complex and multi-ended game play.If you are asking if this game is worth its value, my answer is ""Yes, it is worth it"".If you would like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.

The main character was ""my"" princess and I just had to see it through. I thought: ""I'll keep playing until I beat it. Then that's it."" I was wrong. So wrong.I knew there were multiple ways to win and I got curious. I played with stats, seeing the new opportunities they offered. I started to minmax. I HATE minmaxing.

												I received this as a prank gift from my wife. The gift message read ""Sorry, not sorry."" With the biggest troll face, she said I didn't have enough Fantasy RPGs and this one seemed perfect...When I saw the game, with the anime princess in pink... First I was frightened. Then I was curious. And now I am convinced that the joke is on her. This game is actually addictive and has a very dark sense of humor. I still have not been able to get the princess to her coronation ceremony, she's died from poisoned chocolates, an angry rebel with a sword, the same angry rebel with a staff, an arrow to the gut from bandits, etc. I'm probably missing some example deaths, but I could just go check the badges I got each time she died if I really want to be reminded about how all my hard work came crashing down in a hilariously frustrating and unexpected demise.So yes, if anyone is wondering why I have this many hours logged on this game, there you have it. I must achieve coronation!			"

For everyone else, this is one of the best VN you can get for its price on Steam, and is a vast improvement over Magical Diary in every facet.

												Dear Gwenelle, Ha! I mean Duchess of Sudbury! I am actually trying to work on my royal demeanor, I swear, okay? Life is just so crazy! My moods are so erratic lately. Sorry I can’t make it to your party! My reflexes and archery skills are way below 50, Lore is just sooo much more interesting.. and bandits are everywhere. I even had this bad dream about traveling, and even though I’m not 100% sure it was related to your party, I’m going to stay on the safe side. I’m sure you understand, though, right? I’m sure you would prefer receiving presents from your ALIVE friend rather than, well, not. Yeah, okay so I know you *might* not trust me because of that other timeline where I held Lottie hostage… but I had my reasons, okay!? I’m sure you know how it feels when everyone is judging you and you’re just like ah, how am I supposed to feel -Pressured?!It’s hard being our age and in charge of so much stuff. But hey, at least I sided with you when I *did* go to your party that other time! Do you have timelines or are you just.. like.. stuck? That would suck. OMG, I hope you have more than one outfit! O_OAnother reason I hate not being able to go to your party this time (because every time feels fresh, okay? my room is always just the way I left it..)  is because I really wanted to pick up Briony!! All of her letters were annoying at first but we’re lovers in another timeline. Isn’t that sweet?!? So I figured I could get some early action. ^_^  Nothing with a squid, though! I told you about that poem, right? Sometimes I thought was hilarious, sometimes I just got angry about it.. have you gotten anything like that? Just wondering…I might be +Lonely about not being able to go to your party, but you should be +Cheerful about the presents I sent you! Don’t worry, they’re not chocolates. I would have sent you some apples from my garden—they’re so delicious they’re known to be stolen!—but I would hate to send you—my friend, a duchess—an apple beaten-up by travel. So when the roads are safer you can just come here and we can have all the delicious apples we want, and even play with toys just like old times!  Ps xf dbo krtu pru. ^_^Oh, and to answer your question, I have no idea why my dad doesn’t have a top lip. Like, sure, keeping a stiff upper lip is sound advice. But he just doesn’t have one in the first place! Your friend,Elodie P.S. My handwriting is worse than Adair’s, but who cares?! I funded the printing press!			"

<UPDATED 1/23/2014 - I got a bit passionate in my original review. In fairness to Hanako's hard work, I've made some updates to be more objective and offer better context.>As someone who loves both deep strategy games and the cutesy anime aesthetic, I was super excited after seeing the trailer for LLTQ. This game has SO much potential to be great, and for the first few hours it was.The Good:-Love the art and music-The process of fiddling with your skills and moods and such is initially pretty fun-I love the flavor text that accompanies all your class activities. It's really immersive going through the ""process"" of learning skills in that level of detail.-Skill checks allow for lots of ""little victories"" that feel good, and the game makes it clear when you benefit from having the right skill. Elodie gets to have a lot of cool moments if you picked certain skills ""correctly"".The Bad:-It's difficult to figure out what ""mood"" I need to be in to get the right bonuses for the skills I want. UI could've been a lot better in this respect.-Despite the wonderful buffet of choices offered in the UI, the game's strategy is actually very shallow. Most of these choices only affect optional story events and have no tangible impact on whether or not you win. Depending on your dialogue choices, it's possible to win with only 2 of the game's 42 skills leveled up.-Because of the lack of meaningful skill choices, players who are interested in working out different strategies to win may quickly find themselves bored.-The entire sequence of events happens on a fixed timeline, and unless you opt in to certain risks (whose rewards only affect your epilogue, and not your goal of surviving), you won't see much variation between playthroughs.Did I mention a huge number of the skills are useless? What's that? You leveled up Horse Riding? Too bad, there's only one (optional) event in the entire game where it does anything. There's actually a discussion thread on the LLTQ community where people are debating which skill is the most useless, and there are many strong candidates to choose from...Conclusion:As a strategy enthusiast, I'm disappointed with how this game turned out. The trailer makes it sound like there are numerous paths to victory, but that's based mainly on narrative choices and has little to do with your skills. I geeked out like crazy when I first saw the skill list, thinking of all the different ways I could play and the hours I could spend delving into strategy. Securing victory through trade, warfare, treachery, magic... But most of the skills are only useful for unlocking fluffy side story events. If you're a completionist who's really into tracking down all those little events and collecting the achievements, it'll probably work for you, but sadly it did not work for me.It's a shame. There's so much I liked about this game. Hanako is quite talented and clearly put a lot of work into the game's strategy elements. I feel like if they'd spent a bit more time fleshing out those choices and making them meaningful, it would have been a hit for me. Maybe next time? =/			"

												Long Live The Queen was a surprise for me. I didn't expect to enjoy it but in the end, I had a lot of genuine fun playing. The main mechanics in the game use moods to learn different school subjects. You pick two classes each week to take, each class raises your skill in the subject your picked. The events which you run into throughout the game (you get one event each week) are all virtually the same, but the outcome of each event depends on how you react and what classes you have been taking. There are no fancy visual effects of musical scores apart from the over played British national anthem, the character designs are very pretty, even if they are a little cringey at times for a young girl to be wearing those outfits (anime eh). There is plenty of replayability in Long Live The Queen, I have done a number of different scenarios and runs and I have put almost seven hours into it, each time ending differently. I would totally recommend this game to anyone, even if you aren't a fan of anime (like me); the price is £6, 99 which for a game like this, is worth it. If you get it on sale, you have yourself a bargain. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Long Live the Queen, Or, ""The game that would had happened if George RR Martin was an anime fan"" or ""that one game where you must teach your princess common sense or else she wll die of food poisoning"".The plot is simple, you play as either an advisor to the princess or the princess herself, her mother just died and its apperent that she left a power vaccum in the land of the living. Elodie, the princess, in a simplified take on how royalty works is next in line for the then, but there's the catch, she's almost a year too young to take the crown.The task here is to teach ehr the skills she needs to becoem a proper queen which includes such things as Animal Training, Art, Dance, Song, Running, Sports, Gymastics, Medicine, Espionage and Magic. Yes, Magic.Along the way you must protect her form assassins, chocolates, psyco relatives, a commoner revolution, chocolates, a civil war, a forest that would make the Everfree pale in comparison, chocolates, sorcerers, chocolates, a sea monster and chocolate. Failure to do so will be a Game Over and will treat you to a humourous chibi carcature of the associated death. Her mood and wardrobe will determine how much knowedge she gets in a skill so any sudden mood swings will throw off your curriculumThe trick here is to know what skill are needed to avoid certain doom or pass checks needed to help her earn the crown. You will die a lot, you will save a lot and you will reload saves when you inevitably die a lot, primarely to chocolates, arrows, psycotic relatives, chocolate and the odd tentacle.I'd give it a 10/5. If you like Visual Novels, Game of Thrones, A Song of Ice and Fire, Princess Maker or Chocolate then I do recomend playing this game.PS. Beware the chocolate			"

												My ultra-paranoid warlord princess had the keen military intellect of all of history's greatest generals combined, and could likely have waged war on Asgard itself and won. She declared war on every nation that existed and had a man executed for daring to suggest a peaceful reunion between their nations. Her skill with the sword was unsurpassed, and not a single foreign royal could even bat an eyelid without her knowing of it, and having five separate plans to make them pay. Bards sang songs of her conquests, children feared her, the mere whisper of her name could send battle-hardened soldiers crying home.And then she ate poisoned chocolates, and died.			"

Pros:+Several possible endings and events, requiring multiple playthroughs+You're a princess+Eat chocolate and die+Make the servant eat the chocolate and die+Complete, skillful voice acting+In depth branching story+Supported cheats for when you're tired of getting too close to swords.+Casual, easy-to-learn gameplay++No bugs, crashes, immersion breaking glitches, etc.Cons:-You die.  A lot.  Or at least I do.-Plays a bit like a well-developed flash game.+To be fair, it is an exceptionally well developed flash game.Overall:Yes, it's a glorified flash game.  Yes, the gameplay is simplistic.  But the storyline is actually very intriguing once you get into it.  There are achievements for creative ways to die.  It's just... fun.  It's not particularly hard, nor is it just easy.  But I really enjoyed this game, which is more than I can say of some others.  I think it's definitely worth the buy.Bottom Line: There's really only one standard I use to buy games: Is it fun?  The answer to this is definitely ""yes"" for Long Live The Queen.			"

												Okay, listen.I bought this game on sale for a lark.  I mean, who wouldn't want to spend a few dollars playing a classic princess trainer where your main goal is not getting assassinated?  I did not anticipate how in-depth this game actually was.  I felt like all of my choices were important, but no single one was the cause of my demise.  Eventually I became more invested than anticipated.  Soon, I WAS Elodie and she was me and we were a terrifying force to reckon with.  I am a benevolent princess who will show mercy to misguided subjects, but I am no fool.  If you do not take kindly to my mercy, you shall fear the hellfire I control at my magical-girl fingertips.  If you will not bow in respect, then you shall quake in fear.  Sadly my magic was not strong enough to defeat an entire navy....this time.Bonus suggestion:Try getting a group of friends together and playing in ""democracy mode.""  Everyone has to debate and vote on all decisions in Elodie's upbringing.  Then, when no one listens to you, blame them for the princesses death!  Family fun for all!			"

												I came to this game via the Humble Bundle and I figured it couldn't hurt to try it out as a free accompaniment to that game with the plethora of potential pigeon partnerships. I was expecting a cute little time-sink that I probably wouldn't play more than twice. The art style seemed simplistic and reminiscent of Magical Girl anime, and so I figured the gameplay would mirror that light-hearted lack of depth and character. How wrong I was.. I can't really put it better than RockPaperShotgun did in describing this game as ""a Sansa Stark simulator"" (you can read the remainder of their brilliant and detailed review here - http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/10/long-live-the-queen-review/ ). Rather than a game of frills and frippery, I was suddenly plunged into a very maturely crafted world of political espionage, assassination, murder, magic, torture, civil war and straight-up cruelty that I never would have expected. The game starts you off gently by introducing your newly christened Crown Princess to a host of potential suitors and courtly situations in a genial and cartoonish manner that only serves to further highlight the harsh realities that quickly become apparent, as your new Queen-to-be moves from a childish attempt to control her situation into very real dangers and political turmoil where survival is almost out of reach.. all while still struggling to act like the respectable monarch she has in no way been tutored to resemble. What's more, the various methods of near-certain death are flawlessly executed (pun certainly intended) to the point where the game even has a special gallery and achievement list devoted to your multiple royal demises. Should you actually manage to survive beyond the first couple of months in power, the dangers arrayed against you grow oppressively dark and encroach with ever-greater speed, even as you begin to unlock secrets and hidden power in a desperate attempt to meet them. Ware, lest you become a monster yourself in the process. But of course there's an achievement for that as well. Highly recommended, and at full price.			"

												Waw, what a great game.You play as a princess waiting for her coronation. Soon she will become the Queen but up until then you must survive. The first step to survival is to teach her the right things in her daily classes - one morning, one evening. There's a multitude of subjects, each one changing event outcomes or consequences of choices you make. You could choose to learn how to be an elegant princess, and learn how to make public speeches to put on a great speech or maybe learn more about battlefield medicine, incase you come into a spot of trouble. You'll come across different events that each have different outcomes depending on what your princess knows.Each time you lose (ie. failing to survive), you know what to expect but might not still know the right path to take. You could choose to flawlessly succeed in one event, but maybe fail another because you didn't put enough time into learning about it. Victory comes from a bit of luck and a bit of skill through making the right decision(s). Each weekend you choose what to do, changing her mood.The game is a text adventure, and the art to accompany it looks great. My inner anime side wanted me to get this game, and although it got beaten by 'Super Hexagon' (from 60p to 20p) in the 2013 Christmas Sale, I still got gifted bought the game. Additionally, you can get outfits for your princess, each one giving her bonuses in a certain subject. Overall, the game looks really good - a very 'cute' style with a great colour palette, and definitely catching the mood of the princess at all times. definitely a soft experience for your eyes to accompany the gameplay. The music is great too, with very fitting themes for all the events, most of them done beautifully on piano, meaning a great time for your eyes and ears!I love this game. It looks great, sounds great and plays great. Each time you lose, you come back prepared, but still unsure of how to go about it on the next playthrough. Overall, a great game at a great price too (but maybe wait for it to be on sale!).Thanks for reading!			"

												Long Live the Queen is fun in a way. I'm not giving it a negative review because it isn't... and I'm sure it appeals to the people who like putting cute girls in different uniforms, but Long Live The Queen's gameplay is pure, sheer trial-and-error. You spend your days in the castle, developing skills and learning how to be a good queen. Of course, Elodie can't be good at everything, so you have to pick which skills to develop and which to leave alone. This is all nice in itself, if it weren't for the fact that the game keeps killing Elodie in more and more contrived ways, and every time this happens, it's because the player didn't develop some kind of obscure skill enough. Which means you have to - and this is no exaggeration - play a few weeks until you die, then load your save again and gear all your skill points toward preventing that death. You need to do this every time. What's the point of playing a game if I have to die over and over again and can only prevent it by save-scumming and using foreknowledge?Decided to train Elodie to work with falcons rather than dogs? Too bad, because for some reason a high Dogs skill is all that can prevent you from being poisoned. It gets worse. You get challenged to a duel, and since you've got a good lot of skill points in swords, you confidently accept - only to see Elodie getting run through because whoops, the game decides to test against Athletics instead! I went to assist my troops to fight a naval battle, but did you think the game would check my (almost-maxed) Naval Strategy skill? Nope. Instead, it tests against Climbing and Meditation. Naval Strategy isn't even checked once. It does check against swimming, but haha, did you think being decent at it was enough? Nope, sleepy time with the fishes for you! Get challenged to a duel? You die because your Composure wasn't high enough and you, for some reason, decide to charge the inhumanly powerful mage that just obliterated your father.Yeah, Hanako Games, I know replayability is a good thing, but try doing it in less cheap and lazy ways next time. A game like Vlad the Impaler, which gives you choices in crisis scenarios and then tests against your stats, does it right. Your game, which railroads crisis situations and then decided to test against a single skill, does not.			"

The game seems simple enough from the first glance, but it's misconception. Long Live the Queen has so much depth, it's royally amazing! The more choices we make, the more story branches. Some paths are straightforward and logical, some are complicated and complex, some lead to glory, some to evil, some to most horrible death in cute made creepy way, but discovering any one of them is fun.

												Being queen isn't all it's cracked up to be. For all the fame, fortune, and limitless invitations to balls, there are assassination attempts to fight off, rebelling commoners, war barking at the boarders, and an endless stream of plots to steal your crown. All of this and more is what awaits Elodie, the queen to be, as the impromptu death of her mother accelerates her path to the monarchy in Long Live the Queen, a game that is anything but what it appears.The most important thing to know about LLtQ is that it isn't a girly diversion devoid of strategy and intended solely for would be princesses to live out their fantasies. On the contrary it is an absolutely brutal challenge of wits! Your time is split between taking classes and dealing with the day-to-day events that befall a queen, both of which are intimately woven together and require a keen knowledge to predict the outcome of the choices you make.As you progress through the game you shape Eldodie into a princess of your choosing by way of the various skills you aquire by taking classes. You can only learn so much before push comes to shove and you need to put your skills into action, and finding the balance in it all is where the strategy really comes into play. By manipulating your mood you can gain bonuses to different skills, boosting the amount of skill points you earn in a session, which further adds another layer you need to pay attention to in order to succeed (or even survive).It is all but a certainty that you will die many, many times before you make it to your coronation, however death in LLtQ isn't a gameover but just taking a wrong path at one point, and is intended to be a learning experience above all else. Because events typically unfold in a similar way each time, your main goal is to pick and choose which skills to upgrade in a timely manner in order to succeed and push onto the next plot point. Should you fail you can reload a save and try again with new tactics, or start over from scratch and plan your path in a whole different direction.The freedom coupled with the inherent linearity is an odd combo but what I love so much about the game. It doesn't change so much that you can't easily plan for future events, but allows a lot of variation for different outcomes which gives a lot of replay value for those so inclined as to seek out the different endings. It is also my biggest complaint about the game however, as for all its freedom it does a poor job telling you how to use it and leaves you floundering in the dark trying to find the perfect combo. Getting a ""good"" ending and seeing Elodie crowned is far harder to do than you would likely expect, and repeatedly dying with only vague mentions of what you did wrong and how to change it can be very disheartening and will likely put many off early on as they are still trying to work out how everything fits. I'm all for letting the player find the answers for themselves, but a bit more guidance would have been much appreciated for all the times I failed in ways that seemed no fault of my own.But even with the bothersome lack of direction LLtQ is still an extremely addictive and original game, one that immediately sucked me in and kept me hook for hours at a time. It would be easy to get the wrong idea of the game from the screenshots, but I imagine many would be pleasantly surprised if they gave it a chance. The music is lovely and the artwork very nice, with a clean cut design and humorous, engaging writing that makes it hard not to fall in love with Elodie and the other characters around her. I have never played a game quite like Long Live the Queen, and hope to see more original titles like this popping up on Steam soon. If you are even the slightest bit interested don't turn away after the first impression, it has a lot more depth than I think anyone would expect, and is a wholly refreshing and enjoyable experience that most any should enjoy whether they have ever dreamed of being the prettiest princess or not!You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

Posted: December 31, 2016
												TL;DR: a lovely game I find difficult to recommend.In a nutshell, Long Live the Queen is a visual novel style, stat min-maxing, groundhog day simulator (or would it be a groundhog year simulator?). You play as princess-queen Elodie, crowned dangerously young after her mother's death, who has to run her kingdom by picking from a handful of choices each week. Her choices and outcomes come from passing skill checks, and are otherwise based on what Elodie learned and chose previously. Things start to become complicated at this point -- all her choices are basically intertwined. Choices affect Elodie's mood, which affects how quickly she studies different subjects. Typically, Elodie and her kingdom end up hosed, so you're going to be restarting a lot. It's a compelling game that keeps you doggedly restarting to see if, this time, you can secure Elodie her throne and unravel the conspiracies and mysteries surrounding her. However, I feel it has deep flaws in its gameplay loop.At face value, the game's core goal is to spend Elodie's time efficiently to level up the right skills to survive an onslaught of skill checks, but that summary's not quite there yet. Each playthrough lasts a brief 40 turns / weeks, there are plenty of ways to get offed, and it's almost impossible to have enough skill points to pass every skill check, so you have to choose a small handful of skills. For example, there are over five different skills that Elodie uses to gain information about her surroundings, and since relatively high skill checks come in play during the first half of the game, I don't think you can figure out all the intrigue in a single playthrough, let alone do it and get a happy ending. This game requires multiple playthroughs to find a way to the end naturally, and even more playthroughs to learn everything or get your desired ending. A better explanation of core of the game would be to, over multiple playthroughs, build up one of several optimized solutions to the skill check puzzles of the game. But that's not quite right either.It's not right because it doesn't capture how many little tidbits of information you have to tease out of the game. Really, this game is about learning which skill checks are important to survival (and your desired ending), how high the skill checks are, and which skill checks and mood changes will come in the future from taking certain actions. If you're going for your desired ending, it's also about figuring out the hidden stats, like Lumen approval, Cruelty, how many soldiers you have and how much money you have. Figuring out all of this information without going to the wiki is a trial-and-error nightmare, which is where my complaints start to come in:- It's Groundhog year, but the game won't remember anything for you: The game doesn't organize information from previous runs for the player, and it's not easy to remember. (I'm not expecting Elodie to know things just because she knew them on a previous playthrough). There's no map of the surrounding territories. There are no family trees. Minor characters often don't have pictures. Dialogue choices don't show what mood changes will result. For instance, I remember that visiting Charlotte in week 1 will cheer me up, but I can't remember what visiting dad will do. Even though I've done it before, the game wont show me. I wish it would -- I need some way to remind myself of what's going on, since it's so easy to forget little details from ten minutes ago while juggling stat management and new lore. I'd rather not transcribe things like ""In the year 950, king whatzisface slayed baron hoozdat over the death of his son datboi"" over and over again, or things like ""week 1: speaking to king makes Elodie sad"". The game pushes me to rely on the wiki.- Figuring out flags, checks, and hidden stats is hard: This is a similar complaint, but focused on the stats side. Firstly, even though the game does make savescumming a little easy by allowing tons of saves, it's still kind of awkward. I think the auto saves allow you to rewind back to any day, but they're not labelled at all. Secondly, while the game tries to show you what's causing events to happen showing you when you encounter skill checks, the game doesn't show you how high the checks are (and they're not at even multiples of 25, so it's not easy to guess). Thirdly, although the game is willing to show you when it checks for skills, it won't show you when it checks for flags. Fourthly, If you don't have an option, it won't be greyed out -- it'll be missing. Fifthly, there are hidden stats in the game which important for the ending, such as nobility approval. All of these five combine to make figuring out how to get endings brutal, since I'd essentially have to make a few runs dedicated to figuring out each stat check. Of course, I could always just rely on the wiki.Don't get me wrong -- I love games where I feel a compulsion to map things out, write things down, and unravel mysteries. But this game is too frustrating and keeps pushing me to the wiki. I'm basically being given a choice between three options:A): flail around in the darkness without really thinking things throughB): run through the game a million times to know for certain what the numbers behind the game actually areC): look at the wiki and work from thereC is basically the most sane option. But I don't want to look at the wiki. The wiki is disorganized, it's full of spoilers, and reading it makes me feel like I'm cheating. On top of that, I'm a firm believer in games being enjoyable, challenging, and masterable without the need for guides on principle.			"

												Before considering buying this game, you first have to realize it's more of a Choose Your Own Adventure book with stat checks.  If you're still interested, read on. Long Live the Queen is held together by several things: the amusing/tragic story and dialogue and the replay value of discovering more of it. The sequence of events will never change, but what actually transpires (and if Elodie survives to eventually be crowned) are dependent on what choices you make and how you build her up. Ignoring a single skill in one playthrough could have a huge influence on the story, and since you can't max her out, you'll want to come back several times. I loved Choose Your Own Adventure books as a kid, and for the five bucks I paid, I had a lot of fun with the story and trying different things. I think the only thing I rolled my eyes at was the anime ""magical girl"" outfit, but that's a small gripe. Get it on sale and it'll be well worth it.			"

This makes for a very fun game to play, since what you do actually matters.I should however not forget to mention that there are many ways to die in the game, some more hilarious that the others, while some even make you sad or surprised. This is very crucial, since if you will play this game, death is inevitable*.* if you did not die even once, you did either:1. hack 2. use a walkthrough 3. are blessed by the heavens and should go to a casinoBut seriously a great game9.5/10			"

												This is not an anime game. This is something like Game of Thrones made to look harmless and lighthearted. It's not. If you don't play your cards right, someone you like dies in the first few weeks of play. This is some serious stuff. At first, you obsess over simply making it to coronation. Once that's done, you want to go back and maybe win the way you want, boosting the skills you like to see where that path takes you--probably to your death, in all honesty, but it's great fun.Pros:-Interesting world-ooboodles of skills and customized play paths-ridiculously high replayability-funny scenes-interesting/infuriating mood mechanics-great satisfaction with endgame-interesting charactersCons:-difficult (but I'm a pushover)-...difficult?Great game.

												Princess Simulation Simulator 2014 is hands down the best game I have ever played in my hundreds of thousands of eons of life on this earth. It is a complex look into the life of a young princess, caught up in a political maelstrom which only YOU can guide her through. You will need to think realistically about the life of a princess, and the skills she will need to succeed in the political world, while also balancing her mood. You should be wary of all manner of things, ranging from assassination attempts, to social or political faux-pas', both of which can cut short your political career. The protagonist has a likeable personality, (for a fourteen year old) and a myriad of different outfits to choose from, each of which give specific boosts to a certain field of skills. The addition of these outfits make the protagonist feel like a real person, as real people also change their clothes to suit their vocations.On a socio-political level, Princess Simulation Simulator 2014 could drastically improve the quality of life for any aspiring politician, or even just as a human being. The skill descriptions provide real world advice on how to improve, and generally are very helpful. I would recommend this game to any person who is the heir or heiress to a large fortune or amount of political power, as it is a very realistic look at the various challenges you might face. Furthermore, anyone looking to expand their wardrobe or fashion sense should play this game, as the outfits that the protagonist changes between are a breath of fresh air, and would surely go over well in any social gathering.I rate this game a total of seven stars out of seven, with an additional nine ghost points, to boot! The gameplay is fast paced and exciting, with never a dull moment to be seen. The dialogue is stellar, and I must emphasize that each of the writers of this game should be given the Nobel Peace Prize for their amazing work. However, the game misses out on the elusive tenth ghost point because I do not wish to appear to have been bought out by the developers of the game in order to give it a perfect review.			"

												I enjoyed this game during my first playthrough, it's a bit trial and error but it took me only four attempts, or less than two hours to ""finish"" the game (surviving 40 weeks to be crowned). My first reaction was : ""Was that it ?"" then I checked the wikia, and no it isn't at all. There are quite a few events that can add some unsuspected plot points, but their requirements are ridiculously arbitrary - in one of them, you'll only survive if your ""Decoration"" skill is high enough. I'm not making that up. And as Chiquihuite said, some skills that should logically be useful and even vital like horse riding are never used.Overall, the skill requirements for each situation (Do you know who this man is ? Can you intimidate/flatter him ? Can you climb this wall ? Can you play harp ? Can you notice this food is poisoned ? Can you lead a war ship ?) are so high, and the learning sessions so few that you have to choose what skills to max and miss 80% of the rest. You want to become a magic expert ? You'll get betrayed by nobles because you don't have any time to learn Court Manners and Internal Affairs. You try to learn both anyway ? Then you'll die because you didn't upgrade the running/reflexes/poison knowledge that would have allowed you to survive that assassination attempt. The ""basic"" way to play (survive 40 days) isn't really interesting after the first success, and exploring all paths is impossible unless you follow a detailed walkthrough and manage your skills on an Excel graph to not put a single one unused. Neither of these is fun for me, so I can't recommand this game.			"

												Do NOT be fooled thinking this is a princess simulator trying to get handsome men to marry you. The game is dark and depressing, and it's good... REALLY good. Everything is out to kill you, and most of the time, only you and your decision can save your life. This is a quick pros and cons I'm gonna do since I'm in class and won't be able to pull a full review:+Well written plot and character interaction that can immerse you.+Everything is out to kill you. The game is completely unpredictable.+ You can be a loli hitler or a magical girl or a swordmaster queen. Whatever works!+ Be a scum: Create scandal, assassinate people, lie your way through!+ Be the ultimate pacifist: Deus Ex Human Revolution no killing playthrough too easy for you? Try surviving this game without killing anyone!+A LOT of attributes to level up ranging from riding a horse, archery, internal affairs, controlling your anger, casting fireball, how to dress up... Damn, just about everything.+Be as stupid as ""Hospital? Why would you want to put sick people together? They'll die faster!"" to as smart as managing your not-so-big but vicious little army to conquer the world!+SO MUCH MORE- The game is difficult. No seriously, try to get a decent ending without dying at least three times. It's to the point where you will think the game is cheaping you out, but that makes completing it even more fun!-The art could use some work.-Music can get tediously repetitive sometimes.-Unpredictability seems unfair sometimes. (The wizard battle *cough*)-Surprisingly short if you know the game inside out.Overall, this game left me with a huge smile on my face when I finished it. "

												As the very first visual novel I've ever played, my bar of expectations for VN's has been set extremely high. Long Live the Queen goes beyond the literal name of ""visual novel"", where you click furiously through pages and pages of text. It is a fully interactive experience where your choices actullay affect the outcome of the game! I know, seems pretty mindblowing after Telltale made a formula on how to fake your way through that and still makes piles of money everytime, but you will encounter no smoke or mirrors in this gem. In Long Live the Queen, you guide a young princess on her path to queenhood before she comes of age on her 15th birthday. You must manage and raise her skills so she can handle the various problems that come her way. If you don't get the right skills to a high enough level, the princess will die. (little hint: Reflexes is an absolute must for the very beginning of the game) And there are so many skills to level up! This VN is perfectly designed to make you feel like a young teenager in over their head with daunting responsiblities, sometimes forcing you to make what some may consider ""Evil"" paths just to survive. Thats not including the hidden values that may or may not affect the chances of assassination attempts on your princess; commoner approval and noble approval. Certain dialogue options and choices will change how your commoners and nobles think of you, and if one side or the other thinks too negatively of you, expect a lot more unpleasent surprises in the weeks to come.And if you manage to keep the princess alive, you will discover multiple branching paths that will drastically change your experience. I never got the right skills to unlock it, but I heard the scenes in the Enchanted Forest are really intriguing.The other characters are very interesting too. I was just as invested in keeping my allies safe as my princess, and intrigued in learning what made my enemies tick.Overall, this is an outstanding experience that proves that ""illusion of choice"" is not a necessary evil in every case. Even if you don't like anime art styles or stragety, I encourage you to pick this up at some point. Everyone can get something out of Long Live The Queen.			"

YouTube™ Video: Long Live the Queen Review 

			Views: 386		

			We take a look at the death filled visual novel Long Live the Queen. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

Everyone and everything is out to get you in Long Live the Queen. You play through this gorgeous visual novel as a young 14 year old princess whose mother has just recently passed away and you are thrust into tending to the everyday matters of running a kingdom. From going to parades, giving public speeches, being the judge jury and executioner in court cases, leading your nation to war or diplomatically resolving your international disputes. But such a young girl can’t just jump right in and successfully run a kingdom; she needs to be properly trained. The game plays out on a week to week basis where you start off by choosing 2 school classes you would like to take to train your queenly skills, and with 42 different skills to level up there is plenty of depth and variables to take into account that makes each choice feel meaningful, If you just choose willy-nilly without putting thought into what to level up you will definitely wind up just like your mother. The skills are either negatively or positively affected by your princesses’ current mood, for example if you are overly willful you may earn bonus points for taking a course in naval strategy or internal affairs whereas if you were in a yielding mood you would have a penalty for naval strategy or internal affairs. After monitoring your mood, and assessing which classes you want to take, and you’re skill points are distributed, you are then put into a dialogue scene where you are presented with various dialogue trees, events, and scenarios that either get passed or failed depending on whether or not you have trained enough in a certain skill, an example of this may be perhaps you are out in the courtyard and a snake crosses your path and strikes at you, if you have reached a high enough level in the “Reflexes” skill you will be able to react quick enough to avoid the attack and escape death. More often than not a crucial fail will result in your death, and that is where the game gets addicting, you keep wanting to go back and try to figure out what you did wrong and what you could have done differently to avoid your demise (most likely just to discover another way to die). The game is the equivalent of the anime version of Bill Murrays Groundhogs day, you’ll just keep reliving the same things over and over until you get it right, and quite frankly that style of game isn’t for everyone, it may become too repetitive for your liking or you may feel that you were cheated the way you died and you may become too frustrated to keep playing, but odds are that you’ll be back to try to live the 40 weeks to reach your coronation day and become queen. The game offers plenty of interesting dialogue and has a beautiful art style; the art style paired with the brilliant piano sound track is truly an aesthetically pleasing combination.  The dark nature of the game is an overall exciting adventure experience and the high quality of both the visuals and especially the audio complement the game very well. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/ "

												Reminiscent of text based games from long ago, Long Live the Queen is a very entertaining strategy game.You control the heir to the throne before coming of age and game-play consists of choosing which skills to develop before your coronation next year.  Many different events will happen as time progresses and depending on what skills you chose to focus on, you will either open up new story paths or in some cases even end up dead.  There are many different ways to die, some very unexpected.Replay value comes from going back and trying to see the different endings (or the different ways to die – yep, I’m still working on that achievement), or even the different story options.  You can save any time you want and the game also includes an auto-save so  you can go back some to try different strategies.  Many times though you will want to start over again fresh, picking different skills just to see what happens. If you prefer action based or shooter type games, look elsewhere.  If you like anime style artwork and unforgiving strategy you will not be disappointed.			"

												Yikes.  This game just goes to show how unfit a queen I would be if the role were forced upon me.  Cutthroat politics, aristocratic relationships, exciting celebrations, brutal war, and even magic come into play when you're on the road to queendom.This game plays sort of like a visual novel.  Playing as princess Elodie, you take weekly ""classes"" that improve her various skills, such as court manners, public speaking, dance, swordsmanship, falcon handling, history, internal affairs, divination, and more.  Elodie also has a mood meter of 4 attributes: angry/fearful, cheerful/depressed, willful/yielding, and pressured/lonely.  Depending on what her mood is for each skill category you potentially increase can be affected by a bonus/penalty that influences the rate of learning for that particular skillset.  Each skill you improve will ultimately decide Elodie's fate- there is a failure/partial success/success rating that ensues when an event occurs and depending on what you get, the outcome of the game will be based on these failures or successes.  Be warned!  You *will* die at least once in this game, but don't worry- you can start over from an earlier time or from the beginning, ensuring you have the right knowledge/skills to get through a major event.You also get the opportunity to dress the princess up in various outfits when you improve categorized skills to a certain extent.  Examples include a tutu, catsuit, military regalia, and even magical girl.  Totally adorbs.Music's decent.  It is fitting for the subject matter.In short:Story: 4/5Music: 3.5/5Replayability: yes/5Art: Anything on steam is infinitely better than what I can draw/5PS: Usually if I write > 1 sentence for a recommendation that means I *highly* recommend the game.  So what on earth are you waiting for?  Play it!			"

												I don't know why I haven't written a review for this game yet, so I'm going to now.I was given this game as a gift, because I would never have bought it for myself, based on the store page copy. I was wrong. It is well worth it, even if you have to pay full price; I fully intend on buying a copy to give to someone else as a gift when I can afford it.I'm particularly impressed by the quality of the writing, in every sense. No matter what path you play, it's a compelling narrative, and the writing mechanics are solid as well. I've seen far too many text-based games full of terrifyingly bad punctuation, grammar, spelling, and diction. Long Live the Queen is a paragon of language use, and not just in comparison to the too-common disasters out there. I wish half the books I read were as well-written as this.If you haven't bought this game yet, you should.			"

												Raise those damn taxes. Those peasants have it too good anyway. Maybe I should invest in hospitals for the poor, but I could also play with my teddybear, go to birthday parties (even if they tried to shoot me with an arrow at the last one) and boost religious propaganda. Father wants me to stay away from that crystal in the treasury, but my magical advisor says I need it, even if people have to die for it. The other nobles seem to have planned something behind my back. I feel a storm coming. Or maybe it's just the chocolate I ate (Spoiler Alert: It was poisoned). If that maid stares at me again, off with her head.The next best thing to a Sansa Stark life simulator / VN mix.			"

												I bought this game because it was touted as a deep strategic excercise with an amusing art design that conflicited with morbid deaths and serious yet silly tone.What this turned out to be is a basic role playing game with strategy essentially being very simple. After a few playthroughs you will know what to expect from the game and I essentially won the game through very basic trail and error. The game just became a chore in the end and I really regret buying it. Playing a flash game of new grounds.com (new grounds.com is one word, but its getting censored for some reason) will give you a better gaming experience with deeper strategy in some cases.A more detailed review can be found here on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/02/long-live-queen.html.

												I was going to be a kind, just, and fair queen, beloved by all my people... but then I clumsily took an arrow to the knee.I was going to be a cruel, merciless, magical, iron-fisted despot putting the insects in their place. Then I ate the poisoned chocolate because I lacked the manners to resist it.10/10     Would attempt (and probably fail) to keep myself and my nation alive again.The game does its best to kill you in many creative and entertaining ways. After a few playthroughs, it's not too difficult to discover a way to muscle, preen, spellcast or some-comibation-of-the-three your way to victory. However, the game isn't linear- there are multiple paths to victory, and many different subplots to explore which will require different approaches to fully investigate. Your choices will have an impact on later events, and you can't see the whole game in one playthrough.Unrelated to gameplay: the soundtrack is wonderful.			"

Magical Girl HellFirst and foremost, SAVE OFTEN. I recommend creating multiple saves at different points of the game while you're successful because you will die. Long Live The Queen is a visual novel of sorts with an interesting concept. You're Elodie, a princess learning to be queen. You gotta start from scratch and take two classes a week to improve skills. Sounds good but the ""strategy"" required in this game is a little bit shallow.Mood, no matter how good or bad, influences how effective Elodie will be at learning a skill. I thought that, because there was a Mood meter, you wanted to get her to the top of each emotion (ex: Cheerful vs Depressed) so that she could function at full capacity. However, no matter how negative or positive the mood is, one will benefit Elodie in learning certain skills that the other mood won't allow improvement for. Everything you pick has a ripple effect.Doesn't sound so bad, yeah? What makes this a ridiculous mechanic is that there's no way of predicting what mood will affect skills you might need for upcoming events unless you look up a guide. Every action has consequences; you have to try to control every aspect and memorize events that are going to happen as they occur if you want Elodie to live. There aren't any tells and the events are always the same every gameplay so that helps in anticipating what will happen when you die. After a while, having to click through the dialogue for the 20th time gets repetitive. Failing to learn skills and performing poorly too often will ultimately result in death no matter what. If it doesn't affect Elodie now, it will later.I'm only recommending this game for the art because I'm a sucker for all things magical girl. If you're bad at memorizing and don't like Sailor Moon-inspired stories, this game isn't for you. Would I say it's $10 worth of fun? For what it's offering, I wouldn't pay full price. Long Live The Queen contains a nice art style, a little whimsy, barely-there mechanics, and a feel-good tale we've heard before...if you live long enough. Unless you're bored or curious, I'd opt for something with more depth.5/10			"

												Long Live the Queen has you play as a young girl forced to take the mantle of Queen and rule over her kingdom; with varying levels of success.The game is choice based, allowing you, week by week, to make decisions in your life and ruling which will greatly impact your future and efficiency as Queen of your kingdom. This game is incredibly addictive, in all the right ways. The game is also incredibly deep. I found myself failing the game, replaying, and having an entirely different and new experience. The great thing, though, is that it's very, very, very hard to ""see the strings"". I couldn't easily deduce a way to ""game"" the system to ensure a win; the game's mechanics are so deep, convoluted and fantastic that every choice was a mystery.I had a hell of a lot of fun with this game. I played for 8 hours before managing to complete it, and even then there were sides to the game I didn't experience. You may look at this game and see a silly game about an anime girl, but it's so much more than that. The characters are deep and interesting, the relationships sprawling and complicated, and the choices varied and important. Everything you do matters. Gamers who enjoy games such as Deus Ex, Alpha Protocol, The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us and others will get a real kick out of the freedom of choice your character has, and the reprocussions this can cause.A fantastic title. Make sure you pick this one up.Nilesy			"

												This game is fun, but very very complicated... unless you know what you're specifically aiming for, you won't 100% this through sheer luck.  That being said, it is very enjoyable, and all the sheer magnitude of different variations of what you can do to Elodie's life (the main character) is astonishing!  You can turn her into anything from a benevolent saint-like super queen to a demonic-ish sadistic servant of an evil king who'd blow up her father as soon as hug him!  Or... you could drown in a sea of really really mad peasants...  T_TFinding all the ways Elodie can die is almost as much fun as figuring out how to make her an effective queen, actually, and is one of the achievements!Also, for the badge hunters out there, this game has trading cards!I recommend this game if you like highly detail-oriented games, like D&D 3rd edition and whatnot... if you're like me and find making the characters in it the most fun part, anyways.  It's pretty much creating a character sheet if the character creation was on steroids, with the rest of the game as a sidenote.  =^_^=If you're worried about achievements, don't worry at all!  There are guides that will give you all of the achievements, right on steam.  Only downside is that you will have to replay the game a TON for 100% achievements (if you consider that a downside.  Some will, but I'm sitting on the fence about it).  Good news is that each playthrough doesn't take too terribly long, being 40 weeks/turns at the longest (1 turn/week = 1 set of 2 lessons, 1 castle activity, and whatever cutscene decisions for that week)100%ing the achievements can take as little time as 12 hours (possibly less).  I skipped what could be skipped after reading everything once, always online, but unsure of how much of that 12 hours was ""dead time"".			"

												Fantasy JRPG meets Empire: Total War in a VN-esque fashion.If you ever ventured into one, two or maybe all three of these gaming styles before, I believe it's easy to see why Long Live The Queen is so well rated here.Despite having completely different themes and gameplay, the joy of playing this kind of games comes from the same things:(a) they can be extremely funny when things go wrong;(b) nothing feels better than a well executed plan.So why not mix them all into a single product and see why happens? This indie 'The Sims: Medieval Days' you're now skimming through searching for funny reviews and considering if the price is worth it, is the cute, adorable –but at times infuriating– offspring of a merciless strategy game with a naive Role Playing Game.(Speaking of which, if you're not self-inserting as Elodie, our troubled protagonist, you're doing it wrong).It's common to read folks praising this game for its ""complex strategy"" but truth be told, it's not THAT awesome. It took me about 5 hours and little more than 4 saves to (successfully) get a crown placed above my head, which was kind of a bummer since things were getting really interesting by the end. That said, the ""strategy"" complexity and difficulty of actually ""beating"" the game -as in reaching coronation day- is nothing remarkable. The variety of ways you can achieve that, however, is what makes playing this game over and over worth the time.There's a reason you have literally dozens of save files slots, and if you enjoy the game, you'll likely fill most of them, where, depending on your mood, some are likely to end up with exotic names, i.e:  ""Save File #16 - Should I execute this maggot?"", ""Save File #21 - Survived the chocolate"".The masterpiece lies within the development and execution of the (a) and (b) items previously mentioned where,You'll die. You'll die in funny, unexpected ways.Characters will say funny stuff before you die.And your epitaph will always make you giggle.Alongside brilliant characters with the most alluring behaviors which will show you that,Training some skills on the wrong order will prove extremely disastrous.Everyone has awkward, impossible-to-remember names.You'll eventually give up trying to memorize their names.You'll notice it's easier to just call it whatever is easier to remember (Talasse -> Tallahassee) If there are any negative aspects about this game that I can point out, it would indeed be its short length. Had it been a bit longer, it would make an outstanding awe-inspiring Journey™ instead of just an above-average afternoon play.Anyway, point is,  stop wasting your money with stupid COD releases every year and support this deviant, creative game.Oh, and don't use guides. It spoils the fun.			"

												Can you raise Elodie's stats in time to meet her tests&trials? Probably not and she'll die, but don't worry, her death will be hilarious. After you try again you may fail in an interesting new direction. And this game is about fun failing; I love how you can deliberately fail some of the story and succeed in other parts of the story to become Queen. With 45 achievements, 11 ways to die and 24 different epilogues to the ending, there is a huge amount of replayability. For best enjoyment bring a pen&notepad with you, at least try the game a few times before you use a completionist guide. Love Live The Queen earns a solid recommendation.			"

""Long Live the Queen"" is the most ironic title possible for this game given you likely won't make it to your coronation during your first dozen playthroughs. Long story short: you are going to die. A lot. No, seriously, this game aims to kill you in ways that make you groan in frustration or facepalm at dearest Elodie's stupidity.Nonetheless, Long Live the Queen is a lot of fun to play and, no matter how often (or *how*, because there are a variety of ways) you die, you'll find yourself restarting the game from the very beginning, where you find our that your mother has recently died, leaving you to become queen should you survive one full harrowing year full of assassination attempts, scandal, accidents, and shaking your fist angrily at your computer screen, and playing through yet again. And again. And again. Every time you get just a bit further than the last time you died, you get that fabulous sense of accomplishment that keeps you hooked. There are a huge number of skills to learn (after all, a princess is more than just a pretty face) and every investment affects how the game will play out. If you train your princess in the art of swords, for example, she will be capable of defending herself... But also may lack the social graces to talk herself out of scandal. Similarly, if you spend all your time reading books, you won't be able to outrun an assailant. Balance is key.Taking classes and choosing how you spend the weekend after changes Elodie's disposition and also the options that become available to you through the game--whether that be an economic decision that drains the royal coffers or a chance to attend a fancy party in the next castle over. They also change the people you'll meet and the way they respond to you. Will you entice a possible suitor or make a powerful ally/enemy?  Decisions, decisions, decisions. The graphics are cutesy anime style, full of vibrant colours and overly-dramatic expressions and reactions. The story is actually pretty in-depth, possessing enough intrigue and drama to keep you on your toes, but I don't want to spoil anything..Pros.  A sense of accomplishment once you've started surviving for more than that first week. A strong sense of cause and effect between skills learned (or not learned) and how to deal with situations. A multitude of admittedly funny ways to die. The art is absolutely adorable. There are a range of ways to either avoid or confront problems. .Cons.  Damnit, Elodie! Why you die?! Some events feel unavoidable unless you bum rush a certain skill. Can get tedious as most of it is clicking through stat menus. Not for the easily frustrated as you'll fail more than you'll succeed. .Bottom Line.Long Live the Queen will frustrate the hell out of you, but it will also grow near and dear to your heart. If you're into VNs, simulation games, and/or roguelikes, this game will keep you engaged through a good number or horribly painful deaths.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs-up.

												HEY. YOU. WITH THE STEAM FUNDS.Yeah, you, the one scoffing at why you even clicked on the review page for this game you think you'll never end up buying. I get it, I do. It's frilly, it's girly, it's not your tipical action RPG. Well listen up boys, cause this ain't any sort of namby-pamby walk in the park.Before you punch a wall to regain your manliness that you feel has dropped by even looking into this game, you should know something. If you're into judging a book by it's cover, you might be turned off by Long Live The Queen's anime-esque art style or it's female protaganist - you don't know how wrong you are. LLTQ is a text based RPG that puts you in the shoes of Elodie, Queen of Nova. Or, should I say, almost queen; tough luck buddy, you've got 40 weeks to survive before you get that far.Oh, I know what you're thinking. '40 Weeks? Like three months? Ha. I'll finish that, play some Dota, AND punch a wall to get back my manliness card.' YEAH NO. You're dealing with assassins, monsters, rebellions, a set of pissy (read: deadly) relatives, and an entire kingdom looking at you to fix it. Or not, you know. They could always just kill you - I'm sure that'd fix the problem. Somehow.And here you're saying WOAH, HOLD UP. I've seen this before! You won't get me with your cutesy violence and your lack of guns!Listen up, son. You can be impaled, exploded, imploded, poisoned, drained, and, in one unfortunate ending, eaten. Trust me, this game is very much not what you think it is. The numerous death senarios coupled with the surprisingly gruesome art makes for just as wild a ride as anything you've got.And trust me, I haven't played this for nearly 40 hours for nothing. You think you can make it through in one shot? Don't make me laugh. You'll be dead before you even try to eat- never mind.As for me, I'll be leveling up my mage skills. I have a date with an enemy Lumen, and I don't intend to let him walk away with his limbs intact.			"

												Decisions,Decisions,Decisions this game is all about them. Even good decisions are bad decisions, that's what makes this game so fun. If you die start over again. You will play this game over and over without a walkthrough. You can be a benevolent queen and you can be an evil queen or you can be a pushover. The beauty of this game is that it is all about decisions and the consequences held to each one.  Great game to play, but rather hard.			"

												At first, I was really confused with this game. There is so many stats to up and you got to handle the princess mood too.And the most frustated part is death always nearby so I gotta save often (use all the save slots that's avaliable).But thanks to the ""Illuminate!"", it got my hype up since knowing that my princess is a Magical Girls change the course.1 hours of struggling and at last I really got coronated (Yeah, LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!) but there is still a missing piece.So I open the achievement and well there is a lot still locked, gotta play it again and again then.After that I tried to read some of the Community Guides and found out you can marry a girl .OMG! It's really have a yuri ending and more magical ends.10/10 will definitely Megucas.			"

												Like to read?Do you like to boss others around?Would you like a challenge?Then this game is just for you, harsh with a sprinkle of glitter to comfort you as you watch yourself die over and over.-------------In all seriousness though this game is very lovely.You will die but you are meant to. You slowly learn what actions lead to what to slowly learn which skills and actions work for you. There are 11 ways to die and many endings giving different playthroughs.Certain skills actually help you learn about certain characters/problems they are having which before you would of skipped or not have had a 3rd option due to the skills you learnt up to that day. This is the reason you play again even if you got to your coronation. To learn the secrets of your enemies & more of the story while unlocking some beautiful outfits for each skill-type.			"

												Not that great at reviews but it's worth it for this game.The game puts you as a 14 year old girl becoming queen soon after her mother died. Think it's about cute anime stuff only? Think again. While there is cute outfits, even a magical girl one, the game is far more in depth than that. It will have you balancing politics, war, public safety, and your own life. And if any fall out of balance, expect bad things to happen. From riots/rebellions, to assassination attempts. Be courted by lords (Or the ladies, if you prefer :) ), wage war, raise taxes, force conscription. Do whatever you want.This game is golden.10/10 for what it was attempting. I love it and wouldn't change a thing.			"

												Long Live The Queen is a graphical text adventure game where you play a princess who'll one day become the queen,... if you can survive until the coronation, that is. The princess will have to take daily classes (one in the morning, one in the evening) and that way level up her skills. It's up to you how you invest those skills. Want her to study court manners and impress your friends or relatives ? Or study naval strategies ? You decide how you want to do make her the best queen she can be. There are many things to take into consideration, like bonuses and penalties, and things that have yet to happen. And do you want to level up a few skills completely, or do you want to level up a bit of everything. One thing's for sure; there's no right way to properly finish this game, because it involves a lot of luck and a certain bit of skill and there are many, many different outcomes.I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's different than many of the other games I usually play, and that's saying something.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												Politics Souls, 10/10 would sing evil overlords into submission again.Please don't let the promotional art fool you, this is not a lighthearted dating sim.Long Live the Queen is an interesting game about learning to navigate politics in a fantasy setting. The writing is excellent and makes for amazing replayability. I had myself doing intentionally faulty builds, not just to experience the many interesting ways to die, but to see the flavor text on classes and choices that may not otherwise have been open to me.The game was updated ages after release with even more content, much to my surprise, and had me coming back to play it again for even more new stuff. Every choice you have bears some kind of consequence on the narrative, be it on the influence on your mood, your popularity with your people and/or court or changing the narrative entirely. You can cause civil wars. You can be overthrown by your own court. You can have assassins come for your life for reasons you won't understand until you've played through several kinds of routes. The setting is dynamic and it will take many, many playthroughs to learn how everything pieces together, without destroying the narrative experience for your first, single playthrough.It seems like there's always something new to find. Would absolutely recommend to anyone.			"

												Don't be fooled by the cutesy aesthetic, this game is brutal.Absolutely loved it - there is so much content here for the price. Yes, it made me want to scream with rage at points (death is sudden and omnipresent for poor Elodie) but I kept coming back. I still haven't found all the little narrative twists and turns, and I'm sure it will keep me occupied for a good long while.The narrative is intriguing (and it kind of has to be considering the potential tedium of the stat-building gameplay) and has everything one could want: namely intrigue, murder, magic and lesbians. There is a lot of depth here, more than is usually present in a visual novel.Some complaints I've seen centre around the unpredictability, and I will agree that it is frustrating at points when seemingly random stats turn out to be really important. There is a lot of trial and error - despite this I still recommend it.			"

												This, was quite an interesting, unique and fun game!So, you control the princess, send her to classes to learn skills and get better at things, and do your best to avoid getting taken over or killed.  This is actually QUITE difficult, as there are many different ways for you to die, and you will experience quite a lot of them (but that's good, there's 3 achievements related to this).  So don't feel bad, or a failure, or anything: it's to be expected!  The game shows you the 'checks' that it does to trigger certain events, so you can figure out something to try to do differently the next time around.  And this is certainly not a 'single playthrough' type game by any means: there are so many events that can trigger, and so many ways to try to do things, that you really can't help but try again and again to do something different!  (I put in nearly 30 hours just trying different things out!)The story is interesting, the characters have their own interesting personalities (and own different stories and actions that you figure out through multiple playthroughs), and the game is definitely worth it, even not on sale!  My only regret was that I got this game, promptly put it on my backlog of games to play, and only got to it now!PS: Since everyone else has already spoiled it... Avoid the chocolates.  If you can!

												I don't think I would reccommend this game much.  If you REALLY want a game like this, stick with Princess Maker 2.  This just feels like they tried too hard.  Granted, there are ideas that I love in here like customizing the girl's attire and just being a badass Magical Girl.  The clothing that you can have with her is pretty cool...some....ehhhhhh....really shouldn't have been implemented.  Made me feel awkward with a few outfits for a little girl. Speaking of, unless I didn't get a true ending after defeating a certain someone as a magical girl, I kinda missed the aging of the young future queen.  I also felt the lack of adventure was there as well.  In Princess Maker 2, you had the young one go off on her on and explore certain areas, gain certain items, and all that fun stuff.  Here, it's just a confinement.  The one thing I liked was the fact of doing certain things to make her happy, sad, angry or just lonely.  Doing certain things in the castle will effect your little future queen and that was interesting.However, I felt that this was just lackluster.  There are so many things to boost up in this game, and you just can't tell how much or how many traits you need to progress in the story.  It will take a few tries to get the hang of it, but even then, you just don't know what you truly need.  I say this because, the story will progress rather quickly and with lack of certain traits, your future queen will fail in most aspects, making you a little angry.My boyfriend even played this game and he was a little angry at the game.  He loved the concept, but, only if it was executed well.  I know he too recommends Princess Maker 2, where he made her into the finest blood-thirsty warrior of her time.			"

THE WAIFU WARSEPILOGUE: LONG LIVE THE QUEENYou heave a sigh as you awake from previous events, now all over, and your girlfriend, Summer-Rain snores softly in your arms, both of you on the couch in her room. Not wanting to wake her, you leave your left hand holding her shoulders as you reach for your laptop to play a game, unable to go back to sleep.You realize there's a game you haven't touched,having bought it when it first came out and it was onoffer. You had to keep it from Ms. Novocaine then, forshe was already disliking anime and manga when youstill loved it then. You blink at the clock which reads2.35AM. Shrugging, you open a game of sakura pinkand frilly death.LONG LIVE THE QUEEN.You begin with playing the beautiful (jailbait) PrincessElodie, a would-be-queen of the Kingdom of Nova. Asthe story unfolds, magic has been outlawed (go figure)and you have to make sure Elodie is prepped and readyto rule as Queen in 40 weeks!You blink again in disbelief. ""Wait... what?!"" You gasp,realizing you're on an indirect timer. ""40 weeks is...40 turns?!"" You realize that you're supposed to keepElodie not just alive, but sufficiently skilled in any numbers of methods and paths available as there areBarons out to usurp her, kill her, marry her or makebloody war upon her Kingdom. Sometimes, they wantto do all four!As you take a magically-inclined path to develop Elodie,you glance at the achievements available. The primarycore of the game's driving force is even more horrifying,as the game encourages you to find the different waysthat Elodie can DIE. Your eyes widen as you return tothe glitzy, pastel-colored 2D world. The themes are sojarring and you find yourself uttering over and over thesame words; ""-what kind of game is this?!""""Hmmn? What kind of game you playing?"" Summer-Rainmutters, awoken by the music-box-like tunes comingfrom the game and your incredulous exclamations. Yousoftly greet her as she stirs and explain your predicamentas to who would create a game to discover the myriadways to murder a 12-year-old Princess.Summer-Rain squints for awhile, then curls up into a ballnext to you and looks at your next move through half-openeyes. She draws the blanket over the both you best as youcan. ""Starboy?"" Summer-Rain muses, as you load the game again after feeding Elodie to monsters in the forest. ""Yes...?"" You look towards her, her face bathed in the pinkreflections of the game. Summer-Rain smiles that signaturesmile of hers, eyes closing. ""Thank you. I was afraid youwould go back to her... I would have understood, but thatwould have hurt me. Thank you... thank you so much.""Summer-Rain says the words with such sincerity that youfind yourself moved more than usual by her. You alsocannot help but think you dodged a huge bullet by beingwith her rather than Ms. Novocaine, not unlike how yousteer Elodie clear from danger. Ms. Novocaine trying toreturn at a strange time when things are going well foryou... also makes you wonder if your life and Elodie'sown are... not dissimilar to the other.""You're very much welcome. Summer."" You respond,after carefully choosing your words, just like you wouldfor Elodie to maintain a clear outcome. Although it wasnot necessary, you elect caution more and more afteryou've been playing Long Live the Queen, and that initself, has been a story about learning how to get whatyou want, but at the same time, there are some thingsthat need to be broken, or left behind.Sometimes both.""Happy Valentine's day, Summer."" You kiss her cheek,and she beams absent-mindedly. ""Oh yeah...!"" Shestarts, slowly grinning. ""It IS Valentine's today...!""You realize that Long Live the Queen is both the storyof Summer-Rain and even Ms. Novocaine, the story, orlife of a girl thrust out of her comfort zone, into the bighostile world out for everything. You realize why, to some tiny degree why Ms. Novocaine might have left,for a better future for herself, even if that future wasnothing but a lie. Is that why she wanted to return?Did she really think that her knight in shining armorwould wait for her?You embrace Summer-Rain and return her kisses.Your ship has sailed Ms. Novocaine. ""Sayonara, Senorita."" You think to yourself, smiling slightly. Summer-Rain notices. ""What's so funny?"" She asks.""Nothing at all, my Queen. Long may you reign.""You hold her tightly, both of you hugging each otheras if there was no tomorrow. ""Happy Valentine's day.I love you, Summer."" You can feel the warmth of hersmile. ""Love you too, Starboy. Happy Valentine's day.""LONG LIVE THE QUEEN. "

												Elodie struggled long and hard, using a mastery of politics and court flourish to avoid the attempts against her life. She mastered magic, studied war, and set out to defend Nova against her foes. But alas, foreign planning mattered not when Elodie failed to climb up high, and her grand strategies barely brought her back alive. And so the villain comes, but with it, a chance to run. But Elodie would not go quietly into that good night. Long did she fight the blackhearted foe, matching him blow for blow. But alas, when the finale came, she failed to flash and dazzle, lacking just a bit of razzle. One step short of victory, she gasped:""If only I had studied decoration!""And so the sound of a Tardis echoed throughout the city, to teach a fourteen year old girl of all things PRETTY10/10, will play again.

												Similar to a Visual Novel, this game features a cute heroine featuring a main story.The different approaches one can take to completion (or an attempt to complete) the storyline is vast.The skill leveling system seems self intuitive, however takes a bit of time to learn what moods effect Elodie's stats.Long Live The Queen is a great casual game to play. 10/10.

												Absolutely would I reccomend this to anybody who wants adventure, strategy, humor and suspense all in one.Long Live The Queen can be a little frustrating first starting off; because you have no idea what to expect.You get to know the characters, more about them, and you learn what to expect. There are so many exciting outcomes and possibilities, but it requires strategy; and I love that.This game had me thinking for hours. I've never gotten bored of finding different things that can happen.			"

												Long Live the Queen incorporates Dating Sim mechanics in a quest to help a girl survive to her 15th birthday. Of course, this is not any ordinary girl, for she is meant to be the future Queen of her land. You have to help our protagonist with preparing her for potential assassins, cival war, propaganda and foreign affairs by making choices about her education and strategy.By dating sim mechanics, I mean that you have to choose which stats to builds up and you learn about possible strategies through failure. In dating sims this means failing to get the love-interest. In Long Live the Queen this means dying. A lot.You have multiple save slots. Use them.That is the main piece of advice I have to have the most enjoyable experience possible. Otherwise, let yourself go, accept failure as a definite and enjoy a game where you slowly build a strategy over time via hypothesis-testing.Story-wise, the writing is wonderful. The stats results in numerous dialogue branches, so that you feel like your character is actually changing based on her education and her actions. There's numerous replayability, for you can win (and lose) in many different ways. If you're into Game of Thrones-esque intrigue and royal complications, there's enough to keep you entranced for a while.On the whole, I recommend Long Live the Queen for those who don't mind trial-and-error style strategy game play who are looking for a taste of experiencing Dating Sim mechanics without the dating.(Though, there is some dating.)

You have to focus in this game, take notes, and do a lot of trial and error.Pros:+ There are several plots and subplots. You have to master different skills and take different choices in every run to see all the subplots. + The subplots are really interesting, because they are really concatenated to the main story.+ Several endings. And I'm not counting the death finales.+ Your choices DO matter. Telltale can learn a thing or two about this game.+ It is really fun to explore all the choices.+ You can be a magical girl in this game, or be a strategist warrior, or a hybrid.			"

												You're a 14-years-old, cute, pink-haired princess whose mother mysteriously (and conveniently for the story) passed away recently. You'll be queen in a year, when you come of age, living under your father's regency for the time. What could possibly go wrong?Better question is, what couldn't? Between political intrigue, war, dangerous criminals, ballroom galas and birthday parties, you're likely to get maimed, impaled, gutted, pincushioned and eaten by monsters. Beneath the cutesy animesque paint job hides a deep and often dark world, and only by dilligently keeping up with the affairs and studying skills to be able to respond to  arising situations are you going to stand a chance to live to see the day of your coronation. Practice makes perfect they say, so get those pens and spreadsheets ready, because you have a lot of planning and strategizing to do.Judgement: Short but very addictive and definitely replayable.

Absolutely fantastic game.A title might be a little bit ironic because I died more often than in Dark Souls. So yeah being a loli queen is a hard task.At first	  I have thought this game is a fashion simulator for girls but I was wrong. Its a really mature game with a lot of decision making , and hey decisions in this game actually matter, fate of the kingdom lays at your hands. ( me3 go and die in hell )There is a huge skill tree list  that allows you to play the way you want, of course time is limited so you won't get everything maxed. You have to choose carefully what skills are you improving, and every skill affect the game outcome in a different way. You can be a leader with a strong presence, a strategist , skilled swordmaster, animal lover, qt magician girl , diplomat or trading master.Every skill has its bonuses in the game, if you are good at accounting you will have more chances to improve your kingdom resources. If you are military general you can lead battles by yourself and improve your chances at winning and reduce losses, learning world history will give you more information around your enemies or past events. Being a master at intrugue also helps you to detect any silent threats from your nobles, and it might even prevent a raise of the rebellion. The best part  of it is that every stat is usefull and many of them can be mixed to achieve interesting results. A strategy + Battlefield medicine might yield a sweet results. But its only one of the many possible pairings.Alternatively  you can be a cruel loli and slain everyone/everyone on its way with no remorse.There is few/several? endings. I haven't get to each one but some of them were really surpsing. Game lenght is around few hours but it has a  [/b]huge replayabillity value [/b] , especially if you want to know each ending or try different choices.All you have to do is to make it to the coronation to became a true Queen, but there are many enemies around.Especially chocolates.

												Long Live the Queen has often been described as Princess Maker with all the creepy/disturbing♥♥♥♥♥♥stripped out, which is both accurate and apt. There's not much you can say beyond that to really describe the game: you invest in skills, make decisions and hope that when a skill check comes up you can pass and if you fail, hope it is not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fatal check.Outside of the usual grumbling that it is anime as ♥♥♥♥, a common complaint is that the game is too easy and reaching your coronation is not particularly difficult (there's one obscenely obvious path to winning). The real fun is finding all of the alternative events, conversations and side stories in an attempt to collect all the deaths, epilogues and achievements. Want to win a naval battle? Marry a commoner? Join up with the evil guys? Save the day with singing?! All are possible, but you have to invest in the right skills to set off the correct event flags to just get them in motion.If you're looking for a game to add to your completion list then you won't get much out of LLTQ except a laugh or two, but if you like exploring weird skill combinations and reloading save after save because you got ♥♥♥♥ed over by a completely random skill check you weren't expecting, you can definitely get a reasonable amount of entertainment and accomplishment out of this game.

												This game is a series of choices that alter the story in a huge amount of ways. You train skills with classes and events to prevent your own death until you make it to your 15th birthday and are crowned the Queen. It's very easy to get killed and you will likely do so a couple of times before you success, unless you are lucky. You decide how conflicts plan out based on your knowledge in fields, so if you focus on one class of skills, you will be doomed when another is needed for something. Your mother's recent death makes you sad at the beginning, but you can change your mood which in turn affects your class performance. If you do specific events you can unlock magic, which is great and all, but if you don't want to go down that path you don't need to do that, which is fantastic. You can win by making others too afraid to attack you with your presence, have such defenses that assassins fail in their attempt, or magically detect and eliminate someone with your own preference of killing technique. This game is most certainly NOT FOR EVERYONE, but if you like simulation where your choices can branch out into a story and the theme of being the Queen of a magical fantasy world, then pick this game up when you can!

												This game is pretty simple to describe. Basically it's like a choose your own adventure novel, with many, many ways to die. Essentially you are playing through a linear story, and you are given different skills to master and choices to make in order to get to one of the multiple endings. The game itself is completely sound, I have not run into any glitches or anything of that sort. I personally like the art style, and the music serves its purpose. I believe the music could be a bit more varied througout, but that isn't a huge complaint. Now as far as the gameplay goes, it's pretty much just point and click. There isn't much to go over in that regard. One thing that is worth bringing up is that this is a linear game. While there are different outcomes, the path you take is virtually the same. It's important to note this before you purchase, or you may be dissapointed. To conclude, I think this is worth the five dollars I spent on it. It's a fun game with no technical flaws that I can think of, and I got what I paid for. No serious complaints here.			"

												Being a ruler is no easy task, and if by any chance you happen to be an 14 year old girl, then governing the kingdom may be an impossible trial for you. Created by Hanako Games, Long live the Queen lets us to experience such situation, but in a manner of allowing us to discover the story, rather than emphasizing the gameplay on the strategy or governance.Long Live The Queen is another visual novel from the previously mentioned game developer - Hanako Games. You begin the story as Elodie – a young girl, who due to the sudden death of her mother will become the queen of Nova. However your road to coronation will not be a joyful ride, it is festered with responsibilities, decisions, danger and if you are unlucky…  your death. The plot thickens as history develops. Who was your mother? Why did she have to die? What kind of queen will you be? That and many questions will, or will not be discovered (and answered) as you play the game.What differs the LLTQ from other games of Visual Novel genre, is the way how Elodie matures through the gameplay. Aside from making decisions, which affect the story in a way typical to VN (choose specific option bubble), you have to practice new skills. That is right, our young queen is an unfledged bird, that has to learn a thing or two... or make that many, before she will sit on a throne. Your gameplay is divided by weeks and classes . Each week you have to choose which skills you will learn through that time and when, because you have morning and evening classes. Elodie can learn fencing, economics, dancing and much more (the list of skills is huge and even includes the magic of Sailor Moo… err Lumen). Although this is not a typical strategy game, you have to carefully decide, what abilities your character will develop. Your skills shape the story and the number of options, which you are allowed to choose in time. If you meet requirements the ‘’skill check’’ will test the level of your ability. Success leads to better outcome and failure may result in an unfortunate event. Every skill is important, and even taking painting lessons can be a matter of life and death. Did I mention, that Elodie is an easy victim of political intrigue, assassinations and revolts? Knowing how to solve this issues may allow us to live another day.To add more spice to the meal, our future queen is no different than teenagers from real life (she is 14 years old, remember?). Every action you take (weekend activities and several events), affects Elodie’s mood.  The strongest emotion can be your advantage or disadvantage when it comes to learning skills. Angry Elodie will quickly improve with new military strategy, but in that state it would be unwise to make her to understand royal demeanor. You can either use moods to learn desired abilities faster, or try to balance protagonist’s personality.  All in all game swiftly switches to two modes (that cooperate well) – a story full of lore, and strategy where you have to survive and rule the kingdom. And to think that most teenagers in our life worry only about being popular in high school or  getting the first kiss.This shows us the biggest disadvantage of the game. While different skills and options allow us to discover other perspectives to the plotline (there are many ending, which is a big plus), however the danger that lurks in every corner may prevent us from reaching the end of the game in a moment that we did not foresee, so do not be surprised when your protagonist got an arrow to the lung or died from curse because you chose to learn something else. Every death means, that we have to start all over again, and in worst case scenario, we might be forced to do so, because we did wrong decisions and acquired wrong set if abilities. This leaves the LLTQ as an visual novel with huge trial and error gameplay.Although story and mechanics suggest climate full of suspense, danger and harsh resolves, the visual and soundtrack act as an contrast to this vibe. Character’s portraits, user's interface may resemble the style simillar to previous products of Hanako Games such as the Magical Diary. In addition, even demise of our heroin is not shown as gruesome, as we may think – drawn in Chibi style scenes of our unfortunate death, add little humour to Elodie's perilous quest. Too bad though the scenes and characters are not as good as those from Cinders, whereas Cinders has vivid art style, LLTQ seems to be very static and blunt, even if it has some artistic touches . If I were to describe the best feature of the game, that would be game's soundtrack, that consists of  piano music pleasant to ears. Personally I find it as little masterpiece, very simple and relaxing tunes may soothe our soul after another death of Elodie from wicked relatives or nasty animals.To sum it up, a wildly branched story full of different endings, characters, plots and ways to solve problems mixes quite well with simple graphic style, and easy to understand gameplay mechanic. Unfortunately the risk of death sometimes limits our possibilities and our first tries in this game will be pure luck rather than decisions based on our understanding. If you are patient player, that is curious of discoveries, that hide inside the product (game also has achievements), then I can recommend you this game, in other case you might realise, that plotline appears to be too short for you and becomes a very frustrating experience.Long Live The Queen is like a delicious cake filled with too much raisins, and the problem is... I do not like raisins.Pros-	Good written storyline, where we experience different perspectives-	Skills and mood mechanic, that let us greatly influence the story-	If you like manga, then art style may attract you-	Pleasant soundtrack-	High replay valueCons-	Gameplay heavily based on trial and error approach-	Not as artistic as some other visual novels-       Even if story has many paths, main scenario is too short.Verdict7/10			"

												Interesting hybrid of Choose Your Own Adventure VN and RPG. The RPG part involves leveling up the main character (you can upgrade 2 skills per turn), so that she can overcome tests of skill and survive. She'll have to face war, assassination attempts, duels (both physical and magical) and other perils. During these ordeals, her mood will swing, and each of the 10 moods I discovered so far (apart from the 8 basics, I managed to be Neutral and Injured) will give you bonuses and penalties. I reached my first positive game ending after 8 playthroughs. Each time I died, I learned a new test I had to overcome, so I'd concentrate on the necessary skills. Some of the dangers you can divert by the choices you make (I was a little too much headstrong for my own good, repeatedly exposing myself to trouble, thinking I was leveled up enough), but others are mandatory for your storyline to progress. I'm glad I never felt frustrated and resorted to a walkthrough; instead, I started making notes and planning my character development.When I finally won, after a little more than 13 hours of playing, I was a little perplexed, because I thought the game would be longer. Also, I got only 10 of the 45 achievements, so it's clear that the story has way more unexplored branches! So eventually I'll come back and play again... The following is a list of these initial playthroughs. Maybe I'll update it when I play more:1st playthrough: died at week 25, by poisoned chocolates2nd playthrough: died at week 28, shot by an arrow3rd playthrough: died at week 31, by poisoned chocolates4th playthrough: died at week 28, shot by an arrow (but I passed way more tests than before)5th playthrough: died at week 28, shot by an arrow (I shouldn't have gone to that party again!)6th playthrough: died at week 33, by sword7th playthrough: died at week 33, in a magic duel8th playthrough: coronation at week 40!

												This game is amazing because of the way it lets you choose what kind of person you will be, what kind of ways you can approach a problem, and it is all in a very simple layout. Having so many possible strategies, endings and untimely demises just by choosing classes and dialogue shows how much work went in to this. You can survive by just choosing skills that seem relevant at the time, though it is unlikely, but to prosper you need to make competent decisions all the way through. A class that you took in week 3 could save or kill you weeks later.Do you want to become a master of intrigue and have your enemies die before they make their move?Or do you want to become a cruel ruler with large armies?Or maybe you just want to become a magical girl and solve all your conflicts by being nice?All of this can be accomplished if you try.

												Long Live The Queen is a raising sim where you train a princess in a variety of social, physical, intellectual and mystical skills. Depending on your choices, her mood affects how quickly she learns in her classes. The gameplay is very similar to games such as The Sims, The Idolmaster and Princess Maker.Unlike conventional raising sims, there is little time to worry about how to raise a perfect little princess. Angry citizens, rival nobles, neighboring countries, monsters and other dangers lie at every corner. After the first few playthroughs, you soon realize that the game is extremely ruthless and unforgiving - simply staying alive becomes the first priority. In a world where everyone is after your head, can you ensure your princess survives till her coronation?Overall, I'd describe the game as a cross between Dark Souls and Princess Maker. Highly recommended to those looking for a unique and challenging simulation game. And despite the malice and cruelty it often rewards, there are a few light-hearted and gentle moments as well.			"

This is fun, but not where the real fun of the game is.The real fun is after you've plotted a few routes that lead to survival with their necessary stats, and you can start poking around for all the lore, alternate routes and endings, interactions, achievements, secrets, and more. The challenge changes from surviving to exploring, and the writing and characters in this game are wonderful. I loved this game, and used all of the 100+ save slots to mark various weeks and stat combinations. After 25 hours I'm finally started to feel like I've seen almost all of what the same has to offer, though I still notably have a few achievements left to find.			"

												Long Live the Queen is a Visual Novel mixed with Strategy, but the Strategy part is easy enough to understand, even for someone who despise strategy games.I didn't think there'd be much of a story in the game, but I got a happy surprise when I realised that there's actually quite a few choices in the game that will affect events happening in the game. Everything from dying to a tentacle monster (Kraken) to marrying some random guy, Long Live the Queen got most of it.Getting most of the endings is actually a really difficult task, since there's a lot of stats to manage and you'll have to make sure that you meet the requirements for the events that will lead up to the ending you're after. Even after spending quite a few hours on the game, I've yet to get all the endings from the game.Speaking of stats, some/most of them are actually quite useless which is kind of boring. They don't really have any purpose in the game and will only unlock a little bit of a dialogue that has nothing to do with the story itself.Would I recommend Long Live the Queen?It's actually a really fun game, and it made me realise that strategy games isn't as boring as I thought they'd be. It's pretty cheap, but I'd buy it when it's on sale.			"

												 I found this game very enjoyable, and very indepth. Playing the game and going through the different story possibilities was enjoyable. Though it is all text/static image based, so it may not be for everyone. The game was definitely worth playing. The storyline has a lot of very different events that can be played through. Personally I have seven hours of gameplay, but only 38% of achivements, which would refelct that I haven't even gone through 50% of the possible choices. There is just a lot to this game. The one thing I can think of that I can say could have been better is the skill/stats training system. On a ""weekly"" basis you choose which classes to pick, and the stats effect the choices you can make, and situations you can deal with. So to find all the possible story aspects of the game a player would have to go through a lot of different play throughs with different stats. I find the system can be a bit boring, and uncertain. It does give an enjoyable puzzle aspect to the story, but I would have prefered a more connected choice system that effected stats. Rather than simply choosing a class. Overall, the immensiveness of the storyline and large number of possibilities was very enjoyable. The humour of certain events, such as chocolates *cough*, was very entertaining. If you enjoy reading, and choose your own adventure games its very much worth buying and playing.  "

												Let me start by saying this: This game is AMAZING.The people who are giving downvotes are those who sucked at the game or found it too grindy. Personally, I didn't find the game that difficult. Stuff made sense after playing through a few times, and eventually I knew the game well enough to map out my choices beforehand. Actually, I did play this game before several years ago when I was a middle schooler and I absolutely sucked at it. I never finished a single route. Now trying again, I can breeze through a path that I had mapped out prior to my gameplay. So it's a matter of someone's intelligence when it comes to puzzles. The game itself is amazing and I can not fathom how the creators was able to put in so many different branches in the storyline. Also, the game tells you the effects your choices have on the events, so you can plan ahead. (though remember that you don't have to succeed at everything. You don't have enough time to master everything. Focus on the things that count.)And hey, its chill. Save to your heart's content. PLEASE save to your heart's content - you'll need it.10/10 would wage war and die a bloody death lined with pink frills again			"

												LLTQ is a life-simulation/RPG game where you control a fledgling princess in a land rife with danger, and seek to train her skills and keep her alive until her coronation as Queen in 40 weeks. The characters and lore are well-written, and while at first the anime graphics and simple weekly events recap may lull you into a sense of security (no news is good news?), you soon realise, possibly after your first untimely death, that there are several hidden subplots lurking beneath the surface, and you have to account for them in future playthroughs or die horribly, again.These sorts of games differ from graphic novel games in that there is always a progression of in-game time between turns, and most game decisions, and what options you have, are strongly based upon what kind of skills you have trained up till that point.Each game turn (which represents a full week) takes the following format:1. You get to choose her outfit (if any) -- they're unlocked by training skills to a certain point, and boost all skill checks (but not training) in that skill group for the rest of the week.2. You get to choose two classes for her to take, which improve two of her skills by a certain amount. That amount is modified by any bonuses/penalties to that skill group for the week, which come from her prior knowledge already invested in that skill group, as well as modifiers from her dominant mood.3. You then get a story phase, where every week the ""main plotline"" of the game continues, events occur and resolve, and your character does a bunch of skill checks and often picks an option or two in order to influence the outcome of the story. They are interconnected, so many events early on will influence things later. There is no randomness in this at all - if you train the exact same skills and pick the exact same options in two separate games, events will unfold in the exact same manner both times.4. You then get a weekend phase, where you can pick one of various activities for her to spent her weekend at, to influence her mood. This phase is VERY important because once you figure out how the moods affect the skill bonuses/penalties, you will want to carefully balance her moods, mostly done via these weekend phases, in order to give her the right dominant mood for next week's training. There can be some story events that occur here as well, if you pick specially marked activities that may appear.And then it repeats again, 39 more times, at the end of which you are crowned Queen (if you survive that long).Because the game progresses in weekly instead of daily chunks, I found the game to be much shorter than others of its ilk, my first successful ending was disappointing because my initial reaction was ""Nooo! That's it?! I want to see what happens to her next! She's just starting to come into her own and be a force to be reckoned with! I love her! Let me continue the story! Wah. :(""A lot of the depth of the game is in its side paths, and the branches you can take to successfully reach the end, rather than the length of the story and the actual success or failure. Even now that I know how the story ends, and I am at least dimly aware of all the subplots and what they lead to, I still want to see if I can take her through them at some point to view the story from those perspectives.On the other hand, since each iteration of the game is so short, it actually has a bit of a rogue-like aspect to it, where you learn a little bit more each time you die (or win), and although you have to start over, it doesn't take all that long to get back to where you were before.On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7.5:---Graphics (0-2): 1.5It's typical anime graphics and I didn't enjoy that, though I didn't detest it either. However, some of the outfits she gets to wear are decidedly un-queenly and unrealistic. The graphics are static cardboards too, but that is the standard in life sim games and thus acceptable. She gets a different look for each of her 9 possible dominant moods, which was a nice touch.Music (0-2): 1.5The music seemed repetitive, but never got annoying. Also standard for life-sim games. A few more tracks would have been nice, though.Story (0-2): 1.5The story is awesome, and touching, especially since you can never see the entire story at once. The secret subplots going on in the background are very interesting when you realise their existence and look at them after a couple runs. There are little lore snippets written up for all the skills, for every 10 points you gain in each. You feel very connected to your character, and you feel yourself growing with her. There are lots of little awesome moments that don't influence the plot, but that your character can unlock by passing a skill check at a certain point anyway.However! It is linear, comes to an abrupt end, and lacks much replayability. You can play your character a different way, to see a different path or outcome, but it still goes through the same series of events and you know how it's going to end each time. Not all life sim games run like that. I would have liked this scripted part of the story to be the first half of the game, with a second half dealing with after you become Queen where you have to deal with politics and events and manage your kingdom.Gameplay (0-2): 1It really, reeeeeally needs to be longer. There are games with similar sideways depth and branching options that also go on for much longer. At the least, break the weeks up into smaller chunks, and insert minor random events and evening activities in between. Time feels like it flies by and then is over too soon. Yes that lends itself to a rogue-like feel, but I don't think it's the best fit. There aren't enough opportunities to use many of the skills, and there is no reason to train many of them past a certain (unknown) point, or at all, because there are only one or two checks for that skill through the game, and often ones you can easily bypass anyway.UI (0-2): 2It's mouse-based, simple to navigate, and had nothing annoying about it. There is a clean save/load system as well. Mild problems include that the button to progress time was a small button on one screen and there's nothing on the main UI that points you to it before you know where it is. Also, the panels could be a bit more interconnected, I also often found myself wanting to look at my skills screen during the weekend phase, which is impossible.---Life sims are one of my favourite types of genres, and while I wouldn't consider this game the best one I've ever played (Academagia takes that cake as of now), it definitely ranks up there. In a sense, these life sim games are a digital evolution of the gamebook genre in the 90s and early 00s, similar to Lone Wolf, Fighting Fantasy, Fabled Lands, Tunnels and Trolls etc.And between them, LLTQ matches up to Fighting Fantasy the best - something you won't complete on your first try, due to eclectic/unfair skill combinations/choices needed to complete a path, with some rather extravagant skill checks, skills that are only used once or twice anywhere in the story, and all in all a linear plot even though you have several ways to get there, but still a good read overall.(PS: For anyone wondering about Academagia, it is here[www.academagia.com]. It is awesome, long and packs such a powerful punch at the end that I hate them for not completing Year 2 as of this writing. It isn't on Steam, though, or even Greenlight, yet, because the devs have another nice game on Greenlight that hasn't taken off either. They unfortunately don't really know how to market themselves very well. That other game is Scheheraraze, and is on Steam Greenlight. Also an excellent life sim/RPG. Go vote for it! More life sim games on Steam please. :) )Thanks for reading!			"

												For the first playthrough the game seems very good and is just as enjoyable. Train some skills and see how they influence the outcome. At first it feels like a roguelike of some kind. Unfortunately when you fail and die and replay the game you find out that everything is exactly the same and - save for the outcome of some events depending on your skill. There is no randomization at all. Hence, the game is not very replayable, because everything happens the same way until the moment when you failed skillcheck the previous game, because now you know what you need. This forces metagaming, there is no way to get past some events unless you have appropriate skill and - what is worse - very often there is no hint of what skill will be required of you in the future, so you just train everything little by little until you are forced to replay the game, because you lacked a litttle skill in something. And in the end you will need everything anyway, no specialization is good, gotta be jack of all trades! The game plays like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Age of Decadence, basically. Albeit fun for about 2 hours (or whenever it is you have to replay it for the third or so time), it quickly becomes very repetitive and boring, silly dialogues do not help. I'd actually recommend it for very very cheap though. I got it for 2.5€ I think and I would still be hesitant to recommend the game for that price, but if it is in a bundle or below 2€ or you just love manga, then go ahead and give it a try. It's actually fun for a short while... just too short of a while.Very nice artworks and music though.			"

												Incredibly annoying to play, while leaving the feeling that you've been treated *extremely* unfairly by the game's designers. Imagine having to walk blind-folded through a maze littered with traps. Each time you walk into one, you have attained the dubious ability to avoid it on your next trip through the labyrinth. That, basically, is what playing ""Long Live the Queen"" is like. Or actually, it's even worse than that. Since knowing where a trap is and how to avoid it are two different things. But once you've figured out one of the ways of surviving a trap, you'll have to perform it (in terms of getting certain stats high enough in time) every time you replay the game. The developer actually prides him/herself that there is that there are actually two or three ways to survive a trap (scripted event) out of the circa 30 different stat bars this game sports. Injustifiably so, in my opinion, since this still leaves numerous trial & error runs until the player has found one of the solutions. Surely the option to save your game means that you won't have to replay every single event time and again? Well, only in so far as you haven't blown any of the other choices for maxing the proper stat-bars needed for other events that will be coming soon. And you'll have to write down all the choices you've made up to the moment you saved your game. For *every* savegame, or else there is no real point in saving any of your games. So basically, your princess character gets to die. A lot. Which is illustrated with slightly comical visuals. Does all of that stat-maxing, route-mapping, savegame-documenting and dying over and over again sound like fun to you? Then this is just the game for you...			"

												False advertisement: Princess dies too fast and too often. Of course, that would be the perfect title if she's using a cloning machine...Fun Facts:1. There's a dangerous weapon in this game that can kill Elodie, no matter how well she can pwn everybody. It's immune to magic and is basically a one-kill wonder, especially after the little princess tidies up a withering plant once her =Decoration is high enough. Yes that's right, it's a freaking basket of chocolate. Man, even Hershey's want Elodie dead.2. Despite looking flashy, discs of light don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥against armor.3. This game is what happens when George R. R. Martin tries to turn Madoka Kaname into a princess.4. Chuck Norris isn't in this game for if he was, Elodie's death would've already been part of the backstory.5. No matter how stupid or how much of a ♥♥♥♥-ing idiot you are,  pushing arrows deeper into your flesh is never a great substitute for proper first aid! That is, unless you're a masochistic suicide.6. Contrary to popular belief, not all princesses are immortal. DAMN YOU DISNEY FOR PUTTING THAT 'HAPPILY EVER AFTER' BULLCRAP INTO OUR HEADS!!!!7. There's a way to command the tentacled sea monster to appear: First max out the Wield Magic stat. Afterwards, grab at least three/ four of your Lumen friends to help you out so that you won't turn into Nova's very first (unintentional) suicide bomber. Finally, when the enemy fleet comes within range, yell out ""RELEASE THE KRAKEN!"" and wipe out the unlucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Of course, the tentacled monster is a jerk♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to arriving on time (he do have to finish watching his favorite shows after all) so he'll come by the next day. Of course, he'll be very hungry and will start snacking on your sailors so you have three options: trap him in a magical seal despite the fact that you wanted him to appear in the first place, offer yourself as his next meal and be broken down into nutrients for his huge body (I wonder how many calories does a 14 year old human girl have anyway), or toss your (unwilling) cousin into his maw instead. Of course, if you chose the third option, your auntie had better be dead beforehand or she'll show you the true meaning of being 'as stiff as a board'... Of course, there should be the fourth option of feeding Mr. Kraken chocolate but that would make the game too easy, eh?8. If your Flattery stat is too low, you can insult your future mother-in-law's... assets, which will quickly backfire...9. This game manages to make dying look cute.10. (All) Most of your family/nobles want you dead. Nuff said. Even the peasants want to see what sort of 'candy' they can get from beating the hell out of an Elodie-shaped pinata if you don't treat them right.11' Even the monsters want you dead for some reason. Maybe your hair remind them of that pink frosting that gave them diarrhea at that last monster party or maybe you'd just unknowingly called them ugly. In either case, don't touch those slimy tentacles with your bare hands. That stuff is anything but sweat. Alternatively, you can let the monster grab your friend and hightail it out of there. Sure her mom would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but you're about to be Queen and she is not. Only the strongest will survive.12. This is one of those games that make you want to plow your fist through the monitor. Please don't do it: computers are expensive these days. Just because you play as a princess doesn't mean you're as rich as one.13. You can become the enemy Lumen's evil minion if you're ruthless enough, Cue the evil theme song.14. It takes guts even for a 14 year old girl to push forward to become Queen, no matter how many times you die. Not even the toughest and most manly characters can touch Elodie's dedication. They all may have fancy guns and shiny swords, but Elodie has her dedication, her skills, and around 1 month of replayed games.My verdict- 2,000,000 deaths/100 livesYoungest-Female-Character-To-Die-Too-Many-Times-In-Her-Repeated-Attempts-To-Become-Queen Simulator 2013			"

												On the cover, this game sort of looks like a Princess Maker-styled game. In a way, it sort of is. However, despite the fact that it looks like an incredibly girly visual novel, it is an insanely difficult/complicated strategy game that is actually pretty worth the price. It has wonderful replayability value as you go through and try to unlock different things or get different endings. By different endings, it's better to say ""different ways to die because you can't pass your skill checks."" There are a couple of ""non-death"" endings, but they're... tricky to get. Even then, those different endings have even more variety (or some of them do anyway) depending on different happenings leading up to them that didn't affect the overall ending.It's simple and casual at first glance, but when you actually try to play it, EVERYTHING WANTS YOU DEAD.There are guides out now, yes, but it's still fun to keep playing and trying to come up with better strategies for different options each time.If I have one complaint, it's about the magic system called ""Lumens"" which is kind of hokey. Then again, it fits in with the ""magical girl/shoujo visual novel"" theme the game wants you to get so I supposed in that context, it's fine. That... and the whole coming of age at 15 and getting married to older men at that age is little bit disconcerting but for the time era the game is set in, that isn't really unusual. It's ""safe for work"" at any rate.If you like raising sims mixed with strategy and political intrigue, you'll probably enjoy this despite the pink sparkles and glitter everywhere.			"

												I really wish there was a way to give this an I dont give a crap or play at your own risk recommendation. I was overthrown for challenging a Duke who basically called me♥♥♥♥♥♥ Poisoned by chocolates because I didnt know enough about dogs and no matter what I do my cousin or I always gets bitten by a snake. The game is interesting, Ill give it that. But no matter how high my skill's are I seem to always fail the checks, No matter what choices I make. The interaction I prepared for doesnt happen or I succeed a check and it makes very little diffence in the outcome. The reviews Ive read basically say the game is addicting. Its a love hate realtionship. I suppose thats true, but having a 45 in history and elegance and I still fail the check makes the game just feel like no matter what you would be pretty much doomed to fail regardless			"

												One of the few visual novels on which I've spent more than 2~3 hours in one session.. It's a great example that sets itself apart from the stereotype understanding of the term/genre, visual novel. Most people would probably expect walls of texts with mediocre choice transitions and though being a VN it still consists of mainly reading, you'll find yourself doing a bit more than just that.You will be levelling skills to progress through a branched out story making choices as the 'to-be Queen' week by week. Levelling these skills can be heavily reliant on your mood which you can regulate by taking part in activities, events or making certain choices. The order and acquisition rate at which you get certain skills will affect the choices you will be able to make, so each playthrough is sure to be different. The dialogue is just right in that it doesn't drag on, stays on topic and keeps you focused on what's to come and the tasks ahead of you without losing it's pace. This combination that keeps you reading, thinking, making choices and planning your weekly activities really makes you feel as if you're controlling the story rather than just reading it out of a book.As usual, there's your convenient saving system which allows you to save at any time and rewind later if you want to make a different choice and/or change your course of direction. Though to get every possible outcome, you will probably need a lot more than just a few sets of savepoints. ..which I think is great and gives this game that much more replayability.Whether you're a fan of Visual Novels, RPGs or otherwise.. I'd say it's definitely worth a buy.			"

												I like to think of this game as ""the Dark Souls of visual novels"". Very mechanical, hard to complete and surely lots of fun if you have the strength to persevere.Pros:+ Innovative mechanics: create your build, make choices accordingly and see how far does it go;+ Meticulously crafted lore, which is pleasant to the mind;+ A game where you can survive even without knowing anything about war or swordplay!Cons:- It actually will frustrate you. Over and over again.- Menu is not easily available (I discovered the existence of ""save"" and ""load"" options after some days);- Call me a perfectionist, but I regret that there is no way to do a ""perfect"" run.This is no game for the action lovers. It is a game of patience and strategy, (failed) run after (failed) run. I got frustrated and left it untouched for quite some time, but I didn't give up yet.			"

												This game clearly gets more points for the ideas than the execution. Mechanics of navigating a princess though Game of Thrones-esque world with intrigues and death around every corner are unfortunately relaying too much on trial, error and memorization, which can put off many people.That said, if you can swallow the cliche anime stylistics, you will find a interesting and branching storyline. Plot of the game keeps being fresh on subsequent playthoughts, even when there is no randomization in it, which says a lot about it's quality and complexity. You can always come back and try learning different skills to yield new interesting events and plot conclusions, which makes you coming back to the game very likely. Seeing how much mechanics of this game could be improved, it is really interesting that this game can hold you in with it's silly and amusing premise of being a 14-year old anime-Westeros princess. It is a mediocre game, but a surprisingly fun experience overall. I would definitely like to see a sequel to this game with refined and expanded mechanics in the future!			"

												Elodie, Elodie, Elodie...the last three letters of your name says it all. This girl dies a lot. In fact, in the few hours I've played I've managed to kill her in three different ways. This game looks adorable, but don't be fooled. Deep down it is a thinly disguised murder machine. There's a lot of strategy to this game. I spent a good portion of my time trying to avoid being killed  by an arrow to the chest only to die from poision. As frustrating as it is, it's highly addicting and extremely fun. There's a good deal of depth and strategy involved.  The music is fine, but nothing spectacular. If you pay attention to your lessons there's actually a lot of lore and general knowledge about certain topics to be learned. Definitely worth the price.			"

												One of the appealing aspects of visual novels, for some people, is ""mastering"" the mechanics: Learning the flags, checks, etc... and using that mastery to obtain an outcome you desire. It's the same sort of engagement you might get from a puzzle game. I think that this game focuses on emphasizing that aspect of enjoyment. The reward for being able to reach new branches of the story is getting to see what happens, and the writing and art is certainly good enough (for me) to make that worthwhile.When you first play this game a few times, it's just interesting to see what happens based on the choices you make. Eventually, though, you may find yourself more interested in trying to get to the end, and that's where the gameplay changes.When I first saw this game, I thought that the events that happened to your character each day were just random, so you wouldn't be able to plan your classes very strategically. Well, I was wrong. As far as I can tell, each ""week"" of the game always has the same event, but what actually happens may change entirely based on what has happened on previous days. So, there's enough stability to give you the ability to strategize.At this level of play, the game involves a lot of saving and loading as you explore different choices and different classes. The game seems designed with this in mind: saving and loading is really quick. At any point you can right click to bring up the save/load screen. I never found myself getting frustrated by going back and reloading a save. The game makes it easy to remember what you did in each save by including the week you were on and letting you name the save. It also lets you quickly skip through dialogue you've already seen.If you like visual novels you'll probably really enjoy this game.			"

												Alrighty so...A rather simple game where your stats affect your daily life as a princess. Beginning of the week you choose your classes to study in order to increase your stats and your mood affects your progress of each class. The objective of the game is to survive 52 weeks until your coronation, while your decisions definitely have an effect on whether if you will be exposed to danger, your stats will determine whether if you survive the various ways you could be killed. You can choose to resolve disputes/ problems in multiple ways and the higher you are with the relevant stat the more options open up (eg. high Military - Strategy stat will allow you to select an option to go straight into war instead of parley)Having played it for a little amount of time I am loving the various options and consequences of my actions and it definitely has a high replay valueThe only con I have found in this game is that the ending is somewhat the same no matter how you survive.  I have cleared the game using a militant and magical approach and have been executing people left right and center throughout the entire game and on the 51st week my citizens rebelled against me and I simply responded by burning a handfull of them with magic. Come 52nd week everyone was happily chanting ""Long live the Queen"" and I was kneeling down all gracefully and humbly in prayer accepting the crown... I wanted to be a tyrant... I wanted an ending picture of terror and despair... I wanted to be the Queen that ruled with power and cruelty. Nonetheless I would recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge of the mind or simply a game where you feel like your choices matter.			"

												Long Live the Queen is a visual novel roleplaying game mixed with a death simulation. Yes, you read that right. In LLtQ you play as Princess Elodie, whose mother, the queen, has just died. As the regent you are handed the reigns of authority and must manage your kingdom successfully in the 40 weeks until your coronation as queen.Your day to day activities in LLtQ revolve around managing your moods, taking classes (with bonuses or penalties depending on your mood), and making decisions in a personal and royal capacity. Throughout the story you'll be making countless dozens of skill checks against your knowledge and abilities. Some of these skill checks are trivial, but most are important. Many of these checks are survival tests, like a check to dodge an arrow (fail and you take an arrow to the stomach), followed by a check for battlefield medicine (fail and you bleed out). Others open up or lock you into plot alternatives, almost all of which will eventually lead to further survival tests. Yes, in Long Live the Queen you'll be dying. Over and over. You'll be poisoned, drowned, run through with swords, burned to a crisp, eaten by monsters, and have your brains splattered across the floor. And that's where the magic of this game lives. Beneath its cute anime novel roleplaying exterior is a soul of hardcore planning mechanics that tempers that cuteness in a forge of brutality. Every tragic death will motivate you to plan better, choose better, and fight better to get that adorable princess on the throne on her 15th birthday. LLtQ was a wonderful surprise and one that I can easily recommend. It scratched the itch created by Academagia (a far, far deeper simulation that I heartily recommend) and far surpassed the fun, yet shallow and lackluster, experience of Magical Diary.			"

Note: I got paid to write for reviews4views website.Long Live the Queen is the dark souls of visual novels. Don’t be fooled by the cutesy graphics and initial light heartedness you might feel from it, its a brutal savage man eating simulator. The princess needs to manage the kingdom and survive until she becomes queen sound easy enough? It’s really not… First you need to make sure to understand how mood affects how well she can learn certain criteria and it becomes rather difficult at times to decide which is the right way to swing her mood. At times it will lead you to wield great benefits in her education in certain skills like wall climbing or singing that you wanted to invest in at other times… you will give yourself negative bonuses that make the skills unappealing to touch with a stick.The skills  you can invest in which will result in successes or fails during events depending on the circumstances, the good news however is that if you fail in one skill for a event another one can make up for it. For example having low composure might lead you to fall, but with fast reflexes you can avoid crashing into someone. At times however you will find yourself flustered that none of your skills you spent time on actually helped you out in certain situations and will want to go back to an earlier save to invest points in the required skills  to see how the outcome changes which is why multiple saves can be very helpful in case you need to go back further to achieve a high enough skill.. especially to prevent a death that can occur anywhere in the game Sometimes you are presented even a new option from investing points into skills that would not normally be available otherwise. For example knowing things about trade and mining can open up the option to invest in certain prospects presented to you. Once you understand how to avoid the death flags and finish the game there is a lot of different endings, events, and deaths to be seen and experimented with. It is quite fun to replay the game and think you are better prepared only to be thrown into a new series of events because you invested in other skills.			"

												Want to grow up from a princess to a queen? Well, good luck with that. No one else wants you to and will try everything to stop you.Long Live the Queen is largely a numbers-and-stats game delivered in adorable, yet somewhat macabre, visual novel form. Figuring out which stats to level and when, when its best just to stay home, and if that food is going to be tasty or deadly is mostly done through trial-and-error.After suffering more deaths than the first time you played Bloodborne, you might finish a run (with or without consequence to your kingdom, depending on your actions).Recommended for people who like visual novels with lots and lots of endings.

												The minute I noticed this game, I realized I was going to like it. I guess I have a soft spot for japanese simulation games (Recettear: An Item's Shop Tale is one of my all-time favorites), and that was enough for me to depart with $9 and get the game without digging too deep. Well, my bet ended up being quite a success - since I started playing, I couldn't leave it for quite a while. Died twice already, and I'm about to get back to the game later tonight, as soon as I'm done with some chores.So, my final conclusion: if you like japanese simulation games, get this one. No need to pay  as much as I did (full price is $10, had 10% off on release), wait for a sale and pay less, if you're patient enough, but don't pass on it, it's too much fun for that! :D			"

												This is a well written visual novel. This game, despite playing for just an hour and a half ... is amazing. I love it.However, despite this is an anime while it features a pretty girl with pink hair.. and the fact she's a princess- this isn't a game for the faint of heart. It's actually a strategy game where you must choose your actions carefully while advancing in a variety of skills. One wrong move, or one wrong step... you will die, brutally. I don't even mean in a funny way- you'll see your Queen murdered or killed in ways you didn't expect.It makes your heart race, knowing if you weren't prepared or ready for a certain situation... you can end up screwed over. Luckily you can load from your save, but this game will push you into REALLY thinking things through.I highly suggest that you check the game out. It's awesome and everything about it proves itself being worthy of playing. Plus, it's a successful Indie game that won the Greenlight vote. So that there already says something about the game.			"

												I'm a bit mixed on this game, although it was certainly enjoyable enough that I would recommend it to the right kind of person.The game is basically a stat oriented Visual Novel game, where you spend time studying 2 different subjects each week in order to help prevent and avoid future things that will cause your demise (which take the form of stat checks).  Overall the gameplay is rather basic, and there are many instances where you will see the possiblity for replay value to see what happens if you pass certian stat checks (although from some I saw it seems that the checks have no real effect even if you pass them). I will admit I've only seen one ending so far, so it is possible that some stat progressions may change some of the major events that I don't know about.Stuff I enjoyed: -The artwork in the game is adorable and fun (although there is no animation).  -The game also has a good sense of humor which lightens the feeling of getting into a dead end you can't get out of.-The plot is well paced and fun.Stuff I kind of disliked: -Because of the nature of the game it heavily encourages save-stating and redoing to see if you have actually put yourself in a position you can't get out of (although the game does provide a dialoge skip feature if you press TAB).  -Some aspects of the game like how exactly mood affects stat growth and how outfits work aren't fully explain and will require a playthrough just to learn (but since you have no idea which stats might be good anyways you are going to be learning that too, so it isn't that big a deal).-The game is very linear (there are some randomly placed events, but they don't seem all that important) so you know when major events will hit (which is nice in that it makes figuring out how to beat the game easier, but also makes the game super predictable, save for figuring out a different sequence of skill progressions to reach the ending in a different way).

Note: I got paid to write for reviews4views website.Long Live the Queen is the dark souls of visual novels. Don’t be fooled by the cutesy graphics and initial light heartedness you might feel from it, its a brutal savage man eating simulator. The princess needs to manage the kingdom and survive until she becomes queen sound easy enough? It’s really not… First you need to make sure to understand how mood affects how well she can learn certain criteria and it becomes rather difficult at times to decide which is the right way to swing her mood. At times it will lead you to wield great benefits in her education in certain skills like wall climbing or singing that you wanted to invest in at other times… you will give yourself negative bonuses that make the skills unappealing to touch with a stick.The skills  you can invest in which will result in successes or fails during events depending on the circumstances, the good news however is that if you fail in one skill for a event another one can make up for it. For example having low composure might lead you to fall, but with fast reflexes you can avoid crashing into someone. At times however you will find yourself flustered that none of your skills you spent time on actually helped you out in certain situations and will want to go back to an earlier save to invest points in the required skills  to see how the outcome changes which is why multiple saves can be very helpful in case you need to go back further to achieve a high enough skill.. especially to prevent a death that can occur anywhere in the game Sometimes you are presented even a new option from investing points into skills that would not normally be available otherwise. For example knowing things about trade and mining can open up the option to invest in certain prospects presented to you. Once you understand how to avoid the death flags and finish the game there is a lot of different endings, events, and deaths to be seen and experimented with. It is quite fun to replay the game and think you are better prepared only to be thrown into a new series of events because you invested in other skills.			"

												The minute I noticed this game, I realized I was going to like it. I guess I have a soft spot for japanese simulation games (Recettear: An Item's Shop Tale is one of my all-time favorites), and that was enough for me to depart with $9 and get the game without digging too deep. Well, my bet ended up being quite a success - since I started playing, I couldn't leave it for quite a while. Died twice already, and I'm about to get back to the game later tonight, as soon as I'm done with some chores.So, my final conclusion: if you like japanese simulation games, get this one. No need to pay  as much as I did (full price is $10, had 10% off on release), wait for a sale and pay less, if you're patient enough, but don't pass on it, it's too much fun for that! :D			"

												A linear experience which always provides fun new outcomes; once you’ve slogged through the opening.This game is great, It caught my eye over on GoG and I ended up purchasing the GoG Version- dropping a hour into it (Roughly three play through’s) only to then my friend gifted it to me via steam. Shockingly my achievements carried over into the steam version and I’ve since played through it seven more times- with various degrees of success.The goal is the game is simple: Become the queen. No here’s the catch. The game’s core storyline, which isn’t randomized (you should bare this in mind before purchasing) is designed to kill you. The replay ability comes from how you can approach the previously mentioned story and the differient outcomes they provide. Think of it as a tree- you start out at the bottom following the trunk upwards- you could do this countless times and nothing would ever change. Then you reach the branches at the top and depending on which one you initially choose follow you’ll end up on ever narrowing branches. All unique in comparison to their counterparts.Magic, Cunning, political black mail, Military might, sex appeal- you name it this game will allow you to test them against the situations presented at you- and with each different approach comes a different outcome which changes the later levels of the game drastically.Due to this replaying the game is a tad annoying, since you need to work your way past the same old opening “levels” or as the game call’s them: “weeks”. But once you’ve gotten past the first quarter of the year the game opens up into a dynamic rouge like- and I do mean rouge like.Insta-deaths are EVERYWHERE, sometimes you receive forewarning off your impending fate and you can make preparations to avoid it. Others you’ll simply die with no input from you. It makes the game frustrating to say the least- but it’s still enjoyable since you can avoid these insta-deaths by not learning certain skills at the start of the game.The art style is beautiful colourful and vibrant. Taking inspirations from Japanese Visual Novels yet with attention to detail you rarely see. The characters display emotions clearly and the different outfits that you unlock (which provide bonuses when worn) are both well executed, with many of the designs being references to Anime & J-RPG tropes. The game also features a minimalist soundtrack composed of Piano pieces, which are elegant if not repetitive. I choose to play this game with the soundtrack disabled personally, so I can play my own selection in the backdrop.The last thing I will is add is that, if you see yourself dropping a lot of time into this game or are already a fan of the old “Princess maker” series – I would recommend you pick up the GoG Version- since that provides you with a free image of the world map, and this serves as a great reminder if you wish to play the game with a political or militarists mind-set. It’s good to know who could attack you, where they attack from and more importantly; where you want to strike.This game lets you unleash the dogs of war on several occasions- even leading your troops into battle!Overall it’s a great time killer, something I play in-between working or whilst cooking- and for the cheap price point I would recommend it to almost anyone who enjoys a good fantasy game.

												I can't believe I didn't write a review for this game earlier!LLtQ is a visual novel about an underage girl whose mother dies and will soon become the queen when she comes of legal age. The problem with this however is that their are many people who stand to gain from her demise and taking over her kingdom so she not only needs to blossom into a woman extremely quickly, she must also remain alive while doing so whch is harder than it sounds with so, so many ways to die just waiting for you.The game is a joy to play in large parts due to its simple but great writing. Your character is believable because you dictate how she should behave and the choices have weight to them. If the game just stuck to this formula it would still be a fun game but supernatural elements come into play and while you can choose to be a magical princess you have to keep in mind that time spent learning your magical powers is time taken away from ruling your kingdom and trying to juggle everything perfectly is impossible (the game is purposely designed that way) so you are usually choosing between the lesser evil but do you even care? I mean with everyone out to kill you, aren't you just doing what needs to be done to survive?Your villagers may not see it that way, so be careful! Nor may the very people you thought you could trust and is that dad with another woman so quickly after mom died?!The game can become quite dark and even depressing at times but that is just part of the charm because it is your actions that are causing the other people to react and while it is tempting to appease others you also have to survive as well and lets not forget that your mother just died too, so maybe you don't want to deal with all these pressures right now.If I make the game sound difficult it really isn't. You will die but since it is a novel and not an actual living game (IE Civ5) you can eventually die your way to success after you know what to expect. This doesn't mean however that the game loses replay value as it has multiple endings that reflect the actions you took so if you are a completionist, you will find many hours of replay value to be had here.I heartily recommend this game!

												Don't let the girly anime look put you off, this game is great. It's also not a creepy pedo game like Princess Maker or something. It's heavily centered around what choices you make to manage your mood and what classes you choose to attend to raise your gigantic list of skills. Nearly every event has one or more skill checks, with many giving more than one ""correct"" skill to pass the event. There are many ways you will end up dead before you become the Queen, and when you finish a game (win or lose) there is an option to output the story and player choices into an html text log, which is really interesting.This is a neat game, and if you like managing stats you should pick it up.

												This game looks like it's pretty and pastel and of absolutely no consequence whatsoever.Five or six deaths later, you may begin revising that assessment.This is a strategy game. This is a game about staying alive in a hostile environment. You will die. Repeatedly. To the same things that you died to before. You could lose a civil war.You could lose an uncivil war.You could annoy someone by killing their family and be run through in a duel. You could be shot by bandits.You could be blown up by an enemy mage.You could eat poisoned chocolate.That's not even half of all the ways that you can die in the short year before you inherit.And if you're crowned, that most distant possibility? Well, sure, you might have taken the kingdom. The question is, will that kingdom still be worth ruling? You won't be done with this game until you've achieved your perfect realm and learnt all the secrets hidden from your blissfully unaware heir.After all... How did your late mother, the queen, pass away, anyway? "

												Long Live the Queen is not your typical Visual Novel RPG. Rather, I like to refer to it more as a ""spoiled-teenage-dress up-monarchy simulator,"" but in a surprisingly fun and addictive way. Elodie is a 14 year old princess who you must guide over a 40 week in-game period on the road to her coronation ceremony to become Queen once she reaches her 15th birthday. Only problem is...almost everyone else in the other kingdoms wants to see her fail or die before the 40 weeks have passed. Essentially, each playthrough is inherently unique based on the classes you have Elodie take to progress her skills each week; The classes you assign Elodie and the story's plot progress at a week by week level instead of a day by day format. The amount of progress she makes in each skill every week will depend upon her mood that week and which two skills you decide she should learn at that time (morning and evening class schedule). In order to change her mood from week to week, you must choose certain paths to take in the game, pass or fail in-game events, and/or vary her evening plans each week. Her progress in certain skills and the choices you make each week can mean the difference between life and death for Elodie. One of the beautiful, albeit frustrating, features of the game is that there is no way to make Elodie good at everything. There is a system that almost forces you to actively think through each decision you make, which adds to the complexity of the story and gameplay overall. There is a plethora of ways to win and multiple endings as well, many of which have Elodie dying before the coronation ceremony, but every ending is based upon the decisions you made throughout the game 'til that endpoint. However, there are many events that are locked-in which you cannot avoid; this is one of the negative aspects of the game in my opinion as it makes the story seem more linear in progression and not as dynamic. Despite all of this, if Elodie manages to survive to the end she will always be crowned Queen... but what kind of Queen you become, what kind of Kingdom you create in the future, and how you get there exactly depends on your stats and decisions. I cannot reiterate this wonderful facet of decision-making in the game enough (if you cannot tell). Also, the game allows you to see your entire runthrough and the choices you made via textlog whenever you reach an endpoint should you want a recap or printoff of it in detail. In conclusion, I recommend this game only to players who like visual novels, who are persistent, and are not easily discouraged or rage at their failures, because you WILL fall short in this game numerous times I assure you. Some people have used guides in the past even due to its difficulty to give you an idea of what to expect if you buy it. However, I submit that if you are dedicated to the plot, enjoy struggles only to try again to better yourself, and have plenty of time to put into the game, then you will most likely enjoy it. I know there are mixed feelings about the game, and I have displayed some of those feelings within this review. As such, I give Long Live the Queen a Solid 7.5 or 8 out of 10. While it is very difficult, lengthy, and possesses a somewhat linear plot, the game also has a great story, challenging decision-making aspects, and adaptive gameplay mechanics. Plus, it is always fun to dress her up in various new clothes based on her skill sets. So if you do choose to grab this game, I say to get it while it is on steam sale. Good luck, and hopefully you won't die. Regardless, of if you do-- LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!			"

												Luck-based trial and error and error and error and error, effectively lacking interactivity.This reminds me of Time Gal, where part of the fun can be seeing all the different ways your female protagonist can die over and over again in cutesy ways. The problem is that victory in Long Live The Queen is completely luck based, and even if you get near the end then restart, powered by the knowledge of what's to come, you'll still not get all the way through.The idea is that you train your stats, while constantly receiving situations (these aren't randomised, though that can be slightly different paths depending on outcomes) that test these stats. If you trained one or two stats high enough, you pass. It might matter, it might not, it might change something in a few turns' time.But there's very little give. Even if you die and reload a save from a few turns back, you might train the stat high enough to pass, only to soon die again for not having another stat. So you have load an even earlier save to train both the stats high enough, but then you die earlier because one of the stats you didn't train wasn't high enough. It's a cycle that isn't fun.The idea had a lot of potential, but it only works if there are several ways to an ending (early deaths don't count as satisfying endings), which would be based on your personal approach to being a leader. Instead, you just get killed off unless you have certain stats up to certain levels by a certain point in time, without being given any clues.To get to the end, you'll likely need to follow a guide to the letter. But then what's the point of playing?			"

												The game is fun for $10, though I would have preferred a little bit more randomization with each playthrough.  Still, a fun little distraction.The Good-Funny and interesting story.-Good Art-Entertaining Situations and characters-Game quickly draws you inThe Bad-Most skills don't really matter-UI can be very confusing-The ""moods"" are annoying to figure out, especially when you have to keep flipping from one screen to another to make sure you're taking the right classes.Final thoughts...The game is fine for the price, but I would have preferred more options and more interactions in the castle.  I also would have preferred a UI where the actual school screen would tell me what classes had a bonus and what classes had a penalty depending on my mood.  Flipping back and forth constantly took away from gameplay and got annoying after a while.  Finally, if the story were randomized a bit each time it would have made things a bit more interesting.  If you play the story enough, you'll know exactly what skills to take when for the best possible outcomes. "

												It's a fun, ultra-short VN. Kinda rogue-ish, in that you gotta restart each time after you die to see all the variations of all the events/endings (saving is allowed though). Really like the art style, especially the cute badges you get when the princess dies (albeit that's kinda morbid). Soundtrack is really thin, though.There's cheats if you wanna just expedite the process of seeing everything.That said, might wanna wait until this game's at 75% off or around $2-ish. The length is really short and the replayability isn't that amazing (grindy, to say the least).			"

												Each playthrough of this game can be finished within a few hours (or like me less than an hour), short yes I know but each playthrough is about learning from your mistakes and correcting or just changing your playstyle resulting in a longer than foreseen comepletion time.The art is simple but pleasing, the skill building mixed with mood mulitpliers makes for a style of gameplay that goes beyond just grinding for XP in one skill but instead planning for the events that you failed in the last playthrough just so you can tell that prick at the dance that I am a queen and I will be the one using him not the other way around.either way magic is happiness and long live the queen "

												This game...It will make you, laugh, cry, scoot to the edge of your seat, and feel fear all in one go.It's a never ending torture of a game that you're not sure if you're going to die or make it.Solely based on the choices you make.You will fall in love with some of these characters and even marry them!It messes with your mind becuase these characters are in a game.But, you feel the story line just jump out of the screen.You feel for this Princess and need to finish her story.It's hard to just stop playing and take a breath when you're in the heat of a battle.And not only do you feel for the Princess. At times you feel like you are the princess.Trying to protect your Kingdom with Lumen magic from a hot King who sadly is evil.There are so many different endings and achivments that sometimes it feels like it is nowhere possible to unlock them all. When you play this game, expect to be amazed with the graphics and story.You can change the story just by one little mistake or maybe even one little good luck moment.You can't just study topics at random. Eventually, you will have a system on what to study and when.Sacrifices will be made. Regrets will be felt.Don't hesitate to play if you want to feel one with the character.This piece of art is worth every penny. "

												This is a diabolically difficult game! I went into it without knowing much other than it was a ren'py game about becoming queen, and wow! I died a lot! But it was a lot of fun and very addicting! It took me several tries to beat the game and each time I discovered new things that I didn't see on my previous playthroughs. I would also like to commend the game for its inclusion of homosexual relationship options. You play as the character Elodie, but you can really play her however you like - there's lots of choices throughout the game that you can unlock.			"

Be carefulYou have learnt lots about history, strategy, intrigues, and even magic. As a queen, you have resolved diplomatic crisis with your neighbours, dealt with court intrigue and thwarted a civil war.Yet in the end, because you has not learnt enough about economics, poison, and court manners, you met your demise...By eating a poisoned chocolate sent by a companyEven your knowledge of intrigue didn't help you at all from dying ridiculously after the civil war that you've ended.Be careful of your choices "

												Each playthrough of this game can be finished within a few hours (or like me less than an hour), short yes I know but each playthrough is about learning from your mistakes and correcting or just changing your playstyle resulting in a longer than foreseen comepletion time.The art is simple but pleasing, the skill building mixed with mood mulitpliers makes for a style of gameplay that goes beyond just grinding for XP in one skill but instead planning for the events that you failed in the last playthrough just so you can tell that prick at the dance that I am a queen and I will be the one using him not the other way around.either way magic is happiness and long live the queen "

												This game is similar to the Princess Maker series, except the outcomes may be more limited due to the goal of reaching Elodie's coronation - if you die or do not otherwise make it to coronation day, you basically lose.The gameplay is repetitive, for those not familiar with this type of game. You choose Elodie's classes and an activity each week, and most weeks include an event that lets you make a decision to affect the outcome of the game. The idea is to replay the game (which could be done multiple times a day if you wanted to) to see different endings and outcomes.I found it to be pretty fun the first few times, but by this point I am just using guides to unlock the remaining endings. Since many require very specific actions, it can be hard to find them on your own unless you want to play it hundreds of times.Good:- Fun concept that makes you question the intentions of the characters. The first few times I played, I felt very paranoid about the outcomes of my choices.- A lot of content if you want to see what happens if you pass or fail certain skill checks, or when you make different choices.Bad:- Certain skills/choices are needed to achieve different endings, which limits your choices unless you want to die. If you happen to focus on the wrong skills, there is no real ending since winning always means reaching coronation. However, there are still several different ways to win- Some skills seem to have been pretty useless. I never found a need for Polearms, but I needed to gain skill levels in it to max other weapon skills.If you haven't played a game like this before and have a limited gaming budget, I would wait for a sale. But if you like Princess Maker type games, then you'll probably like this.			"

												I don't play visual novels, but I found myself attracted to the element of fighting off arrows, vengeful duelists, enraged family members, and chocolate for whatever reason. And it was on sale when I purchased it too. So why not.I also wasn't expecting much fun when I launched this for the first time, so it was surprisingly entertaining. I could not put down my controller until Elodie was crowned queen (after dying, like, 20 times, of course). It's very reminiscent of those ""Choose/Pick Your Own Adventure"" books, in which all your decisions count (albeit not always significantly).This game has a variety of paths or endings, giving it a relatively decent replay value.  Loading or saving at certain points is important if you prefer restarting at a familiar situation. You know the drill.Overall, I really recommend this game to those who want their decisions to actually matter in a game. Also to the bored, like me, who stay up at 1 AM wondering if there's anything new but relatively casual to play.As for me, I'll be seeing how many more endings I can reach.			"

All choices seem to have very harsh consequences, even some as far as fifteen turns back. If small precious little princess Elodie dies, you'll proceed to regret not saving as frequently. Compelling environment in the sense of lore and backstory to captivate the biggest nerds.Not for those prone to rage quitting on initial attempt.			"

												What drives a man of God to wash away the sins of his past, only to blacken his heart with a multitude more? How far can a freedom fighter be pushed before virtue and righteousness are replaced by a lust for vengeance? What does a privileged society do when the foundation of its prosperity is shaken? Long Live The Queen dares to explore these heady themes and many more, giving you glimpses at just how the seemingly smallest of decisions can forever alter our realities, and our hearts. As a young princess, your actions bring turmoil and strife to an ostensibly idyllic landscape. It's immensely fun to stir up trouble, and even more engaging to see how boldly Long Live The Queen portrays a society torn asunder. You'll be haunted by this thematically devastating adventure, and indeed, its phenomenal final minutes, which are bound to be discussed and dissected for some time to come.			"

												Decent enough, fairly entertaining as long as you play it in roguelike style and don't keep saving and loading to get through everything and instead just accept death as it comes. Also it is better than the ultra weeaboo look lets on. $10 price tag seems a bit much for it not seeming to have a whole lot of content to the game (Though with decent replayability) but if you can get it on sale for $5 or less I'd say its worth it.

												So pretty and cute. So strategy-intensive. So well-done. Would recommend to people who like visual novels and critical thinking. Even if you don't like pink and frills, try it! There's a demo on the hanakogames website that you can download and try, if you're not sure about purchasing blind. You'll love it. Great game.			"

												I'must say,though it's a 50Mb small game,but interesting and challanging.Hmmm.As a student in history major,I do think the plot is somewhere similar to trhe story of Queen Elizabeth I.Anyway,it's a good idea.My first image of this game is,an American-made PRINCESS MAKER.But I'm totally wrong.Beacause the girl in PRINCESS MAKER can't die anyway.And Elode died A LOT.It has awesome plot,and ur schadule should be targeted otherwise u faced a dead ending.A lot of endings,the branches are quite different,but it won't let player feel fed up or tired to try every single branches and endings,not for the achievement,but the curiosity about the possibility of Elode.I've met dozens dead ending before my first happy ending,really exciting when Coronation.But still,Elode died in many ways and many times.Though the Dead Ending just use a humorous cartoon pic to describe how she died....Maybe you will feel more than that.Truly a best game for kill time,or just play it seriously.Long live the Queen?The Queen lives longer.

												This game is so good.  I off all the visual novels I've played, this is probably my favorite.  It's so much more than just reading.   Its not about a linear story line that sometimes branches off on the choices you make.  Its a series of checks, which makes things more exciting because you don't know always if you pass or fail until you get there.  There are so many acheivements and things to unlock.  Even its replayability is amazing,  I love to play and just pick randomized choices to see how far I get.  Show me another visual novel I can put 100+ hours in without getting bored.  10/10 would be a princess again.			"

												Well. My experience in Long Live The Queen was a great time I will remember.I started my journey as an unhappy, pink haired,♥♥♥♥♥♥of a little girl. As I learned more and more about my past I began to play with more and more ""toys"" and spend time alone in my room. Needless to say when I was asked of marriage, I immediatly accepted, thinking about all that nasty♥♥♥♥♥sex we would be having. My dad did not approve, but ♥♥♥♥ that♥♥♥♥♥♥ I do what I want. On my way home I saw him with some bisexual♥♥♥♥♥♥of a girl. I carelessly commented on her large♥♥♥♥♥♥ promptly being scolded for doing so. After 100 or so failed skill checks that spun me into a fit of rage i've never known before in my life. I got invited to a birthday party for some little ♥♥♥♥♥ who lived across Nova. Thinking over the possible dangers, I saw no reason to not go to her party. So after a few days of meaninglessly managing my♥♥♥♥♥♥s fragile little emotions and classes, I began on my way to my friends party. On the way there some really ♥♥♥♥ing loud dramatic music bursted my eardrums as a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥s started attacking me. I passed the reflex check to dodge the arrow, but i failed the archery check. Why do I need an archery check to dodge a ♥♥♥♥ing arrow? I don't ♥♥♥♥ing know. I'm almost positive I don't need to know how to shoot a bow to dodge one. Like seriously. I don't have to have my liscense to not get ♥♥♥♥ing pancaked by a car. It's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. But I digress. After failing some more random♥♥♥♥♥skill checks. I got shot by an arrow. My little♥♥♥♥♥♥was impaled on her way to a ♥♥♥♥ing birthday party. Still living (keep in mind I maxed out ♥♥♥♥ing battlefield medicine) I pulled the arrow, only managing to stab myself in some vital organ. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥, IS THERE A STAT FOR BATTLEFIELD MEDICINE, IF I CANT ♥♥♥♥ING GIVE MYSELF MEDICINE, ON THE ♥♥♥♥ING BATTLEFIELD. Overall. ♥♥♥♥ this game. I had fun. But I hated it. It was great. But it makes me want to cut myself constantly. God ♥♥♥♥ me, i'm writing this and I still haven't completed the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Like 20 minutes ago I just drowned in the ♥♥♥♥ing ocean because i tried to be a ♥♥♥♥ing good guy. ♥♥♥♥ me. I'm gonna go beat this♥♥♥♥♥♥IGN SCORE:10/10 would play with nasty♥♥♥♥♥toys in room again			"

												This is one of those kind of games where you either don't expect much or you're not sure what to expect. Do not let the 'anime-kawaii-uguuu'ness scare you off and make you think less of this game.I was personally pleasantly surprised by this game, a text adventure accompanied by 2d images and an ocean of different choices which each can actually affect later outcomes. This can be learning about production and trade to help fund a business which will aid you later or having a high reflex, knowledge of archery and composure to avoid getting yourself killed. Do you want to focus on internal affairs? Have more knowledge about military stragedy? The list goes on and on and you can complete the game many times in so many different ways that its even worth its full price.The music does loop a lot but is still enjoyable. I personally wish there was more story than there is as the game feels short, but again the replayablity somewhat makes up for that in the long end.I'd say give it a whirl, especially if its on sale. 6-7/10 in my eyes.

It has A LOT of trial and error, and so if that is not your kind of cake then don't take a slice. Overall the game is pleasant, and has a lot of replayability. The endings are good, but the gameplay is quite meticulous. Everything you do will make a difference, and it can be very difficult at times. If you played those Cute Knight games from a while back then you will like this game, but you most know it is still very different from the original style.

												Long Live The Queen is the first ""Visual Novel"" I've played I didn't expect much when I entered it, I even thought I wouldn't like it. It sounds quite boring, but belive me, it's not. In this game you play as guess who? The Queen, or rather the soon to become queen. Her mother died, and the royal law grants her the queendom, however she must turn 15 first. And this is where your game starts, you start as the 14 year old soon to be queen, and your only goalis to keep you alive for one year, until coronation day! Now to gameplay, since this is a visual novel all you do is press buttons and read. But there are a lot of buttons, first you have classes, and I'm not talking about RPG classes but rather school classes, that you attend to raise your skills in agility, history, faith, etc. These skills will be useful in one way, events. Every week you will have certain events happen to you, and these events can be a problem, unless you have enough skill points. And belive me, you will have to re-try this a lot of times, because in the end it just comes to remembering what the events demand from you and then adapt to that in later playthroughs! And your skills are not only affected by the classes you go to, but also by the clothes you wear, when you reach a certain level in one skill, you will gain an outfit that will boost that skill. And what happen if you fail one of these events? Well, worst case: You die! You will die a lot, or maybe you will be great, but I died a lot. The graphics aint much to talk about, there are images, nothing more, good quality, kinda pretty so it's nice.The music is soothing and nice too, get's a bit repetitive though. I highly recommend this game to anyone who like... event-driven games, such as Crusader Kings 2 or other visual novels, also classic text-adventures.  "

												A quirky visual novel game with cutsey anime characters. So it's all flowers and sunshine, right? Wrong. This game is surprisingly brutal in parts and isn't afraid to make your princess die horribly in several places (and give you achievements for it!), as well as letting you dish it out as well (I took someone's head off in a duel, had someone assassinated, and a few executions as well. Fun!). The game is basically entirely made up of reading stuff and making choices on either events or your weekly schooling, which determines your skills that figure into what you can and cannot do. It can actually be difficult to beat, but once you do you probably will have the game figured out and you won't have too much trouble with that afterwards. If it does have replay value, it is to get all the achievements, which are impossible to get in a single playthrough. It will take alot of them...So is it worth it? Well it was more interesting than I expected, but it's still less a game and more a choose your own adventure book. If you like that sort of thing, this may be worth looking at. :)			"

												It's quite a small game with lovely, cute art and dialogue. But even though it is small, it seems you have several ways to reach the end or by meeting your end. The basic story is that your mother, the queen, died and in 1 year you will be crowned the new queen of the realm. However, you need to survive by making the right choices. Every turn you pick 2 attributes you want to level, followed by an event. The events are always the same except if a specific skill is high enough to know what you are doing. This makes it in a way less random and after playing it a few times, you will know what is to come most of the times.However, the more you play, the more you will learn about the people, the land, your allies, your enemies, etc. This can somewhat give you more reason to play and increases the replayability. Otherwise, when you finished the game once, you are pretty much done, which can be fast as turns are done by weeks. So you have 52 turns before the game is over. Beter spend your decisions wisely.While the game has lovely graphics and dialogue, it certainly is not Princess Maker (A game which I played a lot during my childhood), which I hoped it was the first time I saw this game appearing on steam. Nevertheless, I certainly recommend this game if you like a short, cute, replayable visual novel.			"

												You remember those choose your own adventure books? The ones that had you flipping to each end of the book, killing you in like a billion diffrent ways? Well, this is like that, but with Princess Maker.You are the princess of magical mystery brittain, who just took over the throne after her mother's passing. You need to train yourself in everything from economics to sword figthing to poisons, for both fun and profit.  During your adventures of queen-ing you will be assasinated, stabed, tenticle'd, blowned up, and more, varying on your skills and choices in managing your kingdom.I won't spoil the big story points of the game, but it's a pretty interesting story. It factors in political intigue, dealing with peseants, and not geting murdered, but the story and the game don't take it's self all that seriously, resulting in less frusturating deaths and more 'whoops, all of my blood is outside of me now! Better try again'.Also, you get various outfits to dress your princess in. The Millitary outfit is best outfit.			"

												Quite a nice little game. Not as in-depth as one would like, but the number of possible outomes to events as well as different paths is staggering. However, to expand upon my early statement, things are not random nor do they allow for more flexibility when learning skills, so it is very hard to actually do anything new. For instance, I may not have enough Lore or Foreign Affairs to know this one thing because I only had a day to study two skills. Perhaps an increase in classes per day could overcome this. All in all, a fantastic game, and I'm right now starting my military despot run. I will take my people into civil war hereby unknown to the world.			"

												This game is Persona meets Tsukihime. If that description means anything to you, you should buy this game. Long Live the Queen has surprisingly good gameplay, especially considering that it's a visual novel. The mechanics give you the feeling that you're plotting and planning (not just navigating a tree), and every bit of knowledge that is beyond your reach will make you paranoid.The mechanics mesh well with the story to create a a feeling that you're making decisions, and not just clicking options or increasing stats. The writing is also top notch, which allows the game to cover very dark subjects with a light tone.The central mechanic revolves around skill checks. You have around 42 distinct skills grouped into 14 sets of 3, that you can chose to increase each week by studying. The rate at which you learn a skill is based upon other skills you've learned in that set and category, and is significantly based upon your mood. Elode's mood will help and hinder your rate of learning significantly. You change Elode's mood by doing various activities, which makes the game feel a bit like Persona, but most activities modify multiple moods at once, which gives moods some inertia. So when you're playing you need to think carefully about what mood you want to be in next, and how you'll get there.The writing for this game is wonderful. The aesthetics of the game and the introduction will tend to make you too naive your first play through, until some offended noble draws a sword and slits a criminal's throat right in front of you. There is no graphic violence, but the violence described is intense, and it will make you paranoid and fearful, even after you're done with the game.			"

												Absolute gem of a game, really can't recommend this enough. It's a sort of visual novel with many branching plots and you must guide Elodie, the soon to be Queen through the following year safely to her coronation. Every week you choose skills to advance and have to deal with various situations in the kingdom (which is where all the story comes in). Your chosen skills then affect how you can deal with things. Elodie is quite endearing but despite the cutesy artistic style this is anything but. Your death is assured with various assassination attempts, murders, accidents, monsters and so on ready to bring about your untimely demise. You can play in a vast variety of ways giving this huge re-playability. Replaying is a must if you want to see the huge variety of paths this story can take.The music is quite fittign and really adds tot he mood. When something tragic is going to happen appropriate music plays, something sad starts - sad music start, really adds to the feelings you get from the story.Gem of a game, really hope there is a sequel of sorts. Totally recommend this, it is a fantastic game, don't let it remain hidden!			"

It has A LOT of trial and error, and so if that is not your kind of cake then don't take a slice. Overall the game is pleasant, and has a lot of replayability. The endings are good, but the gameplay is quite meticulous. Everything you do will make a difference, and it can be very difficult at times. If you played those Cute Knight games from a while back then you will like this game, but you most know it is still very different from the original style. Art has gotten better, and the gameplay is more complicated.			"

												This is a short game if you're quick to grasp what to do to 'win'. There's the thing though, for me this game isn't about making it until the end, it's about being able to discover all the story behind it, get all the achievements and seeing all the endings. I haven't played much and I've already 'won', so if that is all you care about I wouldn't bother with this game as you'll probably either get tired of it or won't really feel it was worth your time.Now that's out of the way, I absolutely loved how you could change the way the story developed. It's been a lot of fun trying to play in all sorts of crazy and spontaneous manners to see what happens. If you like exploring different options and discovering new things each time you'll definitely like this game. It's true some skills end up being pretty useless and can be substituted by others, but I consider that part of the process of learning how the game develops, making you realize how you should spend your points to achieve different outcomes.All in all it's a fun game, I recommend it ;)			"

												Like text based games? Like games where you can die alot? Well lo and behold, Long Live the Queen. With various other nobles out to kill you after your Mother suddenly passes away, it's up to you to build up your stats like in the Princess Maker series. Whether you live or die will be decided by various skill checks like that in a D&D game, although some trial and error is involved. Those who know the brutality of old politics should know what to expect (with a side of sorcery). With various plotlines and deaths possible. This game is sure to keep you busy for awhile.			"

												A fairly deep and engrossing game of making choices and facing the consequences later on. It has the trappings of a cutsie visual novel, but its actually a very cut-throat strategy game. Its very simply about choosing what skills to level up, which can vary based on your mood, but choosing the right thing at the right time is critical to not ending up with a sword in your chest. Events unfold, and based on what you know you may pass or face different choices.Its hard not to want to immediately see if you'd made different choices in skills if you could have achieved a different outcome. Saving regularly is  recommended. I managed to reach a number of deaths with my story before I felt it was best to scrap everything and start from the beginning again with what I had learned. I figure it will take a number of playthroughs to reach the various story threads and perhaps find one that leads to a good outcome.			"

Witness so many deaths you will think you are in an animated version of Bill Murray's Groundhog Day. Though it looks girly it takes real skill to make it to coronation day. Sound interesting? Buy the game and answer the ultimate question... Do you have what it takes to become queen?			"

												I recommend this game IF it is on sale, and in spite of the fact that it is way, WAY, ****WAY**** too short. It has an interesting story, good writing, standard high quality iconic anime art design, plenty of ""choose your own adventure"" paths to take during the year in which you ""graduate"" from Princess to Queen, and a satisfying amount of humor.The problem is that at the very moment you really start to enjoy the game, right at the moment you become Queen and you think ""Ok, now things are really going to get interesting!"" -- BLAM, THE GAME ENDS. Seriously, I'd only been playing for an hour and I was really getting excited that the game had the potential to be a really GREAT game... and that was it. Game over. Thanks for playing this incredibly short story. Yeah, ok, there is a little replay value if you want to see all the different ways to fail, and all the different outcomes that the game displays to you as text AFTER you become Queen... but that's not very much at all. I wanted to rule, to deal with the consequences of the ""setup"" that I'd just played, to see the results of my choices, and to make many more choices. The game felt very much like a shareware demo -- ""If you want to play the real game as the Queen, then buy the full game.""...or perhaps more appropriately:""I know we said ""Long Live the Queen"", but what we meant was, ""Long Live the Queen perhaps, if you make the right decisions in the 1 hour 'Choose your own adventure' Princess-Graduating-to-Queen time window during which this game takes place and the long life of the Queen takes place entirely in your own imagination after it says Game Over.""At 10 dollars this game is a complete INSULT. At the 2 dollars I got it for during the Steam Summer Sale it was a MARGINALLY acceptable value. But there should have been a game to play after the intro was over.			"

												The best way to put this game is ""lacking"". While the concept is decent enough, the game isn't long enough to make use of the varied stat building outside of ""Different ending here, different outcome there"", and that pales in comparison even to the most simple of Visual Novels that get by on only different endings, especially since the most variation in these comes in the form of....death?If I wanted to die for different dialogue, I'd go play Dark Souls. I wouldn't get the dialogue but HEY, I'd die a lot. The story is meh...no, almost nonexistant to the point where you won't care about it enough for it to matter. It tries to have RPG like mechanics but really, this is just a royal version of Cute Knight with a lot more stats to level that have no meaning and no dungeon crawling.I need more than this, and this doesn't offer it to me.

How do I demand sacrifices? WHERE IS THE TENTACLE DEATH?Until I find these things out, I cannot feasibly stop playing this game.I reccomend this to... really anyone who likes storyboard games, or enjoys games driven by plot and not action.

												Now, I know this might look like ""Anime Princess Hentai ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" or whatever the kids call it these days. I know that some people might lose their manhood playing this game. It's worth it. Long Live The Queen is one of the deepest Social Sims I've played in a long time. Each and every choice you make matters, and your stats are vital in order to achieve your goal of not dying. While you might think that ""Not dying is a pretty easy thing"", or ""Wow, this game looks easy as ♥♥♥♥"", or maybe even ""Man, i'd ♥♥♥♥ that fourteen year old"", you'll realize that you were completely wrong once you play the game (Except for ♥♥♥♥ing a child oh my god why would you-). This is a truly challenging game, but is still very fun and i'd recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge or is itching for a good sim to play.			"

												I bought the game during a sale and got a loooot more enjoyment out of it than I initially expected. It's great fun to spend the first while playing the full game through, trying to figure out how to reach coronation without falling prey to unfortunate events (they usually result in your death, but there are other fates that are unsatisfying enough to make you want to try again, too!). Once you've gotten to coronation once or twice, the list of deaths-I mean!-endings is an interesting checklist to complete (I only have one left!), and some of the achievements sound pretty interesting and fun to unlock as well. I'm saving heavily now to be able to tweak my skills without having to restart from scratch, but at this point even if I don't manage to get them all I'm pretty happy with my purchase and looking forward to trying out other games from the developer.Edited to add: Playing other VNs is helping me better understand why this one is so good. What you choose to study every week has a clear, visible impact on what may happen during the following week(s), because you see what skills are being checked. You can play a very different game depending on what skills you choose to focus on (e.g., I had a go at being nice the first time around and after the humiliating ending it led me to, I ended up putting all my points in military and executing everyone given half a chance in the next run-through ;) Which opened up new storylines I'd had no visibility in until then). You can have spies and send them out to do your bidding. There is no romance as a central plot point and choosing to marry someone (or not) is a more tactical decision. The ""default"" plot also makes it obvious that there are other storylines you might be interested in unlocking (e.g. the birthday party, Briony) to explore the game/world/deaths even further. Basically playing other games is making me like this one even more :-)			"

												This game is awesome!First impression: great... looks like some Barbie- or My litle Princess- stuff.But you have so many options. And you are wondering ho it might be. And you give it a try.And then it happens. Suddenly you are the princess. You don't care what happens in reallife. You are the princess. And you don't know what you shall train. Best would be, if you could learn all the same time. Because you need it. The world is full of danger. Everyone want's to kill you. Or to marry you. Or to marry you to kill you later. But there are also a few moments when you get gifts. Rarely moments. Some choclate or bling bling for your neck. But then again - only to marry you.I guess every little girl wants to be a princess. Maybe this game changes that. The life of a princess seems not so funny anymore to me. It is hard work, so many decissions only to die and die and die. Seriously, you die a lot in the game. THe frist deads, you might think, ""ha, I just reload a few weeks back, and train this time the one thing, and all we be good"". Mh, I'm sorry, I'm the one, who has to tell you that, but - nothing will be good. You will die anyway. Or you will be the slave of someone. Or someone you love will die. You will have to try harder. And yeah, forget about to go a few weeks back. Restart it. And don't wonder if you die even earlier this time...This game is/was my biggest surprise! Okay, I didn't had big expectations, but this game is anyway the best game I saw the whole year. Maybe even the best of the last two years. It might not be a game you will play your whole life again and again (like maybe Tetris or Super Mario 3) but I love this game and recommend it to everyone, who is bored of the giant amount of game clones today, without any new ideas or even any story.

You can die in oh so many ways and get to change clothes on the way there. It's all about decisions... And even if you make it to  your coronation, the future is uncertain with many different endings to the game. Yeah, I'd buy it again. Will probably play it again too. Click click!			"

												So, it's your birthday in 40 weeks.... All you need to do is stay alive... But why does it have to be so hard. Like an old choose your own adventure Long Live the Queen is procedurally generated based on your choices and stats at the time of those rolls and checks. You get to advance two stats per week and it's a delicate balancing act depending on what you plan to do this time round. One thing you can't do though, is generalise. After so many playthroughs you realise you need to have a plan. If you don't want to fight you can manage through diplomacy, you can kick the attackers asses before they hurt you or even turn full magical girl, but specialisation is good. Like you might find in a Visual Novel there is a romance aspect to your developing plot. You can choose a king (or a queen if you're into that kinda thing) that will marry you after your coronation. But Unlike most visual novels, it's very much a footnote at the end. Honestly I found that it was a lot more rewarding trying to find all the ways to die. XDStabbed, burned, strangled, shot. There are a dozen or so different ways you can ultimately end at either the hands of your Enemies, your people or the nobles who lurk at your back. Either way, it's a complex maze of decisions that will give you hours of gameplay if you're determined to survive. XD			"

												The following two things made Long Live The Queen well worth the price for me:1) It was so creative in its applications of the skills you can choose to develop within the game. It's never quite clear how your choices are going to affect your survival chances--until it's too late, leaving you scrambling for a save file where you didn't make that seemingly innocuous fatal error! Really keeps you on your toes, but it also takes a certain weight off decision making, because you really can't plan that far in advance, so you don't have to worry about making too ""wrong"" a choice. That isn't to say you can't be strategic. The game is balanced in that as long as you cover several bases, you can come back from almost anything (provided you have a close enough save point :P).2) The impressive depth of the story (various important characters don't even show up in certain playthroughs) also allows for massive replayability, with different routes feeling like very different experiences. This has the additional perk of making the chasing down of the many simple but sometimes elusive achievements not like a chore and more like a treasure hunt.Basically, Long Live The Queen is a really well executed choose-your-own-adventure game that I keep playing over and over again, trying to get that 100% completion, all the while having a great time and being majorly impressed at how it doesn't seem to be quite the same game every time I go through it.

												It's hard not to love the dark sense of humor underlying this ""Princess Maker"" update.  You play a 14 year old girl who rules in an apparently matrilineal society (your living father is totally useless for anything but remarrying).  Your job is to not-die.  While not-dying you can tackle a number of set challenges in a variety of ways (there's seldom only one combination of skills that will do the job), marry the suitor of your choosing (including other ladies, if you like) and spend your free time murdering animals or playing bocci ball with senior citizens.  In my first playthrough, I took an arrow to the lung on my way to a 15 y/o girl's birthday party.In my second, I became a murderous despot, sank a fleet of ships with magic then married my maid and got her a diamond bondage collar.You catch on quick :)			"

The end result had over ten sheets of paper with my findings on it... then of course I discovered the online walkthrough but that's another story... however the point is I spent much of my time making strategies and of course dying but it was all in good fun!

												Become a magical girl, learn to wield a sword, develop a web of spies and grow to be a cunning military strategist, or, more likely, upset the wrong duke and end up a red smear on the ballroom floor. This is a game that is very fun to play but rather hard to win, but multiple playthroughs are rewarding and the script is versatile and enjoyable, so that's not such a bad thing. The key is sometimes as simple as understanding that the cooler and flashier skills aren't all you need; you may be a genius at naval warfare, weaponry and field medicine, but if you've been neglecting to practice your swimming then maybe personally overseeing that battle from the helm of your flagship isn't going to go so well.

												Long Live The Queen, a strategy based choose your own ending visual novel is a deceivingly entertaining game experience. The backstory is well written as is the lore for the kingdom and the realm which you are thrown into as a young princess. The objective of the game is simply survival, with underlying themes related to the affairs of the realm. It manages to keep these politics interesting as it mixes humor, creative storytelling and a broad array of options for the player to decide the princess' fate.  The gameplay of this game involves making choices, most of these choices revolve around what you choose to study, as well as what options you select in dialogue, these two aspects decide your survival.The bad however is that some of the methods of avoiding death or decisions made based on lack of research (studying) are nonsense, although this does add a degree of humor and certain attributes are favored for survival. Additionally despite the broad selection of choices, many of which lead to premature death, there is a very limited survival route, meaning as you replay the game you end up following the same path to progress as certain progressions in terms of events are linear. That makes the first playthrough the best experience with this game, with diminishing returns. The game duration is only a couple hours depending on how successful you are at navigating through the game. I recommend this game conditionally if you enjoy choose your own ending style visual novels or text adventures, otherwise it likely won't appeal to you.			"

												Long Live the Queen has been a pleasant surprise to me. I had somewhat moderate expectations for this game and I was blown away by it.This game can be very challenging on the first playthrough (I know I'm not the only one who came to a dead end and had to start over), but once you get to know the major events that will unfold and you prepare yourself accordingly, you'll manage to survive long enough to reach the end of the game, typically on your second playthrough.But that's not the end of it. I'll dare say that's where the real fun starts. Just by beating the game once or twice you'll barely scratch the surface of this game. You'll realize that there's much more to see because you'll be missing tons of achievements, epilogues, and deaths (yes, even ""collecting"" diferent kinds of deaths can be fun and a real challenge). You'll start wondering what will happen if you focus on learning different skills and how the storyline will change if you do. What if I become a military genius? Should I embrace the power of Lumen? If I'm a ruler, I should improve my social skills, so what will happen if I do? This kind of questions will surely arise if you have enjoyed the gameplay, and they'll make you start over and over just to satisfy your curiosity and further enjoy the game. So if you get hooked as much as I did, you can easily pass the 20h mark and still have things to try and achievements to unlock.Still, it's not a game for everyone, but if you don't mind (or even enjoy, as I have to admit I do) the cutesy artstyle, you can bear with some repetition (there's a skip button thankfully), and you appreciate games where your choices really matter, you'll probably have an enjoyable time with it.

												The following two things made Long Live The Queen well worth the price for me:1) It was so creative in its applications of the skills you can choose to develop within the game. It's never quite clear how your choices are going to affect your survival chances--until it's too late, leaving you scrambling for a save file where you didn't make that seemingly innocuous fatal error! Really keeps you on your toes, but it also takes a certain weight off decision making, because you really can't plan that far in advance, so you don't have to worry about making too ""wrong"" a choice. That isn't to say you can't be strategic. The game is balanced in that as long as you cover several bases, you can come back from almost anything (provided you have a close enough save point :P).2) The impressive depth of the story (various important characters don't even show up in certain playthroughs) also allows for massive replayability, with different routes feeling like very different experiences. This has the additional perk of making the chasing down of the many simple but sometimes elusive achievements not like a chore and more like a treasure hunt.Basically, Long Live The Queen is a really well executed choose-your-own-adventure game that I keep playing over and over again, trying to get that 100% completion, all the while having a great time and being majorly impressed at how it doesn't seem to be quite the same game every time I go through it.

												The game trailer on Steam says it very well!  You guide the princess Elodie on her 40 week journey to coronation by choosing, week by week, what classes she will take and what skills she will build.  In addition, there are a number of events during the week where you get to choose how Elodie will handle them, which often impacts what skills she can build, or at least how effeciently she'll be able to build them.  Some events will always happen no matter what, while many others happen in reaction to the way you handled previous events.  Many of these events are deadly.Within that framework, there's a lot of player choice and immense replay value.  It's impossible to build all of the skills in a single play through, and it's very difficult to anticpate which skills will be the most important when you first start out.  It will probably take a few tries to get Elodie all the way to her big day without her being poisoned, stabbed, shot, or blown up.  Even when you do, though, the game still has more to offer.  As the ending screen reminds you, Elodie's story doesn't have to end this way, there are many other options to explore.  And with each playthrough taking only a few hours, why wouldn't you at least try, just to see what happens?			"

												A fun and challenging little number.  It's basically a royalty simulator in which you must decide what to study up on between rounds to affect the overall outcome.  You get to make some decisions, but most are made for you depending upon what you know at that moment.  Spend too much time studying one thing, and you may find yourself at the mercy of an unforeseen event that you know nothing about!  While we're on that point, there are many interesting and varied ways to die in the game, and have to start from scratch.  At one point, I found myself going down pathways that were sure to net me a new and novel demise, just to see...Anyway, it's loads of fun, simple to pick up on, and takes generally 30 minutes to an hour to play, depending upon how quickly you get yourself killed.

It's worth it. Long Live The Queen is one of the deepest Social Sims I've played in a long time. Each and every choice you make matters, and your stats are vital in order to achieve your goal of not dying. While you might think that ""Not dying is a pretty easy thing"", or ""Wow, this game looks easy as ♥♥♥♥"", or maybe even ""Man, i'd ♥♥♥♥ that fourteen year old"", you'll realize that you were completely wrong once you play the game (Except for ♥♥♥♥ing a child oh my god why would you-). This is a truly challenging game, but is still very fun and i'd recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge or is itching for a good sim to play.			"

												This is one of my favorite games ever!One of the things I love most about this visual novel is the fact that the choices ACTUALLY matter... like, a lot. What classes you take matter. What you do over the weekend matters. Who you talk to matters. Your mood matters. What outfit you wear matters. Everything - every little, miniscule thing you do - matters a lot and greatly impacts the story. Elodie faces a lot of difficult decisions and tasks, which makes your choices feel very important. I would sometimes analyze the same dialogue box for several minutes trying to decide which route to go. You may die a lot when you start playing the game... but the challenge is what kept me wanting to play!Also, when we get right down to it, I just enjoy the story. It is rich with detail and quite exciting. Plus, the protagonist is compelling. Elodie is a character who interests me and makes me want to look deeper into her life. I loved the thrill of being a 14-year-old royal and knowing death could be lurking around any corner, yet having to venture on and try to make the best of every situation.The options for romance are awesome. I adored how there are the traditional ""queen marries a worthy gentleman when she takes the throne"" paths as well as paths for same-sex partnerships and even no partnerships/marriage at all. Nice!The only criticism I have really is the classes. I feel like the game gives you ALL THESE CHOICES for what classes to take, and only about half of them are ever relevant (at least in the paths I've taken). Why even include them at all? Just to confuse? I don't know. Anyway, buy this game! It's the best visual novel ever... I'm convinced that even people who usually hate visual novels could get into this one.			"

At its heart, this is more a mechanical game than a visual novel - you will absolutely be spending most of your time growing and balancing stats to try to see your way through coronation.Accept that you will die. Probably many times. You probably won't see it coming and it won't be fair. Make liberal use of save slots and the text skip function and soldier on.

Yes, this game is hard... despite of the anime looks and all. Having finally completed this game less than three hours after so many hard decisions and after so many deaths... (That many deaths will make you more and more curious on beating this game.) My princess finally survived till the coronation day with a Historical-savvy, Political-aware, Medically-educated, Military Strategist, Spiritual and Lumen-attuned Queen...

												Princess Maker Lite.  At least, that's what I wanted Long Live The Queen to be.  It actually plays more like a visual novel with a character building game attached to it.  A friend of mine called it pattern recognition, but that isn't exactly accurate, either.  There's trial and error, certainly, but it isn't strictly linear, and there's usually more than one way around any given major event.  The game also contains plenty of secret side content you can only see if you trend and manage your skills carefully, so it isn't a matter of simply save scumming your way to all the unlocks like your average visual novel.  (Though I certainly suggest keeping saves up to a few weeks back for strictly non-exploratory playthroughs.  Playing without a save to fall back on can also be an entertaining experience.) One of the major features of Long Live The Queen is all the varied ways you can get yourself killed.  In Princess Maker II, for example, you can constantly throw your daughter into the crucible and she'll (usually) be okay.  Death to Elodie, the Queen to be, usually comes swiftly and, at least for your first few playthroughs, often at unexpected times.  One way to avoid them is to avoid the obvious situations where your skills don't fit the situation, but it's never a guarantee the reaper won't show up.  The game is short enough, at 30-odd turns, to make death more entertaining than infuriating, and also adds extra pressure to focus on the skills necessary to get the kind of happy ending you want. Unfortunately, the shortness is also why I can't suggest the game at full price.  It is a fun distraction with plenty of replayability, but what it offers can't really match the classics I was hoping it could recreate.  The Princess Maker series did have the benefit of corporate backing, however, and this is my sole disappointment.  You have little to lose by picking this title up on sale!			"

												This is one of my favorite games ever!One of the things I love most about this visual novel is the fact that the choices ACTUALLY matter... like, a lot. What classes you take matter. What you do over the weekend matters. Who you talk to matters. Your mood matters. What outfit you wear matters. Everything - every little, miniscule thing you do - matters a lot and greatly impacts the story. Elodie faces a lot of difficult decisions and tasks, which makes your choices feel very important. I would sometimes analyze the same dialogue box for several minutes trying to decide which route to go. You may die a lot when you start playing the game... but the challenge is what kept me wanting to play!Also, when we get right down to it, I just enjoy the story. It is rich with detail and quite exciting. Plus, the protagonist is compelling. Elodie is a character who interests me and makes me want to look deeper into her life. I loved the thrill of being a 14-year-old royal and knowing death could be lurking around any corner, yet having to venture on and try to make the best of every situation.The options for romance are awesome. I adored how there are the traditional ""queen marries a worthy gentleman when she takes the throne"" paths as well as paths for same-sex partnerships and even no partnerships/marriage at all. Nice!The only criticism I have really is the classes. I feel like the game gives you ALL THESE CHOICES for what classes to take, and only about half of them are ever relevant (at least in the paths I've taken). Why even include them at all? Just to confuse? I don't know. Anyway, buy this game! It's the best visual novel ever... I'm convinced that even people who usually hate visual novels could get into this one.			"

												A delightful take on a rarely-seen genre, Long Live the Queen falls into the ""raising sim"" category of  life-simulators, and appears to take inspiration from one of the more famous game series within that uncommon genre, Princess Maker.The essence of the game is relatively simple: it is played in a series of weeks, during each of which you must pick two topics of study - skills - for Elodie, and an activity for free time.  As the game progresses, events occur which provide pass/fail test for said skills, either individually, multiples totaled, or sequentially, and the results of passing or failing can lead to everything from getting or missing a bit of information all the way to...well, let's just say it's not called ""Long Live the Queen"" for nothing.There is a *very* wide selection of skills available to choose from, and unlike other sims of a similar nature (or ""monster trainer"" games), you don't have to deal with certain skills being decreased when you train others.  Rather, the mood system provides a similar hazard; based on Elodie's mood, certain skills get a bonus to their training, while others suffer a penalty.  And to mention in advance, no mood is good for studying Economics, so don't bother searching for one.Beyond that, the characters (while all anime-esque) are varied in personality, motivation, and likability, and Elodie herself is sympathetic and adorable, the sort of character that inspires protective instincts - and which evokes a certain pride when she becomes more capable, ideal for a game like this.The game is all-around a delight to play; depending on how you raise her, Elodie can be naive or savvy, powerful or frail, elegant or tomboyish, or all these things together.  There is plenty of replay value to the game, since there is no single ""perfect"" path, and your decisions (and training) have a large effect on what happens.  Will your nobles rise up against you?  Will you withstand assassination attempts?  Will you make peace or war with neighboring countries?  Who will you marry, if you live that long?  While the game doesn't have quite as diverse a set of endings as certain others in the genre - after all, Elodie is to be crowned Queen - there remains abundant variety in how you get to that end goal (or die trying), and what happens after.

												Anime Princess Death Simulator.Don't judge a book by its cover.The game involves Princess Elodie (the playable protagonist) learning about the country she’s soon to rule called Nova. You have to guide Princess Elodie through different lessons while balancing her emotions and handing political, economical, foreign and inner affairs.Oh, you also have to avoid untimely death and make it to Princess Elodie’s coronation, which is no easy task. (There’s a reason there’s an achievement for living through the year of training.)There’s countless different ways you can go about for literally every event in the game. You can be an elegant and graceful queen; a military strategist who strikes fear into the other kingdoms; a powerful sorceress with a cute outfit; a cruel dictator ruling with an iron fist a la Marie Antoinette— your subjects can even cause a revolution against you if you choose this path!While you may succeed in some areas, you’ll fail in others. You will have to make choices for the good of the people (such as having an arranged marriage) and others for your life, despite them not being the best or morally right thing to do.You truly rule like Machiavelli wanted.

												Long Live The Queen (LLTQ) is a visual novel with the addition of a rather big skill tree, with skills affecting both the choice of decisions as well as the outcome of many situations. Failure (as in having your skill not high enough) often results in the death of the protagonist Elodie, whom the player controls/takes actions for.The goal of the game is to survive long enough for Elodie to become crowned queen and the game is not short of obstacles planted in your way and killing Elodie off in quite a few ways, including but not solely consisting of being penetrated by arrows, killed by monsters, stabbed, getting the skull cracked or being poisoned. You as the player must send her to the appropriate classes (which will raise related skills) and have an eye on her mood, which may shift according to how she spends her weekends, whom she talks to and what happens around her and concerning her, and which affects at which rate she can learn a skill, where the right mood can more or less double the progression and the wrong mood can completely nullify any efforts in a skill's progression as long as it persists.While the main selling point seems to be said skill tree and the ever existing threat of being murdered, I did not find it particularly appealing. I cannot deny that it kept me going until my first hard earnt coronation, but my main problem with this system is that it is basically the traditional decision making of visual novels in disguise, which I suppose is there to add artificial difficulty, but it does not. It just lengthens the game rather unnecessarily.Since it's impossible for you to know what skills may or may not be necessary to avoid being brutally murdered, it comes down to trial and error most of the time. Even then, if you know why you died because a specific skill wasn't high enough, going back to a previous save and trying to raise that skill in time won't necessarily help because you either cannot get it high enough in time or you simply succeed in the situation only to find yourself in a new one where you die because another skill wasn't high enough and the whole process starts again.I'd like to illustrate this with two examples that struck me as particularly annoying and uncalled for (very minor spoilers inbound). If you just want to continue the review, skip those.####################################At one point in the game, you will most likely face a war on sea. You can decide whether or not to lead your fleet personally or let them fight on their own. My Elodie being a strategic mastermind with all Military skills maxed out would lead the charge, of course. So I made preparations and the next week we sailed off. I was ready for a hard battle, with the enemy outnumbering us (a predicament that could have been avoided if I had invested in Divination way earlier in the game, granted, but how would I have known that).Apparently I could have also studied magic and become a Lumen (a speallweaver in this game), to support the fleet with magical artillery fire (which would be unsufficient with just Elodie, I learnt much later).Fear not, Elodie has studied great battles and is a master tactician, surely we can somehow turn the tide. Ooops, I didn't invest in climbing, so she failed to get up the mast to give orders using her binoculars. Our fleet was almost completey wiped out, we had to retreat (because her tactical foresight was well enough, otherwise Elodie would have died on the seas unless her swimming was good enough). What? Noone could help her up? Because a princess isn't a master tree climber our fleet failed to get the right orders? And how could I have possibly known that?The other event is a more or less final battle in the game, in case your hold got invaded. You are being challenged to a duel by an enemy Lumen. If you accept and you aren't a Lumen, someone else will sacrifice themselves for you. If you are but your magic is not high enough, you die.So I thought, I'll restart the game and become the best Lumen there is, surely I'll be able to hold them off this way. I did, I maxed out all related Lumen and Faith skills and all the other ones required to survive long enough. I started the duel and the game told me our powers were equal, so Elodie would need to come up with a trick to defeat him. I was given the choice to either conjure a magic sword and attack him or try to dazzle him to prepare for a finishing blow.Since I hadn't trained in swords, being a Lumen and all, and figuring I'd most likely have to pass a skill check, I decided to try to dazzle him. Being a masterful Lumen, Elodie had studied the effects of light and reflection, it seemed rather promising. But alas, the dazzling failed, because Elodie's Decoration skill wasn't high enough. Wait, what?The weeks of studying of the magic arts and mysteries, the attunement of mind and body, all in vain because I didn't also instruct her to learn about flower arrangements. She died.####################################While I like the idea of combining rather curious skills to effect, the fact that you can't possibly know what skills you need and even then how high you need them totally nullifies the point of it all for me and reduces it to simple and tedious trial and error and going back to previous points to try the same thing again.Related to that is that skills cannot be progressed higher than 50 unless you invest at least 25 in each skill of the corresponding category. But I found 50 to be utterly worthless because every important skillcheck failed and of course I don't know by how much. So in order to really use a skill, you will have to invest in the whole skill category, which is at least another 50 points (which translates to 1-5 ingame weeks on a game length of 40 weeks), which then leaves you open to die for other reasons.It would be okay if you could finish the game (as in live to your coronation) with any given skillset, but at least in the games I played there are certain key points where Elodie will die if you didn't pick one of the selected skills that can save her.The story in itself isn't very complex or particularly compelling. With there being so many characters of rather tangential importance and Elodie merely being a mold to be shaped into whatever you choose to, there isn't really any character with huge depth you could relate to and the game ends after 40 weeks at maximum, which is rather short once you skip the known dialogue.So why do I recommend this game?Because after I finished it regularly, which took me about 5-6 hours (in which I had fun, don't get me wrong), I looked up cheat codes to use in the ingame console. I raised all of Elodie's skills to 100, so I would automatically pass every skillcheck and the game's outcome became purely dependent on my choices. It played like a classical visual novel and I enjoyed it immensely. Exploring the different paths lead to some very hilarious and intriguing moments (such as being challenged to a duel by an arrogant noble only to incinerate him on the spot with Elodie giving a cheeky grin and saying 'I decline.')and there's still much to be found out. Things I couldn't have possibly been bothered to find out by dabbling with the skills. Plus, being the rather potent soon-to-be queen felt refreshing from all the helplessly being murdered.Whether or not the game's price tag is justified I find hard to say. While I did have a lot of fun I can also see it getting tedious real quick. The story isn't that great and if you don't like getting Elodie killed which seems to be point of the game, you'll have a hard time. Plus, there is a lot of great visual novels out there that are completely free.I think this game is for people who are into VNs and enjoy taking the game apart, making notes on a notepad and figuring out the paths and what is needed through many iterations until they reach perfection.If you just like VNs, you may still use cheats.

												There are a *lot* of ways to fail in this game and all of them are awesome! Since there also are multiple endings with varying degree of success, it makes for a game of surprising replayability. Just playing around with your daily options to see what path you will end up with or micromanaging your time for the best yield are both fun ways to approach the game, so just do what suits your playstyle. While the art is cute, the underlying story can be more grim than you'd expect.All in all a definite recommendation for everyone fond of visual novel type games, everyone else can just check out the demo on the developers webpage.

												Despite its appearance, Long Live the Queen is not a Japanese dating sim. Instead, it's a surprisingly compelling RPG. You develop your character's skills over the course of the game and these skills determine the outcome of the game's many events. In turn, these outcomes create branches that affect how you progress through the game's narrative. Possible branches include civil wars, foreign invasions, forest adventures and chocolate-induced fatalities. If you survive until your coronation, the game's many endings explain the long-term consequences of your actions (Fallout style). As a result, there's a ton of replayability if you  want to find every possible permutation of the game's story.Don't let its look deceive you; Long Live The Queen is a game worth playing for anyone who enjoys story-driven RPGs.

												A western visual novel about a young princess' arduous survival until coronation. Don't let the cutesy design fool you - it is only there to hide a dark and complex world where everyone wants you dead or in their bed.Pros* Surprisingly mature themes, including wars, assassinations, political conspiracies, human sacrifices and forbidden romances* Replayability as long as you are curious and savvy enough with your skill checks. The main plot won't change but a whole lot of side plots will open up* The sprites are beautifully drawn and the characters are compelling if you manage to dig in their little secretsCons* You will die a lot and most of the time it will be unfair. There's really no room for failings and you will need to gauge carefully your training in each of the 40 weeks until the end of the story, which is relatively linear so each death will feel frustrating* It's really a game of mathematics and planning after learning from your errors rather than a RPG, which will catch a lot of people unaware of what they actually boughtRead some tips before starting and remember you can skip already read dialogs. Be prepared to rule the world or die trying!			"

												10/10 would and will die again. This was actually the game that got me on Steam. When I saw that it's a game where you have a tiny pink anime magical girl princess who you can craft to be everything from a vicious warlord to a silver-tounged spymaster, how could I resist, you know? This game is really endless, I've gone through so many variation and died in so many adorable and gruesome ways, killed so many people and queened so hard. This is just the right amount of twisted for me.Also, I mean, I can get a girlfriend who is adopted by magical lesbian moms and wears Sailor Venus's costume, that is truly living the dream.I'd say my one complaint about the game is, girlfriends aside, even with the extinction I have to SERIOUSLY screw Elodie over if I want her to be able to marry a woman. Like get her dad killed and everything. Elodie's Dad is a depressing, useless buzzkill so I'll trade him for a  hot wife, but that's still pretty harsh.			"

												Long Live The Queen, a strategy based choose your own ending visual novel is a deceivingly entertaining game experience. The backstory is well written as is the lore for the kingdom and the realm which you are thrown into as a young princess. The objective of the game is simply survival, with underlying themes related to the affairs of the realm. It manages to keep these politics interesting as it mixes humor, creative storytelling and a broad array of options for the player to decide the princess' fate.  The gameplay of this game involves making choices, most of these choices revolve around what you choose to study, as well as what options you select in dialogue, these two aspects decide your survival.The bad however is that some of the methods of avoiding death or decisions made based on lack of research (studying) are nonsense, although this does add a degree of humor and certain attributes are favored for survival. Additionally despite the broad selection of choices, many of which lead to premature death, there is a very limited survival route, meaning as you replay the game you end up following the same path to progress as certain progressions in terms of events are linear. That makes the first playthrough the best experience with this game, with diminishing returns. The game duration is only a couple hours depending on how successful you are at navigating through the game. I recommend this game conditionally if you enjoy choose your own ending style visual novels or text adventures, otherwise it likely won't appeal to you.			"

												If you like the style it's great. I loved the mix between girly pink princess and cruel death. You can really choose different education options and - a litlle- personality of your princess. You have to play again and agin to enjoy better the understerding of the consequences of your choices. You can win a lot of different ways. The events will be basically the same but you can fail or succed at different point, leading to different development. Once you unraveled the main plot points you really want to try killing your princess every possible way, discover new secret, enable new event... with the help of a guide ! The big achievement list is really a plus and give you things to look for. If you don't like replaying game with different choices to explore everything, this game is not for you. It's still quite nice to play just once and try to do as good as possible (potentially with reloading saves) but there is better games for this use. I really would like to know more game which look like this. One aspect that I especially like is that the text is never uselessly long, as it is too often the case in visual novel for my taste. The dialogue cut to chase without been bland.			"

												First, this game is hard. Or rather, extremely frustrating. There are basically two fun playthroughs : the first one, for the amount of customization and choices you can make in general, and the last one, for getting that one ending you've worked for.Everything in between is hell. Prepare to save every single week and do a lot of backtracking. There's a final boss of sorts, which serves as the major obstacle in the game and will require a lot of planning and re-planning.Other than that, it's a pretty sweet game. The gameplay is unique and the plot is fun to go through.			"

												Long Live the Queen is probably like Maple Syrup.  You will either love it or think its garbage.  The game has a lot of depth but that depth is unexplained or maybe buried in a manual that I didn't read.  The replayability of the game comes from trying to figure out the game mechanics to influence a different set of outcomes for set events.  I played through a couple of times but got bored becuase I didn't feel like grinding events to learn the formulas under the hood and I the non randomized events made it feel like a choose your own adventure book where you have to keep reading the same events over and over again till you trained your character to ""beat"" the event the way you want it.Personally not my cup of tea but i personally love folks who would ♥♥♥♥ over that kind of game since there is a lot of replayability in that you can become Queen via lot of different methods or so I am told and read.  If you can pick it up cheap and what I just said doesn't scare you then I recommened. "

												(In short: It's a decent read if you have the will to put up with trial and error. The story deserves no praise, yet it motivated enough to keep trying to 'save my people'.)This game caught me off guard. The mechanics of the game put you both in charge of what to study, somewhat like a teacher, and what to do. The results of your actions are not simply based upon which flags (past choices) you have gotten, but also 'points' in various skills, gained by studying, which determine whether or not certain choices are available, and which ones succeed or fail. The point system common in most western games (implemented very well in Cinders), but this is the first time I've seen it applied like this.It works well once you get used to it, but at times it lead to disconnects between me and the character. Part of the game becomes you trying to teach Elodie (the queen to be) what she needs to get past some event. Fortunately, there are many ways to overcome these events, like learning bad omens from divination ...or sheer knowledge. It lets the game branch out a bit more organically than specific routes, but at the cost of being able to replay it easily.I wouldn't say the artwork is bad, I mean it gets the job done... but it does nothing for me. It's cute and inoffensive at best, and bland yet inoffensive at worst. You can gain various outfits for Elodie to wear throughout the game, and they all grant bonuses to a group of stats when you use them. The 'magical girl' outfit irks me as unfitting. The concept of magic in the artwork is easily the weakest part of the aesthetics.Writing is..decent. The story itself is decent but sometimes I question whether I'm playing as an idiot. Elodie has her own personality which is greatly shown in scenes where you don't have a choice. Apparently she's a young go-getter girl with a strong will, but I have trouble understanding how this young 14 year old *sheltered-all-her-life princess*  could say, after witnessing a killing in front eyes, ""Clean this up."" (With an angry puffed out manga-style expression, at that!) While on another scene she'd think to herself  ""I don't know how to deal with handsome older men paying me compliments!"". I think my main complaint about the writing is that age-wise it's inconsistent. I finished this within 4.4 hours, that is to say, I've gotten to a 'good if bittersweet' end after 10 or so bad ends. The replay value, I'm not too sure. That depends on how many possible routes I missed, which I didn't check too thorougly as I was too focused getting through my current route correctly. I will go back to it sometime.Despite all its faults and shortcomings, I enjoyed and recommend Long Live The Queen. Not without caution, though. If you are interested, I suggest you to try the demo as this may be too 'mechanically unique' for your liking. "

												Don't be fooled by this game's ""girly"" appearance: it has many features that can be enjoyed by anyone.The dialogue is well-written and there are many twists and turns in the plot, which makes the game feel a lot like those ""choose your own adventure"" books that I used to adore as a child. The main difference between those and Long Live The Queen is that you can actually influence some of the randomness by passing skill checks, altering your protagonist's mood and making strategic long-term choices.You can perform various actions around your castle every day, and those actions will affect your mood. Afterwards, you can train your skills and get bonuses and penalties depending on your mood. For example, if you're angry you'll get a bonus for war and sport-related skills while being depressed helps you express your creativity.You have to discover all of this by yourself though, which means that there is a LOT of trial and error involved.You will die/fail a lot in this game, so you'll see that some events will always happen while others will trigger only if you train a specific skill before passing a check, or selecting a specific dialogue option. Figuring everything out will take a long time, and sometimes getting the same dialogue over and over can be tiring, but, of course, there is a skip option. (CONT. IN COMMENTS)			"

In amount of endings and plot twist, can easily rival Steins;Gate, but in lenght it pales in comparsion.And when we say massive plot twists, we mean MASSIVE. One single answer or ability check can cripple your ending and send you towards a spiral of madness and death, or maybe not? It's up to you, play, but don't play like you always do.Want to be a tyrant? So be it.Want to be a goody two shoes? So be it.Want to wield nasty♥♥♥♥♥magic?

												This game is pretty fun the first time you play, because everything is new. However, the story variates so little that if you want to play more than once or twice it's very boring. I do like that you know what's coming so you can prepare for large events by choosing the skills you'll need before hand, so LLTQ is much simpler after your first few plays.All in all this is a good game, the story is interesting even if a little repetitive, and it gives you a wide variety of choices. Most of which will lead to your inevitable death, but hey, that's life.			"

												Don't be fooled by this game's ""girly"" appearance: it has many features that can be enjoyed by anyone.The dialogue is well-written and there are many twists and turns in the plot, which makes the game feel a lot like those ""choose your own adventure"" books that I used to adore as a child. The main difference between those and Long Live The Queen is that you can actually influence some of the randomness by passing skill checks, altering your protagonist's mood and making strategic long-term choices.You can perform various actions around your castle every day, and those actions will affect your mood. Afterwards, you can train your skills and get bonuses and penalties depending on your mood. For example, if you're angry you'll get a bonus for war and sport-related skills while being depressed helps you express your creativity.You have to discover all of this by yourself though, which means that there is a LOT of trial and error involved.You will die/fail a lot in this game, so you'll see that some events will always happen while others will trigger only if you train a specific skill before passing a check, or selecting a specific dialogue option. Figuring everything out will take a long time, and sometimes getting the same dialogue over and over can be tiring, but, of course, there is a skip option. (CONT. IN COMMENTS)			"

												Don't be deceived by the cute girlish picture. This game is full of suffering, betrayal, murder, politics and other serious stuff.So this is some kind of a weird mix between a visual novel and... ahem... maybe an RPG(???) The progression of the story depends not only on instantaneous decisions (like in regular visual novels), but also on the skills that your character develops over time. In turn the efficientcy of skill development depends on the emotional state of the character, which you can influence by choosing different activities.Also the game is pretty difficult despite being a visual novel. There are so many dumb ways for your character to die. There is even a built in collection of unlockable pictures that represent different ways to bite the dust. Like achivements, but for loosing instead of succeeding.I'm positively surprised by such a weird mutation from the visual novel genre.The only minor downside in my point of view is the game's significant share of pseudoscientific nonsence. On my first (obviously failed) playthrough I was all like: ""WTF? Was I supposed to be naive enough to believe in magic in order to pass those tests and survive?"". So for me a more realistic (in this case magic-free) story would be more enjoyable, since it has a rather serious setting and seems to expect you to make rational decisions anyway. But as a whole the game is still a HUGE statisfaction.			"

												Long Live The Queen is a game with a fantastic setup and promising mechanics. It sounds fun on paper, and the writing, art, and concepts for how the game works mechanically are all pretty great; in the end, though, I just found it frustrating to play. I'd still recommend getting it on sale if the theme, premise, setting, and art are all up your alley, because you'll definitely enjoy yourself at least somewhat... but I feel like the game could've been so much more if it had leaned more into the role-playing as opposed to the tired visual novel idea of playing the game over and over again, getting tons of Bad Ends, in order to get even one Good End.On your first playthrough, planning out classes and trying to balance Elodie's mood seem like super interesting mechanics and if you're into the aesthetic of the game and the stuff you saw in, like, the Steam trailer and screenshots, you'll be thinking it's like the greatest game ever. The writing is great, the way taking classes shows you a brief overview of the progressively more advanced topics you're learning in a given subject is neat, and man, like everything about the presentation of the game itself is fantastic.You notice as you play along that you're failing like every single skill check. You might even be like ""aw man, I missed this Poisons check? Better bone up on Poisons"" — only to find that you'll like never need Poisons again for the rest of the game. (Disclaimer: I have yet to complete a successful runthrough of the game, but have spent over three hours of time in the game according to Steam.) Then you'll die from something out of nowhere that you could've never seen coming and prepared for on your first time through.""Okay,"" you think, ""I'll give it another shot. This is clearly just a mechanics'd up visual novel, anyways, so I guess I should've expected hell of Bad Ends."" On your subsequent playthroughs, you'll attempt to adjust your class schedules accordingly such as to allow you to pass checks for events that you now know are coming up from your previous playthroughs. Then, when you train for a key class, you'll get little-to-no skill points from it because you weren't watching your mood. Or worse yet, you were watching your mood and thought to make your princess as happy as possible because she starts the game all sad and depressed over the death of her mother, but as it turns out some class you wanted to take does barely anything or nothing at all for you because of the mood you're in. You search around the UI and try and find some sort of reasoning for which classes are affected by which moods — and it turns out that there is no such thing (although they [mostly] follow some sort of logic). Instead, you must either figure out which classes are affected by which moods on your own and write them down in a grid on a piece of paper... or just check the top-rated Steam guide for the game.Basically, in the end, the game becomes more of an exercise in replaying the game over and over and learning from your failures, taking notes on what worked and what didn't, in order to come up with a plan to make a successful run through the game. If this sounds appealing to you, that's fine; I was hoping for a much more role-playing-oriented experience out of the game, myself. Again, I understand that it's a relatively short game once you have the path for ""the right run"" down, and the length of the experience comes from the act of replaying it over and over again, and also it's just a more mechanically-dense visual novel, when it comes down to it. These things are all fine, but it's just not quite what I hoped for given the promise of the game from the outset and the great writing the game has and such.In summary, I feel like the game has a great setup, great art, great writing, average sound and music, and great mechanical premise... but just kind of crappy actual mechanics in the end. It's still worth playing if the theme and setting and stuff interests you, and even more so if you're willing to put up with the visual novel tropes that make several, several playthroughs a must if you want to see a non-death ending... but at the end of the day, I personally wound up finding the core gameplay systems to be frustrating and poorly thought-out.★★★☆☆			"

												The idea behind this game is rather simple.  You're the princess of a country and you have to prepare for your coronation so you can become the queen.  The problem is that some people don't want you as queen.  Some people would rather be the ruler themselves.  Some people might not have a problem with ending your life so that this could happen.So what do you do?  Well, basically you go to school every day and learn stuff in hopes of raising skills to a point where you can fend off these attacks.  The problem is, you can't expect to learn everything easily.  Your mood affects which skills you can learn and how fast you can learn them.  So how do you fix that?  Well, you have a choice of activities that can affect your mood in several ways.  Some activities open up for a very short time, some open up as the result of other skills being learned.  Other activities have desired and less desired effects (you have to take the good with the bad).If you used to like those ""Choose your own adventure"" books, this has a similar feel to it, except the plot can go a bunch of different ways depending on how you worked on your skills.  You won't just be able to say ""oh, I need to choose this so I can get the good ending"" because you have to manage your mood AND study the right courses to get to a point where that option is even available.A nice bonus for studying extensively in a certain set of courses is that you unlock a costume that boosts your skills...so now you have the added benefit of choosing an outfit to help you through a tough portion of the game.  For example, if you know that military skills are needed for an upcoming section, you can change into your military outfit and you'll stand a chance of doing better than you would otherwise.There's no stress or time limits to how you choose to play the game, and you are free to plot out how to get the best possible endings...in fact the game lets you save pretty much the entire game to a text file so you can study the choices you made and figure out what went wrong.   If you're the careful planning and analytical type, you'll probably enjoy this.  If you are the type to spin the wheel and/or flip a coin when presented with a choice, you won't last long, or if you do, you'll have no idea what it is you did to get there.  This game isn't easy...but it isn't frustrating really.  The game gives you the option of seeing which skills failed and which ones passed as the story goes along, so if you die you can see what it was you needed to prevent it from happening.  If you're hardcore, you'll turn this option off and just try to use logic, though sometimes your idea of logic will differ from the game's idea...keep in mind that this is a 14 year old girl and not you... YOU know not to eat strange food shipped to you from weird addresses, but Elodie doesn't (unless you teach her the right things)This is going to be the game I play when I'm in the mood to kick back and think instead of worrying about reaction times or aiming skill.   I just added +15 to my judgement abilities.			"

												An absolute blast to play, with room for different strategies which can all work equally well (though crippling over-specialization can lead to numerous funny deaths); this also leads to loads of replay value as the story takes radically different turns with the different play styles. The game is very harsh and mistakes made early can easily backfire weeks down the road in various ways.The only downside is that the game is remarkably short, although the replay value more than makes up for that.

												I don't know how to explain this game, it looks like a cutesy visual novel, but really it's more like a hardcore stratergy and stat management game, it will punish you and it will kill you. That's fine though you can save whenever you want. The story can play out in all kinds of different ways, trying to find all the endings, events and ways for Elodie to die is quite the task.The art style is cute, that's the best word for it, it fits the general tone of the game well but is a little under stated. The gameplay isn't exactly action packed, but if you can get past it then the task of helping the would be Queen survive until her corrination is an interesting and exciting one.Not for everyone, but if you think it might appeal to you I highly recomend it, I've certainly had a lot of fun.

												Text based games have never really drawn my eye. I prefer something more visually stimulating than mentaly. Then came Long Live The Queen. A deep, stratigic game, you really have to keep an eye on your skills. Dying will also happen. Alot. My first time was being shot with an arrow, and not knowing how to take it out without killing herself. Might want to just BS the beginning to know where the skill checks are, so you can prepare for the early game. There are 40 weeks, and I was able to bs my way to week 22. Still, a humerous and fun game. Don't expect a short session, though, once you start, you're in for the long haul. Definitly give this game a shot.			"

												Our Queen shall live long and be victorious! Long live the Queen!This is a tale of Princess Elodie, she's 14 years old Crown Princess of Nova and very charming. Sadly, her mother just died and because in the empire of Nova Queens are the ones in charge, she needs to learn about what it is to be a good Queen to her subjects. This game tells a very diffrent princess tale than any princess tales that I have heard, saw or read about. Unlike thoes tales about princess needs to be rescued and needs a husband to the happy ending, this game tells the tale of what I have always waited from a princess story. Things about how to rule and run you'r kindom and learining the valuable stuffs that princess needs to learn. Well sure we had Mulan and Pocahontas, but they are rellay not real princessess. But Elodie is, and she is going to be A (the place where the F word is) QUEEN!Good stuffThe game is challengin and fun. Cute too in it's own way and has LOTS of potential. YOU can chose what you want to do. Start a war or learn magic and kick the assassin's♥♥♥♥♥ And the costumes are pretty too. It is very likely that you're going to re-paly this multiple times for the sake of costumes.Bad stuffIt's hard. Everything you do has a side effect on something. You chose the wrong thing and you die. You have not learned the rigth skill for the lvl that it is reqruied in the test, you fail it and probably die. Moods are difficult to handle unless you look the wikia page some help to the moods and mood's skill bonuses. Even I have done it, but I don't regret it. And something about re-playing this game, well, you are going to probably re-play it too because you have died.If I would say, play this game. Even it IS hard and you can DIE in 10 diffrent ways at any time, it's worth of it. Even the price is good. It's fun, it's cute, it's charming, it's fantastic and I can go on and on and on but, I woun't. I can imaginate PewDiePie playing this game sooner or later. ;D LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!			"

												Just so you are warned, this is not a game for kids...  Because why should they have all the fun?(Seriously, just to be clear, this is really not a game for very young kids.  Older kids should be fine.)This game is not a graphical powerhouse, and the gameplay is pretty limited compared to some of today's modern games.  It is not an open world to explore for hours upon hours upon hours.  And yet, it will likely reel you in.  How?What it sets out to do, it does very, very well.  This is a simple strategy game where basically you have to find the secret formula of what to study in what order, and what actions to take to keep your little princess character alive long enough to become the queen.  Sounds simple?  Wrong!  You will find plenty of new and unexpected ways to die!  Some are difficult to avoid.  So, you try again. This is basically the gameplay: try again.  Keep trying until you get it.  For some people, this may be incredibly frustrating.  I found it to be a lot of fun. Putting aside the cartoon graphics and the magical element, the story sort of reminds me of the story of Elizabeth I and all the dangers she somehow managed to live through to become queen of England, despite the odds being against it.  I recommend giving it a try.			"

												At first glance you might think this is some horrible anime garbage aimed at people who unironically use the word ""kawaii"" in everyday conversation. And... well, yeah, you'd be right. But if you can get over that, it's actually a horrendously addictive game which is half RPG and half time management game. You'll pick skills to focus on that sound like they're the sort of thing a successful princess needs to know, only to have the game throw skill checks at you for something completely unexpected and railroad you into failure. You'll go back and learn from your mistakes, focus on different skills, only to fail a completely different set of skillchecks and get railroaded into a new and exciting failure. You'll lose a swordfight because you didn't train in athletics, you'll lose a magic fight because you didn't train in decoration, you'll naively eat poisoned chocolate because you didn't train in court manners and trade relationships, and every time you fail you'll feel compelled to start over, not make the same mistakes again, and instead make a completely different set of mistakes. And if you're really lucky or persistent, you might even manage to make it to your coronation without stumbling head first into a death which was obviously avoidable with the benefit of hindsight.

Instead, you must either figure out which classes are affected by which moods on your own and write them down in a grid on a piece of paper... or just check the top-rated Steam guide for the game.Basically, in the end, the game becomes more of an exercise in replaying the game over and over and learning from your failures, taking notes on what worked and what didn't, in order to come up with a plan to make a successful run through the game. If this sounds appealing to you, that's fine; I was hoping for a much more role-playing-oriented experience out of the game, myself. Again, I understand that it's a relatively short game once you have the path for ""the right run"" down, and the length of the experience comes from the act of replaying it over and over again, and also it's just a more mechanically-dense visual novel, when it comes down to it. These things are all fine, but it's just not quite what I hoped for given the promise of the game from the outset and the great writing the game has and such.In summary, I feel like the game has a great setup, great art, great writing, average sound and music, and great mechanical premise... but just kind of crappy actual mechanics in the end. It's still worth playing if the theme and setting and stuff interests you, and even more so if you're willing to put up with the visual novel tropes that make several, several playthroughs a must if you want to see a non-death ending... but at the end of the day, I personally wound up finding the core gameplay systems to be frustrating and poorly thought-out.★★★☆☆			"

												An absolute blast to play, with room for different strategies which can all work equally well (though crippling over-specialization can lead to numerous funny deaths); this also leads to loads of replay value as the story takes radically different turns with the different play styles. The game is very harsh and mistakes made early can easily backfire weeks down the road in various ways.The only downside is that the game is remarkably short, although the replay value more than makes up for that.

												This game is pretty fun the first time you play, because everything is new. However, the story variates so little that if you want to play more than once or twice it's very boring. I do like that you know what's coming so you can prepare for large events by choosing the skills you'll need before hand, so LLTQ is much simpler after your first few plays.All in all this is a good game, the story is interesting even if a little repetitive, and it gives you a wide variety of choices. Most of which will lead to your inevitable death, but hey, that's life.			"

												TL;DR Review at bottomGamepay and Story For gameplay it dose what it's supposed to do as a Simulation/Strategy game, with lots of choices that can make you better or wores. With classes that make you're princess better at whatever you have chosen, But if her mood becomes a probelm you can make it better by letting her play after school. Her mood can help with some classes or make it harder, try to make the best of her moods.For the story I don't have a lot... Because I haven't beat the game yet. but I got far to at lest see most of it, as a young girl try her best to make things better for the good of all people you see a lot of story as you meet new people and see old friends. But sometimes you see some of the games evil characters who are mostly just ?????.Main Character Let's start with our lovey princess elodie, Even if I haven't beating the game I still love this character the most. she has a heart as big as the moon, has love for her people, and has a mind open to what's going on in her world. but I sometimes feel odd about her, When her mood is sad she will have a sad look on her face wich makes me feel in a way sad for her, When her mood is angry she have a ???? off look as if she going to slap my face hard, But the worest is when she is afraid... she will have a face the looks as if i'm about to her in the bedroom (and it dosent help that theres a bed that can have two people in it behind her.....) But still a Very cute and lovey character <3Achievements Most of these achievements make you have to play through a lot of the story to get, but some are esay to get, one you can get very early in the game. Thats really all i have to say about achievements, I didn't play this game for them, I just played to see elodie...Cards and Badges This game has a lot of cards to get, but it's not that bad... in fact it's fun to get badges in any games! I wish I had a Long Live The Queen Badge, I haven't see any of them yet. The Cards have some pics from the game, I don't always trade, but when I do, I trade cards.TL;DRGame of Thrones if it was a visual novel.			"

												Don't watch any LPs of it, most of them are god awful face cam LPs that are really just man-children making fun of something they don't understand or take time to understand for ""lulz"".Long Live The Queen is appears to be a visual novel with a political skin, but it's much more of a political game that's skinned like a Visual Novel.  You take control of Elodie, a 14 year old princess of Nova, tasked with becoming queen after her mother died or unusual circumstances. However Nova is not a very safe nation, their are many dangers around the corner and something as innocent as chocolate can and will be the death of you.The game is very difficult as many has stated before, and if you save to much you'll not have enough time to train in stats you need for certain events, so that adds an extra layer of challenge, which is why only completing a single run though and several failed ones is an achievement for me. One of the things that make's the game very interesting is all the skills you can practice, you're never going to be able to complete every skill, and the game will check every skill several times and will have ""big"" moments where the skills will be very handy, which adds great replay-ability. However of the games short comings is the repetitiveness, the intro is always the same and the events are always the same, just with new solutions but it can be very boring at times. The art isn't particularly amazing either, most if it looks like it was made in a generator of sorts and doesn't look natural, and almost none of the faces give off any emotion and sometimes the dialogue barely does either..I can't tell if Josyln is suppose to happy, dead or just emotionally dead half the time.As a whole, the game is a good ""Visual Novel Strategy Game"" that kept me hooked and made me come back every time the DAMN BANDITS KILLED ME.

												""Putting all the sick people together? Won't that make them die even faster?""- the girl who thought that pushing an arrow through her the rest of the way would save her lifeLong Live the Queen is a fun little visual novel where the main object is to... well, live long.You will probably fail a lot. It's okay, though! Half of the fun of the game is finding all of the different ways you can die. The other half is being a ruthless dictator/pretty princess that rules with an iron fist. Or possibly with lots of magic lightning bolts. But either way, it won't be fun for your enemies. Provided you didn't die, I mean.The game also deserves credit for having a very nicely realized world, with lots of background detail that adds to its charm. The geography, history, and characterization all add up to complex land with all kinds of variables that will change your game.Seriously, though, this game is addicting. All of the different paths you can take, all of the different deaths, and, true to visual novel form, all of the different possible endings (and that's aside from the death ones!).Will you die by magic? Will you be shot? Will you eat the dreaded chocolates (answer: yes)? Or, against all odds, will you survive long enough for your coronation, and live happily ever after (possibly as an evil minion, if you play your cards tight).			"

The problem is that it's the same event everytime, so the game is repetitive to absolution.Don't buy the game - you can watch someone else play it on youtube, but even that gets boring.  The writing is terrible, and music isn't anything special, and the graphics are still images with no animation.  The drawings are cutsie anime you can find anywhere.Fun for maybe an hour, but it has no replayability and the game simulates difficulty by arbitrarily failing you at every moment.Skills range from 0 - 100, and most things require 50+ skill to succeed, so the replayability lies in how you construct your princess and finding out which skills are essential to avoid death in the first place.So yeah, not worth what I paid.

I Hope they make more like it that offer other stories and allow us to be male characters and choose from a wider array of game plot directions in the future. I will buy games of this genre from this point forward having been sold on this game. This reminds me of the choose your own adventure books I used to enjoy in my youth. Much Fun!			"

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/long-live-the-queen-game-review/Many of you may just look at Long Live the Queen and pass it off as some “girly anime game”. I too thought that the game looked a bit silly, but I was surprised by just how enjoyable it is. It’s almost a masterpiece, which is not something I’d say too easily.Long Live the Queen is essentially a visual/interactive novel, but it goes a lot more in-depth in terms of interactivity that most visual novels do. You’re tasked with getting the main character, Elodie, to her coronation as Queen of Nova without getting killed. Although the game seems incredibly childish, it’s actually quite morbid. There are several deaths that Elodie can run into, with my first one being an arrow to the side, of which my “battlefield medicine” skill was not high enough for me to survive the incident.The other half of the game, aside from making good choices, is made up of skills. Elodie can learn a variety of skills. It’s actually a bit overwhelming, the amount of different skills that can be learned. Every week, you have the choice of choosing two classes to take during that specific week, with each skill having its own class. Each of these skills is a part of a group of skills, which is a part of another group of skills. For example, the “Social” skill tree is made up of three skills: Royal Demeanor, Conversation, and Expression. Each of these breaks down even further, into three “sub-skills”. Expression breaks down into: “Decoration”, “Instrument”, and “Voice”. The four major categories for skills are: Social, Intellectual, Physical, and Mystical.During the development of the game’s story, you’ll encounter various “skill checks” during the dialogue portions of the story. Passing a skill check is always good, as it progresses the story in a positive way (and can help prevent your death). Failing a skill check usually does not matter too much, but in some scenarios, failing a skill check can actually cause your death.There’s also another major aspect to this game, that being Elodie’s mood. Her mood changes based on what happens during the storyline of the game and the choice you make at the end of the week as to what Elodie will do during the weekend. There are four sets of moods in the game, with two different emotions in each: Afraid — Angry, Depressed — Cheerful, Yielding — Willful, and Lonely — Pressured. Whichever mood is dominant determines the skill bonuses for that specific week (each “turn” in the game is another week). Each mood gives a bonus and a penalty to certain skills. The “depressed” mood gives a bonus to expression and animal handling, but a penalty to royal demeanor, conversation, and athletics, with all other skills remaining neutral. This can be used to greatly improve any of Elodie’s skills, depending on her mood that week.Long Live the Queen was a very, very fun experience. If I had to criticize the game, I’d note that the player has no idea which moods correspond to which skills in terms of bonuses and penalties (until you have that specific mood), so the use of a wiki is almost essential. I prefer to go at it and learn myself, but I could understand one using a wiki to avoid getting penalties when attending classes. Also, unless you use a wiki, you’ll have no idea when a certain skill will be required anytime during the story. You may get the hang of it after playing the game for an extended period of time though. Highly recommended!			"

												I find this game incredibly frustrating. You get killed repeatedly with no warning, and often without being able to properly appraise how you could have avoided it, or even which skills might have let you avoid it. There's really nothing to this game except playing it over and over again until you learn what precise combo of skills lets you become who you want to become, and it overall just feels like an incredible time-sink with very little reward for the player.Example - I trained to be a badass magical warrior, with high Swordsmanship, Magical attack, and Magical defence. I then lost a magical duel because I'd never studied flower arranging. I could not have known that was coming, except by doing all that, dying, and then starting -completely over- and training my princess very slightly differently.This is the bulk of Long Live the Queen's gameplay.

												I wanted to enjoy this game. I really wanted to, and maybe a little too much.I read so many nice reviews and knowing what kind of game it was I thought ""wow, this is just MY kind of game!""I might have anticipated playing the game too much, i admit it. I was soooo happy when i could get it and so impatient to try it!I finished my first playthrough in a little more than an hour, dying once or twice, but it wasn't until the second playthrough that I started HATING this game. Everything is too repetitive: the music (OH GOD, the music, I even liked it at the beginning but after a while it just stucks into your head and not in a nice way), the story, the mechanics. But it is the randomness that bothers me the most. There is no way of planning ahead, except trying (and failing) hundreds of times or checking a guide. It's kind of fun during the first playthrough and sometimes the randomness makes you giggle, but if you want to get all the achievements - it gets really annoying.tl;dr[+] the mechanicals are quite original and a very nice idea, in theory[+] the drawing style is really cute[+] the first playthrough is really fun[-] it's too random[-] it gets repetitive quiclky[-] THE MUSIC IS ANNOYING and I wanna kill somebody			"

												I'm a big fan of the type of games and don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing the game or say it isn't entertaining (I'll probably play it again, once the bitterness of dying because I don't own a dog while being the equivalent of an archmage subsides).The thing is, when I pick up a game like this one I expect to have fun discovering the multiple endings it contains, not trying my hardest not to die and then find out which ending I end up with.I understand the concept of the game is to ""live different lives, learning from last time's demise"", but when I actually played it just felt like a game of memorization; the story is kind of generic and there doesn't exist much foreshadowing in it.There should be something in the narrative that tells me certain skills might be necessary in the future, but instead it's just a game of trial and error, which becomes tiring after a number of playthroughs.My biggest gripe is that most events happen out of the blue, and as the story progresses they need bigger and bigger skill checks. The problem with this is that if you neglected said skill (or group of) you're toast; you were practically dead 10 turns ago, but you just have to keep playing until the game decides to kill you.Seeing the tweaks that have been made to the game, I believe that something could be done to help the gameplay without straying from the concept of the game. For example, starting a new game from a previous death while inheriting a part of your previous skills would make sense, while also giving it genuine replay value (other than having a list of ""things to study by turn X to not die"").This is a game for the hard-core and can actually be pretty entertaining if you enjoy that ""grinding"", but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone because of said reasons.

												This is a different type of game from what I am used too.For one you dont explore anywhere its all done with a mouse. Though you have to use your head to play this one >< You have to learn her moods and what to learn in those moods and what not to learn. So far ive died from bandits and poisoned chocolate. But I have enjoyed this game so far and it would probs be a good game for anime gamers who use their heads to play a game.			"

												LLtQ is a good game. Good, but not the best. It suffers from some repetition in that a good portion of the time you invest will be spent attempting to figure out which combinations of choices you make will lead to each ending (and avoid death in the process). The save feature cuts down on this a bit, but if you haven't had previous experience with this type of game, then you are going to be doing a lot of backtracking and starting over. On the other hand, if you know the trick to playing this sort of resource management game, you can easily earn your crown with a half-dozen deaths or less, and in just a couple of hours. The multiple endings add replay value, but you still face the same issues mentioned before. I found the art, UI, and story to be sufficiently engaging, but the music felt somewhat generic, and the $9.99 price tag seems a tad high. I would say buy this when it is on sale for maximum bang for your buck. In the meantime, if you still want to play a game like LLtQ, try the Princess Maker games. They are much more in-depth and have an RPG element to them as well.Overall, I give this game a 7/10 - good enough to own and play, bad enough to be a little picky as to when you get your copy, and put it off in favour of better games.

												This game is quite pretty, yes, but it's essentially a shorter watered-down version of one of the Princess Maker games. While it was fun for a few playthroughs, I found myself constantly comparing it to PM. It lacked the many wide and varied options of that game, the only way to raise your character, the Princess Elodie was to bring her up to become a queen, while in PM games, you can name her anything, and raise anything from a ♥♥♥♥♥ to the queen of Hell, or send your girl off on quests. You also only get one year in LLTQ, as opposed to the 8 years of game time in a round of PM. The other obvious difference between the two games is that in LLTQ, Elodie can die. And she will die. On most playthroughs.			"

Or falconry? ...Or reflexes ...divination ...battlefield medicine?! Oh come on! What the hell do I pay you people for?! Does no one check for poison these days? What were those scouts doing? Lounging under a tree? Did the carriage pass them at all on our merry way into that ambush? A peasant uprising??? Why was I not alerted earlier?! That's it. FIred. You're all FIRED!

												LLTQ is not an easy game to review. I really enjoyed the combination of seemingly light-minded Princess Maker-like character development and brutal, merciless medieval (fantasy) politics, but the problems I had with the game mechanics overshadowed the complex storylines. Maybe it's a tradition for these type of games to be extremely grindy, but the constant need of either reloading savestates or incredible amount of trial-and-error drains the fun out from gameplay. For the record, I had fun playing through the game first five-six times, until I realized it wouldn't get me anywhere unless I made a perfect plan before starting instead of trying to react to whatever was happening.)The game has beautiful art and lots of interesting plotlines, but you have to go through the same initial events over and over again to experience most of them. In other words, the overrall gameplay becomes more and more boring while you're searching for sparks of undiscovered content (in action games this would work, but in LLTQ you'll just end up starting over because you didn't know what skills you need in whatever situation beforehand). Still, it's probably the best game of its kind out right now, and someone with past experience with this genre probably won't find the mechanics so incredibly arduous!			"

												In Long Live the Queen you play as the Princess Elodie, who is getting ready to be crowned Queen. But can you keep her alive – safe from assassins, magic, and public revolt – until then? LLTQ is a kind of choose your own adventure with surprisingly complex systems. Every turn Elodie has the choice of leveling up 2 of 42 possible skills (things like Royal Demeanor, Archery, or Foreign Intelligence) in order to prepare her for being queen. Elodie’s mood also affects how quickly she learns, so that needs to be managed as well in order to optimize.When I started playing this game, I felt like an utter failure. Every time an event happened that tested one of these skills I failed because I had chosen to learn something else. It was a bit off-putting. However, after playing through a couple times I learned that I didn’t have to pass every check, and it was better to level a few skills up a lot rather than try to learn everything. It’s a pretty cool game, and I’ve been having fun trying to discover all the different events and endings.			"

												“Long Live The Queen”:  5.5/10After finishing the game, I reflected on the game and my choices. I am not particularly happy with the outcome, but I didn’t necessarily pick the best options, either. Still, this game should come down to dialog and choices, and the game doesn’t do a great job of that.Gameplay consists of deciding what you’ll study for the week, managing your mood (which, in turn affects how well you learn things via studying), and responding to events (which occur after studying). You get two things to study each week, and get 40 weeks to outfit your potential queen the way you want to (meaning, you get 80 choices on what to study). I sought out to make my queen an interesting one: a falcon-handling, flattery-using, lonely queen that ignores any attempt at courtship. After all, if you give me interesting and/or “silly” options, I’m going to want to investigate them and see how they play out. That’s not to say that I completely ignored important stats, such as history and economics, but that I wanted to make my character how *I* wanted, not how the developers wanted. And this works…sort of. While you get random events that use some of the lesser important characteristics, chances are, you’re *going* to have to utilize a specific skill. And, if you don’t have it increased to a certain point, you’re going to fail, and likely get game over. If you’re going to give us choice, let us have true choice; this is what bums me out the most in the game. Some of the choices are badly done as well. Take, for instance, a pair of chocolates I receive from a commoner. The text forebodes that the box is questionable (“it’s far too well done for a commoner to have made…”), and tells you *before* you make the decision that you either pass or fail a poison check. Why before?!? You’ve explicitly told me that I shouldn’t eat them. Other choices don’t seem to have any impact on the story, either; one particular knowledge check I passed and knew more about the situation, but then I promptly re-loaded the game to see what would happen when I failed, and I came to the same conclusion without any difference, other than that I didn’t know that a family member did something-or-other. While I’m not certain that all choices are such as this, but it’s disappointing to know that some things that you do don’t really matter.SPOILERS: Some of the “choices” aren’t really choices at all, either; you really can’t leave the castle. If you decide to partake in a parade, you either have to have a *very* high specific stat, or you die. Want to participate in an archery contest? Better have it almost maxed, or you fail, and get called out to a duel to the death. Want to visit your relatives? Better hope that you’ve got high reflexes, or you’re taking an arrow to the heart. I understand that there’s got to be some resemblance of a story, but I want to play *my* way, not yours. On the last series of events, I had to save before my decision, and reload it at *least* seven times to barely make it out alive, and that took the king / my father sacrificing himself to the killer of my mother / queen. This basically means that you *have* to get specific stats increased to be able to avoid a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending. Another thing that puzzled me was that there was a couple of instances (I’d estimate five out of forty events) having to do with the royal treasury (“should we hire more troops? Etc.), but there was no form of currency to manage, nor was there any indication upon reloading and choosing differently did it make any impact whatsoever. Illusion of choice is something I am more-or-less okay with, but not when it’s this obvious. END SPOILERSComing into the game, I was under the presumption that it would be largely dialog-driven. This really isn’t the case. Yes, it is present, but not as much as I had hoped; it felt like the game was 75% choosing what I would be studying. I would have really liked to see the game explore more relationships and dialog (although, to be fair, [SPOILERS] my choices did rather exclude marrying anyone, and letting my father die (it was that or game over…)[SPOILERS], so it very well could be different in other routes of the game).In terms of replayability, I spent two hours on the game, start to finish, with perhaps 10 minutes of afk / loading. Because of the relatively ♥♥♥♥♥♥ outcome I got, I was *kind of* interested in playing the game again…but I decided against it. I don’t really think that I’ll be replaying the game again. For a regularly $10 game, I don’t think that two hours for $10 is a good deal. Despite these flaws, I will say that I did sit down and play the game from start to finish in one sitting, which isn’t something most games are capable of. And before starting this review, I did have a higher opinion of the game before I starting articulating my thoughts (initially, I gave it a reluctant 6.5/10). Overall, I’ll remember this game as a game that had great potential, yet didn’t fully realize what could have been.I wouldn’t say that this is a bad game, but I wouldn’t say it’s a particularly good game, either. Considering all of the above, I wouldn’t recommend the game, but if you are interested, I would only recommend it at $2.49.  "

												While it may seem daunting, the game is really very good provided you're into that sort of thing. A largely story-driven affair, I really enjoy my time playing this one. If you've played through visual novels before, a large portion of the game will be familiar to you, with lots of reading alongside static images. The neat part comes from leveling up the skills provided to the princess. Often with games of this sort, I feel that it's largely formulaic. Once you have the parts down pat, the game loses it's interest. Long Live The Queen, however, deviates from this formula by throwing random events in alongside the normal story's progression. While certain events will happen each playthrough, sometimes new things will pop up at inconvinient times because of your skill progression or previous choices; it really keeps you on your toes. TL;DR: If you like reading and don't get frustrated by retrying often, get this game.			"

												I was skeptical at first - I never played something like this before, whatever ""genre"" this may be - but from the start this game was very intresting. It takes a lot of strategic thinking to get a good ending, and it's pretty difficult achieving one on your first tries; nonetheless, i found myself quite addicted with it. Even when I wasn't playing, sometimes, I started wondering wich path could I try to avoid death - skills to learn, in what order, choices to make - and that's good, it means the game is entrataining. The graphics may look frilly, but it's nice to look at it for long times - considering that you'll spend most of your game time looking at the skill-review screen to decide what to learn. The concept is good, and so is the plot; pretty much everyone could be planning your death, and most of the time you won't even know what you will be facing. The storyline also manages to surprise with sudden twists, so every skill may come handy.  I have already achieved two different endings, but I'll definetly play more to discover new ones. Moreover, after dying many times, you kinda feel good for the main character when finally you get to the ending xD I figure that once familiar with the mechanics and once used to save and load at specific points of the story, breaking through the endings is surely easier, but that's not a downside, actually. All considered, I think this may be a nice choice if you never played anything similar before and you feel you'd like to try.			"

												I can't recommend Long Live the Queen enough. You play as the princess of a kingdom during the year before she ascends to the throne, and you have to survive long enough to get her there. It's essentially a text-based RPG at it's core: you level up different skills every week and as you progress through the game you're met with different checks of those skills. (For example, you can't retrieve an item from the royal treasury without a high enough 'Presence' to intimidate the guards).The art is beautiful, the story and worldbuilding are very good, and it has a very good amount of replayability due to all the various different endings you can get and ways in which you can get there.

It has wit, depth, and an odd level of polish for such a simple concept.You might not think you'll like it, but you'd be surprised. I was, at least.

I carefully craft my day to revolve around nothing but birds, military, and swords. Twenty minutes later I am dead because the game did not take pity on my attempts to be a humorously uncouth ruler. No, instead it bent me over backwards and gave me a cruel reminder of why you should save frequently, no matter what you're playing. Long Live The Queen will kill you. You will reload, swearing and sweating, furiously trying to pour your actions into learning what you hope will save your life the next skill check that rolls by. You still die. You die and you die and the game won't stop, even when you're sobbing in front of your keyboard furiously trying to come up with a strategy that will keep you alive at least long enough to get crowned queen.I wanted to put my face through a window after my fifth attempt to not get murdered.

												Imagine a game that is the apotheosis of all games, a brilliant fusion of story and mechanics and art that leads you to new emotional catharsis when you replay it every year.  The game also washes your dishes, files your taxes, and reminds you to call your mother on her birthday.Sounds like a game worth having, right?  But what if it cost $10,000, along with half your hair, both your index fingers, your favorite toe, and the promise of eternal agony in your least preferred afterlife?  It's probably not worth it then, right?Long Live The Queen is a game that is not the apotheosis of all games.  As such, I'd judge its non-sale Steam price of $9.99 as too high.  But if you buy it for $1.99 during a sale, then I'd say it was definitely worth it.At its heart, Long Live The Queen is a choose-your-own-adventure about a princess hoping to survive to queendom.  It has the added twist that each day, you choose two of 14 classes for your princess to take - classes ranging from Royal Demeanor to Climbing to Military Strategy.  Story branches appear and disappear according to your choices, and it is easy to end up impaled by a sword or punctured by arrows or eaten by krakens.This has reasonable amusement value, one that does eventually wear off; laughter turns to snickers turns to forced grins.  Fortunately, by the time I reached the eyeroll phase, I judged my enjoyment of the game up to that point to be worth roughly $2.61.  Which meant that I did more than break even on this game.  Hooray!------------------------------------------------------------------------Arrow in bodyPlease do not push further inYour organs thank you			"

												Long Live The Queen is mostly a visual novel game which we play as a princess, the main goal is mostly surviving long enough to make her queen. Of course, many dangers and many problems will try to prevent her until her coronation.Well... What I'm thinking about this game? In my opinion, it's definitely a good visual novel game. There are so many choices, so many paths, and many events we can trigger as long as we have the correct skills. The story is quite interesting, there are noble plots, execution, many things we could find during middle age. And as long as with some magical girl as well.Each week of the game, we have her mood to manage which can affected her lessons. For example, if she's depressed, some of the lessons will have a penalty while others will have a bonus. After each lesson which will increase a skill, she can do an activity during her free time and it will mostly affect her mood if we need to train others skills faster.Also, during the scenes, you have to manage your reliationships as well. We'll meet many people like dukes and we also have to be careful to not upset them or they might plot to kill you. You can also make commoners happy or angry depending on your actions, but be careful if they rebel against you.Depending on our actions, the story can end happily or badly. If we want to discover everything in this game, we'll often have to start the game from the beginning, trying different skills and/or paths.Now... The game is short but since there are many events to try, so, we often have to restart from the beginning and trying another path. Yet, the problem, we tend to see the same scenes again... And again... But thanksfully, we can possibly skip the scenes. Her mood can be tricky to manage as well, especially when we need a certain mood to train many skills faster.And that's not all... When we trigger an event and trying to suceed it, we don't know which skills we need first and so, we tend to die a first time because we don't have the correct skill. And when we try this event again with the correct skill... Well, often, we need another skill to suceed it! And that can be frustrating at some point... And sometimes, we have to start from the beginning many times until we found the correct skills we need (unless we're following a guide). So, it is recommend to do many saves but not necessarily.In conclusion... It's not a bad game but not a perfect one. As for me, I quite enjoyed it anyway. It was fun and music was quite touching. Many funny things can possibly happen too. I'll say it's mostly a game for people who like interactive stuffs. ^^			"

												This game is basically a turn based ""choose your own adventure"" game executed as a visual novel, with some roleplaying elements.You start as a 14 year old princess, soon-to-be adult ruler of your kingdom. You have to make it to your 15th birthday in order to be crowned as Queen. That's in 40 weeks. Basically 40 turns of learning skills, managing your mood - which alters your efficiency to learn certain skills - and reacting to situations. 40 weeks to survive to be the Queen!Some elements are always present - your mother deceased recently, and you start out as depressed (thus you're more tuned to learn artistic things than conversations initially), plus your dad asks you about state affairs sometimes. Some come random to bite your cute royal bottom - like a box of suspicious but very delicious-looking chocolates, or an invasion. Certain things - such as magic - should be earned first and then learned by hard work.Adorable protagonist, nice atmosphere, some UI quirks, jokes and references, little unlockables, gameplay mainly driven by trial and error. It's a rather lovely game if you have the eye for it, but if you don't like CYOA or visual novels you're in for a letdown.Here is an official video showing much of the game's UI.			"

												A Truly Brilliant yet Simple game! It's crazy how someone could turn a Visual Novel into some sort of strategy game. You have to be careful of ALL of your choices, what Classes you should take, what things you should do on the weekend, and of course the sudden choices you have to make through out the game. It all plays out and brings me back some memories of reading Choose your Own Adventure books. Overall this title shouldn't go overlooked. 5 stars!			"

If you're into Raising Simulations, this is certainly something that you should consider.  Storytelling is compelling, with a good mix of silliness.  The princess herself is lovable even when she flounders and you find yourself wondering, what kind of monsters (everyone) could possibly want her dead?			"

												Do you have what it takes to stay alive? Probably not. Will it tick you off to no end?Probably. Will it be fun? Only if you're masochistic. As it turns out, I am apparently masochistic. This game is extremely addictive, with a relatively simple yet alarmingly improbable premise: survive to your fifteenth birthday. You'll face traitorous relatives, violent monsters, unpredictable magic, court room drama, espionage, and murder. There are more ways to die in this game than to survive. You'll get at least four hours play out of it just trying to survive one playthrough. It's the kind of game that will make you try and try again, and the various outcomes and differences in decision can drastically alter the storyline. Ergo, while certain events over the course of playthrough will stay the same, the end result of differing choices will likely be new to you long into becoming familiar with the game. All in all, Long Live The Queen is a fun (annoying) little game that will provide hours of entertainment (frustration). It has great art, a quirky storyline, and is perfect for visual novel fans. 8/10.			"

												Long Live the Queen is an odd title, but very in its own niche. If you can get passed the ""anime"" aesthetic (which is more ""moe"" than anything else), you find yourself in a heavily political fantasy game. Every class you take to build your skill tree is important to your survival as well as the relationships you build in your own kingdom and on. What may seem daunting and a little frustrating at first, you'll come to find that some deaths are avoidable, even without having the proper skills (such as choosing not to follow the shady figure in the woods). Events are also not random, so the more you play, the lower the difficulty gauge. Overall, I find this little gemstone to be alright for what it is. It's not a horrible time-waster, and it's pleasing enough on the eye. However I would reccommend only getting this game while it's on sale ($5 or less), as it's short and does not have as much replay value as one would hope.			"

Despite its flaws with many situations where it lacks reasonable option the game is actually....fairly reasonable and fun. Your decision is long-last and actually hurts your playthrough, but you will never know what the consequences of any of the actions nor events that happen is unless you're going through your second playthrough+....that is....you died. Yes, in this game, you'll die a lot, both literally and figuratively. There's also a scene that involves tentacle monster but not the kind that you're thinking. Enjoy.			"

												I got the game in a bundle without even knowing what it was, and I'm so glad that I did. I'm a meticulous person at heart, and organization is a personal passion. So when I started this game, with branching paths all over the place and all different unlockable story components and opportunities, I was in heaven. I've got a Word document saved right now, detailing the different paths and the effects of succeeding or failing each test. It's far from complete, and I'm certain there will be hours and hours of additional entertainment as I seek out the deaths, epilogues, and achievements that still elude me as I fill in more of my ever-growing chart of options.Be aware, there's no such thing as a ""perfect"" game. I nearly drove myself mad attempting to raise stats in such a way that I passed every test. You simply cannot, and I think it's for the better. The game forces you to choose what knowledge and opportunities are most important to you and give up the rest or simply save it for another playthrough.The artwork and different outfits are cute, and I appreciated that aspect of the game. However, if you do buy the game (and if you're anything like me, I hope you do because you'll have a blast), make sure you're doing it for the strategy and story element, since those are what truly make the game something special.

												tl;dr If you like this kind of game (pick-your-own, number crunch-y, visual novel and kind of dating sim-like), it's a very nice example of what it is. Otherwise, you're probably not going to like it. Initially,I sucked at the game and hated it. Then, I used a couple of walkthroughs, lightbulb moment happened and now I quite like it. It's a text-based game with consequences, but it's not as straightforward as that.  If you're slightly mathsy: instead of 'do x and y will happen' it sometimes feels more like x + v + u * w means y is very likely to happen, and maybe z too if your character feels more depressed that day'. It makes it almost realistic. In a way. It's still not going to appeal to everyone, though. My pros:- Outcome engine well designed, and well-disguised, which prevents the game from feeling simplistic despite first appearances. - Art is cute. Music doesn't irritate me despite the repetitiveness.- The dating sim element is more interesting than most and doesn't feel tacky or forced. Except for the bit where she can get forced into marriage, of course, but I'm talking about gameplay here.- This is basically a quick hit if you like achievement mining. I like achievement mining. My cons:- It's a visual novel-style game. For many players unfamiliar with them, or maybe text-based RPG games, I think it's not going to feel that engaging. Having to scrutinise a balance sheet of skills every round might not be that appealing to some either. - Wasn't the most intuitive game for me - had to rely on walkthroughs until I actually understood how to not keep dying by week 20. But that's probably my fault. - In terms of replayability, it can get very repetitive after a while. But I'm on something like my 35th playthrough.  "

												Have you ever looked at political leaders (especially after they do something incredibly stupid) and thought, ""jeez, I can do a much better job than them!""?  This game tells you, ""no, no, you really can't.""  You play as the fourteen year old monarch of Nova, and you must learn to be at least somewhat adept at your job before your coronation in a few weeks.  But in the meantime, you must take lessons in a decent variety of subjects.  However, you also must anticipate what you need to know when the cutscenes occur after the lessons.  If you choose to study Foreign Affairs, you'll know a bit about the current political climate.  But if you choose not to study Production, you may not see the value of funding the printing press.  Did I mention you also frequently get killed?Overall, this is an interesting game that demonstrates the immense difficulty of running a country and how to be a good leader.  8.5/10 would recommend.

												This game is something I had origanally got because it was on sale and I had the money to spare. I learned that this game is actually pretty addictive in it's goal of making it to the end without dying, only to then realize that isn't quite the easiest thing when I died three times in a row due to eating poisoned chocolate. That is when I realized (after sitting for five minutes re-thinking my life as to why it happened three consecutive times in a row) that I had to beat this game whether I liked it or not. The process had taken about eight hours, but to do so, I thought it was worth it. Even after beating it, there are other things you can do (which at this point in time I am still working on) such as find all the death scenes and explore every path. Overall, I found this to be a great game for people who like challenges.The game had some pretty alright storyline behind it-if you invested into the history classes, that is-and as advice for people who are going to start the game I would say: ""Don't underestimate the poison classes!"".

In fact I found myself laughing most of the time I died (and the trading cards are hilarious). To be honest most of the skills in this game aren't used and only alter the storyline slightly (at least in my various play throughs) and some are pretty much mandatory to complete the game. Needless to say I had fun and enjoyed the story and game mechanics nonetheless. I give it about a 8/10 and suggest getting it if its on sale.			"

												I will warn you going in, my friends; this game can be an incredibly frustrating experience. You will die a lot, as a result of failing checks that seem to come out of nowhere. However, if you push through this and keep replaying you'll find an incredibly rewarding game waiting for you. It's a great feeling to finally pass a high level check for the first time, and seeing Elodie finally make it to her coronation is the best!One thing I do wish is that there were an option to reread all the lessons Elodie learned so far on a given playthrough. It'd make it easier to catch foreshadowing, get a fuller sense of the world when you can read lessons which inform each other back to back instead of with potentially weeks of gameplay between them, and (when replaying) to realize that you've forgotten to do anything for a check that's coming up. I'd recommend playing through your first time or two just picking whatever you'd like and seeing what happens, but after that here are a couple tips:Okay, one tip for your very first playthrough: Don't keep chasing checks that have already passed! By that I mean a LOT of people have the instinct when they see a failed stat check to go ""Oh no! Let's focus only on that stat for the next few weeks so I'll never fail with it again!"" You'll see this happen in blind let's plays of the game all the time, and it's a good way to get Elodie dead.Read the flavor text you get with your classes! Not only is foreshadowing and worldbuilding hidden there, if you see the description for one lesson mention something you'd need a different type of class to use effectively that's probably the game waving at you yelling ""Hey! I'm gonna check for these back-to-back at some point!Have an idea going in of what you want to accomplish. There is not enough time in the game to get skilled enough to pass every high-level check, so just pick a couple things you want to do and only worry about them. (Well, them plus surviving, obviously.)By that same measure, don't feel pressured into getting your Lumen crystal just because the game keeps bringing it up! There is never once in the game that you NEED to use magic without any other way around it, so if there's some event you're focused on getting don't feel like you need to get sidetracked into pumping up your presence or accounting skills.Having high enough intrigue by a point near the midgame will let you pick something you want your agents to focus on protecting you from. Whichever you pick can save you from one possible failure state later on. (More guards, for instance, will bypass the infamous archery/battlefield medicine/composure check.)Divination is surprisingly useful, there're multiple points where Elodie will get a hint that can lead her to doing something that'll prove useful later in the game from it. But if you rely on it too much it can also drive you away from interesting plotlines.Almost every failure state in the game has more than one way to avoid it. If you keep banging against one scenario you just can't get all the way through try going back to an old save and seeing if you can find another way through it. Some of the alternate ways can be very satisfying! I love watching Elodie using knowledge of trade route and internal affairs to logic out that something's fishy about the poisoned chocolates.			"

												An absolute delight, blending squeaky-cute anime style with a surprising amount of violence and cutely-stylized death at every turn. This is a game in the traditional ""raising sim"" style, though you're more or less left raising yourself, in the role of a princess on the cusp of her coronation to queen. Naturally, political enemies and conspiracy dog your heels at every turn, and you'll have to balance your stat growth and story choices carefully. Even after multiple playthroughs and thinking I'd more or less seen it all, there's actually a ton of content to this game that can be unlocked by various twists and turns of your choices. There are also some points at which it even rewards you for paying attention to the rather copious amounts of setting information that the game throws at you, sometimes (unfortunately) during somewhat easily-overlooked messages on reaching certain levels of skill. Understanding the relationships between the various governments and political players involved can give you a considerable edge in making your choices. Of course, it can be hard to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it's said. Still, it's a fun, breezy, easy-to-play game with a lot more to it than even a single full playthrough might indicate.

												You guided a mood-swing 14-year old anime girl through 40 weeks of Game of Thrones to reach her sweet-15 birthday and be crowned Queen in this Sim-Decisionmaking-EdgeofTomorrow-Simulator. Despite its flaws with many situations where it lacks reasonable option the game is actually....fairly reasonable and fun. Your decision is long-last and actually hurts your playthrough, but you will never know what the consequences of any of the actions nor events that happen is unless you're going through your second playthrough+....that is....you died. Yes, in this game, you'll die a lot, both literally and figuratively. There's also a scene that involves tentacle monster but not the kind that you're thinking. Enjoy.			"

												I got the game in a bundle without even knowing what it was, and I'm so glad that I did. I'm a meticulous person at heart, and organization is a personal passion. So when I started this game, with branching paths all over the place and all different unlockable story components and opportunities, I was in heaven. I've got a Word document saved right now, detailing the different paths and the effects of succeeding or failing each test. It's far from complete, and I'm certain there will be hours and hours of additional entertainment as I seek out the deaths, epilogues, and achievements that still elude me as I fill in more of my ever-growing chart of options.Be aware, there's no such thing as a ""perfect"" game. I nearly drove myself mad attempting to raise stats in such a way that I passed every test. You simply cannot, and I think it's for the better. The game forces you to choose what knowledge and opportunities are most important to you and give up the rest or simply save it for another playthrough.The artwork and different outfits are cute, and I appreciated that aspect of the game. However, if you do buy the game (and if you're anything like me, I hope you do because you'll have a blast), make sure you're doing it for the strategy and story element, since those are what truly make the game something special.

												Do you have what it takes to stay alive? Probably not. Will it tick you off to no end?Probably. Will it be fun? Only if you're masochistic. As it turns out, I am apparently masochistic. This game is extremely addictive, with a relatively simple yet alarmingly improbable premise: survive to your fifteenth birthday. You'll face traitorous relatives, violent monsters, unpredictable magic, court room drama, espionage, and murder. There are more ways to die in this game than to survive. You'll get at least four hours play out of it just trying to survive one playthrough. It's the kind of game that will make you try and try again, and the various outcomes and differences in decision can drastically alter the storyline. Ergo, while certain events over the course of playthrough will stay the same, the end result of differing choices will likely be new to you long into becoming familiar with the game. All in all, Long Live The Queen is a fun (annoying) little game that will provide hours of entertainment (frustration). It has great art, a quirky storyline, and is perfect for visual novel fans. 8/10.			"

												Long Live the Queen is an odd title, but very in its own niche. If you can get passed the ""anime"" aesthetic (which is more ""moe"" than anything else), you find yourself in a heavily political fantasy game. Every class you take to build your skill tree is important to your survival as well as the relationships you build in your own kingdom and on. What may seem daunting and a little frustrating at first, you'll come to find that some deaths are avoidable, even without having the proper skills (such as choosing not to follow the shady figure in the woods). Events are also not random, so the more you play, the lower the difficulty gauge. Overall, I find this little gemstone to be alright for what it is. It's not a horrible time-waster, and it's pleasing enough on the eye. However I would reccommend only getting this game while it's on sale ($5 or less), as it's short and does not have as much replay value as one would hope.			"

												Summary: Princess Maker without dungeonsMultiplayer: NoCompletion: 9 hrsCards: YesCloud: NoThe Princess Maker games are a series of time management games that never saw an official US release. Despite the obvious aim towards girls, they are enjoyable enough in their own right to appeal to broader audiences. A handful of indie games were inspired by them, and this is one such game.In Long Live the Queen, you spend each week selecting classes to raise your stats. Intermixed with the training are story events that take place throughout the game. Interestingly, there's nearly always something new happening every week, and the majority of events require stat checks in order to pass/fail. These checks are not telegraphed in any way, so the only way to know when to expect is to observe them happen, and then jot them down. These events are not random, so you can and must prepare accordingly, as the stat checks climb very high very fast. Because of the high stat reqs, it is ill-advised to spread your points thin, as you would soon be unable to pass anything. This sort of playstyle is a bit... odd. It nearly guarantees failure for any first time player because there's just no way to know when you might get shot or poisoned the first time around, and thus no way to know how to beat it.A rather odd amount of plot is devoted to political intrigue. The game throws dozens of names of countries and nobles at you, most of which you never see or meet. I find it difficult to care about the politics of other countries when I've never visited it nor met its citizens. The game would rather tell you two countries not getting along, rather than show you two people arguing in court. To help curtail the politics chatter, I would have liked more opportunities to interact with other NPCs. Maybe a gathering location such as a tavern for allies would have been nice.A few skills seem to be of remarkably little use, such as some weapon skills. There seems to be a heavy bias towards practicing your magic. I wanted to create a warrior queen who rules with justice and might, but it doesn't seem to be an option.Sadly this game does not possess the dungeon crawling aspect of some of the Princess Maker games. Thus the whole game boils down to your ability to play trial and error, as you aim to survive, and ultimately win. The dungeon crawler would have been a fantastic use of combat-related skills.Long Live the Queen is enjoyable enough, and I seem to be drawn to these sorts of time-management games. It's a curious exercise in optimization, and despite the high likelihood of dying, is very accessible and easy to pick up and play. I rate this a 7/10. Not bad at all, but could use a few cool touches.			"

												Spoiler: The queen doesn't live long at all.Got this game through the auction; way more enjoyable than initially expected.  In a nutshell, this game is an anime version of Dark Souls innocuously portrayed as a loli princess simulator by the cover art.  If watching a blank slate pink haired preteen girl die repeatedly while trying to come to terms with common sense on her way to coronation sounds great, this might be your VN. The game is more gruesome, political, and dark than the initial art style suggests.Death is addicting, and it can be infuriating trying to clear the game; the world just keeps giving surprises when least expected.  The infamous chocolate end that many other reviews allude to is just one out of eleven ways to die; some methods of death (as well as 39 achievements and 24 epilogues) are extremely obscure and it takes a lot of hours to unlock all of them.  Some playthroughs (i.e. hours) will be spent optimizing stats to trigger a specific flag.Branching story implies there are multiple ways to play this game.  You can behave in a benevolent manner fitting of a queen and win hearts through diplomacy and fairness.  Or you can be a tyrant and quash the inevitable rebellion.  A stalwart warrior who crushes armies with might or magic?  Or maybe a darkened Elodie who succumbs to power, whose name is never in Novan history spoken again.  Or will your legacy be the first queen to establish hospitals and sponsor the printing press?  Many ways to play, many endings to experience, many achievements to collect, and many ways to die.  How will you play Elodie?Pros+Cute characters+Music+Branching story (keeps OCD people occupied)+Execute peasants for laughs+Abuse the maid+Tons of political drama, backstories, and hidden motives (allies in one playthrough are antagonists in the next).+Elodie can become evilCons-Needs good planning skills-Takes a long time to complete-Some achievements are crazy difficult to get (few guides exist)-Need to have a habit of having dozens of savefiles			"

If you're into Raising Simulations, this is certainly something that you should consider.  Storytelling is compelling, with a good mix of silliness.  The princess herself is lovable even when she flounders and you find yourself wondering, what kind of monsters (everyone) could possibly want her dead?			"

												Long Live The Queen is a simulation role-playing-game that places you in the role of a princess on the road to becoming queen. Placing aside the images usually conjured by well-known fairy tales, being a princess as it turns out is very difficult. To make it to your coronation you will need to better yourself and make important decisions along the way. There is a lot to learn as a princess, everything from etiquette to history to military strategy to athletics and everything in between. Careful selection of what you learn and how well you learn it can open up new opportunities as well as avoid nasty failures on skill checks. How well you learn a subject is also dependent on your mood which can shift depending on what actions you take and how you spend your weekends.In many ways, Long Live The Queen is similar to Princess Maker which also features a princess with different skills to learn. The key difference being that in Princess Maker you play a king raising a daughter where as Long Live The Queen places you in the role of the princess dealing with political issues of every sort. There is a lot of agency to Long Live The Queen and the story can take radically different turns depending on what actions you take and how well versed you are in certain subjects. So there is much more at stake in Long Live The Queen than in Princess Maker. Who do you trust? Do you take the diplomatic solution or use force? Do you get involved in problems where success is not guaranteed? The first few times playing you will usually meet an untimely demise before ever seeing your coronation.Overall, Long Live The Queen is a fantastic and refreshing game. With so many decisions to make, there are a number of directions the story can go. And even if you fail, it's still enjoyable to just get back up and try again with something different. So if you've ever wanted to be a princess or just have fun as a ruler, I would highly recommend this game.			"

												One of the best visual novels I've ever played. Actually It's not like other visual novels and I think that's why.This twisting and turning story develops based on your choices. And you don't just get 2 or 3 choices, you get 20 or so choices each turn, and then a couple in each situation you get into. You select one or two of numerous skills to train and hope that they'll help you in your quest to become the queen. Then when circumstances happen, depending on your skills you will get a number of options. These can start with something simple like avoiding a snake bite to more complex like leading to a civil war. At first this game seems like a failure simulator and can feel tough at times, but it's not annoying, it's cute and funny. As you progress, you realize that your actions depend on needing the right skills at various times so you have to train them up the right amount for each occurrence. And don't forget to put on the right costume so you get your skill bonuses. For a loli/fail sim, this is 8/10. For a story game this is 9/10. I was pleasantly surprised at how great this game is for such a cheap price. Look forward to anywhere from 5-20 hours of fun play. and another 15 or so of achievement chasing. They recently added new content to the game so there is the chance for more gameplay later on. At $10 it's an ok buy0 for me, but at 80% off ($1.99) on the daily deal for the steam sale 2015, it's an instant buy.I really hope they make a sequel or something similar because this was a really fun casual gaming experience.Tl;dr: get this game.

												I will warn you going in, my friends; this game can be an incredibly frustrating experience. You will die a lot, as a result of failing checks that seem to come out of nowhere. However, if you push through this and keep replaying you'll find an incredibly rewarding game waiting for you. It's a great feeling to finally pass a high level check for the first time, and seeing Elodie finally make it to her coronation is the best!One thing I do wish is that there were an option to reread all the lessons Elodie learned so far on a given playthrough. It'd make it easier to catch foreshadowing, get a fuller sense of the world when you can read lessons which inform each other back to back instead of with potentially weeks of gameplay between them, and (when replaying) to realize that you've forgotten to do anything for a check that's coming up. I'd recommend playing through your first time or two just picking whatever you'd like and seeing what happens, but after that here are a couple tips:Okay, one tip for your very first playthrough: Don't keep chasing checks that have already passed! By that I mean a LOT of people have the instinct when they see a failed stat check to go ""Oh no! Let's focus only on that stat for the next few weeks so I'll never fail with it again!"" You'll see this happen in blind let's plays of the game all the time, and it's a good way to get Elodie dead.Read the flavor text you get with your classes! Not only is foreshadowing and worldbuilding hidden there, if you see the description for one lesson mention something you'd need a different type of class to use effectively that's probably the game waving at you yelling ""Hey! I'm gonna check for these back-to-back at some point!Have an idea going in of what you want to accomplish. There is not enough time in the game to get skilled enough to pass every high-level check, so just pick a couple things you want to do and only worry about them. (Well, them plus surviving, obviously.)By that same measure, don't feel pressured into getting your Lumen crystal just because the game keeps bringing it up! There is never once in the game that you NEED to use magic without any other way around it, so if there's some event you're focused on getting don't feel like you need to get sidetracked into pumping up your presence or accounting skills.Having high enough intrigue by a point near the midgame will let you pick something you want your agents to focus on protecting you from. Whichever you pick can save you from one possible failure state later on. (More guards, for instance, will bypass the infamous archery/battlefield medicine/composure check.)Divination is surprisingly useful, there're multiple points where Elodie will get a hint that can lead her to doing something that'll prove useful later in the game from it. But if you rely on it too much it can also drive you away from interesting plotlines.Almost every failure state in the game has more than one way to avoid it. If you keep banging against one scenario you just can't get all the way through try going back to an old save and seeing if you can find another way through it. Some of the alternate ways can be very satisfying! I love watching Elodie using knowledge of trade route and internal affairs to logic out that something's fishy about the poisoned chocolates.			"

												This is one of the more compelling games I've played recently. A sprawling, chaotic choose-your-own-adventure with labyrinthine plot strands that can change and evolve in surprisingly subtle ways depending on the choices you make and the skills you level up.It's also a damn difficult game. Having played through about 10 times I have only successfully completed it (i.e. reached my coronation) ONCE, and even then I was forced to make some pretty douchey decisions to ensure my own survival. However the challenge is what will compel you to start again and again, trying different strategies and skill progressions.Slight negatives - some of the plinky plonky piano music will get on your♥♥♥♥♥♥after about an hour, and I believe the game has a noticeable bias in favour of certain skills (looking at you Lumen and Court Manners) however I cannot confirm this as there's still so much of this game I haven't seen despite so many playthroughs. Also as this is a ""visual novel"", the genre of which normally has manga-ish overtones, another aspect of the game has you dressing up a 14 year old girl in different garments to boost certain skills. Mostly this is fine, but a few outfits are a bit ♥♥♥♥ing dodgy in my opinion (again, looking at you Lumen).Overall, well happy with my purchase, and still playing now. Long Live the Queen!			"

												Although I am usually NOT a fan of Roguelike perma-death / Start over type games (& over, and over, and over, etc), Long Live the Queen is too perfectly charming not to like.It is a very well designed game. You learn as you go, how to avoid certain traps by focusing on learning certain skills before others. It took me a few short-lived (for the Queen) run-thrus to get the hang of the simple system. Or rather, to see what choices I should have made early on. But really, you're going to be doing that throughout the game anyway.It's not as easy as I thought it would be. But you start caring about the little Queen and you really want her to succeed....or live for that matter. And keeping her alive is no easy task. At least not for me. The dialog options are good & you make choices that really matter & that have potentially severe consequences. IMO the writing is very tight in this area. It's one of the things I liked most. It has slight RPG elements, in that you decide what she will learn. The classes you choose for her will increase her skill in specific areas, all of which are vitally important to her continued existence, and all of which will affect your dialog options at some point throughout the entire game. It's all tied together very nicely.So if you are a fan of games with a decent story, or a fan of Roguelikes in general, I recommend you buy this little gem and enjoy the heck out of it. If you like Visual Novels you will enjoy this....though Queen is a LOT more interactive than most VN's as it is an actual game first.It's a fun little game to spend time with & I certainly encourage everyone to try it!

												This game is all about choice. Someone described it as a Sansa Stark simulator. That's quite fitting. You're playing as a young princess who ends up in the center of a dangerous political world. Unlike Sansa though, you'll be making most of the decisions.If you're curious about the gameplay, I recommend that you watch a review or a let's play clip. In short, it's much like a text-based RPG, with manga style art. You'll choose what the main character studies, what she does with her free time, and how she reacts to events. Her education is essential to both her survival and which choices are available.Recommended to players who enjoy the decision elements in roleplaying games.			"

												I love this game so much. The first time I opened it, I ended up playing for four hours straight, just trying to get coronated. Oh, did I mention it's also really hard? Yes, it's ridiculously easy to die and super difficult to get coronated. But that's the fun! It's very cute visually, with a dark humour that appeals to me. The ads for this are very accurate; you can mold Elodie any way you choose depending on her moods, but chances are you'll be poisoned by chocolate. Trust me, that happens a lot. My one complaint is that it seems you need to have max in one skill in order to win. This may just be my playing (though I've played through more than 20 times) and that seems a tad unfair. This comes from the fact I've noticed that, once you've figured out the game, it doesn't seem to change much. I haven't found different ways to die in a while (odd complaint, I know). But aside from that, it's still really addictive and though the story may not change much, the WAY you play does and that makes it interesting. If you like sim games, cutesy things and have a dark side, this game is for you. Avoid the chocolate though ;)			"

												This is a fun, little game where you might lose all sense of time while playing, because you start over and over to get things right the next time. There are a whole loads of options and ways to go, and also lots of ways to die. Be on your guard.This is my first time with a visual novel rpg, and even though there are little to none animations the game is still pretty dynamic and absolutely has a soul. The images and scenes described in the game plays through my head like a movie while I play, and the game lets me use my imagination instead of showing me every single detail.Do you like visual novels or rpgs? Take this for a test ride, you'll surely have some fun with it!			"

												If you saw the preview for this game, you pretty much know what to expect. While you don't have an exceptional amount of ability to alter the major events, you CAN change their outcomes in various ways. The writing is smart, and the way you make your character can vary in hundreds of ways, making this game one you can easily come back to any time for another go at, either for fun or to get all the different endings. I'd recommend this game to anyone that loves seeing what rewards and conquences lie behind even the slightest alterations your character makes.			"

												Long Live The Queen is a nice challenging little game. You can choose from many very different paths and do many drastically different choices to reach your Queenhood. There are even more ways to fail in this quest for power. Once you learn the important things, you should be able to win the game. It can, however, feel only half won as your kingdom didn't end up as nice as you hoped. With that in mind Long Live The Queen has also some replay value especially for those people who want thing to be just perfect.			"

												Who didn't want to be a princess at somepoint in his/her life? ;) This game fulfills that fantasy in visual-novel style, while still enabling a significant amount of interactivity and decission making. You might be a little overwhelmed in the first playthrough by the amount of skill-sets, but you will soon get the hang of it. It is good that the game gives you feedback whenever a skill passed or failed to adapt you strategy for your next playthrough. Therefore I recommend also to save often and in different slots, because you will run into ""dead ends"" if you level up the wrong skills.I also like the mood system. Different moods give you bonusses for different skills, e.g. ""Depression"" boosts artistic skills, why ""Angry"" boosts military skills. I really like this system, because it justifies each ""mood"". There are also different outfits to unlock which also boost certain skills. Also a nice way to customize your charakter.The story is well written, but it's a little difficult to get to understand the different realms and relations between the charakters.Another motivating aspect is in a ""completionist"" way to unlock as many ""deaths"" or other achievements as possible. The ""skip"" function helps to try different approaches in a quick way. "

												Today I'm writing a review for ""Long Live the Queen""This little game is an interesting blend of things I grew up with, visual novels of course. And a small tinge of the ""Princess Maker"" series. Overall it's worth a play, but I'm not too sure on the 10 dollar price tag. That being said, I think it's a dark, cute little game with lot's of good comedy and excellent art. The dialogue is well written and translated and the multiple endings and choices help a LOT with replay value. Overall I give it a 7/10. If only because sometimes staring at the static screens over and over can be a bit boring and tiresome. Now if you don't mind. I'm off to be the prettiest princess in the land.			"

												OK...I know you're looking at the screenshots of this game and thinking that it's some paper-thin fanservice-filled visual novel. If you give this game a chance though, there's actually some really cool stuff going on here.Guiding princess Elodie through the treacherous weeks prior to her coronation ain't easy. There's at least as much danger here as there is in any given episode of Game of Thrones - civil war, peasant uprisings, assassins, wizard kings...you can rest assured that you'll die many times in many ways before you finally see the crown placed on her head, but with proper time/mood management, some trial and error, and good educated guessing, you can succeed.

												TL;DR: Great game. Your options may seem limited, but they accumulate, and in the end you will desperately try to find the one way to save poor Elodie from yet another grisly death while also trying to figure out who wrote dirty poetry about you. Incredible replay value due to branching story.In the game, you take control of Elodie, a princess whose mother has recently died and who is about to inherit the throne. She just turned fourteen, and you have one year to mold her into the queen she will have to be. Along the way, there are plenty of opportunities to die, which you should avoid - or not; there is, after all, an achievement for dying in 11 different ways ;)You train Elodie by choosing classes for her, two every week, which gives her points in one of about 30 skills. During the story, skill-checks will pop up (binary choice, you either pass or don't, no luck involved) and inform you that you got/missed some information, succeeded in a task or will quite often leave you entirely guessing which influence your doing a good job at dancing at the ball had on the progress of the game - but that's fine, finding out is fun!Additionally, you spent your weekends doing things around the castle. Some further the story, others change your mood, and your mood changes your skill point gain. This means that you WILL be rooting for Elodie to please become more depressed and lonely, because happy people don't learn to handle animals as well.There are multiple ways to survive practially any challenge, and there are many secrets to discover in the story. I doubt you could find them all in one playthrough, or even three - there are just not enough weeks in the year to learn everything.In summary, for such a simple little game, I had and am having a lot of fun trying to do different things and (still!) trying to find the stupid 2nd lumen crystal and, and, and ....

												Long Live the Queen is the kind of game that takes the visual novel genre and makes it into something that's both frustrating yet fun. Similar to the Princess Maker games from Japan, the goal of the game is to aid Princess Elodie into Queendom so that she can continue looking after the realm. You do this by making decisions for Elodie and deciding which classes she should attend (2 per week) in order to polish her into a tru gem. Of course, it's not as simple as that.The story has multiple endings and many twists and turns which often evolve in the death of our dear Elodie. Commoner uprisings, magical wars and coups are all parts of what you have to avoid running into whilst hoping that along the way someone doesn't try and trick Elodie into eating poisoned chocolates. The game is fun with a lot of decisions but can get frustrating after seeing Elodie stumble at the same hurdle over and over again. Gameplay is literally using a mouse to pick decisions but the interactivity of the story makes up for it. The additional clothes for Elodie are a nice touch. If you're an achievement hunter there are plenty of achievements to be found, and as there are different storylines there's a lot of replaying that can be done with satisfyig conclusions. Towards the end when you have almost 100% it can get tedious going through the same story again and again, however.Overall this game is great in any collection and not just for girls. :) Long live the Queen!

												Let me just start by saying that this is a suprisingly fun game. If somebody told me I would spend over 15 hours playing this game I would not believe it. This is a visual novel which means that you basicly play through a story making descisions along the way changing up the story everytime you play it through (which can take between 10-40 minutes). Depending on the path you take you will lead to different endings and a lot of them being... your death. Throughout the game you will level up different traits, depending on what you choose to focus on different part of the stories will be easier for you to complete and changes your possible paths. If you fail a test it's not the end of the world unless... you die. And even if death comes a lot and often and forces you to restart it's acutally not frustrating, instead it works as a motivator to play differently next time. With every restart you want to know what happens if you level different traits, completing a trait test you didn't complete the last time. For example, if I become a animal trainer will my pet dog become a great strong guard dog? Or will I be able to tame animals throughout the story? You want to know!I do understand this game is not for everyone, if you're not a fan of slow/reading heavy games you probably dont want to get this. But if you get a chance to try it, DO SO. Suprisingly fun and of course you want to collect every possible DEATH achievement...Recommended!/ Nurgleprobe "

												A nice Dark Soul-ish game suitable for one sitting. Main complaint is the lack of diversity in ending, as there is only around one path to end it with too little variation. Many of the traits only have completionist uses, and since I tend to be more casual, this is also not a great quality. Also, the game is short, and I was expecting around at least twice as much main gameplay with restarts. Don't get me wrong, this was a thoroughly enjoyable game with a lot of thought put into the side missions. So if you like being a completionist or enjoy seeing all your hard work end abruptly (which IS humorous the first few times), or if you chust want to chill out to the AWESOMELY relaxing music, then this is a must.

												Have you ever thought to yourself, ""Gee I wonder what it would be like if I was Kawii Desu Nee-San anime Princess?"" Well think no more my friend, for this game has the answer. It starts with you (Princess Kawaii) being pulled out of school by you father because your ♥♥♥♥♥ of a mother selfishly died. With her out of the picture, it becomes your duty to become the next princess. You do this by taking 2 different classes every week which in turn increase some of your skill levels. However this isn't like Skyrim where you can be a god at everything, instead you need to be a bit more carfull in what skill you want to increase.For example, if you wish to level up your intelect through history and diplomancy, you may be able to flatter that losser of a Prince after you remember his birthday. However in doing this you probably won't be skilled enough to dodge the arrow that just penetrated your Liver. Oh look, you're dead, try again...After you have completed your classes for the week, you than get see some more of the story unfold. It is also here where your learnt skills come into action, as they determin your success. You also get to make some choices in these events that ultimatly determin the fate of you and your kindom. There are also alot of pre-set events that you can't do anything about, so I wouldn't get to exited. My personal favourite event was when some peasent sent me a fanfiction of me having sex with a Squid.After these events you get the option of choosing an activity to do over the weekend, this affects your mood, which in turn affects how well you learn in your classes. Say if you are in an Angry mood, you will get a bounis in Swordfighting, but you will recive a penalty to Accounting. There are plenty of ways to play this game, however it can't can't give you endless enjoyment like 'Barbie Dollhouse Adventure' as after a few tries at the game, you notice that the story may be fairly linear. But that may have just been because I wasn't very imaginative with what actions I took during the game. I don't really have many dislikes with this game, possibably because I came in not expecting very much. One annoyance was that the only charater that shows any emotion at all is you. Also be prepared with the lore in this game, as there are heaps of Dukes and Duchesses which I couldn't be bothered to remember.I bought this game when it was on sale for $1.50 and I personally think $10 is a bit too much for this game. However if you buy it, it's a fairly fun little indie game.			"

												I know I don't have many hours into this game, but I NEEDED to get this review out of the way because I have a couple of things I need to say. This game is ♥♥♥♥ED UP. I took a small look at the Steam cards for the game, and they're all ways you can be murdered within the game with adorable pictures of our unnamed princess in various horrific ends to her life. My favorite being 'Run Through' which she has a shocked expression with a cutlass THROUGH HER CHEST. But don't worry, it's in a chibi type art style! So it's not too gruesome. That doesn't change the fact that this points out at least part of the game in centered around death, and the death of the main character. Hell, at the beginning her mother died. If she had the luck of her daughter, I couldn't imagine why.The exposition is fairly tame in a game you'd expect to take up your entire expierence before you just give up and play another game. The point of the game? It took me a while to figure out, but the princess is trying to be married. So you are NOT a queen, but that's just nitpicking. Firstly, I can't stand most of the canidates that she's supposed to take the hand of for marriage. I couldn't find an interesting one anywhere, and to be fair, the princess and her cousin (which is briefly killed off by a snake) are the only ones I found with personality. The rest of them are very..Emotionless. To be honest it matches their pictures in game pretty well.I do like the skill system in this game, very complex and the game keeps you thinking on which one you should train in next. One situation, you'll have to use reflexes to LIVE or you'll be screwed over because you don't have enough knowledge of foreign countries!...And it turns into a shoot and miss simulator. You just have to pray you trained in the right stuff. I love the art this game delivers though, of course I love the style, being anime and such. I mean I love anime, as you can see from my profile picture. Gameplay is simple, it's a strategy game that's not forgiving in any way. I've played a lot of unforgiving recently, Five Nights at Freddy's 2, Risk of Rain, Rogue Legacy, hell even Dark Souls 2 and this definitely amung those titles. Although I'm not sure with the difficulty spike in this game as the other titles follow (except Rogue Legacy that just starts out difficult). More of just an awkward curve before the game upright kills you.6.2/10 "

Despite the obvious aim towards girls, they are enjoyable enough in their own right to appeal to broader audiences. A handful of indie games were inspired by them, and this is one such game.In Long Live the Queen, you spend each week selecting classes to raise your stats. Intermixed with the training are story events that take place throughout the game. Interestingly, there's nearly always something new happening every week, and the majority of events require stat checks in order to pass/fail. These checks are not telegraphed in any way, so the only way to know when to expect is to observe them happen, and then jot them down. These events are not random, so you can and must prepare accordingly, as the stat checks climb very high very fast. Because of the high stat reqs, it is ill-advised to spread your points thin, as you would soon be unable to pass anything. This sort of playstyle is a bit... odd. It nearly guarantees failure for any first time player because there's just no way to know when you might get shot or poisoned the first time around, and thus no way to know how to beat it.A rather odd amount of plot is devoted to political intrigue. The game throws dozens of names of countries and nobles at you, most of which you never see or meet. I find it difficult to care about the politics of other countries when I've never visited it nor met its citizens. The game would rather tell you two countries not getting along, rather than show you two people arguing in court. To help curtail the politics chatter, I would have liked more opportunities to interact with other NPCs. Maybe a gathering location such as a tavern for allies would have been nice.A few skills seem to be of remarkably little use, such as some weapon skills. There seems to be a heavy bias towards practicing your magic. I wanted to create a warrior queen who rules with justice and might, but it doesn't seem to be an option.Sadly this game does not possess the dungeon crawling aspect of some of the Princess Maker games. Thus the whole game boils down to your ability to play trial and error, as you aim to survive, and ultimately win. The dungeon crawler would have been a fantastic use of combat-related skills.Long Live the Queen is enjoyable enough, and I seem to be drawn to these sorts of time-management games. It's a curious exercise in optimization, and despite the high likelihood of dying, is very accessible and easy to pick up and play. I rate this a 7/10. Not bad at all, but could use a few cool touches.			"

												Get ready for royal hell in a hand basket. Princess Elodie is not always the smartest or agile in most situations, but it's up to you to guide her. From Civil war to poisoned chocolates, there are countless things that could end your life before coronation. No matter what path you choose, always be on your toes; everyone and everything is out to get you. Prepare to die.A lot "

												When I first found this game I thought it looked a bit boring but still it interested me, so I finally bought it during a sell and i've become obsessed with getting the achievements and i've totally fallen in love with the MC, you can basically make her into whatever kind of person you want to, and shes so freaking adorable! I love that you aren't guaranteed to beat the game and you can die and it's just, it's so entertaining and well worth the money in my opinion.			"

												At first I didn't quite get what the game play was from the trailer, but after playing it for around 8 hours I can see why it is quite a charming game. The stats that you level have a huge affect on what your character will do in a certain situation. Events don't always happen in sequence. I like the variation that can occur in the story based on your stats and decisions as well as the many ways to die. I definitely would recommend this game.			"

												tl;dr If you like this kind of game (pick-your-own, number crunch-y, visual novel and kind of dating sim-like), it's a very nice example of what it is. Otherwise, you're probably not going to like it. Initially,I sucked at the game and hated it. Then, I used a couple of walkthroughs, lightbulb moment happened and now I quite like it. It's a text-based game with consequences, but it's not as straightforward as that.  If you're slightly mathsy: instead of 'do x and y will happen' it sometimes feels more like x + v + u * w means y is very likely to happen, and maybe z too if your character feels more depressed that day'. It makes it almost realistic. In a way. It's still not going to appeal to everyone, though. My pros:- Outcome engine well designed, and well-disguised, which prevents the game from feeling simplistic despite first appearances. - Art is cute. Music doesn't irritate me despite the repetitiveness.- The dating sim element is more interesting than most and doesn't feel tacky or forced. Except for the bit where she can get forced into marriage, of course, but I'm talking about gameplay here.- This is basically a quick hit if you like achievement mining. I like achievement mining. My cons:- It's a visual novel-style game. For many players unfamiliar with them, or maybe text-based RPG games, I think it's not going to feel that engaging. Having to scrutinise a balance sheet of skills every round might not be that appealing to some either. - Wasn't the most intuitive game for me - had to rely on walkthroughs until I actually understood how to not keep dying by week 20. But that's probably my fault. - In terms of replayability, it can get very repetitive after a while. But I'm on something like my 35th playthrough.  "

												Don't let the exceedingly cute graphics fool you, this is a deep strategy game.  If you want to succeed (and by that I mean make it to your coronation), you will have to be very careful in how you develop your princess.  There will be many mistakes made along the way, and those mistakes will see Elodie die from an arrow to the gut, or a blast of magic or drowning at sea or...Yet each gruesome death will leave you coming back and trying to figure out how to avoid it, without meeting your end in another manner.

												I was excited that Steam had this game. I didn't think I'd find anything like it on Steam. I love dating and/or growing up simulation games, like Princess Maker 2, and RE:Alistair++, but you usually don't see them around much).Update for Steam awards and more detail.The game is in a similar vein to games like Princess Maker 2 and Spirited Heart. You spend time raising your combination of Elodie's many stats in hopes of keeping her alive (and as queen) until her coronation. Unless you're looking at a guide, you're going to die. A few times. There are many parts of the story where you have to meet certain skill checks (one of the achievements is for finding 11 ways to die. This means ""poisoned"", ""stabbed"", ""drowned"", not stabbed by 11 different people or missing 11 skill checks to drown.There's two really cool things to that, though: (1) they always tell you where you failed (or even partially pass) a skill check (not all fails kill you), so it adds to the replayability because you're curious about what you missed. But, it also doesn't give the exact numbers (IIRC), so you might not know exactly how much higher you need to make the skill. (2) For most of the situations that could kill you, there are either ways to avoid the situation altogether, or multiple ways to pass the scenario.For example:  Based on a skill check, you can get a choice on whether or not to eat poisoned food. If you fail that check, you don't get a choice--Elodie chooses to eat it. But, based on another skill check, she can be prevented from eating it. If that skill check fails, though, she eats it and gets poisoned. But, THEN there's a check for a different skill for you to counteract the poison.This means you definitely have to put some points in a few areas you might not think of, but it still gives you a lot of room to play Elodie as an overall character that you like. Want Elodie to be a pacifist? You don't need to know archery, but you'll probably want to know medicine.For that, I decided to suggest a category to nominate LLtQ in: ""Replay to Win"". I wanted it to be a category for those types of games where you usually start over to get ahead. Often times, those are visual novels, or games like Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 (where you have to repeat the 2-week vacation).			"

												If you saw the preview for this game, you pretty much know what to expect. While you don't have an exceptional amount of ability to alter the major events, you CAN change their outcomes in various ways. The writing is smart, and the way you make your character can vary in hundreds of ways, making this game one you can easily come back to any time for another go at, either for fun or to get all the different endings. I'd recommend this game to anyone that loves seeing what rewards and conquences lie behind even the slightest alterations your character makes.			"

												The game is fun, but very short and severely lacking. I beat it in less than a day.The game is basically like one of those old DOS command lines, but with a GUI. Instead of typing, for example/attackyou would click a dialog on screen that reads""Attack!""The story is mildly interesting, and mildly emotional. The dialogue gives you a good idea of what is going on. You can train Elodie in different skills. In one part of the game (minor spoilers, doesn't affect story) somebody sends you a box of chocolates that is poisoned. If Elodie is proficient in divination she will notice a bad omen and you will have the option of not eating the chocolates. If she has proficient knowledge in poison, medicine, or herbs she will be able to heal after ingesting the poison. If Elodie hasn't been trained in any of these things she will eat the chocolates and die.I really wish the game would continue past coronation. It is very fun and entertaining, some of the battles and dialogue is really intense and gets you going. It stops short, however. It would also be cool if there was more visual feedback. Instead of:""A fierce battle rages on. elodie makes lots of explosions with her magic and bodies fly everywhere"" it would be cool if there were animations that showed these things happening. Sometimes the battles can be difficult to visualize and it takes you out of the moment.That being said the game is very fun to play and I definitely recommend it for those who like command line or RPG games. It is very fun and I enjoyed it very much.			"

												TL;DR: Great game. Your options may seem limited, but they accumulate, and in the end you will desperately try to find the one way to save poor Elodie from yet another grisly death while also trying to figure out who wrote dirty poetry about you. Incredible replay value due to branching story.In the game, you take control of Elodie, a princess whose mother has recently died and who is about to inherit the throne. She just turned fourteen, and you have one year to mold her into the queen she will have to be. Along the way, there are plenty of opportunities to die, which you should avoid - or not; there is, after all, an achievement for dying in 11 different ways ;)You train Elodie by choosing classes for her, two every week, which gives her points in one of about 30 skills. During the story, skill-checks will pop up (binary choice, you either pass or don't, no luck involved) and inform you that you got/missed some information, succeeded in a task or will quite often leave you entirely guessing which influence your doing a good job at dancing at the ball had on the progress of the game - but that's fine, finding out is fun!Additionally, you spent your weekends doing things around the castle. Some further the story, others change your mood, and your mood changes your skill point gain. This means that you WILL be rooting for Elodie to please become more depressed and lonely, because happy people don't learn to handle animals as well.There are multiple ways to survive practially any challenge, and there are many secrets to discover in the story. I doubt you could find them all in one playthrough, or even three - there are just not enough weeks in the year to learn everything.In summary, for such a simple little game, I had and am having a lot of fun trying to do different things and (still!) trying to find the stupid 2nd lumen crystal and, and, and ....

												Have you ever thought to yourself, ""Gee I wonder what it would be like if I was Kawii Desu Nee-San anime Princess?"" Well think no more my friend, for this game has the answer. It starts with you (Princess Kawaii) being pulled out of school by you father because your ♥♥♥♥♥ of a mother selfishly died. With her out of the picture, it becomes your duty to become the next princess. You do this by taking 2 different classes every week which in turn increase some of your skill levels. However this isn't like Skyrim where you can be a god at everything, instead you need to be a bit more carfull in what skill you want to increase.For example, if you wish to level up your intelect through history and diplomancy, you may be able to flatter that losser of a Prince after you remember his birthday. However in doing this you probably won't be skilled enough to dodge the arrow that just penetrated your Liver. Oh look, you're dead, try again...After you have completed your classes for the week, you than get see some more of the story unfold. It is also here where your learnt skills come into action, as they determin your success. You also get to make some choices in these events that ultimatly determin the fate of you and your kindom. There are also alot of pre-set events that you can't do anything about, so I wouldn't get to exited. My personal favourite event was when some peasent sent me a fanfiction of me having sex with a Squid.After these events you get the option of choosing an activity to do over the weekend, this affects your mood, which in turn affects how well you learn in your classes. Say if you are in an Angry mood, you will get a bounis in Swordfighting, but you will recive a penalty to Accounting. There are plenty of ways to play this game, however it can't can't give you endless enjoyment like 'Barbie Dollhouse Adventure' as after a few tries at the game, you notice that the story may be fairly linear. But that may have just been because I wasn't very imaginative with what actions I took during the game. I don't really have many dislikes with this game, possibably because I came in not expecting very much. One annoyance was that the only charater that shows any emotion at all is you. Also be prepared with the lore in this game, as there are heaps of Dukes and Duchesses which I couldn't be bothered to remember.I bought this game when it was on sale for $1.50 and I personally think $10 is a bit too much for this game. However if you buy it, it's a fairly fun little indie game.			"

												“Long Live the Queen” is a life simulation game that’s reminiscent towards games like “Princess Maker” in Japan.Primarily, the main goal is to have Elodie, the princess that the player has to “raise” and help her survive wars, potential threats, and ward off unwanted suitors before she could become queen at fifteen years old, who is considered as a legal adult in this time period.There are different classes Elodie could take – such as, conversations, royal demeanor, animal handling, history, economics, faith, military, athletics, agility, and much much more! The more classes she takes, the more her skills will rise. The more her skills rise, the better she can understand certain conversations to progress the story along. Of course, it’s completely up to the player on what kind of queen Elodie could be just based on the choices made alone. There really isn’t an end to the choices to choose from!One of the main things that brings people to this game is not just what kind of queen she would be but if she’s going to survive long enough to become a queen. There are various ways to die in this game and each one is actually part of the achievements – which is a unique thing about it since most games would try to prevent that from happening.There is a way to avoid dying, of course, but the player has to make sure that her skill set for certain actions are pretty much almost completely filled up.Another unique thing about this game is the mood system. For every mood that she is, there’s a penalty and there’s a bonus. Certain moods help boost up skills for whatever class the player chooses for her and others, well, not so much. There’s actually a penalty if the player makes Elodie take the wrong classes for a certain mood she’s in.There are outfits the player can unlock, so long as that particular subject is pretty well-balanced. These outfits help boost up that particular subject, especially if she’s in a war, a tournament, or at the gala, although more often than not, they’re just there to change up from her boarding school uniform.If Elodie does manage to survive to coronation, there are epilogues afterwards based on the choices that the player makes. They’re the literal result of what happens based on the player’s choices and decisions as a young fourteen year old girl trying to become a Queen.Not only does the epilogues come in what happened to Elodie and her subjects (if they’re involved in any way), but they come in beautiful drawings that’s similar to stained glass on the castle walls.But what do I think of it? I really enjoyed it! It’s a lot of fun and it’s fun to try to get the different endings and different deaths. There’s actually a checklist within the game itself to try to get all the achievements, deaths, and different epilogue stained glasses to try to vary the game experience up.While it does seem that the endings are endless, there are a few problems.Going over the game over and over, eventually, it starts to become extremely repetitive. Sometimes new menus and new choices pop up which could lead to different endings/results but eventually, the player might have to pass by that same choice and those same scenes again just to get to the choices that the player has to deviate from.It’s a little bit of a bore but there is the option to skip the text so it’s really not that bad. Once new text pops up, though, it stops so the player can read it. There is the option to go back and re-do the choices but it doesn’t work all the time, so be sure you know what you’re doing in terms of choices.The writing for the political intrigue is pretty basic for a life simulation game but, honestly, I’m not sure if that’s really a complaint or not. On one hand, the player would know exactly what to do in a situation such as that and it’d seem exactly as it is: too easy to figure out. On the other hand, it does give the player an opportunity to go back and do the other choice just for the fun of it and just to see what happens. It’s not really hard to get invested in what’s going on in Nova, the land this takes place in, but it’s just as easy not to.The art is a hit or a miss for me. The character designs are simple, but one of the characters, Julianna the Duchess of Ursul, reminds me almost completely of Sailor Mercury of “Sailor Moon”. It’s a little distracting.The backgrounds for the game are fine but, again, tend to be simple since the backgrounds don’t seem to change that often. There are places Elodie can go during the weekend, but there’s not a real immersion factor here although I’m sure that’s probably not intended.Often, it’s hard to determine how old the characters are (especially the older gentleman who sends Elodie a necklace, customary for betrothal) but it’s clear when they’re supposed to be young though it’s hard discerning whether they’re a teenager or not if one isn’t paying attention to the dialogue.More often than not, there’s almost unfinished feel with it. Granted, this game isn’t really meant to be something completely serious and, again as I mentioned before, it’s easy to not get as invested in it since there’s achievements for deaths. If you didn’t get the ending you want, it’s not like the game’s going to punish you – you’ll probably get an achievement out of it instead which could be beneficial if that’s what the player wanted.The music for the game fits it although maybe not the splash song. It’s a piano version of “God Save the Queen”, the British national anthem but the rest of the game’s music is fine. Of course, if the player doesn’t want the music, they could always turn it off in the preferences.As for the intrigue of Elodie’s mother’s demise, it’s pretty cut and dried. Based on the story itself when I got there, it’s so throwaway that her mother being dead might as well not have mattered.  From the way they alluded her mother’s death, I thought that this would finally get some deep stuff about the Lumens and why this world is the way it is (sort of modern but still in past fantasy/medieval) but it didn’t really end up that way, so that was disappointing.Perhaps it’s best that way though – if the entirety for the game is simple, there really isn’t any rhyme or reason why anything else would be more important than anything else. If there is any real intrigue, it’s about some of the preferences the dukes and duchesses have for company. Other than that, there’s no real intrigue. As mentioned over and over, this is pretty much cut & dried. It’s a simple story for a simple game about simply raising a princess named Elodie who may or may not become queen.It’s a fun ride, despite it all, and it certainly does have replay value even after the 100% achievements (epilogues, deaths, & achievements) have been unlocked. It’s not too deep and the art is cute although some people probably wouldn’t like it too much if they’re looking for a simulation with some depth to it. It is a fun game, though, and I’d recommend this to those who just want to try different things without worrying too much about the princess they’re trying to raise.			"

												A cross between interactive story and Princess Maker, this game puts you in charge of Princess Elodie. She is a 13 year old girl who's mother, the Queen, has just died and she now has a year to prepare for her coronation and rulership, as she'll take the throne at age 14. You decide what classes she takes each week, as she'll need certain skills to progress the story in certain ways. Maybe she'll know enough about Espionage to realize nobles are plotting against her? Or what if she doesn't know enough about Court Manners to know that necklace from a distance noble is a courting gift? Will she be able to survive an assassination attempt?With multiple different endings, fans of the Princess Maker series and interactive stories will definitely love this game.			"

												Fun game, not really a hardcore game other than dying every time you step away from your castle... Break a leg? Nah, break your neck instead. Or cut off other peoples' necks, because you're queen-to-be.Game is intended for more casual play - if you want to build up armies like strategy games this is not for you. You explore life as an incredibly death-prone princess, gameplay consists of choosing what type of ingame lore to learn as skills (Image third from the left of the slideshow up top, or second image from the left) and then as time goes by, seeing what events happen and how your skills affect things. Have enough training in <x> skill? Succeed as a suave queen with your composure/knowledge/wit. Fail, and revert to the bratty princess that you are.Gaining skills is affected by what mood you are in - be depressed, and you will not like the royalty training like elegance and composure but you will like animals, so negative buff to training <x> skills and positive buffs to other skills. Affect your mood each week by exploring different parts of the castle during the week.Visually looks nice. Nice. Heh. Nothing particularly graphic or demanding, PG rated or whatever. 10/10 in terms of fun, might not be too long lived and price could be considered slightly high but it's fair enough. Good fun.			"

												This is the first of its kind of game I have played ever. I don't even remember buying it either. Just randomly saw it in my list of games one day and decided to check it out. The rules are really simple: attend class, story event, and repeat. Though it does indeed sound repetitive, and is, there is a great deal of enjoyment out of it, as what classes you choose and which story events you get are part of a larger scale. There are multiple paths and endings you could get as well. It took me over 5hours on the first play through cause I simply kept on dying. Yeah... died lol. A lot of choices are to be made. So choose wisely.Overall though it is a really fun game. Through out the whole time I was playing, time seemed to move by so fast. Woke up in the morning and didn't realize it was already late into the afternoon.			"

												Although I am usually NOT a fan of Roguelike perma-death / Start over type games (& over, and over, and over, etc), Long Live the Queen is too perfectly charming not to like.It is a very well designed game. You learn as you go, how to avoid certain traps by focusing on learning certain skills before others. It took me a few short-lived (for the Queen) run-thrus to get the hang of the simple system. Or rather, to see what choices I should have made early on. But really, you're going to be doing that throughout the game anyway.It's not as easy as I thought it would be. But you start caring about the little Queen and you really want her to succeed....or live for that matter. And keeping her alive is no easy task. At least not for me. The dialog options are good & you make choices that really matter & that have potentially severe consequences. IMO the writing is very tight in this area. It's one of the things I liked most. It has slight RPG elements, in that you decide what she will learn. The classes you choose for her will increase her skill in specific areas, all of which are vitally important to her continued existence, and all of which will affect your dialog options at some point throughout the entire game. It's all tied together very nicely.So if you are a fan of games with a decent story, or a fan of Roguelikes in general, I recommend you buy this little gem and enjoy the heck out of it. If you like Visual Novels you will enjoy this....though Queen is a LOT more interactive than most VN's as it is an actual game first.It's a fun little game to spend time with & I certainly encourage everyone to try it!

												Long Live The Queen is a nice challenging little game. You can choose from many very different paths and do many drastically different choices to reach your Queenhood. There are even more ways to fail in this quest for power. Once you learn the important things, you should be able to win the game. It can, however, feel only half won as your kingdom didn't end up as nice as you hoped. With that in mind Long Live The Queen has also some replay value especially for those people who want thing to be just perfect.			"

												Long Live The Queen is a simulation role-playing-game that places you in the role of a princess on the road to becoming queen. Placing aside the images usually conjured by well-known fairy tales, being a princess as it turns out is very difficult. To make it to your coronation you will need to better yourself and make important decisions along the way. There is a lot to learn as a princess, everything from etiquette to history to military strategy to athletics and everything in between. Careful selection of what you learn and how well you learn it can open up new opportunities as well as avoid nasty failures on skill checks. How well you learn a subject is also dependent on your mood which can shift depending on what actions you take and how you spend your weekends.In many ways, Long Live The Queen is similar to Princess Maker which also features a princess with different skills to learn. The key difference being that in Princess Maker you play a king raising a daughter where as Long Live The Queen places you in the role of the princess dealing with political issues of every sort. There is a lot of agency to Long Live The Queen and the story can take radically different turns depending on what actions you take and how well versed you are in certain subjects. So there is much more at stake in Long Live The Queen than in Princess Maker. Who do you trust? Do you take the diplomatic solution or use force? Do you get involved in problems where success is not guaranteed? The first few times playing you will usually meet an untimely demise before ever seeing your coronation.Overall, Long Live The Queen is a fantastic and refreshing game. With so many decisions to make, there are a number of directions the story can go. And even if you fail, it's still enjoyable to just get back up and try again with something different. So if you've ever wanted to be a princess or just have fun as a ruler, I would highly recommend this game.			"

												Imagine a game that is the apotheosis of all games, a brilliant fusion of story and mechanics and art that leads you to new emotional catharsis when you replay it every year.  The game also washes your dishes, files your taxes, and reminds you to call your mother on her birthday.Sounds like a game worth having, right?  But what if it cost $10,000, along with half your hair, both your index fingers, your favorite toe, and the promise of eternal agony in your least preferred afterlife?  It's probably not worth it then, right?Long Live The Queen is a game that is not the apotheosis of all games.  As such, I'd judge its non-sale Steam price of $9.99 as too high.  But if you buy it for $1.99 during a sale, then I'd say it was definitely worth it.At its heart, Long Live The Queen is a choose-your-own-adventure about a princess hoping to survive to queendom.  It has the added twist that each day, you choose two of 14 classes for your princess to take - classes ranging from Royal Demeanor to Climbing to Military Strategy.  Story branches appear and disappear according to your choices, and it is easy to end up impaled by a sword or punctured by arrows or eaten by krakens.This has reasonable amusement value, one that does eventually wear off; laughter turns to snickers turns to forced grins.  Fortunately, by the time I reached the eyeroll phase, I judged my enjoyment of the game up to that point to be worth roughly $2.61.  Which meant that I did more than break even on this game.

												This game way is much more than I thought it was going to be. At first glance it looks like some girly game only a weeabo or a girl would play, but I was wrong. Comparing this game to Princess Maker is actually insultng. There is much more depth and much more outcomes that can happen based on what you leveled up in. The fine details of the story are easily forgotten but the gist of the story is easy enough to understand. The game takes roots from magical girl culture from Japan with a basic RPG system. If you love exploring new outcomes and experimenting different ways of trying to acomplish something this is the game for you. The game is VERY slow paced and there is no gameplay to speak of; basically like a visual novel. I highly reccommend this game to anyone into visual novels or likes games where you take your time like turn based games like Civ. 5. There isn't too much or any fast faced action if you were hoping for that.			"

												At first sight it looks like a easy game about a cute little princess.Your task is to stay alive for 40 weeks, every week you can choose 2 out of 42 Skills to learn.Sounds easy right?You will soon realise that this game is anything but easy!Almost every week your skills are put to a test and failure may result in death, actually it does almost always put you on a path with a dead Elodie waiting at the end.So you need to choose your skills wisely, as if this wouldn't be hard enough already the value in which your skills increase is affected by your mood. I guess you can imagine how hard it is too keep an 14 year old princess in the mood you need.For every skill set there is an outfit to unlock that boosts these stats, they are all pretty cute and detailed.If you are looking for  a challenge you won't find anywhere else this is a must-buy.

												I was excited that Steam had this game. I didn't think I'd find anything like it on Steam. I love dating and/or growing up simulation games, like Princess Maker 2, and RE:Alistair++, but you usually don't see them around much).Update for Steam awards and more detail.The game is in a similar vein to games like Princess Maker 2 and Spirited Heart. You spend time raising your combination of Elodie's many stats in hopes of keeping her alive (and as queen) until her coronation. Unless you're looking at a guide, you're going to die. A few times. There are many parts of the story where you have to meet certain skill checks (one of the achievements is for finding 11 ways to die. This means ""poisoned"", ""stabbed"", ""drowned"", not stabbed by 11 different people or missing 11 skill checks to drown.There's two really cool things to that, though: (1) they always tell you where you failed (or even partially pass) a skill check (not all fails kill you), so it adds to the replayability because you're curious about what you missed. But, it also doesn't give the exact numbers (IIRC), so you might not know exactly how much higher you need to make the skill. (2) For most of the situations that could kill you, there are either ways to avoid the situation altogether, or multiple ways to pass the scenario.For example:  Based on a skill check, you can get a choice on whether or not to eat poisoned food. If you fail that check, you don't get a choice--Elodie chooses to eat it. But, based on another skill check, she can be prevented from eating it. If that skill check fails, though, she eats it and gets poisoned. But, THEN there's a check for a different skill for you to counteract the poison.This means you definitely have to put some points in a few areas you might not think of, but it still gives you a lot of room to play Elodie as an overall character that you like. Want Elodie to be a pacifist? You don't need to know archery, but you'll probably want to know medicine.For that, I decided to suggest a category to nominate LLtQ in: ""Replay to Win"". I wanted it to be a category for those types of games where you usually start over to get ahead. Often times, those are visual novels, or games like Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 (where you have to repeat the 2-week vacation).			"

												TL;DR - for those who don't like scrollingThis is an excellent purely story based game where decisions have REAL consequence.  Expect a challenge.  Extremely highly recommend at full price.Full review:INTRODUCTIONI have been considering this game for a while before getting it, finally picked it up in the best humble bundle I purchased yet for this game alone.  Do not be offput by the general public brushing it off as a dating sim, that is (or should I say can be) such a tiny aspect of the game I don't even really consider it while I play.SO WHAT IS THE GAME ABOUT?This game is about the struggles of a young girl about to become queen, as it says in the description.  Morethan that though, this game is about how your every move and decision is constantly changing and effecting the world around you creating hilarious, tragic, unexpected, and moving ways to live or die at every turn.  Atfirst the game will seem quite simple, but after your third, fourth, fifth....... death, you will realize just how deep the game can go.  The game's events are generally in a particular order, but those can change and diverge greatly and quickly based on what you choose.THE GOODChoices and meaning.  This game does an excellent job of portraying not only that your choices mattered, but what each one actually meant.  This is extremely empowering to the player.  On the flipside, situations beyond your control, not because the game is unfair, but because of a choice you made... or didn't make, happen frequently and keep you on your toes.  You can feel like a god wielding magic user with all the military knowledge in the world, feel unstoppable as you crush armies with your will alone, but what happens when you get an unexpected gift?  Do you really know what it means?THE BADSoundtrack.  That's about it.  It's a repetitive set of canned classical masterpieces in lovely midi form.  Beynd that, as long as you realize this is a text game where immersion relies on your imagination instead of clunky controls and flashy graphics, you won't have any huge issues.THE INDIFFERENTAs far as things which I don't find good or bad, but worth bringing up there are two.  First is the artwork.  I personally find it well done, but not my favorite style.  All the male characters are to ""kawaii"" and some of the outfits are just silly, like a catsuit with a monocle.  Second is the difficulty.  While I welcome a challange, the game doesn't really lend itself to constant ""save states"" and it's usually better to start over every time you die.  While some people may not like the difficulty, I feel indifferent as the starting over is annoying since the first few events will be the same, but after that it is fun to see how the tiny change in your first 3 weeks completely changes the feel of the game.IT'S FINALLY OVERIn closing, this is one of the best story driven games I have ever played.  I seek out games like this, such as A Dark Room (iOS), Indigo Prophecy / Heavy Rain (must play games for those who like story), and many other, less noteworthy titles.  Out of all of them though, this one may not be the absolute best, but it does do the absolute best job at giving the player power within the story, without giving the player power to control it like a god (I'm looking at you Indigo Prophecy).

												The game is easier than the trailer makes it to be- very seldom do you need a seemingly useless skill. There is some trial and error (much more if you're trying to 100% it), but mostly just common sense mixed with a vaguely general idea how European feudal court politics operated are all you need to get pretty far on a blind run (if not beat it). Magic is completely overpowered once you level it up, which isn't hard, and isn't needed to beat the game. The biggest pain is figuring out which moods give what bonuses/penalties when learning stats. This visual novel has some decent replay value despite the linear story- the minor variances on successive playthroughs add up fairly well.			"

While you don't have an exceptional amount of ability to alter the major events, you CAN change their outcomes in various ways. The writing is smart, and the way you make your character can vary in hundreds of ways, making this game one you can easily come back to any time for another go at, either for fun or to get all the different endings. I'd recommend this game to anyone that loves seeing what rewards and conquences lie behind even the slightest alterations your character makes.			"

												Although I am usually NOT a fan of Roguelike perma-death / Start over type games (& over, and over, and over, etc), Long Live the Queen is too perfectly charming not to like.It is a very well designed game. You learn as you go, how to avoid certain traps by focusing on learning certain skills before others. It took me a few short-lived (for the Queen) run-thrus to get the hang of the simple system. Or rather, to see what choices I should have made early on. But really, you're going to be doing that throughout the game anyway.It's not as easy as I thought it would be. But you start caring about the little Queen and you really want her to succeed....or live for that matter. And keeping her alive is no easy task. At least not for me. The dialog options are good & you make choices that really matter & that have potentially severe consequences. IMO the writing is very tight in this area. It's one of the things I liked most. It has slight RPG elements, in that you decide what she will learn. The classes you choose for her will increase her skill in specific areas, all of which are vitally important to her continued existence, and all of which will affect your dialog options at some point throughout the entire game. It's all tied together very nicely.So if you are a fan of games with a decent story, or a fan of Roguelikes in general, I recommend you buy this little gem and enjoy the heck out of it. If you like Visual Novels you will enjoy this....though Queen is a LOT more interactive than most VN's as it is an actual game first.It's a fun little game to spend time with & I certainly encourage everyone to try it!

												The game is fun, but very short and severely lacking. I beat it in less than a day.The game is basically like one of those old DOS command lines, but with a GUI. Instead of typing, for example/attackyou would click a dialog on screen that reads""Attack!""The story is mildly interesting, and mildly emotional. The dialogue gives you a good idea of what is going on. You can train Elodie in different skills. In one part of the game (minor spoilers, doesn't affect story) somebody sends you a box of chocolates that is poisoned. If Elodie is proficient in divination she will notice a bad omen and you will have the option of not eating the chocolates. If she has proficient knowledge in poison, medicine, or herbs she will be able to heal after ingesting the poison. If Elodie hasn't been trained in any of these things she will eat the chocolates and die.I really wish the game would continue past coronation. It is very fun and entertaining, some of the battles and dialogue is really intense and gets you going. It stops short, however. It would also be cool if there was more visual feedback. Instead of:""A fierce battle rages on. elodie makes lots of explosions with her magic and bodies fly everywhere"" it would be cool if there were animations that showed these things happening. Sometimes the battles can be difficult to visualize and it takes you out of the moment.That being said the game is very fun to play and I definitely recommend it for those who like command line or RPG games. It is very fun and I enjoyed it very much.			"

												This game is all about choice. Someone described it as a Sansa Stark simulator. That's quite fitting. You're playing as a young princess who ends up in the center of a dangerous political world. Unlike Sansa though, you'll be making most of the decisions.If you're curious about the gameplay, I recommend that you watch a review or a let's play clip. In short, it's much like a text-based RPG, with manga style art. You'll choose what the main character studies, what she does with her free time, and how she reacts to events. Her education is essential to both her survival and which choices are available.Recommended to players who enjoy the decision elements in roleplaying games.			"

												I love this game so much. The first time I opened it, I ended up playing for four hours straight, just trying to get coronated. Oh, did I mention it's also really hard? Yes, it's ridiculously easy to die and super difficult to get coronated. But that's the fun! It's very cute visually, with a dark humour that appeals to me. The ads for this are very accurate; you can mold Elodie any way you choose depending on her moods, but chances are you'll be poisoned by chocolate. Trust me, that happens a lot. My one complaint is that it seems you need to have max in one skill in order to win. This may just be my playing (though I've played through more than 20 times) and that seems a tad unfair. This comes from the fact I've noticed that, once you've figured out the game, it doesn't seem to change much. I haven't found different ways to die in a while (odd complaint, I know). But aside from that, it's still really addictive and though the story may not change much, the WAY you play does and that makes it interesting. If you like sim games, cutesy things and have a dark side, this game is for you. Avoid the chocolate though ;)			"

												Long Live The Queen is a nice challenging little game. You can choose from many very different paths and do many drastically different choices to reach your Queenhood. There are even more ways to fail in this quest for power. Once you learn the important things, you should be able to win the game. It can, however, feel only half won as your kingdom didn't end up as nice as you hoped. With that in mind Long Live The Queen has also some replay value especially for those people who want thing to be just perfect.			"

												Who didn't want to be a princess at somepoint in his/her life? ;) This game fulfills that fantasy in visual-novel style, while still enabling a significant amount of interactivity and decission making. You might be a little overwhelmed in the first playthrough by the amount of skill-sets, but you will soon get the hang of it. It is good that the game gives you feedback whenever a skill passed or failed to adapt you strategy for your next playthrough. Therefore I recommend also to save often and in different slots, because you will run into ""dead ends"" if you level up the wrong skills.I also like the mood system. Different moods give you bonusses for different skills, e.g. ""Depression"" boosts artistic skills, why ""Angry"" boosts military skills. I really like this system, because it justifies each ""mood"". There are also different outfits to unlock which also boost certain skills. Also a nice way to customize your charakter.The story is well written, but it's a little difficult to get to understand the different realms and relations between the charakters.Another motivating aspect is in a ""completionist"" way to unlock as many ""deaths"" or other achievements as possible. The ""skip"" function helps to try different approaches in a quick way. "

I never really played visual novels before, but after two hours into this experience I was enthralled. So simple, so stupid, there's no reason I should have enjoyed it as much as I did. Limited ability to fill your wide assortment skill sheets adds for some incredibly demanding replay value as you'll wanna keep seeing what happens differently. If you're a fan of anime drama and comedy like I am, you'll probably love this. If this isn't your flavor, by no means will it change your mind, but it's a ton of fun and a great way to relax. Heavy action games are great, playing online with friends is great, but here it's all about interesting decision making.

												A nice Dark Soul-ish game suitable for one sitting. Main complaint is the lack of diversity in ending, as there is only around one path to end it with too little variation. Many of the traits only have completionist uses, and since I tend to be more casual, this is also not a great quality. Also, the game is short, and I was expecting around at least twice as much main gameplay with restarts. Don't get me wrong, this was a thoroughly enjoyable game with a lot of thought put into the side missions. So if you like being a completionist or enjoy seeing all your hard work end abruptly (which IS humorous the first few times), or if you chust want to chill out to the AWESOMELY relaxing music, then this is a must.

												Long Live the Queen is the kind of game that takes the visual novel genre and makes it into something that's both frustrating yet fun. Similar to the Princess Maker games from Japan, the goal of the game is to aid Princess Elodie into Queendom so that she can continue looking after the realm. You do this by making decisions for Elodie and deciding which classes she should attend (2 per week) in order to polish her into a tru gem. Of course, it's not as simple as that.The story has multiple endings and many twists and turns which often evolve in the death of our dear Elodie. Commoner uprisings, magical wars and coups are all parts of what you have to avoid running into whilst hoping that along the way someone doesn't try and trick Elodie into eating poisoned chocolates. The game is fun with a lot of decisions but can get frustrating after seeing Elodie stumble at the same hurdle over and over again. Gameplay is literally using a mouse to pick decisions but the interactivity of the story makes up for it. The additional clothes for Elodie are a nice touch. If you're an achievement hunter there are plenty of achievements to be found, and as there are different storylines there's a lot of replaying that can be done with satisfyig conclusions. Towards the end when you have almost 100% it can get tedious going through the same story again and again, however.Overall this game is great in any collection and not just for girls. :) Long live the Queen!

												Let me just start by saying that this is a suprisingly fun game. If somebody told me I would spend over 15 hours playing this game I would not believe it. This is a visual novel which means that you basicly play through a story making descisions along the way changing up the story everytime you play it through (which can take between 10-40 minutes). Depending on the path you take you will lead to different endings and a lot of them being... your death. Throughout the game you will level up different traits, depending on what you choose to focus on different part of the stories will be easier for you to complete and changes your possible paths. If you fail a test it's not the end of the world unless... you die. And even if death comes a lot and often and forces you to restart it's acutally not frustrating, instead it works as a motivator to play differently next time. With every restart you want to know what happens if you level different traits, completing a trait test you didn't complete the last time. For example, if I become a animal trainer will my pet dog become a great strong guard dog? Or will I be able to tame animals throughout the story? You want to know!I do understand this game is not for everyone, if you're not a fan of slow/reading heavy games you probably dont want to get this. But if you get a chance to try it, DO SO. Suprisingly fun and of course you want to collect every possible DEATH achievement...Recommended!/ Nurgleprobe "

												I know I don't have many hours into this game, but I NEEDED to get this review out of the way because I have a couple of things I need to say. This game is ♥♥♥♥ED UP. I took a small look at the Steam cards for the game, and they're all ways you can be murdered within the game with adorable pictures of our unnamed princess in various horrific ends to her life. My favorite being 'Run Through' which she has a shocked expression with a cutlass THROUGH HER CHEST. But don't worry, it's in a chibi type art style! So it's not too gruesome. That doesn't change the fact that this points out at least part of the game in centered around death, and the death of the main character. Hell, at the beginning her mother died. If she had the luck of her daughter, I couldn't imagine why.The exposition is fairly tame in a game you'd expect to take up your entire expierence before you just give up and play another game. The point of the game? It took me a while to figure out, but the princess is trying to be married. So you are NOT a queen, but that's just nitpicking. Firstly, I can't stand most of the canidates that she's supposed to take the hand of for marriage. I couldn't find an interesting one anywhere, and to be fair, the princess and her cousin (which is briefly killed off by a snake) are the only ones I found with personality. The rest of them are very..Emotionless. To be honest it matches their pictures in game pretty well.I do like the skill system in this game, very complex and the game keeps you thinking on which one you should train in next. One situation, you'll have to use reflexes to LIVE or you'll be screwed over because you don't have enough knowledge of foreign countries!...And it turns into a shoot and miss simulator. You just have to pray you trained in the right stuff. I love the art this game delivers though, of course I love the style, being anime and such. I mean I love anime, as you can see from my profile picture. Gameplay is simple, it's a strategy game that's not forgiving in any way. I've played a lot of unforgiving recently, Five Nights at Freddy's 2, Risk of Rain, Rogue Legacy, hell even Dark Souls 2 and this definitely amung those titles. Although I'm not sure with the difficulty spike in this game as the other titles follow (except Rogue Legacy that just starts out difficult). More of just an awkward curve before the game upright kills you.6.2/10 "

												I got the game in a bundle without even knowing what it was, and I'm so glad that I did. I'm a meticulous person at heart, and organization is a personal passion. So when I started this game, with branching paths all over the place and all different unlockable story components and opportunities, I was in heaven. I've got a Word document saved right now, detailing the different paths and the effects of succeeding or failing each test. It's far from complete, and I'm certain there will be hours and hours of additional entertainment as I seek out the deaths, epilogues, and achievements that still elude me as I fill in more of my ever-growing chart of options.Be aware, there's no such thing as a ""perfect"" game. I nearly drove myself mad attempting to raise stats in such a way that I passed every test. You simply cannot, and I think it's for the better. The game forces you to choose what knowledge and opportunities are most important to you and give up the rest or simply save it for another playthrough.The artwork and different outfits are cute, and I appreciated that aspect of the game. However, if you do buy the game (and if you're anything like me, I hope you do because you'll have a blast), make sure you're doing it for the strategy and story element, since those are what truly make the game something special.

												TL;DR - for those who don't like scrollingThis is an excellent purely story based game where decisions have REAL consequence.  Expect a challenge.  Extremely highly recommend at full price.Full review:INTRODUCTIONI have been considering this game for a while before getting it, finally picked it up in the best humble bundle I purchased yet for this game alone.  Do not be offput by the general public brushing it off as a dating sim, that is (or should I say can be) such a tiny aspect of the game I don't even really consider it while I play.SO WHAT IS THE GAME ABOUT?This game is about the struggles of a young girl about to become queen, as it says in the description.  Morethan that though, this game is about how your every move and decision is constantly changing and effecting the world around you creating hilarious, tragic, unexpected, and moving ways to live or die at every turn.  Atfirst the game will seem quite simple, but after your third, fourth, fifth....... death, you will realize just how deep the game can go.  The game's events are generally in a particular order, but those can change and diverge greatly and quickly based on what you choose.THE GOODChoices and meaning.  This game does an excellent job of portraying not only that your choices mattered, but what each one actually meant.  This is extremely empowering to the player.  On the flipside, situations beyond your control, not because the game is unfair, but because of a choice you made... or didn't make, happen frequently and keep you on your toes.  You can feel like a god wielding magic user with all the military knowledge in the world, feel unstoppable as you crush armies with your will alone, but what happens when you get an unexpected gift?  Do you really know what it means?THE BADSoundtrack.  That's about it.  It's a repetitive set of canned classical masterpieces in lovely midi form.  Beynd that, as long as you realize this is a text game where immersion relies on your imagination instead of clunky controls and flashy graphics, you won't have any huge issues.THE INDIFFERENTAs far as things which I don't find good or bad, but worth bringing up there are two.  First is the artwork.  I personally find it well done, but not my favorite style.  All the male characters are to ""kawaii"" and some of the outfits are just silly, like a catsuit with a monocle.  Second is the difficulty.  While I welcome a challange, the game doesn't really lend itself to constant ""save states"" and it's usually better to start over every time you die.  While some people may not like the difficulty, I feel indifferent as the starting over is annoying since the first few events will be the same, but after that it is fun to see how the tiny change in your first 3 weeks completely changes the feel of the game.IT'S FINALLY OVERIn closing, this is one of the best story driven games I have ever played.  I seek out games like this, such as A Dark Room (iOS), Indigo Prophecy / Heavy Rain (must play games for those who like story), and many other, less noteworthy titles.  Out of all of them though, this one may not be the absolute best, but it does do the absolute best job at giving the player power within the story, without giving the player power to control it like a god (I'm looking at you Indigo Prophecy).

												You guided a mood-swing 14-year old anime girl through 40 weeks of Game of Thrones to reach her sweet-15 birthday and be crowned Queen in this Sim-Decisionmaking-EdgeofTomorrow-Simulator. Despite its flaws with many situations where it lacks reasonable option the game is actually....fairly reasonable and fun. Your decision is long-last and actually hurts your playthrough, but you will never know what the consequences of any of the actions nor events that happen is unless you're going through your second playthrough+....that is....you died. Yes, in this game, you'll die a lot, both literally and figuratively. There's also a scene that involves tentacle monster but not the kind that you're thinking. Enjoy.			"

												Do you have what it takes to stay alive? Probably not. Will it tick you off to no end?Probably. Will it be fun? Only if you're masochistic. As it turns out, I am apparently masochistic. This game is extremely addictive, with a relatively simple yet alarmingly improbable premise: survive to your fifteenth birthday. You'll face traitorous relatives, violent monsters, unpredictable magic, court room drama, espionage, and murder. There are more ways to die in this game than to survive. You'll get at least four hours play out of it just trying to survive one playthrough. It's the kind of game that will make you try and try again, and the various outcomes and differences in decision can drastically alter the storyline. Ergo, while certain events over the course of playthrough will stay the same, the end result of differing choices will likely be new to you long into becoming familiar with the game. All in all, Long Live The Queen is a fun (annoying) little game that will provide hours of entertainment (frustration). It has great art, a quirky storyline, and is perfect for visual novel fans. 8/10.			"

												I got the game in a bundle without even knowing what it was, and I'm so glad that I did. I'm a meticulous person at heart, and organization is a personal passion. So when I started this game, with branching paths all over the place and all different unlockable story components and opportunities, I was in heaven. I've got a Word document saved right now, detailing the different paths and the effects of succeeding or failing each test. It's far from complete, and I'm certain there will be hours and hours of additional entertainment as I seek out the deaths, epilogues, and achievements that still elude me as I fill in more of my ever-growing chart of options.Be aware, there's no such thing as a ""perfect"" game. I nearly drove myself mad attempting to raise stats in such a way that I passed every test. You simply cannot, and I think it's for the better. The game forces you to choose what knowledge and opportunities are most important to you and give up the rest or simply save it for another playthrough.The artwork and different outfits are cute, and I appreciated that aspect of the game. However, if you do buy the game (and if you're anything like me, I hope you do because you'll have a blast), make sure you're doing it for the strategy and story element, since those are what truly make the game something special.

												Fun game, not really a hardcore game other than dying every time you step away from your castle... Break a leg? Nah, break your neck instead. Or cut off other peoples' necks, because you're queen-to-be.Game is intended for more casual play - if you want to build up armies like strategy games this is not for you. You explore life as an incredibly death-prone princess, gameplay consists of choosing what type of ingame lore to learn as skills (Image third from the left of the slideshow up top, or second image from the left) and then as time goes by, seeing what events happen and how your skills affect things. Have enough training in <x> skill? Succeed as a suave queen with your composure/knowledge/wit. Fail, and revert to the bratty princess that you are.Gaining skills is affected by what mood you are in - be depressed, and you will not like the royalty training like elegance and composure but you will like animals, so negative buff to training <x> skills and positive buffs to other skills. Affect your mood each week by exploring different parts of the castle during the week.Visually looks nice. Nice. Heh. Nothing particularly graphic or demanding, PG rated or whatever. 10/10 in terms of fun, might not be too long lived and price could be considered slightly high but it's fair enough. Good fun.			"

												This game way is much more than I thought it was going to be. At first glance it looks like some girly game only a weeabo or a girl would play, but I was wrong. Comparing this game to Princess Maker is actually insultng. There is much more depth and much more outcomes that can happen based on what you leveled up in. The fine details of the story are easily forgotten but the gist of the story is easy enough to understand. The game takes roots from magical girl culture from Japan with a basic RPG system. If you love exploring new outcomes and experimenting different ways of trying to acomplish something this is the game for you. The game is VERY slow paced and there is no gameplay to speak of; basically like a visual novel. I highly reccommend this game to anyone into visual novels or likes games where you take your time like turn based games like Civ. 5. There isn't too much or any fast faced action if you were hoping for that.			"

There are even more ways to fail in this quest for power. Once you learn the important things, you should be able to win the game. It can, however, feel only half won as your kingdom didn't end up as nice as you hoped.

Normally I am not into these kind of games, but for my own surprise, it was actually pretty decent.It doesn't take that long to meet your death. So one round (=until your death) was nicely short and one could play it every now and then. But sure, I got addicted to find the way to survive and it took rather long for me to make poor Elodie to survive until her coronation day. So yeah, I suppose I kinda liked it.

												Have you ever thought to yourself, ""Gee I wonder what it would be like if I was Kawii Desu Nee-San anime Princess?"" Well think no more my friend, for this game has the answer. It starts with you (Princess Kawaii) being pulled out of school by you father because your ♥♥♥♥♥ of a mother selfishly died. With her out of the picture, it becomes your duty to become the next princess. You do this by taking 2 different classes every week which in turn increase some of your skill levels. However this isn't like Skyrim where you can be a god at everything, instead you need to be a bit more carfull in what skill you want to increase.For example, if you wish to level up your intelect through history and diplomancy, you may be able to flatter that losser of a Prince after you remember his birthday. However in doing this you probably won't be skilled enough to dodge the arrow that just penetrated your Liver. Oh look, you're dead, try again...After you have completed your classes for the week, you than get see some more of the story unfold. It is also here where your learnt skills come into action, as they determin your success. You also get to make some choices in these events that ultimatly determin the fate of you and your kindom. There are also alot of pre-set events that you can't do anything about, so I wouldn't get to exited. My personal favourite event was when some peasent sent me a fanfiction of me having sex with a Squid.After these events you get the option of choosing an activity to do over the weekend, this affects your mood, which in turn affects how well you learn in your classes. Say if you are in an Angry mood, you will get a bounis in Swordfighting, but you will recive a penalty to Accounting. There are plenty of ways to play this game, however it can't can't give you endless enjoyment like 'Barbie Dollhouse Adventure' as after a few tries at the game, you notice that the story may be fairly linear. But that may have just been because I wasn't very imaginative with what actions I took during the game. I don't really have many dislikes with this game, possibably because I came in not expecting very much. One annoyance was that the only charater that shows any emotion at all is you. Also be prepared with the lore in this game, as there are heaps of Dukes and Duchesses which I couldn't be bothered to remember.I bought this game when it was on sale for $1.50 and I personally think $10 is a bit too much for this game. However if you buy it, it's a fairly fun little indie game.			"

												In Long Live the Queen you play as the Princess Elodie, who is getting ready to be crowned Queen. But can you keep her alive – safe from assassins, magic, and public revolt – until then? LLTQ is a kind of choose your own adventure with surprisingly complex systems. Every turn Elodie has the choice of leveling up 2 of 42 possible skills (things like Royal Demeanor, Archery, or Foreign Intelligence) in order to prepare her for being queen. Elodie’s mood also affects how quickly she learns, so that needs to be managed as well in order to optimize.When I started playing this game, I felt like an utter failure. Every time an event happened that tested one of these skills I failed because I had chosen to learn something else. It was a bit off-putting. However, after playing through a couple times I learned that I didn’t have to pass every check, and it was better to level a few skills up a lot rather than try to learn everything. It’s a pretty cool game, and I’ve been having fun trying to discover all the different events and endings.			"

												WARNINGThis game is ADDICTING. When I started playing LLTQ I thought it would get old after the first game. But God do you get annoyed after that first death and are CONVINCED you can beat it if you just play one more time. 25 times later and Elodie still isn't the queen and you're still banging your head wondering what choice you made that went wrong. The best part of the game is that every time you play, it's just as unique (assuming you make new choices and study new things). There are a few monotonies, such as the characters. Overall 9/10, would recommend.			"

												Even after you're able to beat the game, you're gonna want to see what you could of done differently to get to the same goal. Though you will die a large amount the first go around, you will want to see what happens if you fill enough of a subject and that is what helps the game keep it's replayability since the path will alter slightly.

												Princess Elodie recently lost her mother. In 40 weeks, she'll be crowned Queen of Nova, that is, if she survives. This is, basically, a choose your own adventure where you get to stat out Elodie in the hopes of dealing with the scenarios that come up. It's a fun game of character management and intrigue. It isn't possible to get everything out of the setting in just one sitting. Luckily, Elodie dies a lot.			"

												This is not your average visual novel. You are in charge and you make every decision. And there are a LOT of decisions. You will die in many more ways than you'll ever win.In Long Live the Queen, you guide Princess Elodie on her journey to becoming the Queen of Nova, an empire that has lost a lot of its old strength. It's up to you to prepare yourself for your coronation in 40 weeks on your 15th birthday. There are many obstacles in your path such as warring neighbors, magical secrets, and flirty princes. How you establish yourself as the Queen is entirely up to you.The game is played one week at a time allowing you to train Elodie in two skills from a list of about forty and usually followed by an event in the evening that forces you to make a game changing decision. Making these decisions is difficult due to the cost and reward trade-offs that are not always visible. Your available options during events as well as the outcome of your choices are determined by skill checks that show if you've failed, succeeded, or partially succeeded. It's impossible to play a perfect game as you cannot train your skills to pass each event. This gives the game an ample amount of replay value to go back and train different skills to pass different events.Training skills is more complicated than simply picking a class to learn. There are bonuses and penalties applied to learning skill groups based on your current most overwhelming mood. Throughout the game you will encounter events that make you angry, afraid, cheerful, depressed, willful, yielding, pressured, and/or lonely and it's a difficult balancing act to push Elodie into the mood that fits your current strategy. At the end of each week you also get the opportunity to do a simple activity that gives you some control over which mood Elodie will be in during the following week. Mastering control of Elodie's mood is extremely important and learning the mechanics behind it is vital to your success.The setting, story, and mood all play very well together in Long Live the Queen. The developer clearly had a strong idea of what stories were to be presented and, although it might not look like it at first, everything has an importance. The music can be a little repetitive, but it does change frequently enough between classes, events, and activities that I never grew tired of it. I was often aware of where the game was headed based on music cues and facial expressions of the characters without having to read any of the text. The dialog never drags on, but if you've viewed the scene before you have the option to skip the text which I never used until I had completed the majority of the game.I love this game. My girlfriend loves this game. My girlfriends loves the fact that I love this game. I expect many men to never give this game a chance simply because it's a game about being a princess and they are truly missing a great game. If you have ever enjoyed a choose-your-own-adventure book/game then I would highly suggest you buy this game and play it right now. Starting is easy, learning is tough. You'll die in the first 30 minutes of the game unless you're very careful or very lucky. Even dying is entertaining though. Overcoming those events that were a hard roadblock for you feels like a huge accomplishment. I felt as if I had beat the game on a few occasions before I ever reached the end. And when I reached the end, I immediately started over with a plan to pass that event on week 30. It was well worth it.Play this game if you're not afraid of being poisoned, ambushed, overthrown, blasted by magic into dust, or eaten by a giant sea monster. Also, the old forest is not safe. DO NOT GO INTO THE OLD FOREST!			"

												It's better to call this a visual novel with stat checks than a life sim ala Princess Maker, but that aside, the sharp writing and the ever present puzzle of how to piece together a win in your desired path are the real fun of this.I do wish there was more art though.  Only Elodie has more than one facial expression, though since her mood is a key gameplay point, she is fortunately expressive enough to determine her mood at a glance (though the game still tells you her mood).  Everyone else haws the same frozen expression from start to finish.  Also would have liked more inserts during major story events, though the cutesy gorey death screens are a hilarious highlight.  And especially more backgrounds - that same shot of the castle gets old fast.  Aside from that, the art is genuinely good and much higher in quality than a lot of the more tryhard ""otaku"" games.Because Elodie dies.  A lot.  You're basically thrust into a frilly pink Game of Thrones and if you think all you have to do is get married and smile pretty, you're going to eat a poisoned chocolate and croak or get an arrow in the gut or get torn apart by chains or one of the other sudden and brutal deaths.  Keeping a fifteen year old alive for a mere six months is harder than it looks when everyone and everything wants her cute pink curly head on a pike.The overall storyline is very simple, the real highlights are how your choices play out in affecting the plot.  I'm particularly intrigued that in a girly princess game, where you'd expect romance to be played up, it's pretty much forgotten - the entire concept of marriage is played out for pure politics, as it historically would be. Elodie herself is usually marrying with an eye for how to solve a crisis or shore up a political weakness - as opposed to because she needs hot bishonen boyfriend to do everything for her.I'd also add this game is freaking hard.  The only time I won was to become a bloodthirsty magical girl warrior - which had its own issues, but at least I finally saw fair Elodie crowned. Yet I keep playing because I know there are other ways to win, other paths to travel, and even other characters I've yet to meet!			"

I have managed to complete it twice, each time going down different paths.  The addicting thing for me is, I want to see EVERYTHING in the game.  You have to plan at that start what you are going focus on, for your skills.  This adds to the replayability, as I have found some interesting things on each playthrough.  And you will die alot, which I don't find frustrating to start again.  I think it is worth the price, so buy it!  Hopefully they will make a sequel.			"

Replayability is also a strong point of this game even though it's not randomly generated each time you play, there are lots of ways Long Live the Queen can be played and beaten so you will inevitably play this for a long long time! If you like Anime this is probably the game for you, plus it's story is really well made!  Also, this is more of a personal thing probably, but Long Live the Queen is helping me cheer up a bit in a period where i'm always depressed, angry and lonely and i'm smiling a lot more since i started playing this game! Maybe it could have the same effect on someone else with my same problems, who knows =).			"

												If a choose-your-own-adventure style game sounds good to you, and you don't mind getting screwed over because you don't have a skill you had zero reason to take, you could give this a shot. There's a lot of different events to see, paths to go down, etc, but it can be hard to tell how to get at certain events, some of which are determined by pretty arbitrary circumstances. Still, it's a fun setting with some pretty dark undertones (or overtones, depending on how awful you are) and has some replay value as you try to find different ways to not die horribly, and/or unlock the mysteries of the kingdom.If the trailer makes it seem appealing to you, that's exactly what you get.

												With an amusing magical girl exterior, this game is actually a monarchy simulator.  Keeping the princess alive until coronation requires a careful balance of chosing which skills to train in and managing her mood, which affects how easily you learn skills.  Being a military genius is great, but you can still easily fall to assassins or poisons.  Focus on courtly politics, only to die because you failed to properly divine omens, leading you into an ambush.  Certainly not as easy at it initially looks.Definitely worth picking up.			"

												Long Live The Queen works much like a visual novel, which isn't surprising considering the company that makes it. There's a lot of trial and error involved, and you will most likely die a decent number of times before you reach the actual end. However, unlike in most games where that's annoying, it's pretty fascinating to see all the ways you manage to get yourself killed in this game and what all the different decisions you make can do. There's no voice acting for the game, but the music is quite good. The art is well done. The story is always interesting, and you learn more about this world with every play through and with every different decision you make. The game is highly about strategy and trial and error though, and if that turns you off, I really wouldn't recommend this game. But I can easy see putting a decent amount of time in this game just to see the different paths you can take and what different playing styles will do.			"

												This game's a lot of fun, though it does bear some explanation of what, exactly, you're getting into.This is basically a choose-your-own adventure story wherein a young, cutsey-looking anime princess must navigate a brutal, Game of Thrones-esque year of political intrigue and repeated assassination attempts/invasions via building skills and the occasional dialog option.  There are multiple endings, though the vast majority are the ones where she dies in some awful, often unexpected way.  Unless you max out your omen-reading skill.  Then you'll sometimes see 'em coming.Any-hoo, the game's surprisingly mature.  I don't mean there's a lot of nudity or whatever, simply that it handles rather gritty subject matter in a rather circumspect and mature way.  The plot branches about depending on skill choices and the like, so there's a surprising amount of replay value involved.  If you enjoy political intrigue or find the idea of a grim and gritty world conveyed through cutesy anime visuals, you'll probably get a few hours of enjoyment out of this one.Or die trying, I suppose.I give it Several out of A Number That Is Slightly Higher Than Several.  4.73 out of 5.223~, maybe.

												I haven't played tons of VNs, but I've enjoyed the few I have played, and so it's nice to see some leaking into major English markets like Steam. The biggest issues with getting quality VNs put up is that most of them are Eroge (which is to say adult only) games, followed with the issue that the VN genre is rather wide, ranging from literally a book you make minor decisions in, to lots of gameplay coupled with long visual still scenes and text. LLTQ pulls off a nice balace of gameplay and story text, with a fun pace that won't bore you. This makes it a great entry level game of you are new to the VN genre and want to see what it can offer.LLTQ is not very long for the price tag, and the art isn't anything amazing (in fact it comes off as rather generic). However, LLTQ makes up for this with interesting gameplay and plenty of replayability. Half the fun of this game is taking different paths and trying new things to see how it ends up for Princess Elodie, and the game pulls this off with a lot of grace. While not a strict VN, the game doesn't have much action. If you're looking for something akin to Kamidori or Sengoku Rance, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you enjoy VNs in general and like some quirky and strategy based gameplay tossed in, LLTQ should make you a happy camper.			"

												 Combining elements from a life simulation and visual novel, Long Live the Queen makes for an interesting change of pace from the usual action, platforming and rpg games. In spite of the uber-cute exterior, this is a fairly challenging game. You need to keep track of various skills, Elodie's moods (with can have a fairly heavy impact on a skill you're trying to boost), and the various events and characters you encounter. Also, you can expect to have Elodie die more times than South Park's Kenny and Star Trek's Red Shirt guy combined. Overall, LLtQ has a fair amount of replay value as you try for different outcomes and achievements (or to see how may ways poor Elly meets her untimely demise). Only you will determine if Elodie will become the beloved ruler of Nova or a severely depressed,traumatized and stressed out wreck with more emotional issues than Katawa Shoujo's Hanako Ikezawa. As entertaining as the game is, LLtQ does have it's share of flaws. Most notably some parts of the skill check system. Some checks require skills you either will not have early on (Sense Magic for one) or at levels impossible to reach without the debug console. One example is  the weekend event in Week 8 requiring a nearly maxed Sense Magic or skill combinations at 120+ or higher (Lore,Conversation,Presence,Meditation). A slight rebalancing to lower the required levels somewhat and/or having Elodie able to learn Sense Magic without the crystal (natural/ inherited ability) would help here. Another would be having a type of ""Class System"" which would give her more of a background. After all, she attended a boarding school for the children of the nobility and yet has no skills to show for it. Makes you wonder what she was doing there. One way to implement this would be similar to the ""G.O.A.T"" test from Fallout (series of questions to determine her background) or by selecting the type of school she attended / classes she was interested in or excelled at. Choose a Finishing school for Social and Dance Skills), Military (for Weapons,Military and Intrigue), Academic (Intellectual), Athletic (Agility/Athletics) or Artistic (Expression skills) for a small starting bonus (10-20 pts.).Finally, this could use an expanded relationship system rather than just depend on the events in the game. A few Tokimeki Memorial / Sentimental Graffiti style date event and gift/letter exchanges with a chosen love interest (male or female) could add some more depth to the game as well.Overall, in spite of the flaws mentioned, this is an enjoyable game and worth the $8-10 price tag "

The developers are pretty well-known for this exact sort of game, and if anything then they've got the formula down to the dot by now.It's not Democracy 3 level of stats, but couple the stats-oriented gameplay with well-written story that is activelly affected by the stats that your character has, and I'd say that this is one of the competent games in this genre. The price-tag I'm not wholly sure about, I've only played around three hours (on laptop, offline) and don't know how long the game is.To fans of the genre: you know how there are good games like this and bad games like this?

												o_o  fear of chocolate....Elodie, pushing an arrow further into your body will never make things better... Idiot.I would reccomend this to anybody who wants adventure, strategy & suspense all in one.This Game can be a little frustrating, you have no idea what to expect.There are so many possibilities, but it requires strategy.This game had me thinking for ... 2.5 hours. XD (than I died like 10 times ... xD)But I've never gotten bored of finding different ways to survive.			"

												This game is very involved, and as simple as it seems, you could die at any time.CONS:1) It's very easy to fail ""tests"" as you really don't know what you need to study and what you can ignore. And then, by the time you realize what you should be doing, or are pre-empting your inevitable and impending demise, it throws a curve ball and you die, having not had high enough stats.****No voice acting: Not really a con, but I would have loved some voice-action through Elodie, at least. Maybe that's just me. PROS:1) Visually appealing: Very nice art style. Simple, clean, and very polished.2) Interactivity: Highly interactive, without taking itself too seriously.3) Difficulty: It's not easy, and that's great. It doesn't hold your hand, and it makes you take responsibility for your choices, and actions, from start to finish. Elodie's innocence and ignorance are in your hands.4) Replayability: Endless.5) It's got everything: Medieval themes, magic, anime, intrigue, trade, relationships, etc.FINAL THOUGHTS:Do I recommend?What do you think?Hell yes! :DLONG LIVE THE QUEEN!

												This is a fun game wherein you marry 14-year-old girls to old men so they don't kill you. Wait, no: it's a game where you sacrifice bouncy-haired teens to sea monsters so they don't kill the world. Hang on, no: it's a game where happy boarding school BFFs are pressured into war by dominant neighboring political parties and forced to kill each others' family. It's cute and full of anime dressup magical girl nonsense. It presents a fantastic difficulty cliff upon first loading, but the kind where you don't know you killed yourself until twenty minutes later. And when you do manage to stumble over victory, there really isn't a lot of incentive to noodle around with it any more.These are all reasons not to recommend this game. That is not what I am doing, because damn it, I watched Sailor Moon as a kid, and played Princess Maker, and had Barbies, and wanted to grow up to be a fairy supermodel rockstar princess. This kind of make-believe, aged gently so as to avoid being insufferably simple, is embarrassingly welcome.Wonder if I'm too old for princess camp...			"

												Long Live The Queen works much like a visual novel, which isn't surprising considering the company that makes it. There's a lot of trial and error involved, and you will most likely die a decent number of times before you reach the actual end. However, unlike in most games where that's annoying, it's pretty fascinating to see all the ways you manage to get yourself killed in this game and what all the different decisions you make can do. There's no voice acting for the game, but the music is quite good. The art is well done. The story is always interesting, and you learn more about this world with every play through and with every different decision you make. The game is highly about strategy and trial and error though, and if that turns you off, I really wouldn't recommend this game. But I can easy see putting a decent amount of time in this game just to see the different paths you can take and what different playing styles will do.			"

												 Combining elements from a life simulation and visual novel, Long Live the Queen makes for an interesting change of pace from the usual action, platforming and rpg games. In spite of the uber-cute exterior, this is a fairly challenging game. You need to keep track of various skills, Elodie's moods (with can have a fairly heavy impact on a skill you're trying to boost), and the various events and characters you encounter. Also, you can expect to have Elodie die more times than South Park's Kenny and Star Trek's Red Shirt guy combined. Overall, LLtQ has a fair amount of replay value as you try for different outcomes and achievements (or to see how may ways poor Elly meets her untimely demise). Only you will determine if Elodie will become the beloved ruler of Nova or a severely depressed,traumatized and stressed out wreck with more emotional issues than Katawa Shoujo's Hanako Ikezawa. As entertaining as the game is, LLtQ does have it's share of flaws. Most notably some parts of the skill check system. Some checks require skills you either will not have early on (Sense Magic for one) or at levels impossible to reach without the debug console. One example is  the weekend event in Week 8 requiring a nearly maxed Sense Magic or skill combinations at 120+ or higher (Lore,Conversation,Presence,Meditation). A slight rebalancing to lower the required levels somewhat and/or having Elodie able to learn Sense Magic without the crystal (natural/ inherited ability) would help here. Another would be having a type of ""Class System"" which would give her more of a background. After all, she attended a boarding school for the children of the nobility and yet has no skills to show for it. Makes you wonder what she was doing there. One way to implement this would be similar to the ""G.O.A.T"" test from Fallout (series of questions to determine her background) or by selecting the type of school she attended / classes she was interested in or excelled at. Choose a Finishing school for Social and Dance Skills), Military (for Weapons,Military and Intrigue), Academic (Intellectual), Athletic (Agility/Athletics) or Artistic (Expression skills) for a small starting bonus (10-20 pts.).Finally, this could use an expanded relationship system rather than just depend on the events in the game. A few Tokimeki Memorial / Sentimental Graffiti style date event and gift/letter exchanges with a chosen love interest (male or female) could add some more depth to the game as well.Overall, in spite of the flaws mentioned, this is an enjoyable game and worth the $8-10 price tag "

												This game first caught my attention when with its cutesy graphics and native GNU/Linux support when it first appeared on Greenlight. Even so, I wasn't sure if that would be all there was to it. After playing the game for a a bit, I'm happy to say that it isn't.Behind those cutesy graphics is an impressive engine based on the RenPy framework. The gameplay centers around a round-based stats system which is simple to grasp but provides some room for experimentation. This is combined with a well-written branching visual novel with options that vary based on how you build your princess. The interplay of the stats and story makes for an enjoyably addictive experience.I recommend it even if you don't normally enjoy the extremes of the dress-up simulator/spreadsheet game genre spectrum. It's a happy medium that should appeal to a wide audience.			"

												This is by far the most excellent death simulator I have ever played. Not only can you die by your own stupidity, you can be killed in battle, drowned at sea, blown apart with magic, or stabbed! This is only a small list of the many different ways that you will die in this fantastic game!If you'd like to find out what true aggrivation is, then play through this game without saving! I promise you that it will go swimmingly! (And by swimmingly, I do mean you'll drown. Sometimes.)Now I don't wish to ruin anything for you, but I must say this; should you think you'll win this game easily, than I warn you, keep some form of stress releaving device nearby, be that a kitten in a toaster, or perhaps something less grim, like a standard punching bag you may stab with a kitchen knife repeatedly.In all seriousness, this game is fantastic. The story line is very indepth, and every small choice you make makes a larger impact on the overall story. I have yet to beat this game, and doubt that I will anytime soon, and very much enjoy the many hilarious, and sometimes gruesome deaths that I stumble upon. However, the Earl of Lo can suck it, as I hate him with all passion and anger and greed and any other emotion applicable to hatred.			"

												I hoped for a new ""Princess Maker"" but unfortunately ""Long Live The Queen"" is much smaller in scope and length. I guess you could call it a blend between Strategy and RPG, where you pretty much have to memorize important events and be prepared for them - or evade them, in both cases often rather unintuitive. This makes it a case of Trial & Error gameplay, or Guide Dang It.I would call it ""Baby's first Princess Maker"" but actually, the tone is a lot darker. It's more Game of Thrones and less Final Fantasy.Any game where you can sacrifice a girl to appease a tentacle monster deserves a recommendation though.			"

												It's a visual novel based on stats. It is completely scripted with no randomness at all. The game plays out in turns. Each turn you select two 'skills' for the Queen to learn. Then you select an 'activity' for her to do, which will change her 'mood', which will affect which skills she can better learn. The game will then check to see if your skills match a certain threshhold every few turns, which will affect the plot and what happens to the Queen.This is not an erotic themed game.From the description, I thought the game would be humorous. That the plot would involve laughing as the Queen dies in funny ways. Nope, the plot is completely straight. There are funny moments, to be sure, and some of the deaths are pretty stupid. But no, it's a straightforward story.Actually, as weird a comparison it might be, this game's plot actually reminded me of something you might see in a Crusader Kings 2 game. Pretty much all of the focus of the game is on feudal politics, and the most important skill is arguably ""Court Manners."" There is some impressive world building here and I couldn't help but get drawn in. The plot is well written. It's detailed enough to capture your interest, but brief enough you don't get bored. There's enough variance in the plot depending on your results that keep it interesting.My main criticism I think is that the game has a hard scripted event where you have no choice but to fight one guy, and you must have a specific arrangement of skills developed that you won't know about except through trial and error. There is only a set number of turns before he shows up, so your judgment in developing skills and maintaining your mood is critical. I still haven't been able to pass it despite hours of play. (It would be very simple to use a walkthrough and win, but if you did that the game would have no challenge and little replay value.)Do I recommend Long Live The Queen? It's pretty excellent as far as these types of games go. I'd call it superior to Heileen 3.  If you're into these types of games, go ahead.			"

												The princess stands before the invading army, a terrified lump within her throat. Weeks ago she had seen the omens, seeing the telling signs of an oncoming invasion. She had studied as hard as she could, learning as much as possible about naval warfare, hiring as many troops, and speeding up her studies into the realm of magic as fast as she could. However, her management of the treasury wasn't up to snuff and she could neither hire the troops or build anywhere near enough ships and her allies did not come to her aid when she needed them. Despite leading the defending fleet herself and sinking several ships with her potent magical power, her fleet was routed and her armies broken. Now the enemy commander stands before her, sword at the ready to cut her head off and claim her lands for his own. She is on a razors edge. Her magic can't save her kingdom and she is no swordswoman.She keeps her calm though. She has already been close to death several times in a few short months, her composure is perfect and, despite being outnumbered and invaded, she commands the room. Her knowledge of the invaders is great. They love their families and their leader has been pushed into this invasion by his demanding wife. She asks one final request, to sing a song. She picks her song carefully, the song her late mother, whose grave she has frequently visited, sang to her to comfort her, a song to pluck at the heartstrings of her foe. Her vocal training allows her to deliver it perfectly as a hushed silence falls over the room. There is only one victor here. The war is over and the princess's foe is utterly broken. She has escaped death once more by a razors edge and survived one more week closer to her fast-approaching coronation.This was the crowning moment of both awesome and heartwarming in my first successful attempt at Long Live the Queen, and I wish to say that, in my eyes, it speaks to itself as to just how great this title is. I can think of no better example, no better words to tell you if this game is for you or not than those right there. However, I'm sure more people are interested in what lead to such a moment and other factors, so I shall continue on.Long Live the Queen is a delightful little title in which you play as the young princess Elodie whose mother, the Queen, has recently died. Things are not all prime and cushy for the young princess however. Despite being only 14 years old, her mere existence places her as a threat to the power of multiple lords and nations, and they will not hesitate to kill her given the chance. Her life hangs by a razors edge and one wrong move could easily result in her being buried beside her mother before the title of Queen can be bestowed to her. She is determined to survive however. Can the young princess overcome the swarms of political and magical plots upon her life? Or will she be overwhelmed?Long Live the Queen is easily one of the best written visual novel games I have played in a long time and it captures the delicacy and intricacies of just how politics unfolds a lot better than most other games, some of which outright rely on politics, I have played. Many different things can happen and careful balance and attention is required for success with failure having immense, possibly lethal, consequences. The Princess Elodie is one of the most likable characters I have seen in a long time. Young and a bit naive about the world, but capable of immense internal strength and insight.Recommended Price: $10.00. It's short, which is a problem, but the difficulty and varied paths will more than make up for it. Honestly, I can see a bit of a divided base as some people will feel this too close to a Japanese dating sim or too difficult, but to those who can stick it out, it can easily be both fun enough and have enough replay value to hold its own.Final Verdict: A 8/10! I would totally rate this visual novel game much higher if it was a bit longer or more fleshed out. I will acknowledge that the difficulty and time is an easy turn-off for some people.			"

												Long live the queen appears to be a very childish, and little girly, understandably. Though this is only on the surface. Long Live The Queen has you taking the role of a crown princess weeks away from her coronation. As weeks go on, you take classes to make you better in certain skills, eg. Swords, Elegance, Strategy, Trade etc. All of this needs to be carefully planned out. As not having proficiency can screw you over in some sense. Every decision you make on this game can come back to bite you in some way, and even kill you if you are unprepared. Only coming in with a short 4 hoursish of gameplay on the first completion, with possibility for reruns the 6 pound price tag still ends up being worth it.           Long Live The Queen - a suprisingly enjoyable and interesting game offering a quality experience. I can only hope for a sequel. If indirectly managing a kingdom is your sort of thing, then Long Live the Queen is a solid pick for you.                                                                                                 Rating- 7.5 Out of 10                                                                                                       Very Good			"

												It's basically Game of Thrones, the DnD skillcheck game. You choose things to learn about, and skill up in them. Enough skill, you can pass the skill checks that pop up every single day.Get shot at with a bow? Reflex check to dogde. Failed? Archery check to have knowledge how to pull it out safely. Still failed? You're dead, game over.These skill checks drastically change the nature of the plot.Did you go full on crazy military commander princess?  Well, when all the other nations try to kill you through military might, you will prevail.Or maybe went fully diplomatic. Marry yourself off to a stronger kingdoms leader, and then have him assassinated in his sleep, inheriting all his lands and titles.Be prepared to die horribly alot, though.			"

												This. ♥♥♥♥ing. game. It's about as much of a loli princess simulator as Reccetear is a loli cute cute item shop simulator. You soon learn that everyone in the realm is out to kill you and to trust no one, as you navigate the politics both domestic and international, all while trying to mantain your legitimacy as ruler. The only part of this game that could even be related to Princess Maker is that you're sending yourself to class. That's it.			"

												Great game!   However, if you were like me and wanted to play to see the romance, you're gonna be let-down. There is close calls, and forced (not arranged) marriges. Most are for titles and money. Also, so far I've only found there to be 1 happy ending out of the many depressing ones. Strangly, there hasn't been much talk about how her father puts everything on her, and tells her to take care of it, while he sits on throne after a few week into the game. The game can cause frusteration, since there are many impossible things to achieve.  Now for the good sides. It's not perverted in the slightest. The music, gameplay, abilities, are all spectacular. There are many routes and possiblites. It's girly on the outside, but if you ignore the child-like art and pink, it's a pretty gruesome game. It can be gory in words more than image. If you're planning on becoming queen one day, this is the game for you. You really have to think about your next more for it to all sync together.     I really did love this game...until I threw my computer out the window.			"

												Okay, you may be thinking that this game is girly, childish or whatever in the negative sense. However, the truth is that Long Live The Queen offers an incredibly fresh gaming experience. Part visual novel, part choose your own adventure, part rpg and part tamgotchi, though the sum is greater than the parts.You guide princess Elody from the time her mother's death forces her to leave boarding school up to the moment she's crowned. If you get there that is. In spite of the cheerful graphics and beautiful music this game has a brutal difficulty. You make the wrong choice? -> you die, you haven't got several skills up to snuff? -> one dead princess, you kill off a troublesome noble? -> her son runs Elody through.Every choice you make has consequences and the sheer gigantic amount of things that could (and probably will) go wrong is staggering. Yet as daunting as it makes the task, it's damn fun to try it. Additional fun comes in the form of the death scenes which (though presented in a cute way) are reminiscent of those found in Shadowgate.So, what are you still reading for? Get the game!			"

												Long Live The Queen works much like a visual novel, which isn't surprising considering the company that makes it. There's a lot of trial and error involved, and you will most likely die a decent number of times before you reach the actual end. However, unlike in most games where that's annoying, it's pretty fascinating to see all the ways you manage to get yourself killed in this game and what all the different decisions you make can do. There's no voice acting for the game, but the music is quite good. The art is well done. The story is always interesting, and you learn more about this world with every play through and with every different decision you make. The game is highly about strategy and trial and error though, and if that turns you off, I really wouldn't recommend this game. But I can easy see putting a decent amount of time in this game just to see the different paths you can take and what different playing styles will do.			"

Replayability is also a strong point of this game even though it's not randomly generated each time you play, there are lots of ways Long Live the Queen can be played and beaten so you will inevitably play this for a long long time! If you like Anime this is probably the game for you, plus it's story is really well made!  Also, this is more of a personal thing probably, but Long Live the Queen is helping me cheer up a bit in a period where i'm always depressed, angry and lonely and i'm smiling a lot more since i started playing this game! Maybe it could have the same effect on someone else with my same problems, who knows =).			"

												If a choose-your-own-adventure style game sounds good to you, and you don't mind getting screwed over because you don't have a skill you had zero reason to take, you could give this a shot. There's a lot of different events to see, paths to go down, etc, but it can be hard to tell how to get at certain events, some of which are determined by pretty arbitrary circumstances. Still, it's a fun setting with some pretty dark undertones (or overtones, depending on how awful you are) and has some replay value as you try to find different ways to not die horribly, and/or unlock the mysteries of the kingdom.If the trailer makes it seem appealing to you, that's exactly what you get.

												 Combining elements from a life simulation and visual novel, Long Live the Queen makes for an interesting change of pace from the usual action, platforming and rpg games. In spite of the uber-cute exterior, this is a fairly challenging game. You need to keep track of various skills, Elodie's moods (with can have a fairly heavy impact on a skill you're trying to boost), and the various events and characters you encounter. Also, you can expect to have Elodie die more times than South Park's Kenny and Star Trek's Red Shirt guy combined. Overall, LLtQ has a fair amount of replay value as you try for different outcomes and achievements (or to see how may ways poor Elly meets her untimely demise). Only you will determine if Elodie will become the beloved ruler of Nova or a severely depressed,traumatized and stressed out wreck with more emotional issues than Katawa Shoujo's Hanako Ikezawa. As entertaining as the game is, LLtQ does have it's share of flaws. Most notably some parts of the skill check system. Some checks require skills you either will not have early on (Sense Magic for one) or at levels impossible to reach without the debug console. One example is  the weekend event in Week 8 requiring a nearly maxed Sense Magic or skill combinations at 120+ or higher (Lore,Conversation,Presence,Meditation). A slight rebalancing to lower the required levels somewhat and/or having Elodie able to learn Sense Magic without the crystal (natural/ inherited ability) would help here. Another would be having a type of ""Class System"" which would give her more of a background. After all, she attended a boarding school for the children of the nobility and yet has no skills to show for it. Makes you wonder what she was doing there. One way to implement this would be similar to the ""G.O.A.T"" test from Fallout (series of questions to determine her background) or by selecting the type of school she attended / classes she was interested in or excelled at. Choose a Finishing school for Social and Dance Skills), Military (for Weapons,Military and Intrigue), Academic (Intellectual), Athletic (Agility/Athletics) or Artistic (Expression skills) for a small starting bonus (10-20 pts.).Finally, this could use an expanded relationship system rather than just depend on the events in the game. A few Tokimeki Memorial / Sentimental Graffiti style date event and gift/letter exchanges with a chosen love interest (male or female) could add some more depth to the game as well.Overall, in spite of the flaws mentioned, this is an enjoyable game and worth the $8-10 price tag "

												This is a fun game wherein you marry 14-year-old girls to old men so they don't kill you. Wait, no: it's a game where you sacrifice bouncy-haired teens to sea monsters so they don't kill the world. Hang on, no: it's a game where happy boarding school BFFs are pressured into war by dominant neighboring political parties and forced to kill each others' family. It's cute and full of anime dressup magical girl nonsense. It presents a fantastic difficulty cliff upon first loading, but the kind where you don't know you killed yourself until twenty minutes later. And when you do manage to stumble over victory, there really isn't a lot of incentive to noodle around with it any more.These are all reasons not to recommend this game. That is not what I am doing, because damn it, I watched Sailor Moon as a kid, and played Princess Maker, and had Barbies, and wanted to grow up to be a fairy supermodel rockstar princess. This kind of make-believe, aged gently so as to avoid being insufferably simple, is embarrassingly welcome.Wonder if I'm too old for princess camp...			"

												Long Live the Queen was not quite the game I expected, in spite of the fact that it's everything it promised to be on the cover. In this royalty simulator, you control Elodie, a precocious little pink-haired 14-year-old princess who, upon her mother's death, has been thrust into the role of matriarch. Establishing this game firmly in the G.R.R. Martin school of political thought, your goal is not so much to save the world from evil or to rule as a beloved queen should, but to survive long enough to reach your coronation.Your country is weak, your neighbors ambitious, and your education incredibly limited; spend your time training up the many, many skills you'll need to be an effective leader, juggling pressing needs for the kingdom with personal desires to help you get what you want. Meanwhile, the constant flood of events around you will send your emotions scattering all over, and since it's hard to study Military Strategy when you're terrified or Court Manners when you're feeling defiant, you must manage your personal time to keep you in the right state of mind. On top of all that, you'll be asked time and again to commit money or military strength to a number of causes; until you've trained up the proper understanding of economics and military theory, you won't even be aware these resources exist, let alone that they're something you should be mindful of. Screw up along the way and you're dead - assassins, poisoned gifts, bandits, monsters... There are plenty of horrible things out to get you. And they will. Repeatedly. It's a surprisingly anxiety-ridden pile of disasters to manage, and while I adore it, your mileage may vary.On top of that, there's also a decent story set behind everything, though your point of view limits what you can see. The cast of characters is overwhelming at first, but you quickly start to remember which ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s backstabbed you and which actually seem to be decent enough human beings. There are plenty of story paths to follow, plenty of branches that reveal details otherwise hidden, and plenty of endings to grab. Are you a meek and pretty trophy wife? A blood-stained military empress? A strange and terrifying witch-queen? Bear the demands of the throne, squeeze what you want out of the spare time you are given, and you can forge whatever destiny you so choose.			"

												To be frank with you all, I expectd to have finished this game within an hour or so of owning it. But now, after at least six hours of strategizing and four deaths under my belt, I know I was sorely mistaken. Long Live the Queen is more than your normal cutesy-wootsy Shoujo visual novel, it's actually a quite challenging Simulation RPG based on ""leveling"" up the skills needed to put Elodie, our much beloved Queen-to-be, on the throne. You will face challenges such as civil war, uprisings against the crown, foreign attacks, assasination attempts, and the making of crucial decisions that could mean life, death, or even disastor for the whole kingdom. Please, I implore you, do not take this game by face value alone, all the pink and frills cover up a fierce strategy game that had all but left me in stressful self-loathing at my own Christmas purchase.TD;LR: Girly outside, hardcore strategy inside. 9/10 would definitely recommend.

												This game first caught my attention when with its cutesy graphics and native GNU/Linux support when it first appeared on Greenlight. Even so, I wasn't sure if that would be all there was to it. After playing the game for a a bit, I'm happy to say that it isn't.Behind those cutesy graphics is an impressive engine based on the RenPy framework. The gameplay centers around a round-based stats system which is simple to grasp but provides some room for experimentation. This is combined with a well-written branching visual novel with options that vary based on how you build your princess. The interplay of the stats and story makes for an enjoyably addictive experience.I recommend it even if you don't normally enjoy the extremes of the dress-up simulator/spreadsheet game genre spectrum. It's a happy medium that should appeal to a wide audience.			"

												This is by far the most excellent death simulator I have ever played. Not only can you die by your own stupidity, you can be killed in battle, drowned at sea, blown apart with magic, or stabbed! This is only a small list of the many different ways that you will die in this fantastic game!If you'd like to find out what true aggrivation is, then play through this game without saving! I promise you that it will go swimmingly! (And by swimmingly, I do mean you'll drown. Sometimes.)Now I don't wish to ruin anything for you, but I must say this; should you think you'll win this game easily, than I warn you, keep some form of stress releaving device nearby, be that a kitten in a toaster, or perhaps something less grim, like a standard punching bag you may stab with a kitchen knife repeatedly.In all seriousness, this game is fantastic. The story line is very indepth, and every small choice you make makes a larger impact on the overall story. I have yet to beat this game, and doubt that I will anytime soon, and very much enjoy the many hilarious, and sometimes gruesome deaths that I stumble upon. However, the Earl of Lo can suck it, as I hate him with all passion and anger and greed and any other emotion applicable to hatred.			"

												I hoped for a new ""Princess Maker"" but unfortunately ""Long Live The Queen"" is much smaller in scope and length. I guess you could call it a blend between Strategy and RPG, where you pretty much have to memorize important events and be prepared for them - or evade them, in both cases often rather unintuitive. This makes it a case of Trial & Error gameplay, or Guide Dang It.I would call it ""Baby's first Princess Maker"" but actually, the tone is a lot darker. It's more Game of Thrones and less Final Fantasy.Any game where you can sacrifice a girl to appease a tentacle monster deserves a recommendation though.			"

												On the surface, Long Live The Queen looks like a sickeningly-pink girly Princess dress-up simulation game you'd expect to be shipped out under a Barbie logo, but what waits for you inside this deceptively-dressed strategic simulation game is a plot filled with deception, magic, warfare, and political intrigue like you might except from a Game of Thrones themed sim. I definitely recommend this to any fans of visual novels or simulation games in general.			"

												Great game, all diagloue based. The game itself isn't very long but you will likely die the first time and it is well worth playing multiple times as each time you can make different choices and start to figure out more of the overall story. It is definitely not possible to figure out everything in one playthrough. Even with multiple playthroughs it doesn't take long. The game really follows the choices you make.			"

												I had a lot of fun playing this game. It took me several goes before i managed to get Elodie to her coronation - but thats all part of the fun!Each time Elodie died, i was eager to start over, knowing what decisions i would change to keep her alive, and it was interesting to see how certain parts of the story changed depending on what i did choose. It took a good while to work out which emotions (mood) affected which skills, it wasn't made clear and it was trial and error. It proved quite frustrating nearer the end of the game as i needed an exact amount in certain skills, and it took a few 'load games' and outfit changes before i finally found the right combination to get those skill points i needed.Some skills seem to be completely useless, but i think thats a big part of the game, figuring out which skills you need, which skills you don't, and which skills are going to keep Elodie alive!I would recommend!

												It's a visual novel based on stats. It is completely scripted with no randomness at all. The game plays out in turns. Each turn you select two 'skills' for the Queen to learn. Then you select an 'activity' for her to do, which will change her 'mood', which will affect which skills she can better learn. The game will then check to see if your skills match a certain threshhold every few turns, which will affect the plot and what happens to the Queen.This is not an erotic themed game.From the description, I thought the game would be humorous. That the plot would involve laughing as the Queen dies in funny ways. Nope, the plot is completely straight. There are funny moments, to be sure, and some of the deaths are pretty stupid. But no, it's a straightforward story.Actually, as weird a comparison it might be, this game's plot actually reminded me of something you might see in a Crusader Kings 2 game. Pretty much all of the focus of the game is on feudal politics, and the most important skill is arguably ""Court Manners."" There is some impressive world building here and I couldn't help but get drawn in. The plot is well written. It's detailed enough to capture your interest, but brief enough you don't get bored. There's enough variance in the plot depending on your results that keep it interesting.My main criticism I think is that the game has a hard scripted event where you have no choice but to fight one guy, and you must have a specific arrangement of skills developed that you won't know about except through trial and error. There is only a set number of turns before he shows up, so your judgment in developing skills and maintaining your mood is critical. I still haven't been able to pass it despite hours of play. (It would be very simple to use a walkthrough and win, but if you did that the game would have no challenge and little replay value.)Do I recommend Long Live The Queen? It's pretty excellent as far as these types of games go. I'd call it superior to Heileen 3.  If you're into these types of games, go ahead.			"

												The princess stands before the invading army, a terrified lump within her throat. Weeks ago she had seen the omens, seeing the telling signs of an oncoming invasion. She had studied as hard as she could, learning as much as possible about naval warfare, hiring as many troops, and speeding up her studies into the realm of magic as fast as she could. However, her management of the treasury wasn't up to snuff and she could neither hire the troops or build anywhere near enough ships and her allies did not come to her aid when she needed them. Despite leading the defending fleet herself and sinking several ships with her potent magical power, her fleet was routed and her armies broken. Now the enemy commander stands before her, sword at the ready to cut her head off and claim her lands for his own. She is on a razors edge. Her magic can't save her kingdom and she is no swordswoman.She keeps her calm though. She has already been close to death several times in a few short months, her composure is perfect and, despite being outnumbered and invaded, she commands the room. Her knowledge of the invaders is great. They love their families and their leader has been pushed into this invasion by his demanding wife. She asks one final request, to sing a song. She picks her song carefully, the song her late mother, whose grave she has frequently visited, sang to her to comfort her, a song to pluck at the heartstrings of her foe. Her vocal training allows her to deliver it perfectly as a hushed silence falls over the room. There is only one victor here. The war is over and the princess's foe is utterly broken. She has escaped death once more by a razors edge and survived one more week closer to her fast-approaching coronation.This was the crowning moment of both awesome and heartwarming in my first successful attempt at Long Live the Queen, and I wish to say that, in my eyes, it speaks to itself as to just how great this title is. I can think of no better example, no better words to tell you if this game is for you or not than those right there. However, I'm sure more people are interested in what lead to such a moment and other factors, so I shall continue on.Long Live the Queen is a delightful little title in which you play as the young princess Elodie whose mother, the Queen, has recently died. Things are not all prime and cushy for the young princess however. Despite being only 14 years old, her mere existence places her as a threat to the power of multiple lords and nations, and they will not hesitate to kill her given the chance. Her life hangs by a razors edge and one wrong move could easily result in her being buried beside her mother before the title of Queen can be bestowed to her. She is determined to survive however. Can the young princess overcome the swarms of political and magical plots upon her life? Or will she be overwhelmed?Long Live the Queen is easily one of the best written visual novel games I have played in a long time and it captures the delicacy and intricacies of just how politics unfolds a lot better than most other games, some of which outright rely on politics, I have played. Many different things can happen and careful balance and attention is required for success with failure having immense, possibly lethal, consequences. The Princess Elodie is one of the most likable characters I have seen in a long time. Young and a bit naive about the world, but capable of immense internal strength and insight.Recommended Price: $10.00. It's short, which is a problem, but the difficulty and varied paths will more than make up for it. Honestly, I can see a bit of a divided base as some people will feel this too close to a Japanese dating sim or too difficult, but to those who can stick it out, it can easily be both fun enough and have enough replay value to hold its own.Final Verdict: A 8/10! I would totally rate this visual novel game much higher if it was a bit longer or more fleshed out. I will acknowledge that the difficulty and time is an easy turn-off for some people.			"

												Long live the queen appears to be a very childish, and little girly, understandably. Though this is only on the surface. Long Live The Queen has you taking the role of a crown princess weeks away from her coronation. As weeks go on, you take classes to make you better in certain skills, eg. Swords, Elegance, Strategy, Trade etc. All of this needs to be carefully planned out. As not having proficiency can screw you over in some sense. Every decision you make on this game can come back to bite you in some way, and even kill you if you are unprepared. Only coming in with a short 4 hoursish of gameplay on the first completion, with possibility for reruns the 6 pound price tag still ends up being worth it.           Long Live The Queen - a suprisingly enjoyable and interesting game offering a quality experience. I can only hope for a sequel. If indirectly managing a kingdom is your sort of thing, then Long Live the Queen is a solid pick for you.                                                                                                 Rating- 7.5 Out of 10                                                                                                       Very Good			"

												It's basically Game of Thrones, the DnD skillcheck game. You choose things to learn about, and skill up in them. Enough skill, you can pass the skill checks that pop up every single day.Get shot at with a bow? Reflex check to dogde. Failed? Archery check to have knowledge how to pull it out safely. Still failed? You're dead, game over.These skill checks drastically change the nature of the plot.Did you go full on crazy military commander princess?  Well, when all the other nations try to kill you through military might, you will prevail.Or maybe went fully diplomatic. Marry yourself off to a stronger kingdoms leader, and then have him assassinated in his sleep, inheriting all his lands and titles.Be prepared to die horribly alot, though.			"

												It's better to call this a visual novel with stat checks than a life sim ala Princess Maker, but that aside, the sharp writing and the ever present puzzle of how to piece together a win in your desired path are the real fun of this.I do wish there was more art though.  Only Elodie has more than one facial expression, though since her mood is a key gameplay point, she is fortunately expressive enough to determine her mood at a glance (though the game still tells you her mood).  Everyone else haws the same frozen expression from start to finish.  Also would have liked more inserts during major story events, though the cutesy gorey death screens are a hilarious highlight.  And especially more backgrounds - that same shot of the castle gets old fast.  Aside from that, the art is genuinely good and much higher in quality than a lot of the more tryhard ""otaku"" games.Because Elodie dies.  A lot.  You're basically thrust into a frilly pink Game of Thrones and if you think all you have to do is get married and smile pretty, you're going to eat a poisoned chocolate and croak or get an arrow in the gut or get torn apart by chains or one of the other sudden and brutal deaths.  Keeping a fifteen year old alive for a mere six months is harder than it looks when everyone and everything wants her cute pink curly head on a pike.The overall storyline is very simple, the real highlights are how your choices play out in affecting the plot.  I'm particularly intrigued that in a girly princess game, where you'd expect romance to be played up, it's pretty much forgotten - the entire concept of marriage is played out for pure politics, as it historically would be. Elodie herself is usually marrying with an eye for how to solve a crisis or shore up a political weakness - as opposed to because she needs hot bishonen boyfriend to do everything for her.I'd also add this game is freaking hard.  The only time I won was to become a bloodthirsty magical girl warrior - which had its own issues, but at least I finally saw fair Elodie crowned. Yet I keep playing because I know there are other ways to win, other paths to travel, and even other characters I've yet to meet!			"

You have to plan at that start what you are going focus on, for your skills.  This adds to the replayability, as I have found some interesting things on each playthrough.

												Long Live the Queen manages to resurrect the old and partially dead genre of Life Simulation/Life Management that only still lives on in the Persona series, and ""graphic novels"" (read as H games, because let's face it, that's all they are.) and makes it relevant again, if only slightly.Taking queues from Atlus' old Princess Maker Series from back on the Sega Saturn, Long Live the Queen manages to cut some of the old tedium the Princess Maker series had, and sheds it in favor of streamlined (albeit short) gameplay. Humorous situations are also abundant in this game, along with the innuendo here and there (what do you expect, you're the little girl).Though the soundtrack may be repetitive and grating to some, it fits the mood when the need arises and the setting is VERY European/Western, as far as the high fantasy setting goes. Character design is Animu out the wazoo, but it gets the job done while leaving opportunities for very fun still images of your princess and her various emotions.At its core, the game is really a stat management game, but the various branching paths make for a game that has much replay value, if only to see how many different ways you can die, or how far you can get. I've found myself replaying it just to see how events unfold differently with many surprises along the way. One adventure, I'm being ambushed on my way to a birthday party and died from an arrow, and another seperate playthrough I found myself having supreme military might, only to be invaded by a foreign country who decimated my forces with magic (which I was not trained in). You really never know what's going to happen outside of the first few scripted events.All in all, Long Live the Queen is a very solid game and a much recommended buy if you're in the mood to play something that will make you laugh, or make you shout ""no"" at the top of your lungs because you were stabbed by an assassin.

												I bought and played Long Live the Queen before it was released on Steam, but decided to pick it up again for the extra content.The first and most obvious comparison most make is to Princess Maker, and I think an apt way to describe this game is Princess Maker meets Game of Thrones. However, beyond the art and the stat raising, Long Live the Queen and Princess Maker 2 don't really have that much in common. Both involve some level of strategy, but Long Live the Queen eschews the more exploratory bits for a more visual novel style. This is a game about courtly intrigue and trying to survive, and you will probably die multiple times before finally reaching your coronation day. I've heard complaints that there's little replay value, and while the game is short, it's impossible to get all the skill checks in one go, and getting certain skill checks can open up whole storylines or reveal bits of the plot that you wouldn't see if you hadn't chosen to raise that stat. If you're the type of person who needs to get everything ""perfect"" in one go, you will probably hate this game.  "

Sounds about right.Reminded me a little of Princess Maker 2, except it doesn't take as long and is actually fun throughout. And, unlike PM2, I did not feel empty, unpleasant and generally dead inside when I was compelled to start a new game after not getting an ending I wanted. So there's that, too.  "

												A game where, maybe, dying is the funny part.  You can choose how handle the live of your princess, i mean,  in one hand you can be a powerful sorcerer or a skillful diplomatic. It is useful? I dunno. Doesn't care which path you choose cause the game is who chooses if you're doing right. And don't be afraid of the death, your pink haired girl will be as cute as ever. So, use your powerful mind to choose the right way. Magic, diplomacy, being an object woman... (what? You can do it. It's pretty sad but you can.).

												Pros:1. If you take art into consideration, this game has very cute and colorful characters, albeit its backgrounds are reused constantly.2. It's a lot of fun gathering up all the achievements. There's definitely enough to keep you busy and get your money's worth out of the game.3. There's separate endings, all of which are effected by even small choices during gameplay.Cons:1. This game takes a little while to beat. You might want to save each turn, or be prepared to start from the beginning.2. While the many skills the protagonist can have are interesting and fun, it could be frustrating for some trying to pass all of the ""tests"" each skill has. Whether or not you can feasibly beat all the tests, I don't know.3. It can be frustrating at times to encounter an event that you need to complete to beat the game, yet you haven't gathered the required skills.Overall it's a nice game, worth playing more than once. However, I wouldn't shell out too much money on it. "

												I had a lot of fun playing this game. It took me several goes before i managed to get Elodie to her coronation - but thats all part of the fun!Each time Elodie died, i was eager to start over, knowing what decisions i would change to keep her alive, and it was interesting to see how certain parts of the story changed depending on what i did choose. It took a good while to work out which emotions (mood) affected which skills, it wasn't made clear and it was trial and error. It proved quite frustrating nearer the end of the game as i needed an exact amount in certain skills, and it took a few 'load games' and outfit changes before i finally found the right combination to get those skill points i needed.Some skills seem to be completely useless, but i think thats a big part of the game, figuring out which skills you need, which skills you don't, and which skills are going to keep Elodie alive!I would recommend!

												Not for everyone but if you are a ""video games hipster"" (their words not mine) like me then you will find this very amusing. It is essentially a remake of an old game called Princess Maker. A wierd blend of management sim and interactive story. You are effectively ""managing"" a princess to become the best ruler of the realm she will inherit. It is well designed for multiple playthroughs with various narrative paths to follow and secrets to uncover, with a bit of a roguelike approach to difficulty. The price may be a little high for some, especially if you are not sure if this is your cup of tea. If so, I highly recomment picking it up when it is on offer. If you are hankering for something completely different from the mainstream AAA selection, this could be the refreshing change of pace you have been looking for.			"

I shall simply state that the game is fun, the art or the style might put you off, but you should try it anyway.At first you'll probably die. And then on the next playthrough whilst trying to not die to thing that originally killed you, you'll probably die to something else that didn't matter before or was totally unnoticed the first time because you did something different. Then once you've got to grips with how things work, you'll start looking for those markers that tell you ""Hey look. A side route"" or ""Hey look, something new"" or as I did ""Hey look. A different way to get killed."" To date, I haven't found everything, but I intend to keep looking.Play the game, you will enjoy it. (or you won't, but at least you'll know for sure)			"

Skills in PM would decide the life your daughter led and what path she chose when she left the nest. Skills here decide whether you can make it to the next branch or not.It's a solid game, but you're definitely going to have to keep plenty of saves handy and a notepad, digital or otherwise, nearby.And yes, you CAN finish the game without magic... but you have to never give yourself the option of magic in the first place.

												Long Live The Queen (LLTQ) is a game I stumbled upon by complete accident. Let me tell you, that was one of the happiest accidents of my life.LLTQ is an anime-esque visual novel-esque...thing developed by UK based Hanako Games, and it's quite something. LLTQ is a game where you die. And die. And die again. And then you die some more. Yet, dying is part of the fun. For example: someone wrote a silly letter to you about you doing *something* with a squid. Oh, no! A gust of wind picked it up and it's now hanging just off the balcony. Do you climb out to try to grab it?>YesNoYou do? Well then, while climbing, you slip, fall, and break your neck on the ground. Your room is on the top floor of the castle, after all. Why would you try to climb from so high up? Idiot.Except maybe if you picked yes and you actually trained beforehand to be a really good climber, you didn't fall and survived. See, that's what this game is about. Each week, you pick skills to take classes in. And, every so often, you're tested in certain skills depending on what situation arises in your kingdom which could mean life or death for you. And it's oh-so-fun. True, it's very trial-and-error, but with a game like this, with muliptle paths to victory (and many more to gruesome and painful death), that's just part of the experience.This game is recommended for anyone who wants to become a pretty pink magical girl. ...I mean Lumen. (Same thing.) (Hey, it's a thing to do.)			"

												WARNINGThis game is ADDICTING. When I started playing LLTQ I thought it would get old after the first game. But God do you get annoyed after that first death and are CONVINCED you can beat it if you just play one more time. 25 times later and Elodie still isn't the queen and you're still banging your head wondering what choice you made that went wrong. The best part of the game is that every time you play, it's just as unique (assuming you make new choices and study new things). There are a few monotonies, such as the characters. Overall 9/10, would recommend.			"

												Princess Elodie recently lost her mother. In 40 weeks, she'll be crowned Queen of Nova, that is, if she survives. This is, basically, a choose your own adventure where you get to stat out Elodie in the hopes of dealing with the scenarios that come up. It's a fun game of character management and intrigue. It isn't possible to get everything out of the setting in just one sitting. Luckily, Elodie dies a lot.			"

												This game is like my new addiction.  I asked some friends who owned the game what it was about, and they all recommended it.  Therefore, I tried it out.  During my first play-through, I was a little disappointed.....but then I got addicted after dying the first time.  Your first few play-throughs will be dedicated to beating the game (which you will most likely not do your first few play times).  After you beat the game, then comes the real challenge: finding all the deaths and achievements.  Yes, this is a game where the ending is boring, and the stuff in-between is what you want.This game is both entertaining and frustrating.  Every choice you make influences the gameplay, and I'm amazed by how many possibilities there are.  I know I still haven't found them all.  As you play more of the game, you learn what choices can help or hurt you, but it's the things you never think of that may get you achievements.  Some of the achievements are super easy, but others are super hard to achieve.  You can have the princess all set-up to do well on one scenario, but find out later that a choice you made earlier in the game caused you to completely skip that scenario.  It keeps the game interesting, and it will get you hooked.What are the downsides to this game?  Well, it can get very, very repetitive.  You can skip certain dialogues, but that only speeds things up a little.  When you are trying to get to a scenario in week 35, it takes forever to get to that point because you have to play through each week.  Yes, you can save right before that scenario and go back to it in case something goes wrong, but you want to make sure you have the correct classes and mood.  That can take a while to build-up when you start at the beginning of the game.  The save files help sometimes, but you may end up with so many saved games that you forget what is what even if you name them.  There are sooo many pieces to the game that need to be right that it's not really worth saving a game all the time.Is it worth the $10?  To me, I think it's worth a little less.  I really wanted this game, so I waited until it was on sale half off.  It was worth that price, but I do think the full price is a little much.  If they expanded on the game, it may be.  It's one of those games that's fun to play at first, but once you figure everything out, the game will lose most of the fun aspect.  However, I can guarantee it will take a ton of gameplay to earn all acheivements if you aren't cheating.  35 hours of gameplay later, and I still have 1 death, 2 epilogues, and 4 acheivements to find.

												This is a pretty short VN/stat management type game with a lot of replayability. Your job is to knock a whiny little loli girl into shape so that she can face the rigours of being the Queen of some magical fantasy country. As the story goes on, people will try to poison and stab you and so you have to train your little ♥♥♥♥♥ to handle the situation. Like if you don't train your girl in manners and composure or whatever, she'll get sent poison chocolates and IMMEDIATELY EAT THEM, which is maybe not great. There's a bit of trial and error involved. I mean, you would never really think the 'Decoration' skill would be useful but it ends up being of potentially critical importance in a magic duel. But both reloading and restarting are fast enough that no sudden deaths are particularly bothersome.Eventually, I made my girl into a ninja magic lady, who defeated the evil wizard and went on to found the FIGHT SCHOOL. I'll probably play it a few more times to see what else might happen.			"

												There is  variety of ways you can train her and, therefore, change the events that happen and keep her alive (...or not). Like most games like this one, you can expect to die...a lot. It's a strategy alright, so you need to use trial-and-error, but it's very worth it. There wasn't a moment I wasn't entertained in this game. You have total control with the right knowledge; it certainly provides a challenge, even to experienced players.			"

												Six hours of gameplay on record and just once, for one glorious minute, did I manage to bask in the glory of being Queen. Long Live The Queen is a supremely addicting simulation game where all you want to do is, well, live and eventually become Queen. Sounds simple but when you have literally everytihng and everyone coming after your head (and throne), you realize that something as simple as skipping a weeks worth of music class means you're probably going to forget your nations anthem from 200 years ago and end up being assasinated by the Ninja Historians for Musical Integrity faction in a few weeks. Don't worry - you can save often and restart from the week when you ditched that class and correct your error. But now that you're taking music class and foregoing agility lessons means that you're totally ♥♥♥♥ed when that crazy knight comes charging at you with a knife in the Great Hall and manages to completely decapitate you. This game is a beautifully executed (pun intended) manifestation of futility personified. I say that in the most positive, BUY-THIS-GAME way possible. 5/5.			"

												Alright in this game it is a wonderful play of what you want, what you do, and what actions. How it should be. A lot of ways to die and ♥♥♥♥ up royally. Many ends different pieces that some of you see at the end. For instance in example dragon age origins and side quests when they tell you oh you let him go, he ran and stole more goods, or she lived and had a kid. Okay in this one it's like that for the ends. There are many ways to go about this. A nice plot and to be honest, I kinda hated this game in a sense. Not because of playing as a princess but just the ♥♥♥♥ing idea of you having to choose one over the other. Let's be honest, there's a guide, there are cheats. However I don't recommend them if you want the best out of it. For instance, there is a lot of interest I take upon how one would feel about such decisions. One of them especially on achievements which was beheading. I admit some deserved it and I do mean that. However this game has reached an 8-9 out of my book. There are costumes and more, just wish she could change her hair color or style, would help. Also the fact that it's the type where you build up your skills that will tell whether or not the condition is met for a certain time limit on a scene. For example, you need to jump a wall, you need a certain amount of a certain skill or study  to do it. That's pretty much how you get more in. Multiple runthroughs recommended.			"

												In Long Live The Queen you play as Princes Elodie, the incoming Queen. It is up to you to ensure that the Princess lives to be crowned Queen.The game works on a weekly cycle. At the start of every week you will be required to choose two classes in which Elodie will participate. These classes will determine which skills are increased. It is important to note the Elodie's mood, as her mood will determine the bonus or penalty to learning skills. For example, if Elodie is depressed, she will not be very fond of attending a class on court manners, hence, that skill will receive a penalty, and spending time on it will not result in any meaningful increases.On the weekend, you are given the choice of a weekend activity, which will determine changes to Elodie's mood.Interspersed are events that require Elodie's skills to be of a certain level in order to be successful, and if not, a negative outcome results. These events give life to the story, and illuminate the intrigue of Nova and its people: noble, commoners, and criminals alike.The gameplay can be rather formulaic, however, the beauty and tactical reasoning arises when determining the combinations of skills that will keep you alive, and keep your realm and people safe.The magic of the game is found in honing one's skills of forecasting and strategy. Seems like tensions in the realm are rising? Do I prepare for war or hope for the best? These are some of the questions that may need answers as you play, knowing that the wrong decision could very well prove fatal.It is a perfect Groundhog Day scenario to experiment with choices and their ramifications. Visually, it has an anime-esque appeal, but one wishes for a greater variety of scenes and backgrounds. The outfits, which are unlocked by increasing skills in the same branch, are very well designed and emphasise Elodie's demeanour and personality.I highly recommend Long Live The Queen for players interested in a strategy game with flair.

												Long Live the Queen is a game of experimentation at the hands of skill checks thoughout the story. You need to balance the emotional state of your Princess in order to gain the most bonuses needed to survive the endless masses trying to remove you from power. The deaths are tasteful artworks and the uniforms are well designed. The game has a simple tutorial which can be easily bypassed once you know what you are doing. Be prepared to start the game repeatedly as you gain knowledge in what you need to prepare for. There are multiple ways in getting past each encounter but the key is making sure you don't run out of time and fall prey to an event you forgot about! It is a game of muscle memory and worth the time invested if you like skill management. There is a humorous take to the game many would enjoy as they trigger various hidden events and new ways to meet your demise!			"

												The general impression I got from everyone when they saw me playing this game was “ew why are you playing a game so girly”. But once you look past it, this game is really strong in all aspects. It tells a great story, allows you to play how you want to play and the music is really strong. It is a good gateway for an experience in being a royal member, or just an important figure. What you do is important for your people and you. The choices you make and the lessons you take can turn your road to coronation to a sadly short life. Each death you have you looking at what you did wrong and how you faltered in your classes. The real strategy of this game comes from taking advantage of your moods to get the most out of your lessons. The reward of surviving so much is very satisfying and it makes all of the deaths from chocolate and bandits on my way to a birthday party worth it. I have no regrets getting this game, and it would be there up there as one of my favourite games.			"

It is important to note the Elodie's mood, as her mood will determine the bonus or penalty to learning skills. For example, if Elodie is depressed, she will not be very fond of attending a class on court manners, hence, that skill will receive a penalty, and spending time on it will not result in any meaningful increases.On the weekend, you are given the choice of a weekend activity, which will determine changes to Elodie's mood.Interspersed are events that require Elodie's skills to be of a certain level in order to be successful, and if not, a negative outcome results. These events give life to the story, and illuminate the intrigue of Nova and its people: noble, commoners, and criminals alike.The gameplay can be rather formulaic, however, the beauty and tactical reasoning arises when determining the combinations of skills that will keep you alive, and keep your realm and people safe.The magic of the game is found in honing one's skills of forecasting and strategy. Seems like tensions in the realm are rising? Do I prepare for war or hope for the best? These are some of the questions that may need answers as you play, knowing that the wrong decision could very well prove fatal.It is a perfect Groundhog Day scenario to experiment with choices and their ramifications.

												Love the game. You have to play it a few times to set up a strategy but you don't get frustrated if you fail: It's almost funnier to see how many ways you can die or fail. See what happens if you marry a girl, declaring war or becoming an expert of magic. Every choice you made will affect the ending: When you are the Queen. It's a visual novel so if you like dialogues and also stratey I recommend the game. You don't have to be good at strategy to enjoy the game though.			"

												In Long Live The Queen you play as Princes Elodie, the incoming Queen. It is up to you to ensure that the Princess lives to be crowned Queen.The game works on a weekly cycle. At the start of every week you will be required to choose two classes in which Elodie will participate. These classes will determine which skills are increased. It is important to note the Elodie's mood, as her mood will determine the bonus or penalty to learning skills. For example, if Elodie is depressed, she will not be very fond of attending a class on court manners, hence, that skill will receive a penalty, and spending time on it will not result in any meaningful increases.On the weekend, you are given the choice of a weekend activity, which will determine changes to Elodie's mood.Interspersed are events that require Elodie's skills to be of a certain level in order to be successful, and if not, a negative outcome results. These events give life to the story, and illuminate the intrigue of Nova and its people: noble, commoners, and criminals alike.The gameplay can be rather formulaic, however, the beauty and tactical reasoning arises when determining the combinations of skills that will keep you alive, and keep your realm and people safe.The magic of the game is found in honing one's skills of forecasting and strategy. Seems like tensions in the realm are rising? Do I prepare for war or hope for the best? These are some of the questions that may need answers as you play, knowing that the wrong decision could very well prove fatal.It is a perfect Groundhog Day scenario to experiment with choices and their ramifications. Visually, it has an anime-esque appeal, but one wishes for a greater variety of scenes and backgrounds. The outfits, which are unlocked by increasing skills in the same branch, are very well designed and emphasise Elodie's demeanour and personality.I highly recommend Long Live The Queen for players interested in a strategy game with flair.

												Love the game. You have to play it a few times to set up a strategy but you don't get frustrated if you fail: It's almost funnier to see how many ways you can die or fail. See what happens if you marry a girl, declaring war or becoming an expert of magic. Every choice you made will affect the ending: When you are the Queen. It's a visual novel so if you like dialogues and also stratey I recommend the game. You don't have to be good at strategy to enjoy the game though.			"

												Long Live the Queen is a game that represents the nature of trial and error. Similar to the classic Princess Maker games that came out of Japan over a decade ago, I find that there is far more depth to this title. There are no random events in this game, as everything is scripted and outcomes are based on the decisions you make as you journey through the story. This does not mean the game is linear and lacks replayability by any means however, as there is a rather significant number of skills you can select to raise.The flow of the game breaks down into three parts:- At the start of the week, you select two classes for Elodie to take which will affect which skills increase. Skill increases have a bonus or penality modifier attached to them depending on Elodie's mood.- At end of the week you decide what Elodie should do for the weekend. This is what affects her mood, and will therefore change the modifiers for skill increases the following week.- After you decide what will affect Elodie's mood, a scripted event will take place. You are also often given choices to take which adds further variety. These events are where checks are done on Elodie's skill levels, which will determine how events in the story may progress, or potentially how you may be led into an ending.This event-check system allows for a variety of replayability as one learns the cause and effect of the actions you have made in both developing Elodie, as well as the decisions you make within the kingdom. For some this may be seen as a negative. Without replaying the game several times you will not know the most effective route to take in developing Elodie, and you are likely to fail many times on the way toward her coronation.The flaw with the skill system exists in that there are too many skills with too few reward. Unfortunately certain skills seem to exist simply to confuse the player and draw attention away from developing far more important ones. Some of the skills may only feature one or two checks within the entire game, while other skills are constantly relied upon, and thus deserve the player's attention more.The visuals of the game are very simple, but incredibly clean. The artwork is well done and everything is discernable. The UI is simple and works, though unfortunately I personally dislike the use of the right-click. While convenient for bringing up the save/load menu quickly enough, I would have preferred it to act as a back button, however that is personal taste and not a strike against the game itself.The music is simple midi, but relaxing to listen to. Designed to have a regal sense to it, I find it is appropriate.The endings are where the game shines. There are many endings, most of them being bad ends. The severity of the deaths Elodie may happen upon would shock anyone who is not already familiar with this title, from being poisoned, to run through with a sword, to being taken out by magic. There are a variety of deaths awaiting Elodie if the player fails to consider the future and does not prepare the future queen for what is to come.Long Live the Queen is a fun title that I do recommend playing through, however it is not without its flaws, specifically in regard to what I mentioned about skills above. I only recommend making the purchase at a more reasonable price point.			"

												Raise your cute, pink-haired duchess to become the ruler of all people! Long Live the Queen is a fun game that revolves around raising Elodie, the next in line to rule the nation. There are three things that you have to focus on, mood, knowledge and future situations. At first you will think that you want to keep Elodie happy, because why wouldn't you want her to be happy? But what you oare really looking for is the exact mood that is going to boost the knowledge that she gains in classes. And that knowledge will help  you in future situations.The game is about planning what could happen in the future and raising your stats accordingly to avoid death. It's a lot of fun and you can get through a run in about an hour.			"

												I first hesitated a bit before buying this game and really, I have no regret. If you are fond of visual novels, I would recommend that game to you !First of all, there are these splendid artworks and musics (I sometime paused the game to simply look or listen to them). They create the perfect atmosphere to lose yourself in the story. With every action you make, with every skills you improve, you learn a bit more about the history of the country, the links between the characters or some other facts.There is then that cool strategy aspect as you have to choose between many skills to study, skills that may change the outcome of many events, help your Princess to analyze a situation... or simply to survive (You ate a poisonous mushroom ? Too bad you never learn about poisons and how to cure them). And to survive is going to be your priority because you will get overly attached to your Princess and furiously ask for revenge each time she dies (and she dies, many times !).Many pretty outfits to wear, lots of difficult decisions to make and also many endings to discover... Good or bad ones !If you like to explore all paths in a game and replay it again and again and again to try different strategies and unlock everything, you will love ""Long Live The Queen"" !			"

												Fantastic game with cute graphic, yet much more serious story. You are playing as Elodie and your job is to plan her day, so that she learn different things (crucial stat raising aspect), which is also linked to Elodie's mood (depending on it you may get boost for learning particular skill or the opposite, it may become harder). You also make important decisions. There are a lot of moments when your statistics gets verified and very often there is more than just one way of handling the situation (and failing to do so may even result in your death). This game is addictive and challenging, there are plenty of ""easy-to-fail"" moments, though it also deliver a lot of different endings. It has high replay value especially if you're aiming to get all of achievements. The only con is game's length - it my opinion it should take a little longer to raise statistics and game should take place during more than just one year of ruling. But this actually prove of how good this game is - I wish I could play it longer, with more options and more story.I recommend it :)			"

												Not the greatest game ever, but still a pleasant surprise.Don't be fooled by the pink interface, cheerful character and visual novel style. This is first and foremost a strategy game where you have to decide where you should allocate your few training points to avoid all the dangers waiting for you. There is nothing random in the game, everything is determined by your skill points and the skill tests against them.Unless you're a completionist that want to unlock all the achievements/endings, it should take your about 3 or 4H to finish the game. Completing everything would require either extensive note takings, or checking a wiki (don't do that before finishing the game once by yourself !), as there are a lot of stuff that is not at all obvious and require planning far in advance.

												Don't get me wrong, the premise and appeal of this game is excellent. It attempts to balance the many facets of an upcoming fantasy queen's ascension, filled with schemes and character progression.But - the game really only makes foresight and save scumming viable. It's inconcievable to beat this game on your first playthrough, let alone an ideal or perfect ending on several tries. It's a steep learning curve, and a lesson in frustration. 8/10, would get Depressed again.			"

												While I have complaints about the sheer number of 'skills' this game has, mostly related to how they serve as much as a way to kill you as anything else,it is definitely an interesting game. The plot is thin, the dialogue paper-thin, and the game 'play' quite limited but. . .it is fun. I did enjoy the game, I won't deny it, but honestly? As long as Princess Maker 2 (just google how old that damn thing is) is the best game of this type ever made, something is seriously wrong. It should have been bested by now, if only by a carbon copy. This game has its charms, and if you can afford to blow the money, you will have fun, but. . .just go play PM2 otherwise.			"

												It's neat, but sorta frustrating. I think the visual novel concept sorta hinders the actual decision-making, primarily because there are hard skillchecks that require you to replay the game a bunch to not die. While that's intentional, I'm sure, it also kinda artificallly increases the amount of time I have to spend reading text that I've already seen a bunch of times.I think the game could really use some sort of flag system based on which skill checks you've seen/not seen that records whether or not you passed the check and what skill level you were at. While I'm a big fan of taking notes when playing adventure games, it's sorta boring to have to remember whether or not I needed 25 or 35 dancing skill to impress my dad's friends.It's a neat game, but I wouldn't actually reccomend it to anyone who doesn't already really like this genre.

This game has a suprising amount of strategy, choicing skills to increase, monitoring moods, keeping track of relationships and the coming-and-goings both domestic and foreign. The game can be played a lot of ways, but you gotta be clever and persistent if you don't want your future queen six feet under.			"

												A pretty basic game overall.  I enjoyed it for a little bit, but overall I think it's lacking.  There are two main reasons why I find this game a bit lack-luster, and you can take them for what they are worth:1.)  Every playthrough has the same plot.  So if you die (which you almost certainly will), you have to sit through the same plot devices every round.  Although there are clearly efforts made to give you several options, I still found myself trying to skip fast enough to get to new plots.  I think randomized events mixed into a few core events would have made replaying much more fun.2.)  The way that bonuses work make it super beneficial to max out a set of skills.  The more you know about a skill, the more you learn by training that skill.  You should avoid this trap, because if you are missing a few particular skill, it could lead to you dying very early in the game.  I think they could have been more creative about how the went about skill training to encourage a more diverse skillset and allow players to succeed in more skill checks.Those two reasons are primarily why I couldn't keep playing this game.  It is worth a playthrough or two if you can get it cheap and like sim games, but not something you'll likely want to keep coming back to.			"

												I didn't know what I was getting into with this one. After reading reviews, testimonials, everything about the game it describes how you will die by chocolate. I did not die by chocolate on my first five tries even once... I did have a number of other grisly fates however.Those fates are primarily the crux of the game, the idea that there are plenty of ways to get killed as a monarch, and you must survive them all for your dynasty to continue. From looking at reviews, and achievements, there appears to be innumerable ways the story can permeate, which leads to a lot of replayability. Even in my few hours I was able to notice major differences in the story... as well as consistencies. As nice as a diverging main plot is, it doesnt seem very diverging. All five tries had the same main plot driving the game forward, same series of major events. Maybe it was just my choice of side events, but I didnt see anything personally which led me to believe these were my choices. Even when i tried to diverge, i ended up with the same main plot. Maybe once i sink my hours in I will see more content.The content I did see was very well done. Nice pictures, backgrounds, emotes, and music all add to the experiance greatly, giving an emotional depth to it. Of course, its not a tightly story driven ""visual novel"" (which is a term I personally reserve for romantic or eroge styles of the genre, LLtQ is a game pure and simple, not an interactive novel), but it still is able to make you see the lore and story of the universe, showing the intense effort put into crafting this world. Everything about the game resounds quality, and in such a small and concise package. Simple, elegant, yet deep and complex, and resounding with feeling from every ounce.This intense feeling gave me chills even. The idea of playing a ""king simulator"" or in this case ""queen simulator"" is a very intriguing game type that highly interests me. The idea of being so vulnerable, but having that power still is something that I really want to like and play with, but I always hate being assassinated. But with this game at least assassions means you start all over and can make better choices, unlike some other king games where you just might end up in a worse mess than before *looks at crusader kings 2*. Either way, the tense edge-of-your-seat feeling the game gave me, as well as the feeling of power when I -spoiler warning- disintegrated a thousand peasents in a second with a fireball, was really satisfying.The game has no major issues from what ive seen, other than maybe no ""randomised"" plot but thats just a personal want from me. So I would recommend the game if you like king games and can stomach the kawaii desu desu aesthetic.See more reviews here- http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JSJaRG "

												If you like seeing intense dark storylines and can tolerate all the princess stuff this game is for you.If you want Princess Maker + Puella Magi Madoka Magika + Game of Thrones, this game is for you.If you like a lot of lore and deep story telling and lots of story elements, this game is for you.If you like Sailor Moon references, this game is for you (Moon Prism Power!)If you like lots of different endings, achievements, killing the NPCs who bug you and ways to kill off the main characterYOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME.Warning: this game gets addictingThe good:everything mentioned aboveThe bad:the game seems to go by too quickly and you may or may not have taught the main character everything you want her to know. You get about 40 in-game weeks that feel more like 20 days in the long run. It'd be better if you could spend each individual day of said 40 weeks to teach her what she needs to know to be queen and live (if those are your intentions). But this is what makes the game so challenging and addicting: you don't have much time and your kingdom may fall into ruin with or without you being alive.Although this game can be compared to the likes of Princess Maker, there are no mini-games or little animations where you see your main character's hard-earned skills put to use. Even the duels you can partake in are just reading, so you're going to need your imagination when you play this game.Another thing that isn't really bad, but may♥♥♥♥♥♥new players off is that YOU WILL FAIL A LOT. It's all in trial and error, whether you view failing as dying, not passing a certain skill check test thing, not getting the ending you want or losing without dying in another way. But you could also say that these numerous skillchecks and this high-failure rate when you first start out just adds to the game's replayability. In addition, it could also show you why there were so many bad monarchs in history~Overall, Long Live the Queen is a cute and extremely dark adventure where you help teach (and almost raise) this girl to be queen in a short period of time. I totally recommend it.i give this game 5 Lumen crystals (or EXCECUTIONS if you don't want to use magic) out of 5			"

												For the pricepoint, Long Live the Queen is cheaper than a movie and thus worth it.Starting a review talking about the price is never good, and while this game tries its best to appear to be a nonlinear fantastical rpg story following the trials of a little girl turned queen-to-be, it falls flat on several key factors.Overall: B- ""A neat game for a few hours.""- I enjoyed it because I got to do crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥and then die. That's about it.- The story is mediocre with very few nonlinear branches. There are several true endings (assuming you make it through alive), with very little deviation, though honestly, as far as I played the game, there are really two endings, both decided on a hidden value: your reputation with the common people. This was rather disappointing to learn once I got to the ""end"", but there were two bigger concerns that I had.1) While appearing to be unrestricted in deciding whether or not you wanted to play with your toys all day or finally go learn magic, the game is actually extremely restricted by the scripted series of events that occur. Technically there are several ways to advance through each scripted event and avoid failing, but I found myself forced to pick just one of two ways (such as getting agility or some other skill to avoid the scripted assassinations) which led to the same event conclusion, with little deviation. I never was truly free to just be a socialite with a little bit of combat knowledge - I was pretty much forced to level my combat knowledge just to advance in the story. While disappointing, I still initially had fun doing whatever the hell I wanted and dying before finally buckling up and trying hard.2) Dying is a main sticking point to this game, and to truly experience all the well written scenarios, one must setup a specific strategy path to get to that point, often beginning from Day 5-10. At one point, I had 12 save files just to reach different types of death scenarios around that one war, only to be unable to advance 11 to the conclusion of the game. For example, I really wanted to sing my way out of this one part, but it turned out I needed 100 rating in voice to get there (among other things), leading to a very specialized decision tree. Of course, this led to me being deficient in other areas and unable to get much further in the game. This was the same for my other 10 paths, with only the 12th decision tree being the winner. This was rather upsetting. Why can't I sing my way to the end?? Blah. (Obviously I'm aware you can, but I didn't feel like restarting my game.)Significant Opinions:Music: B - It's a short story game with a few different arrangements. The main piano theme got repetitive on my 120493th attempt.Art: A - Anime-styled, not really anything amazing. Still gets an A for effort.Replay Value: C - The main selling point of this game is to die and live. Most of the time you die because you have no idea what ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous story event comes next. Then you either have to restart the game to get the optimal decision tree to that point, or reload far enough back (read: possibly several weeks) to be able to prepare for that event. It doesn't help that you don't know any of the values required to pass each of the choices in an event. LOTS of trial and error. Paper and pencil are necessary. If you use a walkthrough... it stops being a game due to the spoiler nature of walkthroughs for decision-based games, but I understand if you're frustrated you'd go for it. For perspective, I died maybe 30 times before I went to the day-by-day walkthrough/spoilers, on which it stopped being interesting since I was basically reading the story in order to get through it. In short this game can be frustratingly hard and requires dedication.///All in all, I had fun dying for several hours, so I recommend it. Don't expect more out of it and you'll be satisfied. Would eat OBVIOUSLY POISONED box of chocolates again. Or sacrifice myself to a tentacle monster. 10/10			"

												Well here is my review of Long Live the Queen: Are you suffering from having too much ♥♥♥♥ing time? Do you question your mental state of mind? Have you ever been arrested for stalking an individual? Are you a human? If you said yes to any of these questions above, this game is for you.. I had to up my dose of Prozac after this one let me tell you; this game makes you want to hang yourself with an ethernet cord, yet you can;t stop playing. Death is so often the outcome in this game that you start to question whether the point of the game is to live or to die in the most ♥♥♥♥ed up way imaginable..... For real... I'm starting to think that it would be pretty legit to go out like a boss and get killed by a tentacle monster. Don't you? I feel so much smarter because of this game, because ""Elodie"" ,or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ her name is (not worth remembering necause she's a♥♥♥♥♥♥, is the dumbest mother ♥♥♥♥er ever imaginable. Who the ♥♥♥♥ dies from falling out a window by accident? She does.... She ♥♥♥♥ing does... Oh and don't get me started with how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it is when she dies FROM ♥♥♥♥ING POISONED CHOCOLATE.

												This game is KINDA like the old Princess Maker games. You have a heiress and you need to trainer her and shape her into being a level 100 pokémon so she can rule a kingdom. And it's a visual novel.The scenario is actually pretty good, with a lot of intrigue and people trying to kill each other by guile to further their positions, kinda like Game of Thrones (you even have an option to sacrifice your little cousin to appease a monster) and people die in unexpected ways, and I like how your choices affect the plot development.BUT.The mechanics sucks. There's little character development and people kinda flash on and away from the storyline before you get to feel familiar with then. And the ending is just a bunch of slides that leave a lot of open ends. If the game was longer and I could keep on developing my kingdom it would be a lot nicer and maybe would earn a recommendation.TL DR: Wasted Potential.			"

												This has been called a ""princess simulator"", but it is a bit more than that. What we have is a trial-and-error strategy game enmeshed in a setting which emphasises feudal politics, fantasy tropes, a story of betrayal alongside decision making, tailoring and improving your skills. All done in a setting that you will discover is a cruel and pitiless world. In this den of jackals you play a small, weak, and initially helpless young girl and heiress to a queendom.Your Lumen (mage) mother, the Queen, is dead, and you are very young. Everyone is lying to you, including those closest to you that claim to be trying to protect you. Are they really making the best decisions for your future? Currently, it is a matriarchy but you are too young to inherit. What this means is that you are encircled by sharks, who will steal your rightful crown off of you if you are not careful (and ruthless). So play dirty, form a plan and study hard, give in to evil, paranoia or try to pursue a just path. Remember though, to prepare yourself for death.5/5 dead princesses			"

												So I have owned this game for less than 5 hours. Still have not won yet, but that is no issue. This game is addicting.So far I have died in three different ways, and no playthrough has been the same. Picking skills makes some aspects of the game change, and ever triggers differnt events. No matter how many times I play, I forget what skills will make me 'pass' certain tests that I don't normally succeed on. It's made each game unique and fun.My only complaints of the game are problems I have with a lot of visual novels. Many sequences become tedious and if you want all the endings, and experience all the opinions, you have to sit through them. The skip opition is much appreciated. Some of the skills seem completely useless, or only seem to have one use for a 'test' in the game. It's hard to tell which ones though, as some skills uses don't always get triggered. I recommend having a save file immediently after the start tutiorial so you can have a quick restart and not have to sit through the opening.Also. Leveling up intrigue is a good way to not eat the chocolate. NEVER EAT THE CHOCOLATE.			"

												This game is extremely frustrating at times, but worth playing. It has an in depth story with many different outcomes. I've died many times in the game, but it was worth it just to win.I'd recomend this game to anyone who likes a good strategy game were you have to constantly learn from mistakes. I think it's worth the price.There are a lot of save slots for the game, I used almost 100 of them.The main character is a little dumb, but that's because you have to make her clever, strong, and independent. Her deaths are laughable. I spent a good amount of time just laughing at her responces to different senarios and deaths.If you're considering buying the game, go ahead, it's very intertaining, and would be fun to show to friends.

												So... honestly, it's not so good as I was expecting. The base gameplay is simple: play the game until you die or fail, then try remember what skills you were tested on, and play again while learning those skills. It's not like you can predict what's coming up, as the other reviews point out (you can die from the most arbitrary of conditions, many events don't test the skills you'd expect them to, and some skills that sound useful do very-almost nothing). So the gameplay really isn't the reason to play this, but it's really supposed to be centered around the writing.Which is why it's unfortunate that the writing is incredibly generic. There's seriously nothing unique or witty about it. It's like the writers went ""Let's think about an ordinary thing that might happen. And then write it exactly how you'd expect it to go.""In fact, really, the only reason I can see why people play this so much is because it's addictive. Which is a pretty poor reason to like a game. So no, I don't recommend it.			"

												Worth a playthrough; but don't recommend it for more than 2 play-throughs.  Some of the decision sequences needed to beat the game outside of military power or magical capability are incredibly obscure, and while I can recommend it for two play-throughs, it can be incredibly frustrating.  You never know how many points in something you need to succeed at an encounter.  What this means is that it is incredibly easy to spend too much too early in the game on one factor, and neglect another.  Even when you have played it thorugh and know exactly WHEN you need something, unless you go to the game wiki you won't know how much of it you'll need.  ""Military issue coming up...is 40 enough? What about 70?"".  I played trying to minimize how much I spent of certain skills so that I could invest in other areas.  I ended up keeping a logbook to track minimum requirements.Also, I never figured out mood maintanence.  STILL RECOMMEND THOUGH! Just...lower your expectations.			"

Its not the longest game but for the price I'd say its worth it considering there are multiple out comes of the game. The game is rather dark despite what the previews show. The story is actually not the bad and the music is simple but good no less. It does prove quite a challenge when it comes to balancing moods cause you'll want to get the bonuses to learn a skill faster. The game does provide some depth of strategy. Its easy to pickup and play due to its simplistic design. So in other words I would recommend this game cause for what it is its pretty damn fun.			"

												Although I haven't played this game much, it's pretty great so far. Managed to die numerous times, from not being able to climb a ladder, to being mediocre in poison.Greatest part about this game I'd have to say is how you can play it however you want, from a paranoid, stressed genius, to an enraged warlord, the game makes sure to reward/punish you for what you've done in class.I would definetly reccomend this game to anyone who likes strategy and roleplay.Funny though, people usually want to stay  out  of school, but in this game you can't have enough classes.I'll be sure to make an update to this after I've played it more, as many people do say it loses its value over time.Edit: Still a fun game, but I'd suggest getting it on a discount unless these kinds of games are your absolute favorite.

												First impression of the game before I played it: Just another silly anime themed game...Okay, I'll play it out of appreciation since it was gifted.After actually playing it: It's...actually quite hard, in some sense. And I totally take back my words before, because this cheesy looking game is actually not cheesy at all!Here you have, this little teenage girl who knows very little about the world, in need of serious cram sessions of various knowledge in order to succeed her dad and rule the kingdom, and the time frame keeps shrinking as crazy crisis arise along the way. Here's the tricky part: what you choose to learn can save you or kill you in different scenarios that arise during the story. In a lesser life-threatening situations, it would embarass you at most. So learning things and managing mood strategically is the key to make her survive long enough to be crowned as the queen. The process may seem a bit repetitive, but being a avid fan of RTS type games, the subtle strategic elements and the interesting tale really kept me going.			"

												I was hanging here and there on Steam's offers. Then I saw this game.-Long Live The Queen ?To be honest, it's really hard to review a game that talks about politics. Because, politics is a personal notion, since we have opinions that influes a lot on it.I was bored so I started reading about this game. Reviews, descriptions, oppinions...The fact is, I always liked that kind of game when it comes to direct and manage a whole state/Empire. I love management. I decided to download it, hopping this would be like I want to - I was wrong. This wasn't. This actually was better than I thought. And how realistic...Embody a young queen, make decisions and face random & unexcepted situations, the storyline of this game is like...Awesome. I really felt how great this was, it was really everytime a new situation, and you knew that you will never live it a second time.You can play it like a troll, or play it like Twilight Sparkle (Being serious). In both ways it's gonna be as fun.Some says ""It's hard !"". No. No, no, no. It's NOT hard, it's a kind of a Die & Retry. That means that you SHOULD die, you WILL die! (Yes, I'm talking to you, Chuck Norris.) The risky side of this game when you have to choose what to increase...Bad choice ? Gotta die. And no, it's not even infuriating : It's...Incitating. You want to replay ! You want to succed ! And everytime you will ""create"" another storyline. You can't stop thinking you're always playing another game of the same kind, but you're actually playing this one.Oh, yeah, sorry but HENTAI POWA! (No, it's not, but sometimes it's ALMOST.)20/20 Awesome, but needs to be about 20% cooler...Now, excuse me, I gotta go : I have to talk to Chuck Norris about this game so he will be so depressed when he'll die in that game he'll die too.

												""LAND! LAND! A DAUGHTER FOR THOU LAND!""these are the opening words of Long Live The Queen, as your Father attempts to auction off you, his daughter, for more land. He is the king of the land, and is disappointed his wife did not bear him a son. Instead, she popped out a smoking hot loli babe. The king's a realist, however, and knows his lineage is gonna be♥♥♥♥♥♥if he lets his daughter take the throne. Instead of killing her like a normal human being, he tries to sell her, but fails, as she is too old. Now, personally, age isn't a problem with me. I'd stick my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in a granny or a preteen. Long as they ain't ♥♥♥♥ing Polish. I hate the Polish. But I digress.Now, the story gets interesting. Your dad dies before you can have hot teen incest hentai sex with him, which is unfortunate. but also probably a good thing cause we never see him and he's probably some wrinkly old ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a limp♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'd rather jerk off to bestiality. And trust me, I have. But I digress.Mommy and Daddy are dead and everyone hates you. What are you, Bruce Wayne? Haha, you would get that joke if you had seen the Dark Knight Rises. If you haven't, then you could probably skip it. I thought the first 2 Nolan Batmans were much better, and TDKR kinda left me unsatisfied. I, personally, would only watch the first 5 minutes or so because of the meme it spawned. FOR YOU. That was the meme. You'd have to watch the movie or understand the meme to get the joke, but I digress. So you have to survive. ""Oh? Survive?"" You may think to yourself. ""I played minecraft! I love survival games!""Right? That's exactly what you thought, isn't it?WELL YOU'RE WRONG.THIS IS THE WORLD'S FIRST STRATEGY SURVIVAL PRINCESS SIMULATOR.Surviving isn't a ♥♥♥♥ing game, you piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥This is an all out balls-to-the-wall mother♥♥♥♥ing royalty simulator.You wanted a cutesy, japanese KAWAIIIIIII video game about being ♥♥♥♥ing cute?you came to the wrong place.action.adventure.mystery.deception.stealth.Look someplace else if you want this.This game is all about menus.And it's not an easy menu like McD's where you can say in your fat neckbeard voice, ""i'll have a number 1"" while you fill your pants with your yellow putrid♥♥♥♥♥because the poor 18 yo who is working 12-9 for her miserable summer job is talking to you.SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO TRAVEL THE WORLD.AND NOW LOOK AT HER.SHE'S A SHELL OF HER FORMER SELF.DEFEATED BY THE HELLHOLE YOU CALL ""THE REAL WORLD""IT'S NOT THE REAL WORLD,IT'S A GAME.AND THE DMs ARE THE TITANS OF INDUSTRY WHO RULE THIS PLANET, SITTING IN THEIR IVORY TOWERS, COUNTING THEIR 100s AND NOT GIVING A ♥♥♥♥ ABOUT THE POOR AND OPPRESSED.THIS IS THE REAL WORLD.YOUR GLORY DAYS ARE NUMBERED.WILL YOU SPEND THEM FLIPPING PATTIES?OR WILL YOU PICK UP YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING BOOTSTRAPS AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE?the choice is yours, play it safe or be something. do something. live life to the fullest.But I digress.This game isn't very good, but I'll reccommend it because it definitely gave me some spank bank material. 8/10UPDATE:Okay, so I wrote that entire review before steam told me I actually had to play at least 5 minutes, so I booted the game up.And wow, I was blown away. Pros:Your dad IS  a hot stud. And he doesn't die right away, so I guess the hot incest porn isn't off the table. Also, the title screen has a beautiful rendition of ""God Save the Queen"", which is a personal favorite of mine, but I digress.The title screen gives you a nice tease as well. The picutre of the queen, whatever her name is, is like one title away from giving you a great upskirt shot. I've jerked off hundreds of times to upskirts of Japanese schoolgirls, so this aroused me. I also love that it doesn't give me the upskirt, it just teases me with it. I enjoy the tease. I think I actually prefer it over an actual upskirt.Cons:I didn't actually play the game, but what I got from it is that it's kinda boring. At least the other hentai games I played gave you the promise of a sex scene, I can practically guarantee this game is fully clothed and family friendly. Summary:I'd skip it, unless you like being teased with an almost upskirt of a kawaii anime princess. If you do like that, i'd highly reccommend it.9/10			"

												This game is rather interesting. You basically have to build up stats to accomplish certain objectives but if you failed some are fine but others prove rather fatal. Its not the longest game but for the price I'd say its worth it considering there are multiple out comes of the game. The game is rather dark despite what the previews show. The story is actually not the bad and the music is simple but good no less. It does prove quite a challenge when it comes to balancing moods cause you'll want to get the bonuses to learn a skill faster. The game does provide some depth of strategy. Its easy to pickup and play due to its simplistic design. So in other words I would recommend this game cause for what it is its pretty damn fun.			"

												How hard could it be to be a 14 year old princess in a feudal kingdom fantasy universe? Turns out, pretty friggin hard. This game has a simple enough face but actually goes quite deep. You need to level up  skills in weekly classes in between events. These skills must be high enough in order to succeed at skill tests that pop up throughout the story line: Are your court manners high enough to endure socialization with other nobles? Are your military skills enough to resist invading armies? There is no time to study everything so each week's classes must be chosen carefully. Your mood also affects these classes and how effective they will be for you to learn about that skill. Later on you also gain access to outfits that will also give you the option to boost certain skill sets. Your choices, and events that go certain ways because of your results of skill tests, affect the story line and some variations occur that makes this game a re-playable game in the sense a choose-your-own-adventure book is re-readable a few times. Many different roads and many different (usually fatal) ends.It is pretty linear in general story and events but there is a handy ""skip"" button that makes it so you can go past all that and just try to survive to reach your fifteenth birthday. Which is REALLY not as easy as one might think.			"

												This was my first time playing a visual novel RPG. The player controls Elodie, a pink-haired 14-year-old princess whose mother just died. She will inherit the crown and become queen on her fifteenth birthday - if you can keep her alive until then.As the player, you can regularly control two aspects of her life: what she studies in her classes during the week, and how she spends her weekend. Classes range from court demeanor to animal husbandry to military logistics. Elodie's lessons affect her ""skills"" stats, which can also receive a boost if you choose to have Elodie wear the associated outfit (e.g., military uniform for strategy, cat suit for political intrigue, etc.). These skill sets affect Elodie's performance in the game's events, such as her abilities to fend off assassins, adequately deal with criminimals, and sense the plots - both political and magical - of those who want to steal her throne. While Elodie can choose how to respond to would-be suitors or political attacks, her options are shaped by her skillset (in this case, flattery/composure for the former, intrigue and her kingdom's history for the latter).Of course, Elodie's ability to retain knowledge to boost her skill set is controlled by her mood, and her mood is controlled by the choices you make as the player about how she spends her weekend, or sometimes by forces beyond her control (aren't we all). For example, playing sports on the weekend increases her anger, and being angry helps her retain military-related lessons at a faster rate. Touring the castle's barracks on the weekend, though, can make her feel more pressured.ALSO THERE IS AN OPTION TO BECOME A MAGICAL GIRL?!While there's more than one way to win, and winning is fun, so is dying - sometimes attacked by bandits, or from poisoned chocolate. There are at least two achievements in Steam that you can win for finding a certain number of ways to die!Tonight I gave a human sacrifice to satisfy a kraken, & also saved my kingdom from invasion by singing.Basically, this game is great fun, and I didn't know games like this existed. (I mean, I was aware of visual novel RPGs, as they sometimes inspire anime series, but not the details.) I'll be messing around with this one for a while, but am very interested in finding and playing more.			"

												A very good strategic decision making game, its a shame that the artwork of the surroundings and characters (except for the queen) is pretty limited and basic. The situations are very thrilling but there is a very bad balance of the situations of what is to come. The game almost feels unfair by not guiding you or preparing you of what kind of situations are going to come or appear, I know the core fun is by not telling you but a little guide of what skills you may need for the coming danger would be very welcome.6/10 would be for me. Worth the 10$? I dunno. But its very worth to try it out if you are into these kind of games. Try getting it in discount if you are unsure. $5 or $7 bucks for it, its a nice deal.			"

Get your act together or die in many lovely ways because everyone else thinks they will be the better ruler. They could be right, but why give them that satisfaction?Who cares about love, I have a kingdom to win.			"

												This game is interesting. Think of this as a hybrid choose your own adventure, Visual Novel, Life Simulator-esque type game. The UI feels a bit unwhieldy as you'll be swapping back and forth between the classes, mood, and skill menus to find out what you'll need to train everyday.  Secondly the game doesn't spell out to which moods impact what stats feels like a mixed bag. You won't really know what to do at first without a little experimentation. This isn't necessarily bad but you might need to look up a guide or check the game's wikipage. The events within the game are not random, however there are a large variety of plot branches and ways to go about this game. Whichever you may take, your goal remains of keeping the Princess alive to make her Ceremony and becoming the Queen.   Throughout playing this game, you'll find out there's a suprisingly high amount of ways to find yourself dying (hell there's even achivements for it) so there's a bit of trial and error in understanding what skills you'll need at specific event skill checks that determine the difference between living and a game over.   Overall I really liked this game. I've always been a fan of choose your own adventures and I've liked Visual Novels. However that won't be the same for everyone as it's a fairly niche game. I picked it up for 5 dollars while it was 50% off and would recommend picking it up for that price or if it goes on sale for below 10 bucks.			"

												It's a pretty decent game to just kill some time with.  I rather enjoyed the game for what it was.  I like that there's a little bit of strategy involved with choosing which skills you want to focus on upgrading each week.  Plus there is a decent amount of replay value in replaying the game to try to get different endings.  Playthroughs can go by a lot faster too because they give you the option to fast forward through dialogue that you've already heard.			"

												I'm not one for girly games but this one is completely brutal. It seems like it's an easy flash game but it's so much more. It's frusturating, time consuming, and curiously addicting. If you're a competitive, technical person who doesn't have the gut urge to vomit at the sight of frilly pink things this game is for you.Just when you think you know it all, or you've improved all the right skills to pass a test you don't. The game throws many confusing curveballs and your corination is certainly something to be proud of, gloat over, and brag about. "

												A very good strategic decision making game, its a shame that the artwork of the surroundings and characters (except for the queen) is pretty limited and basic. The situations are very thrilling but there is a very bad balance of the situations of what is to come. The game almost feels unfair by not guiding you or preparing you of what kind of situations are going to come or appear, I know the core fun is by not telling you but a little guide of what skills you may need for the coming danger would be very welcome.6/10 would be for me. Worth the 10$? I dunno. But its very worth to try it out if you are into these kind of games. Try getting it in discount if you are unsure. $5 or $7 bucks for it, its a nice deal.			"

												So... honestly, it's not so good as I was expecting. The base gameplay is simple: play the game until you die or fail, then try remember what skills you were tested on, and play again while learning those skills. It's not like you can predict what's coming up, as the other reviews point out (you can die from the most arbitrary of conditions, many events don't test the skills you'd expect them to, and some skills that sound useful do very-almost nothing). So the gameplay really isn't the reason to play this, but it's really supposed to be centered around the writing.Which is why it's unfortunate that the writing is incredibly generic. There's seriously nothing unique or witty about it. It's like the writers went ""Let's think about an ordinary thing that might happen. And then write it exactly how you'd expect it to go.""In fact, really, the only reason I can see why people play this so much is because it's addictive. Which is a pretty poor reason to like a game. So no, I don't recommend it.			"

												Worth a playthrough; but don't recommend it for more than 2 play-throughs.  Some of the decision sequences needed to beat the game outside of military power or magical capability are incredibly obscure, and while I can recommend it for two play-throughs, it can be incredibly frustrating.  You never know how many points in something you need to succeed at an encounter.  What this means is that it is incredibly easy to spend too much too early in the game on one factor, and neglect another.  Even when you have played it thorugh and know exactly WHEN you need something, unless you go to the game wiki you won't know how much of it you'll need.  ""Military issue coming up...is 40 enough? What about 70?"".  I played trying to minimize how much I spent of certain skills so that I could invest in other areas.  I ended up keeping a logbook to track minimum requirements.Also, I never figured out mood maintanence.  STILL RECOMMEND THOUGH! Just...lower your expectations.			"

												Surprisingly engrossing, intricately balanced and darkly comedic, Long Live the Queen is a shrewd evolution on the simulation genre. But first, just to be clear: this game isn't for everyone. Caveat #1: Everything is text-based, meaning you've got to have a desire to learn the nuances of the realm's allies and enemies. Fortunately, the writing is top-notch and concise, meaning you won't feel like you're slogging through tedious nonsense.Caveat #2: You're going to die. A lot. And the game doesn't let you jump back in time to change your decisions at those critical moments.

												It's a pretty decent game to just kill some time with.  I rather enjoyed the game for what it was.  I like that there's a little bit of strategy involved with choosing which skills you want to focus on upgrading each week.  Plus there is a decent amount of replay value in replaying the game to try to get different endings.  Playthroughs can go by a lot faster too because they give you the option to fast forward through dialogue that you've already heard.			"

												While I do love this game, I can not in good faith recomend this game, it commits to many of the typical flaws of its kind. Let me list them out and you be the judge.1. Story is truly linear in how you have to pick certain skills in order to survive, especially early on.2. You are forced into to many instant loose scenarios and your skills are not taken into account. For example when my country was being raided, I had 100% on military tactics and logistics, neither of these were allowed to be used, which is absolutely flawed and stuipid in my oppinion, if I am a military genius, I should be allowed to command my forces like I am one.3. To many numbers mean nothing, for example, the game asks you to lower, raise, or keep the taxes the same, without being presented numbers, these figures are meaningless, not only that but kings had advisors to help explain things to them that they did not know.4. The game does not give you the option of advisors to help assist in decisions of state as a real king or queen would have and in plenty.5. Your character starts off with all stats being 0, this is absolutely horrible to me, it is saying that your character has never done anything in their life, has no skills, no training, no natural talents until you are teaching them. This is the biggest killer of the game in my oppinion and completely breaks the whole mold of the game. At least give some stats with 5's or a few tens to them even if they can not handle a skill check at least I have something there to prove my character is a person.			"

												Surprisingly engrossing, intricately balanced and darkly comedic, Long Live the Queen is a shrewd evolution on the simulation genre. But first, just to be clear: this game isn't for everyone. Caveat #1: Everything is text-based, meaning you've got to have a desire to learn the nuances of the realm's allies and enemies. Fortunately, the writing is top-notch and concise, meaning you won't feel like you're slogging through tedious nonsense.Caveat #2: You're going to die. A lot. And the game doesn't let you jump back in time to change your decisions at those critical moments. Instead, go in with the understanding that you'll want to be judicious with creating multiple save files, and yes, you'll probably wind up starting over from the beginning several times. If those two things don't sound terrible to you, you're probably going to have a lot of fun digging into this game. The machinations of this world are complex, opaque and captivating, and if you enjoy games of influence and diplomacy you'll probably be surprised by the depth of strategy available here.One last thing: I don't think there's anything wrong with a text-based game that requires multiple playthroughs to learn its systems and win.

												Worth a playthrough; but don't recommend it for more than 2 play-throughs.  Some of the decision sequences needed to beat the game outside of military power or magical capability are incredibly obscure, and while I can recommend it for two play-throughs, it can be incredibly frustrating.  You never know how many points in something you need to succeed at an encounter.  What this means is that it is incredibly easy to spend too much too early in the game on one factor, and neglect another.  Even when you have played it thorugh and know exactly WHEN you need something, unless you go to the game wiki you won't know how much of it you'll need.  ""Military issue coming up...is 40 enough? What about 70?"".  I played trying to minimize how much I spent of certain skills so that I could invest in other areas.  I ended up keeping a logbook to track minimum requirements.Also, I never figured out mood maintanence.  STILL RECOMMEND THOUGH! Just...lower your expectations.			"

												Long Live the Queen uses an engine for Visual Novels, looks like Princess Maker, but plays like a roguelike.Basic summary of the plot and gameplay: Due to her mother's sudden death, Elodie needs to survive 40 weeks before she turns 15 and is crowned Queen proper. You manage her class schedules which will increase her skills in different areas, but you must also keep track of her mood which can affect how easily she learns certain skills. These skills will become vital as they are frequently checked in events throughout the game. Failing these tests can have consequences that range from not gaining certain dialogue options to instant death.That's the gist of it, but as you play you realize the events of the game look far more complex than it seems. A single decision can have implications several weeks down the line, sometimes interacting with several other factors that railroad you to your death. Adding to the complexity is that sometimes the game checks for skills that didn't seem superficially necessary to an event. And sometimes these checks are STEEP to the point where you'd pretty much need to have been planning to go for them from the start.Then again, you can save and load at nearly any point in the game. Hope you've been taking notes or have a good memory. Would recommend that you only begin using a guide after the first 5 or so deaths or if you're hunting odd achievements.There is often more than one way to skin a cat - for example, you could negotiate a compromise with an invading army to back away, or utilize an alliance to intimidate them into doing so. You're not entirely hosed for neglecting a certain skill set, but you'd better make sure whatever you've invested in is appropriately polished. And because you never have enough time to max everything out, there's a constant possibility of what happens if you resolve certain conflicts in different ways, and the challenge of managing your skills and mood such that they're up to standard when the time comes. A singe complete playthrough takes about 2 hours to accomplish, but be assured you'll spend even more time exploring other events the game has to offer.9/10. Would get shanked in a duel again due to not having enough Athletics to not get tired.			"

												The problem with this game is that you're not given any indication of what skills are going to be needed and in what order, and there are several points in which your character will die no matter what choices your make if you don't have a certain skill at a certain level. It's pure trial and error gameplay, and restarting the game over and over isn't fun.			"

												In Long Live The Queen, you must intricately plan out your classs to take based on your mood and complete certain activities in order to change your mood. there are many skils that can pay off in the long run by helping you defeat foes or keeping such a masterful composure people won't fight you. there is a rivoting story and crucial plot points that greatly affect the story and your relationship with Elodie. There is a lot of planning that needs to be exerted so precisely to ensure that this game is completed perfectly. This game will pull you in and you will create the most amazing princess ever who is capable of facing the harshest demons and the strongest gladiators and mercenaries. Assassins will not be able to harm such a domineering ruler as yourself and you will reing supreme over the world in all its entirety. There are many suitors to marry and many friends to make, many foes to erradicate, and spells to cast. There is truly nothing that can stop a ruler as great as Elodie. as her empire would chant ""Long Live The Queen."" You are truly a magnificent Queen Elodie, may your reaing last foreverOh Wait...She died from eating chocolate. And she ate it because she didn't have knowlegde in trade...I quit.			"

												Did you ever want to be a princess? Did you ever want to have an endless closest full of spectacular clothing from pink tea dresses to formal dinner gowns? Were you that weird kid who dressed up as Jane instead of Tarzan or Belle instead of the Beast for Halloween? Well, I have some bad news for you... you most likely suffer from gender identity issues and should probably seek psychiatric attention immediately.However in the meantime you can fulfill you all of your taboo fantasies in Long Live The Queen! Between your long, arduous therapy sessions you can dress up just like a princess. Or after popping your daily medication of anti-depressants you can throw a fanastic ball for all of your rich friends. Long Live the Queen will definitely let experience what it truly feels like to be a little girl ruling a kingdom at the ripe age of 13, because you know, your inept father apparently can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥ So tell your therapist to ♥♥♥♥ off and pick up a copy of Long Live The Queen today and embrace your inner fabulous! You just might survive long enough to become Queen!			"

												This game is very confusing in a lot of strange ways...Want to avoid being poisoned? Better have knowledge in trade and production skills! Want to tip a sea battle in your favor? Better make that climb check or it's lights out, regardless of having maxed skills in military stuff, extra boats because you saw them coming, etc. (That rebellion you quelled earlier makes it impossible to win despite ALL preparations, sorry... guess you should've invested in that printing press and made army recruitment flyers!) There are too many ""gotcha"" moments in this game that come out of left field and just don't match what's happening. Atop that, it's very hard to tell what is important and what isn't. Should you invest in ""elegance"" so you don't get run over by clumsy servants and impress your fellow nobles? Does that MEAN anything? Or should you invest in ""flattery"" so you can show your false approval for your father's new beau? What good is your opinion to your father, you're 14!It's very difficult and the skill checks just seem to have a mind of their own as far as what skill is tested and when.There are, of course, multiple endings but most times folks will try half a dozen times, die, and then just look up a guide to this well-explained (though poorly executed) mess of a Choose-Your-Way-With-Skill-Points mini-novel.

												Ever want to be a princess attempting to avoid horrible ways of death? This game is for you. It's an intersting story, but a good mechanic for a novel type story regarding training mechanism and trigger checks. It's good to get on the cheap.For more, go to the video here:

You basically pick skills out of the dark until till you die thus learning something you need and then, repeat till you find the winning path.I wanted a raising sim and this is not one.			"

												I played this game a few times.  In the end, I think it is flawed in a lot of ways.  In order to play it well, you essentially are forced to play through multiple times and fail.  You need to learn what events happen when and plan accordingly.  I guess you could say that a game like Super Meat Boy is similar, in that you are forced to replay levels over and over in order to learn how to beat them, but the difference is that a skilled player has the ability to navigate an unplayed level with success.This game doesn't seem to have any skill involved.  You just experiment until things go right.  There are ways to manipulate the bonuses in order to get skill points where you want them.  But it takes a few play throughs to learn what bonuses are associated with what moods, and what events take place that require you to have certain skills at certain times, and then by the time you figure it out, I really felt like I knew the story enough and I didn't care enough to play it again.I did sink a fair number of hours into this game, and usually that is the sign of a game I enjoyed, but this one left me feeling annoyed that there was no payoff at the end.  I didn't get better, I just learned what happened when, and the experience is utterly forgettable. "

												Overview: Visual NovelUnder normal circumstances this is a game that would never appeal to me: cute anime characters, little interaction, and cute music, yet underneath all this is a game filled with a lot of choices and difficult decision to make that affect the outcome of the story. With multiple ways of dying, upgrading your character and choosing how the story plays out, this game is filled with lots of replay-ability. In LLTQ you make three types of choices. After every week you can participate in an activity that alters your mood. Depending on your mood, you get a bonus or penalty to certain skills. The second choice you make is the types of skills you want to learn on a week by week basis. The story has a series of skill checks, by passing or failing these skill checks you are given more information or choices in how the story progresses. The third type of choice you make is directly related to the story, you decide who lives or dies, weather you should go to certain events etc... all of this drastically affects the story in multiple ways and leads to various outcomes...some good....some bad. This game is all about playing the game over and over again trying out different skills and choices and see where the story takes you. Though I'm not the biggest fan of visual novel games, this game is worth checking out. "

												Hey, it's only $10 now!Aside from that, it's just a fun little game. There's not much to say. I found what I think is pretty much the best possible ending, even with such a short amount of game time, through optimizing my choices better every time I played.However, that's not to say I found every possible ending, or every possible death, so your mileage may vary. I just called the game 'done' since I didn't feel like going out of my way to see every possible ending. Also, the game just makes me sad, Elodie is much too kawaii to see her die constantly.You know what you're buying. Everything that you'll get is what you see before you. It's like a visual novel where you die constantly. It's just ten dollars, so why not pick it up? You could buy something much, much worse with those ten dollars, you know.			"

You must figure out what's best to learn, and I love the mood system! It really helps learning things you need quickly, or poses more challenge to you. I love the art, story, characters, and music. Over all a great game, that can prove to be a fun challenge to those who enjoy strategy games. I highly reccomend it, especeilly for only 10 dollars.			"

												Long Live The Queen is... an experience.Initially, when I began playing, I found myself almost instantly satisfied with my purchase. The art is much easier on the eyes than that of some VNs I've seen in the past, while the soundtrack is... eh, kinda underwhelming, but could honestly be worse. Although I entered the game slightly confused and disoriented at the immense size of the menu screens and statistics that faced me from the get-go, I soon found myself engulfed in the game entirely, saving every week until my Queen's end. I found myself falling in love with the game the more I played. I was hopelessly addicted. Every time I found myself dying again, I would scramble to my last save or start over completely just to see more.Then my demise began.Long Live The Queen, past its moe, monarchial facade of a game, is a Pandora's Box of various hells from which you cannot escape. You start playing with the expectation that it might take a couple tries to help your Queen succeed. You try once. You try again. And before you know it, you've played twenty games from start to finish and your hair is in piles on the floor from when you pulled it out because you drowned. Again. For the fifth time. And you know you're going to die like always when you start anew, but damn if you will stop putting yourself through anime agony only to be buttravaged by a tentacle monster out of absolutely nowhere.You continue to play and save. Eventually, you have a pattern. Max out on Lumen as soon as you possibly can. As war approaches, maintain the Queen's mood at the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ place it's been for the last 10 weeks so you can stock up on your knowledge of war and strategy to the best of your ability, then dress your Queen properly so her stats are boosted even further.And yet you still die. With all the stats you need at 100+. Because you don't know enough about dogs to keep yourself from being poisoned by some random ♥♥♥♥ing chocolates that appeared out of nowhere. 10/10 I shouldn't have let my mom die			"

												Pretty Rare (If at all) that I decide to leave reviews, but I honestly must say, this game is a must have!As listen in the tags it is a VA style game, the artwork is well done and I have'nt spotted any glaring errors in the text, makes it much easier to immerse yourself into the storyAnd it is a hell of a good story, playing as the future queen after your mother died, you have to decide every week what skill you will learn, all the while balancing what you want to learn with what you need! The first time I played through I got hammered because I spread it out to much XD And the skill increases are affected by Elodie's mood, if she is Angry, she will learn fighting and military strategy better, but she will learn nearly nothing in Royal Demeanor, causing a balancing act every few weeks trying to get those bonuses where you need em.Another bonus here is the feels! Between sadness for Elodie, some minor melancholy moments, you also have that soul crushing sense of defeat and grief every time you get her killed :p And you will get her killed, but thats part of the addiction here, You will lose and -want- to keep playing to achieve victory and Elodie's coronation; imagine playing dark souls without the necessary masochism xDThe only downside I have so far (And I really had to stretch for it) Is that there is no gameplay after coronation, (just a epilogue based on your choices (which to be fair is awesome). nor is there any form of a ""new Game+"" Like you would normally see in games of this type, this isn't a serious lack, nor does it really detract from the game itself, But I would love to see some additional endgame contentMy Final recommendation and scoring: Get this game, 9.8/10			"

												Long Live the Queen is a fantastic game, but its more than a game, its a voyage of self discovery as you truly attempt to learn the many skills needed to be a queen and are faced with incredibly intense and difficult decisions.I loved this game, I killed a snake and got a pet falcon before being shot by a bandit. Truly it made me think of how short and pointless life is, from now on I shall not care for such petty passtimes as falconry and shall devote myself to a life of warfare and seclusion.			"

												Definately a fun little gem. You take on the role of a princess who is to become queen in one year. There's a bunch of reasons (read: people) that indicate that you may not make it that long. Can you live long enough to become queen?Expect to die your first few playthroughs. There's multiple endings, but no real random chance (kind of a choose-your own story kind of method). Your only real choices in the game are those made available as your choices, and those unlocked by the skills you learn. (If you train to be a queen that's too dumb to think twice about eating potentially poisoned candy, expect to die from eating poisoned candy without getting a chance to think about it.)Honesty, this should be called a decision-based survival game.

												I have had so much fun playing this! There's a variety of endings based on your actions, and it can be very challenging to get there. You must figure out what's best to learn, and I love the mood system! It really helps learning things you need quickly, or poses more challenge to you. I love the art, story, characters, and music. Over all a great game, that can prove to be a fun challenge to those who enjoy strategy games. I highly reccomend it, especeilly for only 10 dollars.			"

												Long Live The Queen is a game that doesn't screw around. Don't practice your social skills? You get killed during a ball. Don't practice horse riding? You die in a forest. Don't practice first aid? You accidentily jam an arrow further into your side and die. You go out in a navy fight and can't swim? You drown.This game punishes you for being overly specilized in one field and it takes a bit of juggling to win without dying or destroying your own country in the process.My princess was sneaky and underhanded while taking full advantage of her magical powers. But she also trained her falcon, who saved her life during an assassination attempt. She was too depressed to eat chocolate and thus avoided being poisoned. She lost a navy battle but killed the lead invader via challenging him to a magical duel then cutting his head off with a magic sword. She set fire to a bunch of rioters and lived to wear the crown.So you can stuff up yet win at the same time. A fun game and wow does it feel good to finally become Queen after dying dozens of times.			"

												Simply put, it's like shoving all your pride and scraps of compassion into your manhood(or ladybits) and then forcing it through a meatgrinder coated with battery acid with elevator music in the background. All for a blank slate character that FOLLOWS EXACTLY what you tell her to do, to her success or various unfortunate ends. Yes, she dies. Alot. In really ingenious ways with a little bit of dark humor caption on the side.If you happen to find this game somewhere in the bowels of the Steam Store.... Consider buying this if the following suits your fancy.1. All text w/ voice acting as from what I can remember.2. Replay value? Tremendously high, given how nearly every skill has its own use somewhere in the game. (Lots of Endings, mostly bad for you and your pupil though)3. Heavy text: You will need to memorize things over a long period of time.4. Failures are always present. You'll likely lose and start over doing the same pattern while slightly changing your strategy to see if you can persevere. 5. Difficulty: It's Hard. REALLY FREAKING HARD. YOU WILL DIE, and there are ACHIEVEMENTS for dying in certain ways. It's like Dark Souls, but your ability to dodge roll, parry, and block are gone. You need to keep notes for your actions, and therefore devise a strategy. My experience? I haven't beaten this game. I've only gotten so far, and then got off'd because I neglected a certain skill that I could have taken WAY in the beginning of the game.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off eventually, and I gave up because I'm a Casul.And also, Have fun creating a manipulative monster, a military savant, a magical (yes magical) sorcerer chick with a fondness for incineration, or.... someone who marries into a stronger family to secure her social ties and hires assassins to clean up any opposition; ( of which there is ALOT) "

Sure, it's girly and cutesy with a pink-'n-frilly art style that vaguely grates on me, but if you can look beyond that there's a surprisingly deep and intriguing game and story going on.Like similar games, you've got a limited number of ""time blocks"" which you can fill with various activities. A substantial number of choices (often based off how you chose to spend your time) then drives an extensive, branching storyline.All in all, I'm on something like my 8th playthrough now, and still discovering new and interesting ways to get murderated. Next time my wife buys me something, I'll just play it straight off!			"

If you abuse the save system, I'm sure you could beat it in 1-3 playthroughs. But I find it fun to start over entirely, as the game gives the impression that it is short.

												Pretty Rare (If at all) that I decide to leave reviews, but I honestly must say, this game is a must have!As listen in the tags it is a VA style game, the artwork is well done and I have'nt spotted any glaring errors in the text, makes it much easier to immerse yourself into the storyAnd it is a hell of a good story, playing as the future queen after your mother died, you have to decide every week what skill you will learn, all the while balancing what you want to learn with what you need! The first time I played through I got hammered because I spread it out to much XD And the skill increases are affected by Elodie's mood, if she is Angry, she will learn fighting and military strategy better, but she will learn nearly nothing in Royal Demeanor, causing a balancing act every few weeks trying to get those bonuses where you need em.Another bonus here is the feels! Between sadness for Elodie, some minor melancholy moments, you also have that soul crushing sense of defeat and grief every time you get her killed :p And you will get her killed, but thats part of the addiction here, You will lose and -want- to keep playing to achieve victory and Elodie's coronation; imagine playing dark souls without the necessary masochism xDThe only downside I have so far (And I really had to stretch for it) Is that there is no gameplay after coronation, (just a epilogue based on your choices (which to be fair is awesome). nor is there any form of a ""new Game+"" Like you would normally see in games of this type, this isn't a serious lack, nor does it really detract from the game itself, But I would love to see some additional endgame contentMy Final recommendation and scoring: Get this game, 9.8/10			"

												I love this game, and I can't say enough good things about it.The game isn't easy, and it will definitely kill you. Probably more than once. But it also allows for multiple different playstyles. I've successfully completed the game with Elodie as a swordswoman/general, an academic interested in history and statecraft, a lumen wielding paranoid with spies everywhere, an athlete that hates lumen, and a historian interested in the arts. I love that I can craft so many different versions of Elodie and complete the game, though I will say it's much harder to not die if you choose not to become a lumen, and the ending seems far more sinister for an Elodie that isn't a lumen.Stat raising in the game can be a real challenge, and the best advice I can give is to keep your mood bars as close to the center as possible and only raise a lower high enough to give yourself the bonus you need. Go too far in one direction, and you'll find yourself unable to train key skills when you need them.  Also, while there is marriage in the game, this isn't a dating sim, so these really exist to add flavor text to the epilogue. The sweetest options are Briony (though it is hard to keep her alive)  and Evrard, though my favorite is ""romancing"" Brin and marrying her brother. That one's awesome.The only thing I don't love about this game are the aesthetics, which have far too many pink hearts for my taste, but the interesting and fun gameplay more than make up for that. And honestly, I've love a sequel where we get to play Elodie again and help her through her first year as queen or one of her children.			"

												As odd as I found myself buying this game (I almost never watch anime or anything like it), it actually is pretty interesting.Basically you get to play the ""pretty pretty princess"" and as they call it, it is a Sansa Stark sim...well more like a female Joffrey sim...well...It's actually none of those. It's probably one of the darkest (but for all the right reasons) games I think I've ever played. The story is very branching and loose and has everything to do with what YOU choose to do. Even something as simple as managing a certain event differently can have DIRE consequences.The main thing you do in the game is basically play Elodie, a Princess of a fictional country called Nova as you try to survive multiple assassination attempts, wars (both civil and uncivil), political intrigues/plots and other stuff.The main thing I can say about this game is this: WHY IS CRUSADER KINGS 2 NOT LIKE THIS GAME???Even though this game is literally 58 MB (yes it's even smaller than Star Wars Dark Forces) it feels like a much larger game, with a lot of options to choose from and even quite a few endings to find, which sometimes are hard to find because of the complicated nature of the game that really lends to being replayed just to see it the whole way through.The main way you influence stuff is you train Elodie with various tutors that educate her in mostly real life skills like court protocol and public speaking (important if you actually want to look the part), military and weapons skills, political intrigue, history, economics etc. You can even get Jedi-like powers and win most of the game by blasting people with magic. It's tons of fun.Did I mention this game is more of an RPG than CK2???Not that I hate CK2...well...at least it has combat...kind of...and...mongols.In all seriousness though, I was surprised how well fleshed out the game was - every option is worthwhile just to see what it does and how it affects the storyline.The characters are rich and realistic (wow) and they even have the penultimate theme of the ""old tyrants of europe"" - ""God Save the King/Queen/Czar/Tsar/Kaiser/etc."" as the menu theme in a nice piano solo. Nice touch. That alone made me want to play.The only problem I had with the game was the lack of physical character customization (besides different outfits). I wish you could play as a prince or princess (like Fable III), but then again the game would then be called Long Live The Whatever, so I guess that wouldn't have worked XD.Very Impressive.10/10P.S. That's very high praise from me because I love games where you play as the nobility (like Fable, Dragon Commander and CK2). As far as I'm concerned, this is easily a great, if not an excellent game.			"

												Frustrating but fun. I still haven't gotten an ending I really like but hey, I sure have managed to die in a lot of interesting and fun ways. Magi-splosion might have been my favorite death. Good game for anyone who liked the Princess Maker series and likes interesting visual novels that don't revolve around romance and which have many plot points you get to affect and change. But on the same note, can be frustrating for some because you can die for strange reasons and find out later you could have been saved by something that it would have been impossible to make a logical connection between. For example, how would learning to train hunting hounds save you from being poisoned with a gift? Either way, still a fun game.			"

												I dont write reviews, normaly. But i was realy positivly surprisesed that Long Live the Queen was in my update row today. Its Nov 2015. 2 Years since the game came out. And they still maintain it. Without having mmo, dlc, gosh, multiplayer at all.Its a cute, kind, funny and entertaining queen-simulation. Made with love. And you can feel this fact. Thank you Hanako Games.			"

												I have had so much fun playing this! There's a variety of endings based on your actions, and it can be very challenging to get there. You must figure out what's best to learn, and I love the mood system! It really helps learning things you need quickly, or poses more challenge to you. I love the art, story, characters, and music. Over all a great game, that can prove to be a fun challenge to those who enjoy strategy games. I highly reccomend it, especeilly for only 10 dollars.			"

												Definately a fun little gem. You take on the role of a princess who is to become queen in one year. There's a bunch of reasons (read: people) that indicate that you may not make it that long. Can you live long enough to become queen?Expect to die your first few playthroughs. There's multiple endings, but no real random chance (kind of a choose-your own story kind of method). Your only real choices in the game are those made available as your choices, and those unlocked by the skills you learn. (If you train to be a queen that's too dumb to think twice about eating potentially poisoned candy, expect to die from eating poisoned candy without getting a chance to think about it.)Honesty, this should be called a decision-based survival game.

												I played the game all night for 3 or 4 nights. I still haven't become queen once, but this game is so great I'm not even mad. If you abuse the save system, I'm sure you could beat it in 1-3 playthroughs. But I find it fun to start over entirely, as the game gives the impression that it is short. Although, my better performing playthroughs last over 2 hours, so it could be infinitely longer. I'd highly recommend it.			"

												My wife bought this for me. I ignored it. I got couched.Eventually, I gave in and played it and, you know what... it's actually a darned good game! Sure, it's girly and cutesy with a pink-'n-frilly art style that vaguely grates on me, but if you can look beyond that there's a surprisingly deep and intriguing game and story going on.Like similar games, you've got a limited number of ""time blocks"" which you can fill with various activities. A substantial number of choices (often based off how you chose to spend your time) then drives an extensive, branching storyline.All in all, I'm on something like my 8th playthrough now, and still discovering new and interesting ways to get murderated. Next time my wife buys me something, I'll just play it straight off!			"
