												If you like Total Annihilation / Supreme Commander types of rolling economies - then this is the 4x for you.  Tired of the constant back and forth over a single star system on the edge of your territory?  Simply destroy all the planets and the star they orbit and your problem is solved!Don't like how looooong it takes to build those 1,000,000 kilometer long ships?  Simply build a Ringworld around a super giant star!  You can build fleets in the 1,000's in just seconds!But wait!  ""Building that Ringworld is going to take too long!""  Sure, while that might normally be true, all you need to do is build planetary thrusters on each of your planets and fly them all into a single system.   Take that logistics!			"

												+/+ Unique take on the 4x genre.+/+ Great technology tree.+/+ Infrastructure and starships receive updates with tech.+/+ Excellent starship construction options.+/+ Lots of options for how you set up the game.+/+ Well supported by developers (over 30 patches).+/- Star Ruler is played in real time with pausing.+/- Micromanagement is handled by the A.I. by default.+/- Swarm style warfare.-/- Weak diplomacy.-/- Mediocre user interface.-/- Little purpose to using fleets.-/- Graphics and sound effects are weak (not that important for genre).-/- Lacks steam features.Verdict: 7.8/10.  Star Ruler is a very unique and deep 4x strategy game.  It’s a great game, but as of writing this review, the sequel is being developed and looks to expand upon the strengths while fixing most of the weaknesses (such as the UI, fleets, and diplomacy).  If you’re not a huge fan of the genre or can’t get it cheap, I’d wait for the sequel.  That being said, this is a worthy game in its own right.			"

												One of my absolute favourite space games of all times.  Very open-ended, with a complex technology system that really lets you experiment with countless combinations and strageties.  There is a learning curve on how best to design your ships for various purposes, and the AI is extremely difficult I find, but once you have it all down, it is a really rewarding and challenging game.  I don't believe the game was fully finished, so there is something a bit unfinished about it, but the shear power and scale of the game make up for it with a little imagination.Considering the price, it's definitely worth picking up by any space 4X fans!

												Before buying the game I ran across some reviews indicating that this is a 4X strategy game with a high level of complexity. Thats fine for me, after all that is what is intended to be for serious strategy 4X games.But complexity needs the appropriate tools, interface and AI to work fine. Unfortunately this game lacks all of theme. Yes it is complex, but it turns out to become very chaotic in the end. So you probably get fed up and let everything be managed by the AI. The AI governors will actually do a good job for you and the only thing left to do is designing ships (which is actually a cool part of the game), building theme into thousands with out any limitations and penalties and sending theme to massacres under a very aggressive AI which doesn't give you much choices than to go into meaningless chaotic wars. Just curious, doesn't a ship have any maintenance expenses? And build by the thousands? It wouldn't be a problem managing such a large numbers of units, but you don't have the appropriate tools to do that or at least the ones provided are very poor.Diplomacy is very poor, management of empire also poor and with out any perceptive, interface controllers and functions a bit strange and difficult to adjust even for experienced strategy gamers. The game also lacks a sense of personality, rather mediocre.  So finally in the end you have got this enormous in numbers ships and just send theme to battles, one after another, contentiously... ba ba doom booom... boring... still for some this might be enough and very entertaining.On the other hand, graphs and layout are quite good, simple and minimal which in my aesthetic (and functionality) perspective is good. Music is also one of the best encountered in this genre of games, and the concept is fine but just stuck in the level of intentions.			"

Star Ruler is an RTS 4X of theoretically limitless scale and great strategic depth. A game could include over a thousand star systems if it's running on high-end hardware.Graphics: Unsurprisingly, nothing too amazing (though the planets actually look pretty nice), but then at the scale most games of Star Ruler run, it should be considered something of a small miracle that there are as many objects rendered as there are. The UI is mainly just functional, nothing too pretty; it's not as intuitive as it could be and it can be hard to figure out what's going on even if you read the necessary literature, but it's nothing that can't be gotten used to.Sound: Pretty standard space game fare. The soundtrack is decent enough, though a little light on tracks. Some notification sounds can be easy to miss or sound too much like other notifications.Gameplay: This game has as deep a ship design element as one could hope for (like the creation of ships the size of star systems that shoot planet-sized asteroids, if one so wishes and has the means) as well as an interesting approach to tech trees which adds an element of chance to breakthroughs and branching. Unfortunately, the gameplay is usually too fast-paced to take full advantage of the ship design features and the pace of the game also negatively impacts the management of planets as well (an element that seemed fairly well done at first). Additionally, there seems to be an unresolved bug regarding energy weapons never cooling down, so avoiding those is recommended. Overall, however, the gameplay of Star Ruler feels a bit like Supreme Commander or Planetary Annihilation on the scale of a galactic 4X, albeit with a good deal more of untapped depth.This reviewer gives Star Ruler: 7/10Additional Note: The Galactic Armoury mod adds a fair amount of content to the game and is highly recommended. If I recall correctly, the developers themselves helped with the mod, so it's sort of an ""official"" expansion.			"

												Great game! BUT - it does seem like this game is getting robbed by a sequel - the game description claims that features are ""currently"" being expanded... but to all appearances its NOT, its just the old sales pitch, while the expanded feature development is implemented in a new game (sequel).  Does ""seem"" a little dishonest... .  If this changes, I'll change my review.			"

												Star Ruler is a very open-ended game. This supports modding very nicely and there are some wonderful mods out there for it, such as Galactic Armory. The blueprint design system lets you stop worrying about exactly how the ship is going to be put together and worry more about exactly what types of systems you want to install, and how much of them. There is almost no limit to how big a ship's scale can be, and everything is done on a beautifully simple relative ratio allowing you to take any ship design and rescale it easily. Research is well handled, while simple, it is also complicated with the possibility of randomizing links between different fields, resulting in completely unique paths to the future technologies per play. Unfortunately the game's multiplayer support is not up to snuff, so is difficult to play with others over the internet. LAN games appear to work fine however. One thing to note: Star ruler 2 is allready in development, so this game is pretty much solidly locked as it is. The original promises of expansion and update have come to fruit to a degree, and it's a wonderful game overall, but don't buy it for multiplayer unless you're going to game on a LAN.			"

												A brilliant game. I play with the Galactic Armoury mod and absolutely love the game. There is a steep learning curve and some of the aspects of the game can be a little obscure and difficult to follow but, with potentially infinite maps (depends on how good your computer is) and almost limitless customisation of ships and stations I would rank this as one of my favourite games. Of course the fact that you can make ships that are bigger than the entire galaxy is a plus!One of the detracting points for Star Ruler is the Diplomacy system but for Star Ruler 2[starruler2.com] this is being completely overhauled.On the whole I would recommend Star Ruler to anyone who is willing to take the time and put in the effort to learn an excellent game.

												Despite the obvious fact this planet was made on a nearly non-existant budget it's pretty good for how small it is. And the size some of the maps can get to is damn impressive, just be prepared for your borders to become a grind zone for fleets that can range from where in the hundreds to the millions. Add in that literally everything can be destroyed, and you have chaos unending near the end.Don't like chaos? Don't play this. It runs on it.			"

												Pros: + the massive scale is amazing. You can make galaxies as big as you computer can run.+ the scale is not just limited to the galaxy the palyer can make some massive structures like a gun that can destroy star from other star systems and ships that can be larger than entire planetsCons:- the diplomacy has nothing to it all the options are just to make a threat, demand, allaince, or war. The playere literly   just selects on of those optins form a drop down by the race which give no satification- the economy is just one resource really and that is ore the other two resources are just refinde ore and refined refined    ore so it pretty one dimensional- the research system can be quite intersting where the player can infinitely research a tech at exponentially higher cost  to continue to gain advancements in that field the bad part to this is that advancement feels very incremental for the most part which it is. This takes away a lot of the excitment from researching a new technology because the not a ton can generally be done with new research advancments.Conclusion:I have defeinately put quite a few hours into this game and definitely had some fun with this game but at the same time I do not feel like I can recommend this game to others. This is mainly due to after playing for a while I do not feel this game really has much of a soul to it and in my opinion can be a bit lifeless at times. I also had this same feeling playing x3 where the whoel universe just felt overly mechanical. "

												Star Ruler is the perfect example of an indie diamond in the rough. The core realtime 4x gameplay gives you a ton of freedom and ship design is fun and open, while the game progresses to eventually become really hectic. The customization and stuff isn't overdone to the point of being spergy like in some of these types of games. However, the game is pretty graphically poor, there being only two visually distinct sets of ship designs and everything being sort of par for the course budget indie space game graphics. The studio seems tiny though so can't really fault em that. A bigger issue is that the gameplay tends to degenerate into walling off a section of the map well enough that the AI can't bust through easily, and then beelining a ship of such a large scale none of the AIs can deal with it as it blows up planet and sun after planet and sun. The basic resource gameplay is realtime resource chain management sort of similar to Anno games, at which the AI has perfect micro - the difficulty setting seems to be what bonuses they get, and I couldn't find a difficulty at which I could have a back-and-forth fight with the AIs. Either I would crush them outright, fight them to a stalemate then win after two hours of turtling like outlined above, or get totally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game seems to have a lot of potential for multiplayer but there ain't nobody playin this obscure♥♥♥♥♥indie pile lol. With more dynamic and varied AI this could be great. The sequel will be something to look forward to, though I gotta say an expansion fixing some of this would be better, first.It's a recommend if you dig stuff like Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire with a dash of Anno and a pinch of autism mixed in, then all the polish knocked off			"

												Superb 3D space RTS. Like the civilization games if they were massize 3D space RTS with no size limits or unit caps. This game delivers a true 3D universe (with the option to flatten it to a 2D pane if that's the kind of map you want) with real time flight between stars and clusters. Sins of a Solar Empire meets Sid Meier's Civilization with extras that both games lack like 3D spaceflight along individually determined paths, real time civil management and custom unit construction.Really a lovely game, proud to have it in my library. A recommended collectors item to buy on sale or even off if you have the spare cash and would appreciate sitting down to play something like this singleplayer sometime.Unfortunately multiplayer is fairly dead and with Star Ruler 2 available for purchase now likely to stay that way. Still a very nice game for even just a few 100 hours of singleplayer. Star Ruler 2 going to be even better I hope and with people online.This is the sort of thing I think of when I think of a honestly priced classic high quality PC video game.A shame it hasn't been much more popular. Hopefully that would not ruin it as it seems to have much of the industry.			"

												There was a time where this was new and innovative, but that time has passed (hense 110 logged hours).They are developing a second one, which you should be more interested in.Now, if you're hooked by the advertising, I'll tell you that there's an intellegence limit before it's button mashing. At first, you design your ships to meet specific needs, due to your many constraints. As technology progresses, design is irrelevant. If you don't have thousands of colony ships on standby, thousands of it really dosent matter as long as they get incrimentally bigger every 5 levels or so on the way to random galaxies, etc, etc...Basically I'm saying you reach an inevitable singularity. What was fun, required strategy, and your own creativity turns into mindless operation. I look forward to seeing how they counteract this in ther next game.			"

												One of my favorite games, hands down. Nearly 400 hours and still rising every so often. If you like having the ability to customize your ships in Galactic Civ II or something along those lines then this is the next step up. There (were) also some excellent mods, at least two total conversion mods that added tons of weapons and the like but unfortunately those have become outdated. I hear, however, that the modding is easy (relatively) so that is another plus if you like messing around with your games.Unfortunately, it does have some problems though. I am not 100% certain the weapons are all balanced and the diplomacy system is... lacking.. to say the least, but I still very much enjoy playing and still do.If you liked this game, you should check out the sequel they are working on!

												Just finished the tutorial and... Wow! this game!.. It has got the best of every 4x game I've played till now.So what should you expect?......Expect a Space Empires game (a turn based 4x) minus warp holes for inter-system travel, with RTS elements of Homeworld on a game engine like a AI War: Fleet Command. Oh! Forgot to mention, Star Wolves like pirate raids. :))Verdict:It is a close to perfect 4x RTS game which doesn't need a hefty system specifications to run on with guaranteed tonnes of hours of gameplay. The reason I called it ""Close to perfect 4x RTS game"" is because I havn't played long enough to be able to comment on AI. But I'm optimist it won't disappoint.Rating:For now, 10/10 for game design and controls... Will update this review after playing a couple of hours with AI.Update: AINow since I've played close to 19 hours, I guess I pretty much understand how the AI's behave. Initially I thought AI to be easy, but couple of minutes later, game proved me wrong.Unlike other games, where AI's target you when you are supirior to them or become a threat, in this game, they will ensure that your race is wipped off the galaxy if your race is inferior to them. If you however are superior, they are likely to give you resources and research points to stay your ally. I'm not saying they won't attack you if you are superior (i.e. leading in number of ships, research, star systems inhabited and economy), but that in my experience will only happen if there are no more planets to colonize.AI's can also become annoying at times with constant treaty requests. While most of the AI's rely on medium ship sizes (usually 10x-50x), some will build gigantic ships (like 100x or larger) couple of minutes in the game. So I suggest you to try to build some for yourself.Also, build a huge number of ship so that you have enough reserves for ones you might lose in battle. As if your fleet size is minimized, most of the AI's will turn their backs on you and believe me, thats disasterous!!			"

												When it doesn't crash, it's a nice experience, but it crashes way too much. I recommend it cause overall it's a must-have for strategy gamers for its deep customization/traits system (you can even write the background of your alien species or make blueprints of your own ships). But seriously, it crashes way too much.I'd highly encourage to follow Star Ruler 2 development, to see if all those issues will be addressed. "

You can design and build swarms if microscopic ships all the way to solar system sized dreadnoughts. If you enjoy designing your own units to make your forces work in whatever way you choose, then this game is as good as it gets.

												Pros: Still one of the most ambitious rts games I have ever played, Star ruler makes up for bare-minimum graphics with mind boggling scale and complexity. Will your strategy involve fleets of ai controlled drones? Or a handful of superdestroyers? Perhaps you prefer to send carriers full of small, manned bombers? The ability to customize your strategy to your tastes is easily the best part of the game, followed by a galaxy generation system limited only by your hardware. Its the little details that make the ship building mechanic shine. Your free to design whatever ship you want, but you'd better pay attention! The game will hold your hand just enough to complete the ship design, but be sure to add enough fuel! I only needed to build one expensive fleet of ships that drifted into black nothing with empty tanks before I knew to check fuel specs EVERY time I designed a ship. Ammo consuption, power levels, life support, net acceleration- all important variables in your design. A ship that suffers a power outage every time it fires its main weapon will be an expensive coffin when the fighting starts. You get the idea. Cons: Its certainly rough around the edges; Its a game that doesn't really know if it wants you to micro manage every little detail, or let its automated systems do the heavy lifting. It often feels like big complex mechanics were put in place and then made irrelevant in order to keep the game playable. Examples include an entire resource (luxuries) that in all my 80 hours of gameplay I didn't worry about once. There is also a system for how happy your populace is thats supposed to affect how fast they build things, but it never seemed to cause problems. Theres an entire game buried in the social and economic aspects of star ruler, but its like the devs realized no one wanted to be bothered with luxuries when a galactic war was on and painted over it. I've had so much fun with this game that I have to recommend it. At the same time, its difficult not to wish the developers had focused more on their design; cutting away the pointless bits, defining the core mechanics. . . Its a great game that could have been better, but I love it all the same.			"

												Woa this one is a bit hard to review. It's an old game from an old distant galaxy in the olden times...Fast review: If it's 10$ or less, you can buy it, over that go buy starforce 2 instead! Much better in everyway!!!Now for the detailed review:- Space strategy 4x game realtime with pause and adjustable speed. Colonize planets, develop them, build ships, conquer- There ain't much graphics in this game. An old windows xp can run this game fine. Ship battle are kinda 2D boring affair.- There is far too much bass in the background music! I had to turn it off after a few minutes, i was THAT annoyed by it.- The gui is unpolished. It's not buggy, but it's not intuitive. It takes quite a while to find out where everything is and how it works. Because it's not a big AAA game, there ain't much information either in forums or elsewhere. It's pretty sparse. But on the other hand, if you stick with it, the learning curve is not that bad. Nothing compared to Distant Universe for example.- The ship design is unique compared to any game i've played. Designing a dreadnought or a cruiser is the same, only the amount of armor and the hull choice seems to decide what amount of HP the ship has, but they both will have the same amount of components. A bit dull if you ask me. Clunky too. But, god it's complicated at first with something like 20 stats that you can affect with the components you include. Example: Amount of ammo your ship has, the amount he will spend by second, the amount of fuel, amount of fuel spent by second, amount of energy generated and on and on. I think it's a bit too much detail, but you can design your ship to your heart content! Also, all ships pretty much looks the same, only difference is size (which you can also set. If you want a fighter bigger looking than your dreadnought, you can do that too!).- The research graph is interesting and kinda fun. I like it. It's also one of the few part of the game that is intuitive and easy to understand and use.- The zoom and map movement is pretty horrible. It made me think of the first 3D game i've ever played where they had not yet mastered how to move the camera in 3D. Haven't found a good way yet to move around my empire except by planet name. And the funny part is that the game may look like 3D, but you actually move only in 2D. HAHAHA!- The amount of ships you are going to lose because of them reaching empty fuel is pretty crazy. You need tankers everywhere and in large numbers. Yeah if a ship or fighter reach zero fuel, they die and can't be 'revived' except maybe with boarding ships.On the other hand, there are no cash and no ship maintenance in this game. So if you want a fleet with 1 million ships, you can go ahead and do it. You seem to only be limited by the amount of ore that is on planets and asteroids.- You can automate each ship with pretty detailed orders, but you can also shoot yourself in the foot repeatedly with a bad automated order. It does not always act like you think it does. And there are no explaination anywhere about them. So go go experiment.- Everything in the game will improve with the appropriate tek researched. Every building on planets, every component on a ship including armor and hull. There are a lot of research fields.- You can retrofit ships as long as you kept the same design name. For example, 'Carrier' blueprint. If you changed the name, then it is not considered the same class of ship and no retrofit for you. So you keep the starting design from start to end game. Does not matter that you completely change a ship vocation and components, as long as the design name is the same you can retrofit it.- You will make millions of ships. Eventually, you won't even bother and you will put your planets on repeat order so they crank out the same ships forever. And you send them attacking the frontier. You can have a biiiiiiiig empire. A bit hard to manage properly thought.- They kept the physics in the game as newtoninan as possible with even ship mass and thruster power. Depending on mass, a ship can take awhile before changing speed or even direction! It sure is pretty realistic, but i don't think it makes for very fun battles. The amount of errors you will make in your designs before you get them just right is going to be huge.- I've looked at the starforce 2 game and it seemed much better than this one. They kept the same concept, but graphics are loads better, the gui too is a lot more friendly with nice icons that do what they look like, spying and improved diplomacy to do dirty trics and the design of ships seems much more interesting and fun. Also, unlimited galaxy that you can generate! You decide the shape of the map and how many stars there is and they generate it for you! You are only limited by the speed of your computer! So you can 'in theory' generate a billion star map! It won't play well but you can do it!- Diplomacy is pretty bare bone and pointless. Enemy ai don't seem too challenging either after you master the game. Everything looks a bit bland. Once you played one game to completion, you don't really want to play another one.			"

												I cannot stress how cool this game is. Alright, so you like Civilizations... so you like Galactic Civilizations, well this game is just like them, but better, and getting better all the time. Not only does it allow you to design your own Starships, but it lets you set their scale as well. Want a ship bigger then a star system? Ok, easy enough, its just gonna be expensive and take forever and a day to make, but still it will be there, all bigger than a star system and all. And thats not all, this game has a massive sense of scale, EVERY planet is colonizeable in EVERY star system, and each star system has a minimal of 2 planets to colonize with the average being 3-4. Not to mention that every time you play a new galaxy is made, that YOU choose how many star systems are in, I personally made a galaxy that had 700 star systems,  (though you can go MUCH MUCH higher, your really only limited by what your comp can handle.)But anywho, check this game out, its fun as hell.

												As an avid fan of space x4 games,  this is one of my top 5 favorites.  If you enjoy space x4 games, you can't regret buying this especially when it's -75% off during sales.   Positive pointers of this game:  Design system is different and really awesome.  You can design a ship of unlimited choice of size.  It could be 0.001 or millions.  Setting up a galaxy, you can choose to have tens of thousands systems (if you have a good computer lol)  which is pretty cool game-creation ability.  The only bad pointers I can think of is the ships, they only have 2 shipsets (and basically they all look the same) but I didn't mind that so much in this game.   Technology is very general, there are no special ones since everyone can research the same things.  There are no ""races"" to play as other than your ""game profile"".    But really, the bad pointers are small and they are not enough to overlapse the good pointers of this game.   Like I mentioned, If you enjoy space x4 games, this is a good buy! :)			"

This game relies on the principle, if your pc can handle it why not do it. unlimited amount of planets and unlimited amount of stars, traveresed by ships of unlimited size. This combined with a although clunky, adequate UI and controls.

												If you can grab it on sale it's definitely worth playing. The end game stuff is hilarious and there is basically no limit to technology research-- if you can fund it, you can build it. Interstellar artillery, battle planets, ring worlds, star destroyers... it's all there! Wouldn't advise playing it unless you're the type that really likes to tinker with stuff, a casual RTS player would probably be put off by the lack of ... spit polish. The newtonian physics can also be annoying-- the problem with implementing such a system is that unless you support n-body physics [which this game, without any ambiguity does not] things will constantly overshoot as there is no curve to their path.If there's one thing I hope is fixed in SR2 it's the physics...

ONE FRIGGIN SHIP wiped out half my planets and its defensive fire took out the remaining survivors of my once mighty starfleet, who feebly attempted to rescue the terrified civilian victims of ONE FRIGGIN ENEMY SHIP !!!!Playing this game is the only way to realise that even with a (meagre) tutorial, you have not been told anything beyond the most basic of details, and are woefully unprepared for anything you might encounter.

Have I mentioned that it does everything semi-realistically. Like give you velocity, fuel, travel distance estimates and times? It's detailed.Also the tech tree is random and infinite as well, so get ready for some long games which will end with the guy who reached 'The Singularity' first steam-rolling everyone.

												This game wants to be something greater than what it is. It implements so many features, but its very core and basics are so fundamentally flawed that no amount of giant super sun-sized space stations of doom can actually overcome it.When you spend literally hours designing a ship and another few hours watching it build, only to watch it blow up because of completely screwed up controls (how people can screw up controls in this day and age baffles me)... well... you don't get much satisfaction out of it.I seriously spend more time wrestling with the poor UI and control scheme than I do actually playing the game. It is ridiculously difficult to control a fleet. The game promises fleet AI to do the micromanaging for you but that fleet AI is about as useful as me playing this game blindfolded.I played this game when it first came out. Now, practically a year later, they added so much new stuff but barely fixed any of the problems that made it so hard to like in the first place.			"

												Unless by some miracle of the internet you happen to buy this and not have the multitude of issues that most of the users of this game have experienced, DON'T purchase this game. The concept, from the near 2 hours of play I got through, is sound and seems awesome, but those two hours involved at least 25 crashes of the game for doing simple things like scrolling down a menu or clicking a menu button. Before I could even run the game I had to activate some file in the program files, just to get in. Now most of these issues would probably get fixed by patches right? Well they're done patching it and the Steam version is the latest patch. Star Ruler 2 is coming and I hope that it will be a nonbuggy version of the original, but I'm not exactly holding my breath. Do not buy this game unless you have recently won the lottery or been struck by lightning.			"

Many options and mechanics of the game are not explained anywhere. What exactly does the ""Upgrade hull"" button do? When are upgrades done if I uncheck autoupgrade? What does a upgrade intervall of ""Every 0 levels"" mean in comparison to ""Every 1 levels""? How many metal is used by an electronics fabric to produce one electronics?The game gives you many choices but they are useless if you do not know anything about their consequences...- The many crashes.You already have one fleet? Don't create a new one via the short-key, it will crash the game. Same for adding ships to a fleet if the fleet is too far away. Annoying.			"

												Just couldn't get behind it. I like action and fun. In this game you control this small tiny similar looking ships and build stuff on planets where you spend a bunch of time micromanaging inventory and all these resources and build a bunch of different things. There are like 100 different menus in the game and it is all pretty confusing. The battles are boring, just a bunch of small tiny similar looking ships shooting little ball bullets at each other. There isn't much to do besides let them auto shoot at each other. No real interesting space warfare. If you are looking for like a warcraft or starcraft in space this is not it. You basically just micromanage resources, build ships, go to planets and spend time on spreadsheets and menus, then have your forces auto fight in uninteresting battles. So basically if you don't like action but love micromanaging things and spending 2/3 of the time with confusing menus this game is for you. As all of the actual critic reviews say, steep learning curve and tons of confusing menus. But if you want to spend forever going over every menu and system and trying to learn the game, which doesn't seem that interesting, this game is for you. But not me. 4.5/10.			"

												When a game makes it a struggle enough just to chug to the end of the tutorial, you know there's a problem. I'd sooner have fun completing every tutorial in every paradox game ever made than try to do this tutorial again. It was just too boring. It taught you what felt like everything the game had to offer, and yet I still got into my first match feeling like I've learned nothing at the same time. And here's what I learned in my short time in my first match and in the tutorial of this game.+The game takes a unique spin on the RTS genre, points for bravery.+You can raise literally a fleet as large as your CPU can support. That is astounding, and really helps the combat element in this game.+/- A very unique take on planet management, one that is complicated to understand, but also sort of interesting to toy with. Every planet forms a web of resources, and can be tailored by your or an AI to a certain task.+/- Resource collection feels lacking. everything essentially starts as ore, which then gets processed into countless more complicated resources to tailor to specific production. Ore is limited on a planet, so you need to keep expanding or also begin to take advantage of asteroid fields. I've never been a fan of ""One resource"" strategies like that, especially when you then need to tailor certain planets into factories to turn that resource into a specific production part. It just seems like a needlessly complicated version of what should be something simple, and I just don't like it.-The tech tree is bad. Instead of researching specific techs, you have this strange map of generalized tech types. You can queue different ones for research, or just leave it on one type, and watch as they ""level up"". This doesn't provide you with anything new really, it just upgrades the effeciency of what you already have. To update your ship with ""new"" upgraded tech you hit the ""update"" button on the schematics, and then retrofit. You then watch as no visible change is made to the ship, but know deep down that somehow, it is better that it was. Even if it's completely unobservable.-Diplomacy is pointless and makes no sense. I can't have a peace treaty without an expiry date or it lasts the entire round? What the ♥♥♥♥? Ever hear of breaking a treaty? How declaring war nullifies treaties? I don't want a match-long peace or alliance I just want one that ends when I or my ally chooses to end it, not at the end of 1-10,000 seconds. Oh, and no normal human being counts time periods that long in seconds so what the ♥♥♥♥?-Ship design is utterly confusing/under-done/needing a complete redesign. Essentially you just drag and drop modules, hulls, engines, and etc onto a flat square that is supposed to be representing your ship. They tell you placement matters, if you put it towards the front, it will be in the front. If you overlap it with another module, you may get some bonuses. Why the hell is it apparently so complicated like that then, if I'm designing a ♥♥♥♥ing square? I don't know where things are going to pop out on an aerodynamic long-shaped ship when I'm designing a god damn square! I don't know what these ""bonuses"" i get for overlapping things are, because nothing in the game teaches you this. This is a pathetic way to go about ship design.I could go on ranting, but I'll end by saying that Star Ruler is a game you play only when you have NOTHING else to play, at best. I give this a 3/10. It has potential hidden in there, but I can't bring myself to waste my time trying to see if it ever shows itself. I certainly hope Star Ruler 2 is better than this. Because you should avoid this game like the plague unless it's on a very cheap sale, and you have literally nothing else to play.			"

												Two thumbs down on this one. The UI is nearly impenetreable and there is no tutorial at all. It just throws you in and assumes you'll be able to figure things out. The diplomacy system makes no sense and 9 times out of 10 you won't even be aware people are trying to give you ""diplomatic missions"" until you get the alert that your time is up. The system for setting up trade routes and supply runs to even out resources in your empire is so convoluted that even after a *long* time trying to figure it out I simply threw my hands in the air and gave up, usually with over half of my planets completely unable to make anything because they're missing some critical resource that, no matter how much I try, I can't seem to ship in from other worlds that have excess.The battles are basically just giant zerg rushes and frequently cause massive drops in FPS because the computer just builds up huge-massive fleets and sends them all over the place, thanks to there being no unit cap. And a player that isn't aware of the size scaling issues can very easily set the scale too large only to discover later in the game that when they *thought* they were doing well it turns out that the computer made a fleet of like 1000 super ships the size of several star systems.TLDR- The game isn't very fun, it's got a near impossible learning curve, there's no tutorials or explanations for the vast majority of in game functions and the ship designing does not pause the game, meaning every time you need to upgrade or change around ships you're wasting time that you *should* have been spending micro-managing your empire. Which, unfortunately, is required because without constant attention everything just falls apart.2 big thumbs down. If I could send a message back in time the first thing it would say are the numbers to a winning lottery, and the second thing it would say is not to waste money on this game.			"

												Yikes. This game looks like it could be great. However, I have some GLARING problems that I can't seem to overcome and haven't yet found answers to. These are gameplay basics that just seem to get glossed over as if they are obvious. Well they may be obvious to the developers, but to someone coming in from the dark, it doesn't make any sense at all!Here's my 2 main complaints: 1. The tutorial is terrible. I tried to run the tutorial and it seems to jump through time and says that I've completed tasks that it never showed me how to do! What a useless POS! So I quit the tutorial and decided to try the game on my own. 2. The menus are HORRENDOUS at describing what they do. Specifically I can colonize planets left and right, but they never build anything. The supplies they start with are insufficient to even build a metal mining sctructure which would allow me to build other structures. SO I have to make haulers (transports, why not just call them transports??!!), but they don't haul anything anywhere! The options for the haulers are crazily unhelpful. I give them commands but they never do anything. So I'm stuck with planets that don't ever progress. Forget installing governers, they just go for the first structure in their list and of course it is something that cannot be completed, so they just sit there building a space port for hundreds of years.I have tried to find answers to these problems, but there are none to be found. The ingame help only describes general game concepts, and has no mention of how to navigate menus or which options have which effects. Wikis are similarly useless.This game looks really good despite having useless diplomacy and NPCs that seem to always follow the same formula to success.Support this game a little better and consider tooltips ingame and you'll get a positive review from me. Don't try to make me read your mind to understand how the game should operate. TELL ME how the game operates. Use your words! Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs!This has been a very frustrating experience... maybe I can find some playthroughs on youtube and learn by watching others. If google is any indication, though, that information doesn't exist anywhere on youtube either.I have found a Let's Try (play) that covers my trouble with planets not building anything. I will not be changing my review yet, because it should be explained in the game or at least on the game's wikis, NOT by having to find other people playing the game on youtube and watching an entire video just to get some answers. Anyway, here's the video if you're having the same trouble I am:

												Wish I could talk about the great things that others have discussed with this game but I can't.Why? Because despite trying all sorts of troubleshooting I can't play it longer than about 5 minutes before it locks up and windows greys it out and asks me if I want to wait or close it.  If this was an Alpha I'd be understanding.  If this happened in ANY other game I'd understand.  But after experiancing it in this game I tried the demo and verifed cache and disabled shaders and nothing works.  Please fix It looks like a good game but if I'm the only one then eh, it was 50% off and we all know how hard it is to fight steam.EDIT: This game conflicts with my anti-virus.  While I highly doubt this is due to an actual virus disabling it fixed my issue.  Seriously? I'm not sure who to blame here really, though at least I have a workaround.  Game is awesome, still puzzled over why my AV fights this game so much.Based on merit alone, this is a awesome game.  Based on conflicting with an unrelated program that likely a few others have without either giving an indication of said conflict? Not so good. However to be fair I wrote a negative review on the AV website as well.			"

												A game that allows you to micromanage, and then promptly makes it as inconvenient as possible. Since micromanagement was never going to be realistic at the scales they were going for, they might as well have abstracted it out of the game.The macromanagement aspect of the game is simply a blown up version of the micromanagement, so it ends up feeling poorly done.

												The blizzard swarmed the offices of Ironclad Games Corp. Snow was common enough in Vancouver, but no one in British Columbia had quite seen a storm like this. Sheepish developers were busy prototyping a fresh reboot of ""Sins of a Solar Empire"", while loved ones called in, urging workers to stay off the road and bunker down at the office.  There were no races with defined playstyles, histories, or specific mechanics. No one had spent much time iterating anything but the most serviceable art assets, statistics, and tools for generating vast universes of orbiting planets and stars. The heroes and villains were essentially a blank page. The scope and ambition of mechanics bristled in the minds of developers, like the hail bearing down. It was this moment that ""Star Ruler"" would briefly blink into existence. Let's talk about Star Ruler. This is a game made by fans of realtime space 4x games, which looked at cheesy sci-fi, and said ""why not?"" You start off creating Snailigons, the mad race of starfarers you dreamed up, and then a random galaxy of stars to rule. You decided that while whatever lessor races were getting up to, Snailigons were perfecting production, Communism, and Hard metallurgy- from a mish mash of racial and political perks. Snailigons soon outbreed the comfy confines of Orbos III, to colonize the neighboring Orbos II, and strip-mine everything else in the Orbos System. Snailtopia would cover the stars in Orbos fashion, or that was the plan anyway. You ""found intelligent life"", or rather invaded a colony of spacefaring meatbags. Humans declared war, and sent a cute fleet of flak firing fighters. Your hardshell cruisers tore the never-ending stream of fighters apart with lasers, for about 2 years. Then they adapted with pesky ""shields"" and ""rockets"". Snailtopia would need to respond- it had to adapt. Thankfully, every ship can be micro-designed via technologies uncovered in your sprawling random tech tree; from scale, to crew size, weaponry, propulsion, tools, and defenses.Clearly, Snailigons would create one unstoppable, planet sized destroyer, scorching the offending human systems into obliv... into your care. It works right up till the discovery of a second race, which promptly rips through the SA-43 Molluscan, like butter- salty butter. Now you, Star Ruler, are managing trade, adaptive war, politics, and survival across multiple systems, and it starts to feel a little heavy. You know there are more stars to manage, and who knows what opposing intelligences lie in wait there. You probably should have made a smaller galaxy to play in, and with 3 species instead of 30 to inhabit it. You know, Snailtopia's leader had a good run, but it's time to retire.Star Ruler doesn't have the polish or intentional direction of an AAA 4x game, but it has the resources for the player to play the 4x game they want. I would recommend Star Ruler, but only with the addendum that it's an incredibly humbling endeavor, and to be sure to brush up on the tutorials. I eagerly await what Blind Mind Studios does with the upcoming Star Ruler 2. "

												Very dull. No real storyline. Gameplay can be almost completly automated. If you don't automate, everything takes too long. Don't know where this ""build ships as big as you want"" malarky is coming from. Ships have a ""scale"" setting, but don't reallly change sixe, and still have limited module spaces. An etremely drawn out game with no reward. If you win one game, you've won them all. No variation whatsoever. Not recommended.			"

												Going through the tutorial, get to planets section after the pirate battle (like so many other space games)And the tutorial is not scripted in text to what the screens that pop up do.PLANETS, that one feature in DOZENS of space empire games, have ruined the games.Sins of a Solar Empire is seemingly the only game immune to crappy tutorials.I am not going to waste 4 hours at 11pm at night trying to debug a tutorial. No wonder this has a meta of 28,Uninstall and move on, it's buggy to get started because it has a hard core install error the devs have acknowledged they don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about.hard to learn because teh tutorial is so badly written and scripted it's like the one who wrote the NPC conversation didn't know what was happening on the screen. or Vice versa			"

												Quite a boring and slow game, ships are far to small to really enjoy a good space battle but there is alot of customization, reasearch tree seemed lacking and quite simplified while other aspects seemed far to complicated, controls and camera movements were just annoying, definatly not as well made as its competitor games like Endless space. This is probably a cheaper version with less content, units, ships and custimizabillity but at a similar price to endless space. Long story short if you enjoy playing for hours and hours manging lots of little things then this game is for you. If you prefer the option of custmizabillity with a resonable match duration and cool combat scenes then play Endless space. In any case i wouldnt recommend this game when then a much better games out there at the same or even cheaper price. Definatly if they improved the combat and perhaps made solar systems etc more pleasing to the eye then it could be worth trying again.			"

												Probably the best 4X game out there, blows Sins of a Solar Empire out of the water. There's tons of customization and different equipment to use, and it uses newtonian physics in ship combat; ships have no max speed, they have max acceleration power. Combat is fast paced and brutal. Great mod support, and a good sound track as well.The only problems I have with SR is late-game micromanagement, and an enemy AI that becomes impossible to beat if you let it keep pace with you, as the AI is better at managing huge empires than players.

												This game could be mildly equated to the Dwarf Fortress of space RTS 4X games.

There is a big sense of 'what do I DO?' along with 'how do I do it?'  The tutorial and in-game help files are only so useful -- Knowing that a ship component has certain capabilities is different than knowing how it should be applied. That being said, after playing a few times I have a much better grasp of the game.

												Star Ruler is an amazing 4X game with lots of customisablity. Its noted for allowing the player to produce massive space stations, battle ships that span entire galaxies, and tools to destroy whole planetary populations, or even the whole planet. Its not the best looking game, has AI and micro management problems.. but its definently the most fun game of its type in my opinion. But that's coming from someone who doesn't really like this genre, but enjoys blowing up planets and making space stations thatare bigger than stars.This is worth a few hours of play time for anyone who likes big tech trees, big economy, and massive construction projects.

In Star Ruler the player is given the freedom to customize their ship's size and internal systems to gain an edge in combat.  While each player expands into the vastness of space they will have the opportunity to establishing colonies on planets and customize them to suit their needs.  The goal of the game is to gain control of the galaxy by fighting for control of all of the hostile  solar systems.			"

												Brilliant, if graphically lacking, game.It's an oldstyle 4x game with your standard, colonize, capture, space battle, design spaceships, research technology type setup.It borrows the multi-level technology route from games like space empires and the ship design is fairly open ended allowing for lots of types of ships.The scale of this game is massive, and everything is destructable.Don't like those neighbours?  Just make a large fleet and blow up their star.The game has a large mod following and I reccomend the Galactic armory mod, it adds a LOT to the game while keeping close to the style.Worth the money if you like strategy and have some time to get into it.

												This is an interesting little number. It's a real time strategy game set in space, akin to Masters of Orion. You can choose your galaxy type, make races with different traits, have up to thirty or so players (AI or real) in a galaxy.You can actually make your own ships to an extent. There's only a few actual models, but you can choose what weapons and systems go in them.The game's a little hard to get used to, and the camera's annoying. It's not without its flaws, but it's probably the most approachable game in the 4X genre that I've played.			"

												Some really interesting concepts in this game - having the freedom to design the ships in your fleet gives creative (though not all together administrative) minds a good chance at crafting out a workable solution in this game.Playing on the hardest difficulty setting the AI is extremely apt at expanding their empire quickly and assembling powerful fleets that race ahead in the tech tree's. I was able to counter act this by focusing on one specialization (torpedos) and creating vast amounts of small ships into disposable fleets that could assault effectively incurring huge but acceptable losses. By sacrificing the versatility and robustness of the vessels, and only supplying low fuel and ammo, you can ship fleets straight off the production line and into the fight, presenting multiple targets that simply cannot be reppelled even by the largest most powerful battleships.If I had played a game were there are only a restricted number of ship designs I would have been crushed by the more advanced and efficient empires, however being able to design ships to meet my requirements and negate my disadvantages to a maximum gives great scope. Evolution by natural selection is allowed to take full reign here and genuine specializations can mature, instead of a game purely based on resource mining and quick tech tree progression.Subsequently there are some draw backs to a game of this scale on a smaller budget - Most noticible of which is graphically there leaves alot to be desired. Secondly the huge amount of management that is required over a vast empire can be a bit restricted and becomes time consuming. Therefore this game will appeal to those who enjoy building up to huge scale battles that can be observed from a distace, and less to those who enjoy going straight into  micromanging elite units or playing the hero themselves.Fans of Homeworld, EVE, and Sins of a solar empire should take a look here. If you prefer your space games to be more like the X series, Freelancer, or Galaxy on fire - I would recommend waiting on Star Citizen to be fully released.			"

												Just Recently stumbled accross this 4X Space RTS from few years back. Here's why it's awesome:+++ Actual working 3D Space!! +++ Ships have momentum, which makes them feel very massive. Travel time is half acceleration and half deceleration. Changing direction at high speed is very slow. This pleases me to no end.++ Adjustable and pausable game speed. This really works for me as I like to ponder and micro-manage everything.++ All processes are highly automizable. This really cuts back the tedious parts of managing an expansive galactic empire.++ Very high customization. Designing ships is my favorite part of the game. + Tech research is a bit more complex than usual. Different fields have connections to other fields and researching these connections lets you discover new fields and speed up research of known fields. If I understood correctly, there's also no hard tech cap so you can never just ""complete"" science.+ Easily moddable. (I added some portraits for new alien races for my game. No hassle. (The stock ones vere quite terrible.)+/- Camera controls are are thorough and free. They are a bit unintuitive, but worth learning. Minus is for occasional buggy jamming of the edge-scroll (at least for me). Maybe it's a feature, but I haven't figured out how it forks.I have been really enjoying myself playing this game. Even so, there are some negatives:- No working orbital/gravity mechanic. No space game has this (except Kerbal), so no biggie. Ships can just sit still in space right next to a star. You can order ships to orbit planets but they need to fire engines constantly to stay in orbit.- There are no collisions. Ships can just fly into stars, planets and each other with no remorse. -- Moons are completely untouchable. You can't even click on them let alone build on them.-- There's no real difference between playing different species. Everyone is basically just humans with slightly different shapes. ""Gaian"" is the preferred type of planet for all. -- There's no real variance between planets. They all have just ""type"", ""size"" and few random traits. I'd very much prefer full detail or at least atmosphere, mass and temperature. ---The scale is horribly ridiculous. For both time and space. I'd prefer something a bit closer to realism, but this game measures time in seconds and it really takes just a few dozen of those to travel to the next star system with the basic rocket thrusters. Also the models of the ships are almost the size of planets, which are almost the size of stars and they are all practically brushing against each other in a crowded universe.  A big turn-off for my space-boner, but I can live with that consentrating on all the positives.I absolutely recommend this if you're into 4X space strategy. I haven't really tried most of the recent games of the genre so I can't tell how this compares to them, but this game reminded me of good old Space Empires, Master of Orion and Ascendancy. The atmosphere is maybe not as good in this as it is in them, but I enjoy this at least as much as I did (and do) them. There's a demo in the interwebs, if you want to try it before you buy it.			"

												Probably the best 4X game out there, blows Sins of a Solar Empire out of the water. There's tons of customization and different equipment to use, and it uses newtonian physics in ship combat; ships have no max speed, they have max acceleration power. Combat is fast paced and brutal. Great mod support, and a good sound track as well.The only problems I have with SR is late-game micromanagement, and an enemy AI that becomes impossible to beat if you let it keep pace with you, as the AI is better at managing huge empires than players.

												I've managed to play for about an hour thus far, however, the ship design is incredibly awesome.  While you can micro-manage everything in the game, I would surmise that would take quite a lot of time and energy.  Thankfully, the developers allow governors to build structures for new colonies.  The only thing you have to worry about, is which systems to colonize, which technologies to research, which ships to build and new ship blueprints.  The game's ship mechanics allow you to create ships that are as large and larger than a star.  In addition, it is possible to develop weapons and technologies that can be used to blast apart stars and planets alike.  Great game for just 5 bucks!			"

												IF you like RTS's and the X4 series style games, then this might not be a bad buy. I've enjoyed the game  (as well as getting fustrated with it took awhile to understand a good balance for economy). The concept is simple, you start off with 1 planet and you try to build an empire from there, colonizing each planet in your system then expanding to others. You can add AI or be by youself completely (there are pirates who will raid you if you aren't well defended, but i believe you can turn that setting off too). the really intersting part of this game is the fact of how you can craft your ships. You can't design the way they look, but you can add all the sub-sector parts (like power generators, bulk heads and shields) and then you can choose a scale of the ship (as small as a fight or as big as the galaxy and im serious on that look up 10m scale ship star ruler on youtube to see) if it goes on sale i'd recommend picking it up.

												This is an interesting little number. It's a real time strategy game set in space, akin to Masters of Orion. You can choose your galaxy type, make races with different traits, have up to thirty or so players (AI or real) in a galaxy.You can actually make your own ships to an extent. There's only a few actual models, but you can choose what weapons and systems go in them.The game's a little hard to get used to, and the camera's annoying. It's not without its flaws, but it's probably the most approachable game in the 4X genre that I've played.			"

												I had high expectations, but they were well met.Star Ruler is a bit overwhelming at first, but it grows on you every minute of playtime.Everything is on a massive scale.I'm gonna take my time with this one before going to the sequel.			"

												Game runs perfectly, no crashes or freezes, take some time to understand how to play but plenty of youtube videos around to help and the manual is good too. I believe this game is better than Distant Worlds Universe, much better value, better graphics and more fun. options are limitless in what you can do. Great value for money, highly recommended!			"

												Brilliant, if graphically lacking, game.It's an oldstyle 4x game with your standard, colonize, capture, space battle, design spaceships, research technology type setup.It borrows the multi-level technology route from games like space empires and the ship design is fairly open ended allowing for lots of types of ships.The scale of this game is massive, and everything is destructable.Don't like those neighbours?  Just make a large fleet and blow up their star.The game has a large mod following and I reccomend the Galactic armory mod, it adds a LOT to the game while keeping close to the style.Worth the money if you like strategy and have some time to get into it.

												For being able to destory entire solar systems, making planets startships, making planet sized starships, and being able to construct ring worlds. I give this game a thumbs up, the game is a little brutal to the first time player but a quick trip to youtube or to the forum will lead you in the write direction to creating the most badass empire/federation.

												It's a deceptively deep 4X RTS with changes in scale that have to be seen to be believed.  The game is *not* best summed up by the part where you quit building ships and just start fitting your planets with guns and engines to go on the offensive.  No, the game is best summed up by the part where that approach is obsolete and a single misclick can result in a planet - or a star! - being destroyed by an errant shot.  It's possible to make starships larger than an entire solar system in this game.			"

												This game could be mildly equated to the Dwarf Fortress of space RTS 4X games.  There are a lot of concepts here and figuring out how to make them all work can be a bit difficult because they aren't all laid out for you.  There is a big sense of 'what do I DO?' along with 'how do I do it?'  The tutorial and in-game help files are only so useful -- Knowing that a ship component has certain capabilities is different than knowing how it should be applied. That being said, after playing a few times I have a much better grasp of the game.  Ship blueprinting is IMMENSELY detailed and a lot of fun if you're someone who likes to puzzle through building them to do what you want.  The AI is kind of bad in that you can get it accept and it will often propose horrendously bad deals.  There is functional multiplayer, but the game isn't quite designed for it because of timescaling.Not bad for $5 if you dont mind the complexity.			"

												The game has a steep learning curve. By steep, it's like swimming up a waterfall. If you take some time with the game, to learn how it works, how to get started, what does what, it's a reasonably well made game. It's stable and runs well.Can't emphasize that curve enough though. You're not gonna jump into this and dominate the AI overnight, it's going to take some experience.			"

												Possibly the best game i've ever bought for 20$. Even after you beat vanilla, theres enough mods to keep your entertained with this game for years! The AI is brutal, and online is complicated to set up so it has it faults, but it's still a very solid game :3			"

												Star ruler is truly one of the best strategy games i have played in a while..... the colonisation is fun as well as the building......if you just want to build and command ships you can as you can set the AI to build your worlds for you......all the mundane tasks like telling your ships to refuel is also controled by the AI giving you more time to play around with your tech and take over the galaxy. all in all i give it a 4/5			"
