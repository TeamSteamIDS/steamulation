												Don't even bother if you have Patrician and/or Port Royale. Yes graphics are better than those but that doesn't matter when you are not even looking. This is a ""trade simulation"", not an rts, fps or something like that which requires any graphics after all.  A few cities (excluding dlc, because i don't have it), a few items to trade the game becomes nothing of a challenge after 3 hours or so.Price is damn too high also. I pre-ordered it for 40$ which i can easily say that it was the worst gaming decision i have ever made in my 18-19+ years of gaming. Maximum amount i would pay to this game after knowing what it really is is about 10$ and it is a ""maybe"".BUT if you don't have Patrician or Port Royale (Patrician 4 was better for trade i think) and have the money or this game is on sale, go for it. It is quite okay. But don't expect you will play it 2-3 hours a day for months or you will go back to it after 3-4 months. You play it for a few days, a few hours a day and game manages to bore the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.			"

												This game is a useless copy of port royal 3. As PR3 was a failed game, kalipso labs decided to make exactly the same game but in a different geography. Detailed cities have disappeared, leaving us a full detailed map where options are really simple. Families and political issues have been improved slightly but economy is now stupid. The same price is shared by many articles so a kg of fruit costs the same as a kg of oil.No complexity appears now in this game where changing the Caribbean to the Mediterranean seem to be the most impressive game. Even comodities icons are the same.No changes, no innovation, less complexity, less detailed cities, useless combat controls, and higher prices (God save steam sales) is whats i would highlight from these cheap copy of port royal.

												Well, this is simply the worst game in the honorable Patrician/Port Royale series. After being a long-time fan of the Hansa Tycoon series which were the Patrician games, I'd expect some flavour in a Venice-centered sim. Nothing but disappointment is what I found.   Pros: .Simple to play (if you like to play extremely simple games, it's a positive value)   Cons: .Economy ridiculously simple. Being a game of economic management, I see it as a major design flaw. Goods have the same standard prices all over the mediterranean; it doesn't matter where you buy them. The prices tend to stabilize as time goes by (and some occasional events like fires, etc). Offer and demand have little to do, other than on the very moment of buying/selling. Naval combat is simplistic and absurd. Yeah, I know these are ""arcade"" battles, but there was no need to implement such an inefficient interface and commands. And OMG, those annoying voices during combat...    I'm sad to see where is gone such a promising and entertaining series of games. Keep your bucks to any other game.			"

												I'm a big fan of the Kalypso titles. I played most of the economics titles with the exception of tropico which i will try someday. As for Port royale and Patrician , RoV follow the logic of the economy of Kalypso titles with enough difference to have its own title, you don't place building or expand your city size like Patrician or Port Royale. Everything takes place in the wolrd map , which is not a bad things as it saves tons of loading screens. RoV requires you not to play in '' God mode '' meaning if you scale back too much the map you will miss everything froms teachers to black market or chests floating around. With the DLC the map get a decent size, still much smaller than Port Royale but bigger than a Patrican map. In short if the others titles i mentioned pleased you in the past, RoV is for you. HOWEVER, and i must warn you all, there is a massive crash bug regarding Nvidia cards which as of July 25 2014 is not yet solver at all. Yes friends almost a year out and there is still a major crash bug unresolved with no news as of we are working on it.... If you are the kind of people getting angry at stupids bugs AVOID this game at all cost. The only thing that keep me going is my addiction to the capitalism system Kalypso titles gives us. Because of this i will not recommend this game to anyone. A TDR bug with one of the most popular 3d cards of the decade means a broken game that should not have been released.			"

												Once again, I'm left wanting a ""meh"" button instead of a thumbs up or down...This isn't so much a bad game as it is the complete stagnation of two different good series.  As someone who loved Patrician III, I can say that this game basically just copy-pastes most of the good ideas from that game, dumbed some of them down or made you arbitrarily incapable of trading trading certain goods until you unlocked them, and went piddling on ahead with them.  Like Patrician, you basically just get a boat to buy low and sell high repeatedly until you can afford to buy more boats or build a business that lets you make things directly for less price than buying them, then turning around and selling them for even more money you can use to buy more stuff to make MORE money...  This system is dumbed down compared to Patrician, with less interconnected supply lines and with prices much more strictly tied to an ""average"" price to the point where you don't need to do anything but look for whether something has two or more green bars before you buy it and only sell when it has no green bars.  To this, it adds Port Royale mechanics that make no sense in a game supposedly about the RISE of Venice.  Venice rose in the 9th Century, due to its heavy trading with the Byzantine Empire, but the game starts during the period of the fall of Venice after Constantinople was conquered.  Why focus a game on the ""rise of Venice"" on a period where they were actually declining?  Because that's when cannons were brought to Europe, and Kalypso didn't want to have to rethink their pirate combat system to work with ballistas...Additionally, enjoy such traditional Venetian activities as collecting pirate maps to search for buried treasure that totally aren't just ripped straight out of their pirate-themed Port Royale. Combat is poor, but this is pretty par for the course for naval combat.  There is almost no strategy in a battle with few units on a featureless plane and only a few attacks to choose from.  Add to this, however, that any ship you aren't manually controlling (one at a time) will flagrantly disobey your wishes, and charge headlong at the wrong enemy (no control on who it attacks) even when you want them to retreat. Further, the fire arcs are TINY, (and slightly behind your ship, so you often have to be sailing slightly away from the enemy to hit them,) and the only way to steer is to right-click in the direction you want to go, but the only way to fire is to click on the enemy... and because of that tiny fire arc, you need to constantly babysit your angle relative to the enemy while also instantly clicking on the enemy the instant the firing ring turns green.  Basically, there's no way to do it but to keep a button on the pause/slow down key, stop the game, fire, and then go back to steering whenever time is flowing.  The only reason not to auto-resolve all of this, besides the fact that auto-resolve doesn't perform boarding, (for a bonus ship to sell if you capture instead of sink,) is that the AI is so blindingly stupid and trigger happy to fire at the instant something grazes along the edge of their fire arc that you can manual-fight enemies nearly twice your weight class.The game also completely lacks even the stakes that even Patrician managed to have.  You have ""rivals"" in Rise of Venice, but they don't rival you in any meaningful way.  This isn't a 4X where territory they take is territory you are shut out of, the ""rivals"" are just other random ships with colored flags that trade and build things, occasionally getting to a good deal before you did.  Since the Patrician-style mechanics where all developments help improve economic development and ""rising tides lift all boats"" are in play, however, the existence of your rivals actually helps you, instead of hurting you.  When you can't afford to keep pumping money into expanding housing, the rivals occasionally will, and that just creates a larger market for your trading empire to profit off of.  Likewise, this isn't even a race to be doge first, those other guys are just THERE.  They hypothetically can sabotage you, but only do so if you drop relations with them, and that only happens if you sabotage them, first.   They have no personality, and there's not even any clear reason WHY these three other random yahoos are your rivals rather than any other random trader.  Well, no, it IS clear - because ""rivals"" are just slots for multiplayer players, so in singleplayer, the bots replacing rivals are there, but they have essentially no relevance to the game outside being somewhat more likely to build housing and industry. Add to this lovely quest-breaking bugs, where you can complete a quest, but still fail it because the game doesn't recognize your success until time runs out, and you've got a very frustrating experience.This is a game that should have taken tried-and-true mechanics into a new setting to make something new and interesting, but instead, it's just a Frankenstein's monster with no identity of its own since these pieces of existing games were cobbled together with no rhyme or reason.  It CAN be fun, but it's fun because of what was done better in other games. The city building and trade route management was better in the now MUCH cheaper Patrician III.  If you like the piracy and combat, you should be playing Port Royale, because your opportunities for piracy are severely limited.			"

												If you've played Patrician IV and/or Port Royale 3, this is ""the same, but different"".  Which some might find off-putting, and which I sure as heck wouldn't recommend at full price.  But I got it on a Steam sale for $6 USD, and it was a steal at that price.  It's a maritime trading game with city-building elements and a nice politics/intrigue game mechanic that fits the setting along with a nice sense of progression that's a welcome add to the series.If you're not already a fan of this genre, it's not going to change your mind, but I've been playing these games for ages and I like it.  There's not enough here to merit $30, but anything $15 or below is well worth the price.			"

												Quite a bit of negative comments for this game, though I believe largely undeserved. This is a trading/political (lite) simulator. The crux of the game is to further your personal success across a defined region. Many claim the campaign is too simple and after a few trade routes are established This may be accurate, however, the campaign is primarily a long tutorial, not desigend to be crushingly hard. The heart of the game lies in the Free Play mode through setting the world up and stacking the odds against you to begin with which gets increasingly fun, especially if you reach in to the dark corners of your mind and do some backstabbing and pillaging. It is most definitely a title built upon the foundations of the Patrician and Port Royale series, however, the steps taken to create a more fluid engine are very welcome. Seemless transitions into ports provides easier access to the game menus and provides a neat ""tilt shift"" effect to the world. If you are looking for a good trading simulator focused more on running your businesses than battling pirates Sid Meier's style, then you will fall right Rise of Venice. Highly recommended.			"

												In principle, this Game adds a very nice spin to the well known The Guild/Pirates!/Patrician/High Seas Trader/A.D.1602/Port Royal... settings. It enables you to build up a grand empire from zero up, advance to political honors and get filthy rich.Graphics: Nicely done, do their job. Nice zoom-in/zoom-out function. 8/10Sound: Not groundbreaking, but OK. 7/10Mechanics & Gameplay: One of the strong sides of the game. Nice trading system, OK combat mechanics with some tactical depth. Interface works very well after a brief learning curve. 9/10Long-term motivation: Here is the point that I found weak. After some hours the game got repetitive. I felt as if I had achieved enough money to get more or less what I wanted. Only I couldn't motivate myself to do it anymore, as it now felt pointless. In contrast to other ""endless"" building or build/fight/think games, such as the Guild, SimCity 4, X3:AP, I didn't have any goals that I badly wanted to achieve then... 4/10So, do I recommend this game? Yes, I still do! It's a well balanced, atmospheric sandbox. I would not recommend buying it at the current standard retail price, though. Wait for a sale and then grab it up for 15-30 hours of playing (or maybe more, who knows).Buy this, if you like- Port Royal- Patrician- The Guild- Pirates!and maybe- A.D. 1602/1503/1701...- X3			"

												Buy low.  Sell high.  But that's all.  Static map.  Static production locations.  Static prices (dynamically computed, but the cricumstances basically never change).  One or two kinds of random events that increase sale prices for a moment.  The most interesting part is when you can program your own trade routes, and there is a lot of configurability in how to you load/off-load to your warehouses and how you buy amd sell, but for reasons that defy the imagination, this is done via an interface that doesn't let you see a) all of your instructions for a city at once (how much was I buying here again?), b) what the other cities on the route produce or demand at the same time, or c) what the going rates are for such goods or how much of each goods are in stock at the time.  Basically, I think a real Venetian trader in 1455 with a few parchement sheets and some chalk and tablets would have had an easier time controlling his fleet.  The game is thus reduced to programming your obvious trade routes ""through a straw"" and hoping for a mission as exciting as ""Rome needs dyes"".  Oh, and there are naval battles but you'll want to automate them anyway.  Except the campaign insists that you play some of them.  So there's that.			"

I played the campaign at my own pace and after I finally accomplished my end-goal of becoming Doge, I had clocked in about sixteen hours. Not bad for such a simple game, and for the right audience could be fun and worth picking up. If you aren't a patient person or don't like simulation games this isn't for you. If you need action, this isn't for you. But if you're looking for a relaxing and casual game to play to pass the time, you might just find this worth picking up.			"

												I bought this game quite a while ago, but put it aside, as at the time I was still having too much fun with Port Royale 3. As both games share the same main gameplay principle, playing both simultanously didn't work for me. I recently started thinking about going back to Port Royale 3, but then I remembered I haven't given Rise Of Venice its rightful chance yet, so I started playing this instead. As evident by my play-time counter (almost 30 hours, as of writing this review), I got hooked very quickly, just like with Port Royale 3.Simply put, Rise Of Venice is a trading simulator with some strategy and political elements. The idea is to build your business empire by building businesses in cities, and trading the goods between them by your naval fleet. Just like in the real world, there are politics involved, as your competitors have their own agendas and interests, which hardly ever align with yours. Just like with Port Royale 3, there's a story-driven campaign, which I believe is the best way to start the game. Except in Rise Of Venice, the campaign feels much more than a mere tutorial. I've actually found myself enjoying the plot and the missions presented to me, and was disappointed to finish it. I really wanted it to go on. :)After the campaign, the game turns into a ""Free Play"", where you continue to build and maintain your empire. You still get missions, but there's no deep or interesting story behind them, as there was in the campaign.All in all, I really love this game, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes this type of games.

Unlike in P4, you don't get to plan a city, expand walls or help build a new settlement. The map is WYSIWYG.Naval battles are OK, have a nice touch with the oil and the barrels.In short: If you like P4 and want a bit less features and less depth, this game is for you. If you want a large variety, better stick to P4. I am still enjoying this game.			"

												If you are going to get any game from Kalypso, i would say avoid this. If you can get Port Royale 3 or Rise of Venice for less than $5 than get one of those, but don't expect it to be fun for long. All of their games use a very simplistic trading system, used in Patrician Series, Port Royale, Rise of Venice and Grand Ages Medieval. They unfortunately use less and less commodities and seem to shrink the map they use for every new game. The very thought of making a game that uses the entire earth, and a much larger range of history? No, because they would have to actually do some design work, instead of sending out the same game over and over again, with a new location, for $40. Again I would suggest avoiding Kalypso games altogether, unless they are extremely cheap. Don't reward their laziness, buying game retreads.			"

												10 hours playing and I needed to restart 3 time because the game is not responding.Small improvements compared with Port Royale 3 which is an exact clone of this game. The game play is repetitive a lot after a few hours playing. The map is smaller, has less ports and landmarks. Also the campaign quests are repetitive and not impressive story line. I regret that I spent $10 on the DLC because is not adding much to the game for the value. The DLC should be free for the little improvements that it offers and for the very important reason that the campaign map does not include the DLC expanded map with extra ports. There is no DLC campaign.Graphics are good and the UI is better organized with an easy to buy goods based on the amounts price difference (amounts bar snaps to the max limit / price).Why a game with so much potential failed to impress me:- Errors. Game needs restarting every 1-2 hours- My biggest disappointment is the small map with just a few ports. It feels like the game is not complete. - DLC does not have campaign storyline. - No action at all when it comes to history around Venice. Game starts with impression that building up army will get excited and you can change history but nothing changes once you have super power and you can only clean up pirates on the map for almost no reward.

												Havent been able to play this game much as it hacks and are randomly slow and sometimes to the Extreme. Not shure why, maybe because of online problems. But from what i have played, this game have no complexity or Depths, but is a game i can play for a few hours and then get bored for and forgett all about. Basic Graphics, basic gameplay and gameinstruction who makes me think this game was menth for children (Or maybe they think we are dumb). The game has a Limited map With few cities to trade from. Not that it matters how many citites there are, as they all look the same and you just dont need going far to make decent trades. However i cant seem to be much inspired to earn a hugh mass of wealth. Why do i start the game With a steamship??? Around 350 years to early for that, isnt it?			"

												Got the game of a Steam Bundle not too long ago, as a slow paced trading game I do recommend Rise of Venice however the game is too repetitive to be worth full price. Game lacks a proper tutorial or guides to be able to fully grasp essential mechanics like trade routes, spent the first 3 hours or so just trying to figure trade routes out and spent the rest min-maxing them. Politics is too simplistic and could use some work but to be honest I doubt this game will be getting a DLC or get remastered in the near future.Conclusion: It WAS a great game back in its time but there are way too many adequately priced trading games these days for RoV to be worth your money.

Another crash.Do not waste your money on this piece of .......Not even if it's 90% off.As of the 2nd of March 2014, my original note still stands.Although I have to be honest about customer support trying to do their best.But until know, the problem still exists, even supplied them with large amount of debug data.The game still crashes.As of the 24th of March 2013, my original note still stands.Nothing has been done to make this game playable.It still crashes and the only reponse I get back: Please reinstall your graphics drivers.I went to the extend to install a clean windows 7 install with only steam and rise of venice on it.Same issue.Same reponseSame Result: Not working.

												I bought this game for €20,- on a Steam sale and that's exactly what it's worth. If you've played Patrician IV you'll miss the detailed towns, but this game has a few more things to offer in return. Unfortunately naval battles is not one of those things. Apart from that I still really like this game. If you haven't played Patrician IV or Port Royale, then I think this game might be difficult at first, since the tutorial isn't great. TL;DR It's better than it's predecessors, but not worth the full price. Take it for half at it's really worth it.			"

I've got almost 300 games on steam, I've never had this problem and I've never had a dev blame thier problems on me. Simply Unacceptable!Also of note- X3 is great trading sim game, however, it's in space. I realize this is apples and oranges, but only the time period. There's hundreds of items to trade, hundreds of ships to try out, and I think around 60 different panetary systems to trade in. Just a thought.			"

YouTube™ Video: How Many Hours can You get out of Rise of Venice? 

			Views: 341		

			I'm always suspicious by people who claim that a game has an infinite amount of gameplay. I mean, if you replay a game you can replay it infinitely But we're talking about quality new experiences.		

Rise of Venice fits into a weird sub-genre of sail based economy simulator.  Rise of Venice is almost an identical clone to Partician and Port Royale.  The major difference comes down to the maps.  Rise of Venice original covers the area of the world Genoa and east while the Gold version extends to the Portuguese coast of the Mediterannian.The game is broken down into ships (convoys), businesses (production buildings), and warehouses (where you manage resources).  The game can overly overwhelm new players to the sub-genre but it comes with an excellent single player that breaks down the game.  The single player campaign can take up to 20 hours to complete while the free play will be worth another 100 hours.  Add in the Challenge Mode and you are looking at a grand total of 160 hours of gameplay in this game.Unlike previous titles the game has improved ship combat.  However, all ship combat is mouse based.For what you're paying the game is well worth your time.  It's not going to be your most favorite game in your library, but it will be one you will find yourself unable to simply quit.			"

												The combat is horrible, and provides no tutorial for it while having a completely incomprehensible controle scheme. Early on the campaign forces you to board and capture a particular enemy ship and it is absolutely game breaking for me. I like these types of games, and I liked Patrician but this system of limiting ship battles to 3 per side while the battles themselves simply being silly circles of death is also painful. I dont think I can be any more angry about these problems ruining an otherwise entertaining game.			"

												This game is just anouther example of how kalypso games are heading downhill. Port Royal 3 was just a cheap knockoff of Port Royal 2. This game is a copy of Port Royal 3 with new textures. There is NO REAL TUTORIAL aside from a few hints here and there. Towns are spaced too far apart compared to ships so that viewing the game is a sickening expiriance. Icons are horribly small compared to the map. I as of yet, have not found a way to adjust the sensitivity, and scrooling is a quest of its own. Town zones are too large for no reason, and the trading system is shotty. The most I can say for it is they have introduced a political system-- For players who want even more politics crowding thier minds. The creators have tried way to hard to pound out yet anouther game. The guality and gaming expiriance reflect the obvious lack of effort. ""Copy past Port Royal 3, add new map, make game even worse than before, and done, $25.00x, x = every sucker to buy this game""			"

												Create a trade empire in the Mediteranean during the Renaissance. I really enjoyed planning shipping routes to get the goods to where they would be worth the most, and creating enough interlocking routes so that the entire operation is automated. I went to sleep one mnight and woke up the next morning to 15 million gold. Has supply and demand characteristics that change over time to dictate what goods need to be where. The automated fleets are very effective after you experiment to understand the interface. Over all really fun game, I bought it on a whim when I had the flu and didnt want to leave the house.			"

The game is certainly prettier and die hard fans could probably name thousands of ways that the games are different but i found the games to be so similiar that i would have been really disappointed if i had paid a whole lot of money for it.Luckily i did not and if you have not played Patrician IV then there is no reason for you to care. But people who have should know about this.Now concerning the game itself. I really enjoyed my time with the game at first. The game should should be pretty easy to get into both for newcomers and old fans and it is really fun at first to travel the Mediterranean Sea buying low and selling high. Setting up trade routes, building industry and expanding your trade empire is really fun and relaxing but the game is just way too easy.You really have to try to fail at making money and after a couple of hours you should have been able to set up some trade routes which basically makes you a bunch of money without you having to do anything. There is a bunch of stuff to do in the game but it all comes down to making more money and it is often more time consuming than it is challening. Sure you can produce your own wares to increase your profit margin which means that you have to make sure that your factories have the required raw material and so on. But why would you do this more than once only to increase the profic margins that are already good enough.Sure you can try to make some more money to buy some new ships and create an extra trade convoy but you have already done this a bunch of times and the endless loop of making more money so that you can make more money gets old.I found the game lacking in having interesting stuff to spend your money on. Some people might be satisfied with simply making money so that you can make more money but i found that really boring after a while and there really was not anything there to keep my interest after that.Oh and the naval combat is crap. It controls really odd and for some strange reason the devs decided to take away the slowed down speed modes in the combat. So the combat is really fast and i thought that it turned into a hectic mess. You can also only control one ship at a time and the ai takes control of the rest. This is functional for normal sea battles but it turns into a mess when you have to sail around and try to catch a ship so that you can board it.I have probably sounded quite negative about the game but i absolutely do not dislike it. It is a charming and simple game about trade and i would recommend it to people who is looking to spend some hours doing just that. But i did not find the depth in the game to keep me interested after a couple of hours and you should probably take that into consideration when thinking about the price.			"

												I can't complain about this game. Bought it on a Steam-Sale and so far it is worth the money. I'm more an FPS/RTS/RPG player, sometimes i play a bit of Anno and Tropico. So as you see i'm not that much into those Eco-Sim games. I understand the negativ ratings, most of those players need more games with much different things in it. If you don't play such sims too often but still like them, this game is what you should start with or as i do, play it from time to time. Its light and has not much depth.I can only give it a thumbs up. I have always an overview about those few things i can do and it's not so easy for me to handel multiply trading routes (in other games you have to keep an eye on many many more things).			"

												I'm a gamer whou should be the ideal target marget for this type of game.  My many hours of 'gameplay' have been spent simply trying to get the game to function as intended by the developers.  Sadly for me the game sound stutters terribly, so the game is unbearable to play.  This is despite the fact I'm able to play all my other games without similar issue, so the hardware should not be at fault here.  This is a common cause of ffrustration for many players, and often put down to players having certain Nvidia graphics cards that are seemingly not compatible with this game (though indeed some owners of this brand can play the game OK apparently).  However, there's enough people posting similar issues to understand this is a fundamental problem for some players.  No fix has ever been forthcoming since the game release.  Avoid at all costs unless you want the risk of similar frustration.  If it's ever fixed for me, and I doubt it will be, I'll update the review to assess the game as it was intended to be played.			"

												I do and do not recommend this game. As a trade and economic simulator it is entertaining but when you try to choke out your competition by using war and espionage this game is severely lacking. Naval combat in particular is unsatisfying especially when you are trying to blockade a port to strangle trade. The biggest convoy size you are able to put together is 3 ships while the coms are not limited to this and frequently come at you with convoys of 5 ships. Granted this is to combat AI being unable to make strategies like a human player but when you are fighting over a reef which negates your ability to manouver while the AI is not hampered by the reefs. Espionage is also unsatisfying and is never a good idea to use in this game as it is only good for kicking the hornets nest inviting your enemies to all start sabotaging you back negating any possible benefit in terms of reputation gain.

												This game is absolutely amazing if you like trading games. You start really small and can grow really big by trading and even produce your own goods. Great!So first you start trading to get money. Then later you build your own production, first with goods that you buy, later you produce everything by yourself. Money money money!			"

												Kalypso isnt exactly a top drawer dev but at times they can put out some interesting work.  WIth Rise of Venice we get a beautiful looking game with some nice features.   Its fun right up until you understand that the game plays itself, it really doesnt need you.  Once you automate 2 seperate convoys you will be rolling in money and the difficulty of the game is gone.  To be blunt it feels like this game was shipped about 6 months too soon in its development cycle.  Some of the features wernt really that well thought out.  It still plays and is a fun time, just know you arent going to stick around long and will forget it quickly.			"

												This game is a mess. It was fun for a few hours, but after that is was REALLY boring. Unplayably boring. Do you know why? THE FIRST MISSION WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME AND IT WAS WAY TO HARD FOR A FIRST MISSION. You have to level up in rank but you need, like 10,000 dollars to do it and it is extremely hard to trade without losing money. I'm either a hopeless trader or missing something.The tutorial was terrible, giving barely ANY insight intohow to trade proftably. Oh, sure the first trade you make was easy, but  after that you are thrown in the deep without knowing how to play and enjoy it while making a profit and making progress!All in all, this game is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The DLC adds hardly anything, the first mission is impossible AND the tutorial offers NO help! At all! So I hate this game for this very reason. It SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												* reskin of Patrician / Port Royale* at a certain ""level"" pirates appear and you can't get rid of them* pirates are just annoying, because you can circumvent them if you escort ships, this is the same♥♥♥♥♥♥as in the previous game. I would love an option/mod to turn those ♥♥♥♥ers off.* sea battles are just annoying and NOT fun* the campaign is just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid: 1) you must have a sea battle and cap an enemy ship 2) there is a follow-up mission to reach a certain rank, I had that one, next mission automatically starts to buy wine from port X (which you need to bribe in) in a certain amount of time. I couldn't make it, campaign lost. Furthermore, the ♥♥♥♥ing counter in Venice counted down even though I brought wine from another city... so the counter was misleading (BUG)I am glad that I bought it on sale.0 innovation and 0 willingness to remove to allow to turn off those ♥♥♥♥ing pirates.

												This is a really fun game. It's similar to Civilization in its ease of play and depth of strategy. Like Civ I can't stop playing it. It's really fun. I don't like RTS or strictly turn base; this a hybrid of both. You can change the game speed and don't feel rushed like RTS. I like Civ, Banished, Axis and Allies, and Sim City. If you like these games, you'll like this.			"

												Overly simplified economy, for an economy game that about says it all. You ships look like little RC sailboats as the speed around the Mediterranean leaving huge wakes behind them.  Just plain weird naval combat. If the economy was any good all of this could be overlooked. Basically plays like a mobile game (yes it’s that simplified).			"

												Bought it on sale. I was having some fun and then I tried to make a trade route. At that point I saw this wouldn't be a game for me. The system for doing that is just awful and convoluted. Given that automating trade routes is one of the fun parts of such games this is a deal breaker for me. Overall very shallow. If you've played games like this before than you will see everything this game has to offer really quickly. Seems very basic with little that keeps you engaged. If you've played Patrician 3 imagine someone tried to create something similar for the average twelve year old and then got drunk when they made the trade route controls. That said the naval combat while not great is perhaps an improvement on some other similar games. So that could be what you're looking for though it is still not great.4/10 at best			"

												Unfortunately, this is really the only game that scratches that ""Trading"" itch at the momentFirstly, the PROS vs Port Royale (Which I believe is the only other real trading game, although Recettear was good too)* There is no longer a loading screen when entering every city* Certain areas of the map will now be 'hubs' for certain goods, even on random goods (Eg- Spices only from the middle east)But the CONS* Biggest one is that your control over auto trading has been DRASTICALLY reduced from Port Royale to the point where autotraders often no longer make a profit (You cant set the game to load from a warehouse and sell down to a specific price anymore. It has to be either warehouse activity only or city activity only. There is a 'captain' option which allows this, but is an AI automanage system resulting in the AI selling down to the price of production... meaning no profits) - only option then is to micromanage...*The new ""Rival"" system, although holding promise is not well executed. The AI receives huge upgrade bonuses and are not a challenge economically wise*The senate system (pleasing each family) is a burden and the sabotage system isnt fun, rather they are frustrating (Senate members are fine with sabotaging and stealing each others goods and cities, but when the player goes privateering, everyone hates you!)Port Royale was much better and had a MUCH bigger map.The campaign can be finished in around 8-10 hoursWith just a few hours the game can be ""completed"" (Supplying every city with all the goods they need)			"
