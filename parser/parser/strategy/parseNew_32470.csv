A decent game made great by its space battles and player modsPlenty of bang for your buck, with three campaigns, about a dozen turn-based conquest modes, and classic skirmish battles. However, if you're an experienced RTS fan, you might find the ground battles lacking. The unit controls are imprecise, the balance questionable, and the pop limit placed painfully low. That said, the space battles are magnificent. Each class of ship has its place, and the pop limit gives you far more breathing room. The game just shines here.And when vanilla bores you, check out some of the mods on moddb. I personally recommend the Revenge of Thrawn and Republic at War projects, both of which introduce a plethora of new units familiar to longtime Star Wars fans.			"

												I have only played this game for a little while after buying it, and I can say that it is good. Though, there are a couple downsides to it. Heres a list of Pros and Cons.Pros:-Game is fun, and plenty of strategies to experiment with.-Moding community is amazing.-Really is worth the money, with the free ""Force of Corruption"" Expantion.-3 factions to experiment and play with.-Real ships and vehicles from the movies (Including a couple that aren't).-Balancing is great, depends how you look on it though.-Maps that you can re-inact your favorite battles with.-You can build the Deathstar. 'Nuff said.Cons:-Gameplay is fairly limited.-Units are fairly limited.-Ground Battles aren't exactly bad, but they aren't great either.-Multiplayer servers shut down. (You can download third party programs to get multiplayer, though I havn't tried this yet).-No workshop. (Mod installing isn't as easy as it could be).So, these are my thoughts on this game. Buy it, it's definently worth it. I may edit this if I find anything in the future. "

												It's an amazing game a must have for every Star Wars fan, the space battles are the best thing ever, you can send a lot of ships to the enemy and at higher difficulties you can get awesome space battles, the land battles can be slower and boring like hunting a single unit for the whole planet, but still you can use AT-ATs to crush your enemy or send Darth Vader to kill every single being on the planet, or if you want something more evil, you can just blow up the planet with the Death Star, onto the replay value if you finish the 3 campaings you'll still get a Galactic Conquest mode with all of the units from the campaing and more, if that's not enough you can use a lot of awesome mods, i'll recommend the Galaxy Divided mod, with even more ships from the expanded universe, bigger unit caps, and the biggest ships ever, get this game and enjoy one of the best games on the Star Wars history.

												If you like Star Wars, buy it. If you like sci-fi stragedy games, buy it. If you like killing every rebel scum you come across with the combined power of the death star 2 and a SUPER star destroyer with an unfair amount of bombers at your command, BUY THE SH*T OUT OF IT. This is the best rebel scum killing simulator since Star Wars Galaxies. Even if you aren't good at stradegy games play easy as the empire and you will have the most fun you ever had killing rebel scum like anoying cockroaches mildly annoying your empire of unstoppable stardestroyers and at-ats. You can even take control of an entire planet using only stormtroopers and patrol frigates.			"

												I've spent so many hours playing this game. First impressions were pretty mediocre, but once I got into it the pay off was great. Definitely satisfying sweeping the galaxy clean of imperials or rebels in whichever strategy you like. I'm at a point in my gaming career where I've stoppped caring about graphics as an integral part of a game (if it doesn't need to be to get a point across i.e. a horror game with specific shadowing etc.) so I easily look past the simplicity of Empire at War and just enjoy listening to a podcast or two in the background while I manage and conquer. Good times.			"

												Star Wars: Empire at War is a real-time strategy game from Petroglyph and published by LucasArts, the best strategy game in Star Wars franchise. Gold Pack also include the expansion pack Star Wars: Empire at War - Forces of Corruption in one package.Star Wars: Empire at War takes place before and to the event of Episode IV, to the Battle of Yavin, while the expansion pack, Star Wars: Empire at War - Forces of Corruption follows the underworld faction Tyber Zann with the Zann Consortium.Star Wars: Empire at War gameplay is more like map conquest called galaxy conquest since this is the Star Wars galaxy, you start on a galactic map, establishes bases on planets like Coruscant, Tatooine or Naboo, build up armies and galactic fleet, then engage in space or ground battles on map in real epic battles. You get to command the Star Destroyer fleet with the Galactic Empire or squadrons of X-wing with the Rebel Alliance. This game can entertain you for many hours.While Star Wars: Empire at War has great gameplay, the graphics are somewhat, inadequate for me. Kind of like, ugly, but at least has some detail. The effect are not that great too, except for the Death Star. The performance are great nevertheless.The one of many greatest thing about this game is that there are many mods out there making this game even more interesting and fun, like Republic at War or Thrawn Revenge, try them.The downside of this game is with the expansion pack, Star Wars: Empire at War - Forces of Corruption, it still have many minor bugs that left unfixed. Although the bugs won't hinder your gameplay at all, but it is somewhat annoying.Very addicting game Star Wars: Empire at War is for strategy fans, you get to fight twice to capture a planet, a space battle and planetary battle. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												Played this game maybe 80 hours on the old retail DVD and it has not aged a day in my eyes.  Game is a spiritual successor to Rebellion which in turn was a time sink i played in the 90's more than i care to admit. It was a awesome space strategy set in the star wars universe and it was deeply addictive and awesome in every way because it used the SW license to the max. And this game? Same but it goes even further and UI is now much better. More units, a proper space and land combat system, ships and races you wont be seeing in the movies much but will find in the SW lore and comics. Don't be afraid of the aging graphics. you won't be watching the ship details up close in space combat anyway. Detail level on planets is pretty good. nothing to be ashamed of much when compared to modern RTS games.  Game engine is solid and fun factor is very high.  Battles are simplified and will not satisfy more hardcore RTS audiences but as stated the fun factor is high and learning curve is low. It will not take long before you are laying out complex conquest plans on the galactic map.  DLC pack adds a new Zann Consortium faction to play. This faction is the only thing i don't quite like as it's so different from the base Empire and Rebellion factions. It is obvious it has been designed from the scratch to be as different as possible so how does that blend in well with the classic factions? Badly it seems. Certain units are OP when spammed and countering these OP units can be tricky which in my opinion breaks the beautifully simple paper-rock-scissors type of fighting that takes place between the two classic factions. 9/10 anyway. Grab it. Game is still worth it's price even today.			"

												Ahhh the memories...I remember this game before it had the expansion, and I remember the funny, glitchy things which as a young kid I did not care about. After the expansion, I remember putting hours into trying to beat the campaign (I was about 10-12 years old), and havinig to reload from the last save on some of the hardest missions ever(many I still remember). I recently bought this game, and, amidst the nostalgia, had tons of fun. My only drawback was I could not get multiplayer to work, and skirmishes get a little boring after a time. Besides a few imbalances (corrouption in galctic conquest, Garm Bel Iblis, etc...) the game is very enjorable. If you have not played it, get it, If you remember playing it, get it. Probably one of the best RTS games I have played.			"

												I played the original disc version of this game before getting it again on steam.Despite its age I still think this is the best star wars RTS to date. It has everything from the original films and is a bit like playing with virtual star wars toys. You get land and space combat so the best of both worlds really. Warning though as this game will soak up many hours of your time. You get some awesome moments such as launching an AT-AT attack and then using the death star to destroy a planet. There is also a larger galatic strategy to the game where you control planets and what is built on them.   It adds further depth to the game so its not just about RTS. In the land battles you sometimes get to control one of the iconic heroes / villians which is a whole lot of fun if you come up against an opponents opposite.If you are a die hard star wars fan and love RTS then you cannot go wrong with this game. 10/10			"

												As of June or some other month in 2015, or maybe 2014, whenever GameSpy shut down, this game NO LONGER has multiplayer. In order to play with your buddies you will have to download and install a program such as Evolve or Tunngle, in order to play online over LAN. Star Wars Empire at War is a strategy game. Unlike some strategies, Empire at War is very basic. With little micro management, and a small unit cap. This makes it great for those new to the genre, who are looking to get into it. The gameplay is in real-time. Meaning it is actually fun, unlike turn-based titles. There are two types of battles: space, and land. In space battles you have a space station, which you can upgrade. Through this station, you build new units and buy upgrades for them, unlocking more units and upgrades as you upgrade the station. You must destroy the enemy's station to win. The land battles put you on a planet in the Star Wars universe. You have a base with multiple buildings, each one allowing you to buy different units/upgrades. As with the space station, you can upgrade your central command building to unlock more advanced technology. You must destroy the enemy's base to win. With both battle types, you can change the win conditions. So instead of just having to destroy their base, you have to wipe them out completely, etc. The Gold Pack comes with both the original Empire at War, and the Forces of Corruption expansion pack. Unfortunately Forces of Corruption has some balance issues, but the game is still extremely fun. The original game allows you to play as either the Empire or the Rebellion. It has it's own campaign, which is around 5 hours or so in length. But as with most strategy games, the campaign is more of a slow tutorial to prepare you for multiplayer. Forces of Corruption adds a new campaign, and also allows you to play as the Consortium. Which adds new units, upgrades, abilities, and requires you to change your strategy in certain ways. The multiplayer still has a very active, but very small, community. If you do plan to get the game, be sure to switch your location to the US in the options, otherwise you will see few, if any, matches. Empire at War is an excellent RTS, and definitely one to consider getting whether you are a veteran of the genre, or have never played one before.			"

												Star Wars: Empire at War puts you straight into the centre of galactic war in real time strategy fashion. Depicting the struggle of the Rebels, the Empire, and the Zann Consortium. The game is loosely set between the events of Episode III and Episode IV in Star Wars.Players have three campaigns to choose from. The Rebels campaign that takes them across the galaxy to stop the Empire’s advance and stop their new super weapon. The Empires campaign works closely with Darth Vader himself as he tries to crush the remaining Rebel forces, complete the Death Star construction and prevent the leaked plans getting in front of the Rebel leaders. lastly the Zann Consortium campaign where you seek to spread your corruption across the galaxy and earn vast riches along the way. All campaigns are very well written and while linear, they offer a few side missions to add some extra life to the campaign experience.In addition to those story driven campaigns, players can also take on the entire galaxy in the galactic conquest mode where players can play as the Rebels, the Empire or the Zann Consortium as they try to achieve particular objectives. There are a number of grand strategy elements present in these modes as you manage funds from the planets under your control and use those funds to improve your troops, research technology and more to get a leg up on the opposing forces. Also you can battle it out in shorter battles in the skirmish mode. Regardless of which you choose to get the Star Wars strategy experience from you’ll find a good mixture of vehicle, infantry and even spacecraft battles to enjoy.With plenty of Star Wars references and characters littered throughout the game, it’s a strategy experience that will definitely resonate with Star Wars fans more than anyone else. Star Wars fan or not though the strategy experience is worth playing with real time and grand strategy fans both catered for.			"

												Star Wars Empire At War Gold is a super fun RTS game. It allows you to take control of either the Empire or the Rebellion (Also a faction called the Zann Consortium in the forces of corruption). They both play uniquely, and differ majorly on tech, the rebellion stealing tech from the empire, and the Empire making their own. You fight for control, sending fleets of starships into battle over planets, before launching seperate ground forces to completely conquer the planet. The gameplay is good, easy to control units and good user interface for anyone just coming into the genre. The Forces of corruption is a good addition to the game, allowing you to corrupt planets as well as take them over, giving you access to lots of nefarious things, even allowing you to enslave certain races, using them for cheap soldiers. The game is very good, and I give it a 8/10.			"

												SW: Empire at War + Forces of Corruption is basically the real time Total War version of Star Wars RTSs, boasting a feather-weight empire management overworld, where you will construct buildings that produce your Ships/troops on your planets, and send heroes/agents around to assassinate bothersome enemy heroes and play wack-a-mole with Zann Consortium corruption, before getting into space and ground combat to wrestle control of a planet from the AI's grubby mits.The Space Combat is where the game shines, even though the game has some annoying AI problems for their units, most of them can be ignored as they are minor and can be solved by just telling the ship to stop with the stop button on the command bar, or by just droping the SSD ontop of the enemy base before you bring in the rest of the fleet. And if/when you get mad, just start bringing the Death Star, an Interdictor and tie scouts with your ""blob of death"" and blow up their space station and have them commit suicide by attacking your wall of Star Destroyers and Ties head on.The ground combat while servicable is nothing spectacular and you can often spend minutes chasing that last remaining unit of rebel soldiers, and that is when you aren't getting constantly attacked by Jedi heroes and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mobile fortress hero that all can infiltrate your planets with enough firepower to single-handedly beat off the Empire at Hoth. But very little can beat the coolness of commanding Veers and  a pack of AT-ATS, supported by airstrikes and planetary bombardment as they smash their way through an fortified rebel planet where even the natives wants to fight you.Now, the multiplayer is dead out of the box for the game, but if you can stand gameranger and can get it to work properly, then you might even get a couple of good MP games out of it too, just be prepared to get stomped by someone who has probably played the game since it came out back in the Bronze age.It is worth mentioning that the game still has a quite good, active and helpfull modding community that has produced everything from simple rebalance mods to humongus mods that are bigger than the base game.If you want purely a good Star Wars ground RTS go and buy Battlegrounds Saga, if you want a more comprehensive Empire management Star Wars game, go buy rebellion. If you however want the best(and possibly only) game where you control the Empire/Rebels on a galactic scale, while also controlling the space and ground battles yourself, then this is the game for you.

												Hands down one of the best Star Wars RTS games to date. The space battles are truly epic (ground battles are okay) and the game looks great on max detail. While the vanilla version makes this game outdated and not worth the purchase, this game has tons of great mods that make it worth to play it even today! If you like RTS games and like Star Wars, Empire at War (with mods!) is a must have game.

												Im not a real big RTS fan but being a Star Wars Fan i thought i would give this a go !! I remember playing this years back.I think this game has one of the best tutorials i have ever seen in a RTS game hands down.Even though this game is old it still holds up to most of the RTS games of today,even though like i said not a fan of this genre ;) I think one of the coolest things in this game is the Cinamatic View button during battles.So if i think this game is real good and im not really into RTS games, i think any RTS fan would love this game 100% Star Wars or not !!

												Hello! I have played this game alot and have enjoyed it severly! But that won't get you to buy it, will it cause everyone has their own tastes! Pros-Long gameplay, a single galactic conquest could take a couple days with breaks in between.Multiplayer, since the shutdown of gamespy it's been difficult to play multiplayer but with programs like gameranger you still can and it is VERY enjoyable.Battles, the battles are VERY fun but can sometimes get repetitive but thanks to the still active modding community and the DLC, this problem is solved.The tactics and strategy aspect, I, personally, am in LOVE with strategy and tactics and this game is full of it. A corvette cant beat a star destroyer head on but put that corvette in a ambush like position and it might stand a chance!Star Wars, must I really explain this part?The unpaid DLC, the DLC is very enjoyable with new units and a new side. Insteading of running around with stormtroopers why not run around with stormtroopers AND giant robots!ConsRepeat, this game can get very boring since the gameplay is limited to half a dozen land and space units on each side so it gets boring. But thanks to modding and the DLC it can be fixed.Modding on steam, its a bit annoying when installing mods on steam because you have to download the mod and find the steam folder and install it there them mess around the launch options. The community(including myself) has been BEGGING for a workshop integration for the game but there has been no luck...The campaigns,The campaigns are a bit frustrating and boring and the story is trippy.Unit size, the units are not realistic with its actual canon size. Boba Fett is half as large as an AT-ST, no matter how awesome you think he is.However the cons are solvable with modding and the game itself is VERY  fun! I definitly recomend this to star wars fans and RTS fans!			"

												Playing this game as the Empire makes me realize how utterly impossible the Rebellion could ever win in the original Trilogy if the Empire were using proper strategies. As soon as the Death Star II was constructed, it started blowing up every outer rim planets, space stations, any capital ships (If that stupid idioitd Ackbar put his big♥♥♥♥♥♥ship in the fight, he will be the first to get blownn up before he realized that he's in a trap). By the time the 5th planet was destroyed. I cannot fathom how these stupid rebels can still have the will to fight, they have become ""the problem"", every planets they planted their bases were blown up, Realistically, any planets will quickly reject these stupid rebels and their hopeless cause, else they risk being annihilated. But since this is a game, the Rebels, in their blind persuit to restore their stupid and flawed as ♥♥♥♥ed ""Republic"" kept retreating into other outer planets (they didnt even have the balls to take one of the core worlds), this resulted in every outer rim planets being annihilated down to the last planet...and that ONE planet they retreated was ironicially..Korriban, the birth place of the original sith pure-blood.The Emperor did not wish to destroy this once sacred world, simply ordered the alternative. Every fleet, every military units in every star system in the galaxy were ordered to travel above the orbit of Korriban to show these pathetic rebels who couldn't learn to just get along and admit that the Empire is the new order who actually brought peace, that their cause was a delusion long lost.Mon Mothma, along with the rest of the remaining rebel heroes and ONLY a single platoon of infantry left (Everyone else had pretty much died or abandoned them) watched the sky as over 70 star destroyers, more than hundreds of AT-AT, AT-ST, Artilleries, thousands of stormtroopers assaulted their last base (Which now cosists of only a barracks and a light factory).Luke, Obi-Wan and Yoda died in a fight against his royal majesty the Emperor himself, Lord Vader and Boba Fett. The traitors such as Han were being demolished by Colonel Veers's army. Chewiee tried to hijack something but died to TIE-Bomber bombardment, wookies don't win this one.Finally, Mon Mothma was humiliated when the Emperor added the final insult to injury by ordering a single dismounted Scout Trooper to shoot the barracks she hid inside until it exploded. Finally causing the end to this stupid pointless rebellion that caused over 30 worlds to disappear from the galaxy map when they could have just surrendered ages ago.While all this happened, Tyber Zann's plan was ultimately foiled because Ryloth, the planet he was on, was thought to be a Rebel world and got blown up along with the planet, the Consortium died long before they even ever got their first capital ship built (Palpatine was getting annoyed these rebels wouldn't give up so he simply ordered the Death Star II to just flew randomly to any non-imperial controlled worlds until the entire galaxy is marked blue)10/10, would rewrite Star Wars history again for lulz			"

												This is my favorite RTS of all time. Probably because I've never played C&C but anyways this is a very simple RTS but a very fun RTS too. First, there are the Space battles which are pretty fun and can be super epic. Then there's the land battles which are pretty slow and boring, there are some cool moments that can happen but you will most likely auto-resolve. There are 3 campaigns, Many Galactic Conquest modes, and Skirmish battles. Galactic Conquest is what I think is the best mode because you can conquer more planets and choose your approach. Campaign is a simple Star Wars story and teaches you how to play the game. Skirmish battles are land/space battles where you destroy the enemy base. Unfortunatly the game's multiplayer no longer works but you can play regular Empire at War (No Forces of Corruption because Steam counts it as DLC.) with Gameranger.What I do suggest if you get bored is that you download some mods. Some of my favorites are Republic at War, Thrawn's Revenge, and Super Star Wars: Rise of the Droid Empire. I give this game a 9/10 but I say get this game on the May 4th sale because thats the only time I've seen it on sale			"

While the rebels, I didn't do that good of a job apaprently though, Yavin IV got blown up because I was too slow unlike in the films. I immediately destroyed the Death Star after that and still ""saved the galaxy"". As the empire, I just blew up all planets with the Death Star, easy.

												Clunky glitchy, god awful. I Have 550 hours on this game. maybe a hundred of those were me being too tired to shut down the game properly at 4am and just letting it idle.No other rts has given me this experience. The defence on multiple fronts, the ever pressing need for better weapons, the heartbreak that fills me when one of my capital ships detonate, all hands lost. it is just amazing. ive played maybe a half a dozen mods, conquered the galaxy repeatedly using various factions. its all just so darn good.if you are an rts nut, this game is a must. if you are a casual player who wants something they can come back to and play this is a must. if you enjoy the modding scene, this is a must.Tips: don't auto resolve with ships in orbit, tech up before going on the offensive, build mines only on planets with a 50 or higher base income, and set a timer so you dont accidently play all night.MODS: most mods can be installed by creating a mods folder in ypur corruption folder, and then click and dragging the mod you downloaded into the mods folder. took a few tries but i got it down, some mods are weird, but not usually worth the extra effort. uninstall mod by clicking and dragging the file out of the folder. i just saved mod authors like 60 comments with that i swear to god. MODS, as witnessed by moiRepublic At War (RAW) while well polished visually, it is horribly unbalanced. republic easy campaign is 20 hours at the least. Cis Hard campaign was 8. i kid you not this mod is not finished balance wise.Clone wars mod is like the 2008 series. crashes occasionally, but better than RAWClone wars sub-mod has great Land combat just like the 2003 cartoon, but space battles are meh.Thrawns Revenge is pretty epic and very unique. exact opposite of RAW really. Very well balanced, but the visuals are not as good. granted unlike RAW this game isnt advertised as finished and gets a new beta in febuary of 2017Rise of the mandalorians is both interesting, stable, and Pretty to look at. also has the BEST turrets on ships unlike in vanilla and many other mods (again, RAW) Awakening of the rebellion seems like a dumpster, it has so much content from so many creators that it lacks stability. also has an annoying change to the way the camera works in space that ruins the top down atmosphere. overwrites your data folder for vanilla, thus requiring  a load of fiddling to uninstall.Ultimate Corruption feels like an expansion. it balances ship strength and fighter complement by class (light cruiser, cruiser, heavy cruiser, battlecruiser) allowing for you to pick and choose what you like. adds loads of new ships, makes stations awesome, and utterly destroys x wings. in closing, this game is ok vanilla, but fan made content shines it to a gleam.worth full price.10/10 would sink more hours into this than your average college course.

												Luke, did I ever tell you these were your father's droids? We went on wild adventures together for over 3 years in the Clone Wars, and the little one even saved me from a swarm of buzz droids, yet I somehow don't recognize them anymore. They were good friends.Luke, did I ever tell you that while your father was training on Coruscant, C-3PO served your family (Uncle Owen, Aunt Beru, Grandma Shmi, Grandpa Cliegg) for nearly 10 years? Somehow, your uncle didn't recognize Threepio when he returned to family's service.Hey Luke, did I ever tell you that all Jedi used to dress like homeless moisture farmers the same as I do, despite that still dressing like a Jedi is no good way to hide from Empire? It was a good robe though.Come here, Luke, today we will be training with this practice droid while you wear this helmet to blindfold yourself. You would think this was an impromptu training procedure, but no, we did this to younglings all the time and even built them special mini helmets. Right now you are literally worse than a child, Luke, like the ones your father killed with that lightsaber you are holding. He was a good friend.You must go to Dagobah, Luke, and seek out Yoda, the Jedi Master who trained me — well, actually, he's A Jedi Master who trained me. Before I moved up to Liam Neeson's service, I was one of the 20 younglings who went to Yoda's class every tuesday and thursday back in youngling school inbetween Jedi chemistry class and lunchtime. Nothing remarkable or mystic to our relationship at all. He was just my teacher who handed out droids and youngling-sized helmets to the class. Also, all his deep seemingly spur of the moment lessons and teachings from a true master are all fairly common Jedi sayings that he just butchers with his ghetto way of talking. A good friend, he was.			"

												Star Wars fans will buy this anyway, because there is no other good strategy game from the universe. You might consider it even if you are not fan, the planetary turn-based-like strategic map is simple but unique in its mechanics. Graphics are not superb in this day and age and battles on planets are rather dull most of the time. But where the game excells are battles above planets, with spaceship. It has always been intriguing to see the fight between Calamari warships and Star destroyers and now you can experience it too, which I like a great deal.			"

												Star Wars Empire at War is a gem, perfect for those who are looking for a slow but entertaining real time strategy game that takes place in the Star Wars universe.Pros:-Challenging.-Includes a fun story mode and missions that are separate from the story.-Moddable.-Active Community.-Many locations from the movies and new places to invade.-Forces of Corruption is an expansion that adds a lot more content.-Famous heroes can be controlled, including Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, and Han Solo.-Battle Camera can allow players view battles in a way seen in the movies.-The game can be replayed a ton due to Galactic Conquest and Skirmish.Cons:-The game can get repetitive without any modifications.-Without Workshop, modding can become difficult.-The artificial intelligence is not the best, sure you can be out-smarted by them in your first game but you will learn and there will be no way to lose.-Ground battles can be annoying, especially when you kill everything but one person is hiding somewhere.9.8/10Star Wars Empire at War is nearly perfect and the game is one of the games a true fan of Star Wars must play.

												Still playing - Worth the $30 I paid for this; The MODS (on Moddb.com) for this game makes you want to play, play, play, PLAY (I have mods to be more accurate like the actual Star Wars film and these units look crisp, very excellent, and adds about 4,500 new units like the Executor Ship, Death Star II, Eclipse class destroyer, etc. (with the mods I downloaded in moddb.com) "

												Short Version: Get it at full price or on sale, worth it either way. Endlessly entertaining, tons of well-made mods.Star Wars Empire at War is one of my favorite games of all time and an incredibly fun RTS. I've been playing it for around 8 or 9 years now (most of that was a physical disc) and it has *never* become boring. It has very good balancing with a rock-paper-scissors strength/weakness system, and the strategic elements aren't too simplistic yet aren't as in-depth as, say, Sins of a Solar Empire. In the base game you play as the Empire and the Rebels, and in the Forces of Corruption expansion (which is what I'll be talking about during this review) you get the added Zann Consortium. They all have the gameplay styles and strengths as you'd expect from the movies. Empire is very straightforward in their attacks, can produce massive ships and use their superior technology to crush their opponents. The Rebels are more cautious and use methods like stealing technology from the Empire and relying on fighter support more than huge battleships. The Consortium is essentially the Rebel's stealing mechanic amplified, with systems like bribing and actively stealing money. All are fun to play as- it's satisfying to send a Super Star Destroyer into a weak Rebel base and dominate them, beat a seemingly-unstoppable Empire with a few squadrons of well-coordinated Y-Wing and X-Wing strikes, and to cripple powerful factions through espionage.The battles themselves are entertaining. Even if the same general scenario has played out before, it's still captivating to watch the ships on-screen battle and blow up system after system until one explodes and falls towards the nearby planet. Personally I think the space battles are MUCH better than ground battles. I usually have the game auto-resolve ground battles, but they are still enjoyable nonetheless. Oh, also, mods. The mods for this game are absolutely incredible, and if for whatever reason the base game doesn't satisfy you enough, perhaps the mods will. Want to add campaigns based off of the Thrawn Trilogy and play as factions like the New Republic, Pentastar Alignment, or the Empire of the Hand? Want to fight through the Vong War, and all the other awesome EU events that happened post-Return of the Jedi? (Or, sorry, our overlord Disney says those aren't canon anymore. But let's pretend they still are.) Get Thrawn's Revenge. Want to COMPLETELY convert the game from the Galactic Civil War to the Clone Wars? Get Republic at War. Want the same thing but you're not that good at strategy games and don't want to be brutalized by AI Opponents? (That would be me) Get The Clone Wars mod. In conclusion, just buy it. You won't regret it. And if you're that /one guy/ who DOES regret it and thinks that Disney's EU is better than the old EU, you can use that handy refund button.11/10 would destroy every planet with death star again			"

												First, I'm gonna start with the pros:- No lack of content, you could play this for hour at a time.- Compatable with Windows 10.- The campaigns are very entertaining and interesting to follow.- You could always try a quick skirmish battle from the home screen if you're short on time.- The 'Forces of Corruption' pack has a really good EU story, it's also fun to play as a team other than the empire or rebellion in a GCW Star Wars game.- Very little lag.- Very few glitches.- You actually look at what your/the enemy's troops are good/weak against and use that information to win the battle instead of just aimlsessy making them all charge like hooligans.- ADAPT, ADAPT, ADAPT!- Snowspeeders are fun.- AT-ATs are even more fun.Now for the cons:- It's not fun  going against a snowspeeder or AT-AT when you don't have the opposite.- Not the best graphics, for those who care about it.- Units may sometimes be unresponsive, especially in space.- Special abilities don't always work.- It's sometimes hard to go from right click for move/attack to left click for the special ability.- Money is very rarely a challenge.- WHAT?! 4 SHOTS FOR A BLOOMIN' KILL FOR ONE PERSON, WHAT IS THIS?!- Some beginners may find easy mode feeling medium or hard (EDIT: The first few missions are normally quite hard, the rest rather easy).- Auto resolve is pretty harsh and unbalanced.- Most of the times that I tried out the Death Star it crashed (luckily it works for the campaign).Overall, it's a very good game with its cons being rather minor. The content has kept me up for days  yet I'm still going. It is very addictive and it's hard to just leave among all your other ditched games. It also is probably one of the very few games that is actually tactical, making you adapt to certain situations. 9/10.			"

												Star Wars Empire at War combines a great combination of ground and space combat which not only looks great but also plays well.The game works around the idea of a galactic map with planets that you control. these create a general map that you have to conquer, each planet can change control to whoever conquers it and has two levels of defence that you can have.Ground defence allows you to have fight in traditional RTS ways where you have to eliminate the hostile forces to capture the planet  or stop an invasion force.Space combat allows you to bring large or small ships into combat using RTS gameplay, this creates great combat and gives you the oportunity to play as you want. there can also be a space station and defences that you can build / destroy making space combat vary in each fight.the game in general is good fun for anyone who likes RTS games with a unique take on the genre. i find that it is enjoyable and the game has its own fan made expansion which completely overhauls the game and changes the empire and rebels to republic and federation. This allows for an entirely new type of gameplay as the new units have far more weapon spots and units which makes your screen light up with turbo lasers.the expansion however can run a bit slugish if you go insane and spam battledroids as the game tanks and doesnt run too well.in general i would say if you like RTS conquest games then give this a shot, its pretty cheap now and the free expansion Republic at War allows for a near whole new game.

												This game is the perfect game for any starwars fan! The modding community has allowed many adaptions to allow republic versus CIS and many, many more modes and maps. If anything I think the game is too short, I also think the AI needs to be harder for more intense game play. The models for the base game and even the models for mods are fantastic. The varying  units for each side are brilliant and really show the difference between factions. Even after playing the base game there are many tutorials to install new mods to allow new and exciting gameplay. When it comes to the forces of corruption aspect of the game I think it is an exelent new story for the galaxy. Being able to experience the way Zanns plans unvail and experience first hand the Wrath of the empire is incredible. Again all the game really would need is a harder AI for ""Hard"" or just a new difficulty level. In conclusion I would deffinetly recommend this game to star wars fans and even strategy game fans. C:And now to Forces of corruption, in general I quite enjoyed the campaign but it was kinda short in my opinion. On galactic conquest ""Equal Footing"" playing as the empire is quite hard, even on easy. I build the second death star and Darth Vaders flagship the executor. The Zann band of pirates controlled a small fleet and a handful of planets. I moved my main fleet to Kuat to build more star destroyers and support ships, Zann sent a defiler to corrupt Kuat and before I could remove the corruption they sabotaged the planet destroying all forces in space and on the ground putting the planet in nuetral. I lost the second death star and couldnot rebuild it. Now if you think about it zann consorptium is over powered, I did overcome the consorptium and held my ground but they can take out your ships and planets like theres nothing to it. Even with the over powerd consorptium I still enjoyed the challenge and still won.			"

												Want a game that takes LucasArts Battlefront's Galactic Conquest and just makes whole game based on that concept? Well here you go. You can obviously play as the Empire or the Rebels. Each one equip with their own planets, specailities, heroes, etc. And with the DLC you can play as one of the many space gangs. The space battles are where it's at. And it's done well. The land battles are a toss up really. Some people like it and some people hate it. Everything else about this game is just your typical RTS with a very solid and in-depth tutorial.Other than that I recommend it!			"

Game is very moddable as well. As a huge fan of the expanded universe, aka legends series now. The Imperial Civil War mod is o detailed and makes the game when you get tired of it seem like an entire new game. I would always recommend this game to every star wars fan or RTS fan. AI can be easy at time, but playing online with mods is your wits against another person. Using every skill you have to win.			"

												We all know that Rebel terrorists are the greatest threat facing civilized society.  How can we, loyal children of the Empire, ever hope to rise above such subversive filth?  Thankfully, Star Wars: Empire at War exists, as a realistic simulator that readies Imperial cadets for the challenges provided by the drunken, racist Rodian-slayers and effeminate robots that make up the rank and file of the Rebels' immoral affront to civilized society.  Disregard revisionist history; Rebels shoot Greedo first, ask questions later.Empire at War deftly combines the challenges of space and land combat into a single RTS, with resource managment and allocation of troops around the galaxy being key to whether or not you can repel the vile, fish-headed ""Admiral"" Ackbar from cruelly dominating and subverting the otherwise good people of the Empire.  There is an option to play as the Rebels, but no one would ever do so, unless they were a social deviant in need of wholesome Imperial reeducation.			"

												To this day, Empire at War has the absolute best space RTS combat ever invented. It's a shame that no other games have ever even attempted to copy it. While the game is often commended for that, it's often overlooked how the game pulled off a fantastic linear campaign, despite being a 4X. If you think you'll enjoy the game, you will.			"

												This game is literally perfect, I have around 3000 hours of EaW and FoC as I have played them since release. I just recently bought the steam version so I could play online with other Steam players on Forces of Corruption via GameRanger. If you can get past the slight balance problems and bugs the game has you will enjoy it a lot. Pros: 1. Very cheap $$$ wise.2. Regular Empire at War is almost perfectly balanced.3. Both EaW and FoC have a very fun fast-paced Skirmish for Land and Space. 4. EaW and FoC's Galactic Conquest can give hours of entertainment. 5. Forces of Corruption has a very fun Campaign.6. Both EaW and FoC can run on low-end PC's with lower graphic settings while having the ability to look amazing on higher graphic settings. (Graphic enhancement mods exist as well)7. Both EaW and FoC have countless mods, custom maps and etc that extends the gameplay.8. Pretty easy game to mod and a good start if you want to learn how to mod games.9. Very simple map editor. Cons:1. Forces of Corruption isn't balanced. (Not even close)2. The Campaign's for Empire at War aren't the best and can get boring. (My Opinion)3. Multiplayer no longer works without 3rd party software such as GameRanger.4. Multiplayer can be very buggy and cause a lot of Synchronization Errors. (Via GameRanger)5. If you attempt to play Forces of Corruption online with another player with the Steam version then he must also have the Steam version. Steam players can't play with Retail Forces of Corruption players due to a version mismatch. (Does not effect regular Empire at War)6. The EaW AI is very dumb, the FoC AI is slightly better but still isn't that great. (AI Improvement mods do exist) If you are interested in playing the game online I truly suggest you download GameRanger at www.gameranger.com Official online servers were shut down due to GameSpy shutting down.

												A great and beautiful RTS game. A very active mod community producing wonders such as Republic At War. The normal game is already worth the money, but with all the mods it is a great deal. Well worth the price of 20 dollars. Which means when ever it does go on sale (tends to go on sale every now and then) it's a great snag.			"

												Where to begin, lets begin by saying this is the best RTS Star Wars strategy game. Not to mention its going to stay the best because its going to be the only strategy for Star Wars with space and ground battles. Its worth every thing to pay for the game down to the last penny. Commanding a legion of stormtroopers or tanks to assembling an armada of star destroyers. Dont forget to check the Moddb mod fourms. Theres always people that want to expand the perfect Star Wars strategy either by converting the game into republic at war, or to a Star Gate mod. Eitherway. Its recommended that you take high consideration on setting aside atleast 2 bucks on your next paycheck to buy this master peice. 10/10			"

												Probably the best strategy game of the Star Wars series since Rebellion. This game makes for both ground and space based warfare, making it an interesting change from past games.

												While I am a little biased here (this game being one of my favourite Star Wars games ever), Empire at War is a fairly good RTS for Star Wars fans looking for some fun. It can get fairly repetative at times, but over all, it's a pretty entertaining game. BattleCam gives some interesting shots but don't expect to see anything spectacular effects wise.All in all, 8.5/10: While not the best RTS ever made, Empire at War deffinately diserves a remake for the new Canon with modern effects.

												One of the best RTS games I've ever played. The stories are ok. But the battles, especially the space battles, are awesome. Also the soundtrack is perfect. When I play the Empire, I really feel I'm the Empire (maybe I'm just nostalgic and a fan from Palpatine).But what these points even tops are the mods. I played ""The Awakening of the Rebellion"" (German modders) and ""Republic at War"". Although I've quite often problems with the installation of AotR and that RaW lags on my laptop I love these mods. They are much more intensive and it's a real joy to play this game as a Star Wars fan. And the AI should not be underestimate in both mods.I'm hoping for years that there will be come a similar new one like this. Until that I'd even play 1,000 hrs with it, if necessary.^^			"

												Imperial tech level 5 is when everything goes crazy.But seriously, this game is beautiful, made in the golden age of RTS games. The space battles are awesome to watch but it's difficult to go into cinematic mode because you have to keep everything under control. Taking over the galaxy is a long, hard piece of work, but as you finish up that Death Star, you realise that the rebel scum are screwed.10/10 would space nazi again			"

												Amazingly fun game. I find that the multiplayer, which limits coop multiplayer to skirmishes, leaves a dry taste in your mouth but there is a lot of fun to be had though if you're into player vs player. The galactic conquest game mode in single player, which you fight individual battles over planets in order to planet hop your way to victory is very entertaining. Each planet you conquer typically gives bonus effects and increases construction slots. give it a try :)			"

												As RTS games go, this title isn't going to redefine the genre in any way. But that doesn't stop it from being an enjoyable enough game, especially if you're a Star Wars nut. Personally i find the space battles to be the real highlight for me, they're just so much better than ground force battles. I also must admit to having NEVER played as the rebel alliance, i always play as the Empire... purely because their ships and vehicles look so much better! For this reason i'm not sure just how balanced the gameplay is in terms of unit strength or if the number of recruitable units varies to make up for the difference in strength... after all, sure an AT-AT is going to be pretty tough to beat, but i wouldn't fancy the rebels chances if the Empire could recruit as many AT-AT's as the rebels can recruit in soldiers!Those of you who want to play as the rebels will be at least partially pleased to hear that the AT-AT doesn't appear until VERY late in the campaign. Same applies to the vast Executioner class Star Destroyers, although those ships seem to be lacking in firepower and are little more than enormous target practice sites. The bad news for the rebels though is if the Empire manage to finish constructing the Death Star and retrieve the stolen plans, they've already as good as won. If you're playing as the Empire then consider this good news, especially as you then get to destroy 4 or 5 planets and revel in genuine global destruction.In terms of graphics and audio, this game is fine and has stood the test of time well. In terms of gameplay it's pretty simple, bringing in little in the way of new features to the RTS genre. So if you're a fan of Star Wars and like the established RTS style of game, you're going to really enjoy this. If you're looking for something new, this will be a very shallow game indeed.			"

TIny rebels squashed with slightly less tiny bombs.Is Fun.Also many awesome mods *cough* Republic at War *cough* and an amazing community.Edit: THERE ARE SPACE BATTLES AS WELL.*cough* You can build the Death Star in Galactic Conquest *cough*			"

												In only one word. Perfection. The pinnacle of Star wars games. This game, along with Battlefront II and KOTOR, forms a triumvirate based on success, technology, and most importantly,FUN. I won't make this beginning too long, beacuse, if you are seeing this, you have probably played prefection already. But for those who haven't played (what are you waiting for?)I'll elaborate on some aspects of the game.NOTE:In this anylisis I'm writing about the gold pack itself. Apart from a few exceptions,I won't make any distinction between the original EaW and FoC-Graphics7/10Well, yes, I have talked of perfection and all of that stuff before, but, the graphics aren't perfect. The original game graphics are poor and cheap.The battles are truly spectacular,specially the space battles.Land battles aren't that wonderful, but they are playable and fun.-Duration10/10I won't talk much about this aspect. The ""Galactic Conquest"" mode can last for days, and you can repeat it  again the next day and have brand new posibilities! This game is REALLY long.-FUN FACTORWe finally arrived at this aspect. The previous two were just a warm up.Now is whe the real review begins.It's completely awesome.Period.Okay.You're still reading this.Then you are interested in the game.It's clear now.The game features the Galactic Empire, The Rebellion, and, in FoC, The Zann Consortium. The main Campaign drives you through the perils of each of the factions, though the Consortium is only available in FoC.Then there is the ""Galactic Conquest"" in which you control one of the factions to ultimate galactic domination, crushing, liberating or corrupting.And there is also a skirmish mode, but you guys must already know what entails.In fact, the feeling of crushing Echo Base(Hoth) with your AT-At's is wonderful. There isnm't any feeling like it.Well, this is all, finally, I can only say that.... 12/10.PERFECTION.Once more,yes.[/i]Overall game mark: 9/10I told you just a bit earlier that there isn't a feeling like crushing echo base,but, there is one.Writing this review sitting back and relaxing with my cup of tea, listening one of my favourite Dire Staits song.If you have read this....Thanks.It's been a pleasure.

												Empire at War is not your typical strategy game and definatley not your typical 4X sins of a solar empire/ star ruler etc brand of space strategy either. And despite that Empire at war really isnt anything special even back when it cam out  over a decade ago EAW Was not that innovative or edgy, or even orgional..this game uses a tried and true method that the total war series took up and perfected upon, Like total war it Empire at war sports a simple enough turn-based campaign map along with an equally simple easy to use Real-time battle map.Now, even with all that Empire at war is unique for that fact that you can not really find anything equivalent that does not require hours upon hours upon hours to complete Or is so superficaly put together or badly designed that enjoyment tends to be losst after a meere few hours of play. Empire at war is a rather thin game without all that much depth..or width but whats contained within the admitedly narrow scope of this game makes up  for it all tenfold. Personally i have rarely seen such a well put together bug free game with amazingly designed graphics that can still hold relevance today ((although that point is probably more opinion based, still point dersrves to be made)) along with the fact that this games devs put the time and effort into going over every single inch of this game making sure that pretty much everything is polished and finished. this is probably one of the most well made games you could run across..its just old. To sum this up simply put, imagine total war rome in space minus the minor social management and diplomatic features boil it down to war and you have Empire at war.			"

												Although nearly 10 years old Empire at War represents the FINEST in Star Wars Strategy Games. Whether you want to do a ""Galaxy Conquest"" mode and just play as either the Empire or Rebellion, or do a story mode learning about the empire or republic this is the game to get. It also has multiplayer support and a massive amount of mods, many of which focus on other eras of the star wars legacy.

												Let me start by saying I do believe this is worth buying but I caution you if you are a fan of RTS games that this may not be what you are used to. The modding community has also done wonders with this game and for the Republic at War mod alone is worth buying the game.The game is split into 2 distinct parts. The galaxy overview where you build bases, move your troops and play in a Risk like format. The second part is the the RTS side of the game where you control your troops directly. This is further split into space combat and ground combat. I'm going to give each a review and then add the sum for my total review.First with the ground combat it always involves protecting or destroying the buildings. The defending side get's units through deployed troops already built and gets further free troops from buildings designed to construct units. The offensive side I find often is at a disadvantage and it becomes of game of invading with totally overwhelming numbers or playing more tactically with stealth based units. This generally ends up being long winded and downright boring battles in the later parts of the game where the combat is meant to be more fast and furious to keep a game going. For the ground combat I'd give it a 2/5.Second the space combat. This is where the game really shines and you can recreate some of the great moments from the movies. The Rebels and the Empire both play very differently and it keeps the fights fresh each time. The Imperials go for that ovewhelming numbers and get free Tie Fighters and bombers from the capitol ships. The Rebels why they need to buy Fighters and Bombers are generally more well rounded to deal with threats. Capitol ships on both sides play fairly the same with your standard Rebel Crusiers and Star Destroyers but what makes space combat so unique is that larger ships and space stations have hardpoints to target. To many Tie fighters take out the hangar. Mon Calamari Cruiser flanking around you take out its engines and leave it stranded. This adds a whole new dimension to and RTS that I've never played before and makes it a truly tactical experience. Space combat gets a 5/5.Finally the Galaxy Overview portion. It's fairly straightforward and just involves moving units, building bases on planets, sabatoging enemy bases and upgrading the tech tree. For players who don't want to play the battles can actually play and entire match from this screen and let the computer simulate the battles for you. It's different, it's cool, it's noting totally special but does offer a new take at strategy games. The Galaxy overview gets a 4/5.Don't expect much difficulty from the computer. The AI is somewhat dissapointing but fear not. One of the best parts of this game is what the modders have created for it. The Republic at War mod can take the place of the expansion and allows you to play out the Republic vs. Seperatist conflict. The AI in that is tough. I'm at the point where all I play is Republic at War and it offers the challenge that I was looking for from an AI in an RTS. AI gets a 4/5.So when you add it up the game is a 15/20. That takes into accounts both the vanilla game and the modded game. The modded version is much better and totally free so it's absolutely worth getting. Vanilla version is more for people who want to learn the game or are big Star Wars fans. In all it's not super difficult and definately different from most RTS games on the market. I definately recommend this game!			"

												This game is a great RTS, which is good in its own right, but it's also set in the Star Wars universe, thus making it awesome!Honestly, I have yet to really play Empire at War as I have become enthralled by one of the game's many mods, Republic at War.This mod is based on the Clone Wars rather than the Imperial Era and is well worth the download.Some reasons this game is so good:Easy for a complete noob (i.e. me) to start playing.Has solid multiplayer (with the help of Evolve or other similar software).Is the only game that allows full immersion in Star Wars battles on such a grand scale.As of this moment, I have barely touched on the Galactic Conquest gamemode. But if you play smart, you can amass a colossal fleet of Star Destroyers and cripple everyone, which is amazing to watch.Some interesting things that have happened so far:My friend had a full population of B1 Battle Droids, I had an orbital strike and annihilated said Droids.In a 2v2 game: Other team attack all our mining facilities, they lose to teammates Acclamators.He attacks their base, a solid stalemate. I then send in the 6 Venators I've been stockpiling. Win.I start my first Galactic Conquest game. 5 minutes later. Alderaan is being attacked. I have 2 Venators and a couple of other ships defending it. Droids have 13 of their biggest cruisers. I lose.In short AI > friends.			"

(this was before Petroglyph has official forums(Yeah im that old XD) I love this game to death and have spent many hours away from Steam playing it. I even bought a second copy just so i can play it again. I would have loved for a follow on to this game was made as it was awesome.  "

												Having logged countless hours in the retail version back when retail was up-to-date, I was eager to play it again and replay an awesome RTS in the SW universe.  Now before the actual review, I would like to warn windows 8 users: MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO NOT BUY THE RETAIL VERSION!!! You will find this game super cheap on Amazon, E-Bay, etc, but they will not run correctly on win8 systems. There is an official patch to fix this, but it doesn't always fix the whole problem. However, you will not need to patch and/or modify the game on steam to work :) Now for the review:Yes EaW is old, but it can compete with most current RTS games pretty well. EaW brings cool ideas to the table like space battles, hero units, and a conquest mode in which you have to conquer the galaxy!!! While EaW wasn't the first to do some of those things, they sure did them right. Ok now time for the generic Pros and Cons section:Pros:Doesn't feel repetitiveHas a large map varietyExplores a part of the SW timeline from an interesting new perspectiveIt's in the SW universe!!!Space BattlesBalancing is ok (Aside from the Rebels and their suprise armadas out of nowhere!)Zann Consortium adds a fun new play styleConsKinda pricy for an old gameGraphics (Expected from an old game)Battles should be bigger (There's probably a mod for that)MP is dead :( (There are programs for running MP on Gamespy dependent games though, look up Evolve or Gameranger)Rebels are really OP and can do massive suprise invasionsConclusion:If you like Star Wars, RTS games, or both, then buy this game. If you are looking for stunning graphics and scripted events every minute, then this game is not for you. If you found this review to be good, please mark it as helpful, but if not, then please mark it as not helpful so I can re-write it :)			"

												I would rate this game a steady 9/10, as it has mostly pros, and a few consPros:You could play for hours on end without the game getting boring or repetitive.There is a good modding community, crap tons of mods, and the mods are easy to installThe game is correct, as it follows all the books, movies, and comics (extended universe)There is an exellent community, and online is fun (if i could figure out my gamespy password), in FoC, (Forces of Corruption) you get to play as a pirate faction, and FoC has more mods than the normal gameCons:the guy who made the AI was probably high (just a fair warning).A few minor bugs.(for thoughs who care) the original graphics are pretty OK (not going to lie, they're not the best), but you can get mods that enhance the graphics.All said, the game is solid, loads of fun, easy to understand, and better than 80-90% of all other strategy games i've played, and last IF YOU THINK YOU WANT THIS GAME AND IT'S ON SALE; GET IT!!!I hope this review helps, and encourages any one looking to buy this game to do it.

												One of the best RTS' out there. It has amazing replayability, and the campaign can take you from just before episode 4 to the end. In the expansion pack you play as the Mysterious Zann Consortium, that had just re-appeared. After you play all 3 campaigns, you can waltz over to Galactic Conquest and continue there until your tired of that. Afterwards, there are TONS of mods that will boost experience such as Republic at War, Thrawn's Revenge and the Absolute Corruption Mod.			"

												One of my favorite star wars games, especially for the PC. It has some pretty cool space battles and land battles. It introduces some iconic troops and has some uniqueness to it. It's not groundbreaking but it's a good game. The only real fault of the game is it's multiplayer campaign mode.  Slow and buggy, difficult to play and there's a lot of waiting involved. They could've have tweaked that some.			"

The age of the game barely shows - it's still a beautiful Star Wars game and its especially fun as one. I love how accurate the units are - there are alot of different TIE Fighters and theyre represented perfectly in game. The same for the Rebel Alliance and the Zann Consortium. The storyline is fun, galactic conquest is even better and for you quick fixes, there is skirmish mode. You can download and play custom game maps as well! You can always DL a 3rd party VPN software platform, like Game Ranger, and continue to play online with friends. For the price, I highly suggest this game to any RTS fan and definitely to any Star Wars fans! May the Force be with you.			"

												I recommend this game becuase it's a star wars strategy game and if you like star wars and strategy games this is the game for you. I personally play this game becuase of the galatic conquest were you star off on a couple of planets, then you start to build your army up and fleet, then attack the enemy planet and capture and defend it you can also build the DEATH STAR as the Empire. The skirmish mode is great aswell, there are three factions you can choose from The Empire, Rebel Alliance and the Zann Consortium, They all have a great verity of troops in space or on the ground. The other  thing I like about this game is the AT-AT the Empire have and they can drop troops which is amazing, so for a example get 2 AT-ATs go to a capture point drop some troops off let them capture it then get your troops and the AT-ATs to storm the enemy base. The one thing I dislike is the ground battles when you capture a point and call some troops in and a ship comes down which is awesome but they your troops are very open for attack and some times which happends to me alot is if you play against hard AI, If there the Empire and they have a AT-AT and it's at your capture zone you call some tanks to deal with it, Then the ship comes down and the AT-AT destroys them which is a waist of cash. But apart from the ""spawn killing"" it's a wonderfull game and I highly recommend it to anybody			"

												If you wish to get into strategy games then I would recomend starting here, it is a RTS strategy not like the Total War series which is a turn based strategy with many things such as polotics, but Star Wars Empire At War dosen't have any of that stuff. Its just a plain and simple game with hundreds of hours of fun and maybe more. It dosen't say I have that because I played it years ago not on steam. Of course you can either play as the evil Empire or the Rebels, I have to say I found it easier to play as the Empire compared to the Rebels, but when your the empire and you finally manage to buil the Death Star it is so amazing, its just like your in the movies but instead of watching it your controlling it :) If your a Sci-Fi fan, RTS/ strategy or a Star Wars fan I would recommed getting this game now, I would say it is worth the money because there are so many skirmishes you can play and depending on how you play the campaign can go on forever literally, I even built the biggest fleet with over 200 space craft and possibly more and my laptop was lagging due to the ammount of ships I had in the game lol.

												This is going to be a warning more than a review. I played many, many hours of this game as a kid and I bought it on steam because the Forces of Corruption expansion wouldn't install properly on my computer. This game installs and plays but let me warn you, SAVE OFTEN. Do not count on the autosave. I got some PTSD from the steam version after I played some hours in the campaigns. The game has some serious game breaking bugs. You may not get them, you will be lucky to get them 1 out of every 5 times you play the campaign. But when you do, you will want to tear your hair out. The one I got in the steam version (similar stuff happened on the disc version) was when I moved a character to do a mission within the time a scripted sequence was occuring in dialogue (IIRC) and he bugged out inside the planet. I needed him for the next mission but he was stuck in the planet. What's supposed to happen is you get your character back after a small period of time but that didn't happen. The autosave happened right after that so my save file is unplayable. SAVE YOUR GAME.Edit: I decided to do a retrospective video on the game to provide more information:

												This game really inspires my inner star wars fanboy. Everytime I boot Empire At War up, I quiver down to the deepest fiber of my being. I am enamored with concept of commanding an armada of space nazis in a universe where the laws of physics are cartoonish and the extent of technological doctorine is more shortsighted than trying to romance your unforgiving boss's daughter at the company christmas party. Inspite of the very massive flaws in the Star Wars univers, I still love playing as a glactic hegemony whose best option for soldiers are ordinary humans in hardshell space diapers. I love swooping in and using projectile weapons that have subsonic muzzle velocities that can be hit like a baseball by a glowing laser stick. Often times I will fantacize about being a sith lord and I wonder to myself why anyone would subject themselves to the self righteous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry of the Jedi Order. Its deep thoughts like these that get me through days of choking down Mountain Dew soaked Cheetos and constant reposturing to cope with chronic back pain. Most discomfort in my life can be offset with a successfull planetary invasion in this game. The tactical and strategic interphases are incredibly intelectually stimulating and I feel great accomplishment with every victory. On a good day of playing this game I can feel my self esteem increase and sometimes I even muster up the courage to say ""Hi"" to cute girls I see at the local grocery store when I go to get more Mountain Dew and Doritos. Overall this game is quickly becoming a lifestyle for me. I came. I saw. I conquered. This is my new motto. Becuase of all the euphoria I experience from this game, I will give it a solid five out of five Fedoras. Now only if someone could make an Evangalion mod for this game.			"

												Awesome game, I used to have this on CD before I got steam, but I would say I've spent at least 500 hours on this game, over a period of 7-8 years. The Game has a lot to offer and I find it incredible that despite being made a fair while ago it still holds up today as a great game.  It's an easy game to understand, it was my first PC game and I never had trouble understanding how to play. I love being the Empire and crushing filthy rebels with my fleet of Star Destroyers, and when that doesn't work, when there's dirt you just can't quite get, there is always the Death Star to help you get those hard to reach places. The multiplayer has been down for a while now but by downloading something like Game Ranger which is what I use, you can still play online. I know there's modding for the game but it's not very clear how to properly install it and I've never gotten it to work.9/10- Would clean the galaxy of Rebel Scum again			"

												There are three Star Wars games that should really set the bar for any that follow them: Star Wars: Jedi Knight III: Jedi Academy, Star Wars: Battlefront II, and the one you are looking at right now, Star Wars: Empire at War.Essentially a Total War game in the Star Wars universe, albeit with a realtime campaign map as opposed to turn-based, this game offers a deeply enjoyable RTS and Grand Strategy experience, all set in the wonderful world of Star Wars. Play the Empire and crush the rebellion with your lumbering fleets of Star Destroyers and the legendary planet-destroying planetoid, the Death Star. Alternatively, shatter the tyranny of the Empire as a fledgeling Rebel Alliance, utilizing fast and agile ships to run circles around your foe.Ultimately, of the three gameplay modes, Space Battles are where the game design shines the most, followed closely by the campaign map, both of which overshadow, by a large degree, the lackluster ground battles. But this is not an issue. The Space Battles and Campaign map are so engrossing that you will likely get more fun and replayability out of those two modes alone, than a version of this game where more time were diverted to making better ground battles.Ultimately, I highly recommend this classic gem of a game to Star Wars and strategy gaming fans alike!P.S. I have probably over 200 hours in this game on the CD version, which I had since barely a month after its release!			"

												This game is the best Star Wars game that has ever been made in the history of mankind. Better than Battlefront. Better Jedi knight II. Even better than KOTOR. It's a thoughtfully made strategy game, that wisely keeps you focused on the military side of things instead of making you deal with agricultural or political problems. Land combat, granted, is nothing special. You've experienced this kind of thing before if you've played a Total War game. Space combat is where the game really shines. It feels like nothing else, and does a great job of making you feel like a powerful fleet commander. If you secretly dream about being a the commander of a powerful fleet putting the planet below you under siege, this is the game to you.			"

												Star Wars: EaW was my first Strategy game. It is not the best Star Wars and also not the best strategy game, but if you have no strategy games played, then this is (in my opinion) one of the best choices to learn strategy-game mechanics. The gameplay is simple and easy to learn, the graphics are old, but this is clear, if you buy a game from 2005.If you want to learn the mechanics, then buy this. If you own a OS, older than Win7, then buy the game in the retail.			"

												Although a very very old game, it provides an excellent blend of Galactic management, ground tactical battles, and space tactical battles.The best parts:Interactive galactic map that, while it appears overwhleming, it actually extremely simple. Planets have space stations, ground structures, and special effects based on the specific, such as planetary weather or tactical advantages such as production discounts for specific units.Space battle mechanics. Frigates, Cruisers, Capital ships and Space Stations have ""Hardpoints"" that have different functions, like torpedo launchers, turbolaser cannons, shield generators, or engines. The hardpoints are individually selectable as targets and can be destroyed in any order. As hardpoints are destroyed, the ship loses functions, for example destroying turbolaser cannons will silence them, destroying shield generators permanantly disables shields, and destroying engines reduce speed and manuverability.The hardpoints also have limited firing zones. What his means, is that turrets can only engage targets in their cone of fire, so it's possible for skilled tacticians to ambush larger ships and hit them in their ""Blind spots"" to gain a tactical advantage.Each factions has it's own unique line-ups of ground forces, starships, and heros. Each one is unique, and nearly all units have special abilities to exploit. All units also have carefully designed strengths and weaknesses, and using each one correctly is the key to success.  No point-and-click tank and plane wars where the bigger army wins. A small force of well-played units will trump a large force of point-and-click steamroller armies.Of course, the game is a bit outdated. The graphics aren't up to date, and the game sacrifices intense, specific battles. It makes up by combining all 3 levels of command in a simpler way that caters to smart, creative tacticians rather than ""Point-and-click steamrollers"" who are used to just ordering a hundred tanks and craming them down the enemy's throat.

												Great game if your looking for awesome space battles!Pros: - SPACE BATTELRUUUU~- A dated game, yet explosions and ships don't imeadiately disapear, I love how the hunks of destroyed ships fall slowly into the abyss away from the field.- Awesome spawning in system, team battles are amazing.- Mostly balanced races for fun all around actual games!- Mauler Mithel- I mean Darth Vader in a tie counters everything but Darth Vader in a Tie (dat XWING tmg reference)Cons:- LAND BATTLES D: so much potential... so much tank spam- AT-ATs provide free supply of squads, actually very game breaking when you have enough- Assault speeds counter everything. Harpoons in the future are the key to controling the universe apparently.- The NINE supply... MFW- Confusing and very annoying/frustrating when trying to build your units, why not be like the space battle and have everything built/unlocked at one key location? WHY BREAK YOUR OWN GAME!?- The ultimates are ultimately useless until you knock out the shield generators- and even then, they really don't do that much damage, and are too slow that you literally need the force to make them connect with anything viablly tactical.Final Review/Opinion:Great game overall, if the supply lock wasn't so low for un-modded battles, this would be an even better game, but even with the supply locked to a default the battles are intense, and every choice or reinforcement you call in is a  carefully decided choice. Should you go for the giant capital ships, slow but powerful? Or should you field a specialized fleet of fast movers capable of dodging the fire and taking out his big supply units? Micro versus Macro, fleet ships engage with decent AI, fighter squads also engage in decent AI at a ship to ship level of combat. The ground battles are giant blobs however, whoever has the better blob wins. If you see this game on sale, buy it! a must have for every sci-fi nerd or anyone with two eyes!			"

												Very much recommend this game to any Star Wars enthusiasts, and in general fans of the RTS genre. The Base game and Expansion are fun and engaging to play, as well as getting difficult at times, but special mention goes to the modded content available for the game and it's easy method of changing the game files, allowing you to fine-tune the game to your own specifications.Be warned though, in Forces of Corruption prepare for an uphill battle as the Empire, Tyber Zann and his pirates and mercenaries will be the ever present thorn in your side, and that's nothing to say of the rebels.Still though, somewhat old game, but by no means bad. I spent many an hour playing this as a younger teen, and i will continue to do so. If i had to rate the game itself i'd probably give it a 7-8/10.			"

												This will be what could be described as...a ""mixed"" review. I recommend this game for any star wars fan out there that wants an RTS fix. I can't recommend this game to rts fans. It is a very straight forward and shallow game that basically amounts to having more units than the other side. There are actual strategic elements that are brought in through community mods and add-ons, but the vanilla game is sorely lacking in this area. There is also a steep difficulty curve between the easy and medium modes. Note, I never gave the multiplayer a shot. +community support for mods and add ons.+Star Wars name +mixed space and ground combat keeps things interesting+fun to live the role of stratego for epic space battles-lack of depth to rts elements-once all units unlock, the end result becomes foregone-steep difficulty curve between easy and medium. Easy mode the computer is ridiculously easy. In medium mode, the computer's aggression is turned to 10 and development of a military force is much more time consuming. It becomes a matter of consolidation of resources and base defense. "

As a star wars fan this game was so immersive dispite the graphics which are ok. But the sound effects, muisic and voices actually sound like they are right from the movies! For example, in other games Darth Vader doesnt really sound like vader but in this game it acctually sounds like him! The mix of space and ground battles are great! I would recommend this game to RTS fans but for star wars fans this is a MUST HAVE!!!! Only con I can think of is kinda my own pickyness...

												STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack is an enjoyable RTS based in the Star Wars universe. Including the expansion, there are three factions. These factions are called the Empire, the Rebels (or Rebellion), and lastly the Zann Consortium. Each of these three factions has a nice variety of ships and land units to choose from for upcoming battles. Each faction also has their own type of research which gives the game more variety. The Rebellion has to send one of their hero units to an enemy faction to steal technology. Usually this tech that the Rebellion steals is a unit or building. The Empire must have a research base on the planet that they want to research tech levels which gives them a new tier of buildings and units. The Zann consortium cannot steal tech, but they can send hero units to planets with a black market to get unit upgrades. Now on to the maps: By default there aren't many maps to choose from unless you mod it. Each map has a set number of planets that your faction can control. You can build up to 8 buildings on any planet you control, although you won't be getting 8 slots on most planets. You may also build a space station above that planet, which can be upgraded up to 5, but depends on the planet. Land combat is quite dull in many peoples' opinions but space combat is quite good. There are also many mods to choose from that give the game much more replayability which I would suggest getting after a couple playthroughs. I've personally played Republic at War and I enjoyed it, a nice change from the base game. I did experience a few crashes and a bug, but that's expected from a mod. This game does feature a campaign for all three factions, which I think you should play through as well because they aren't bad. Lastly, I believe I'm right in saying the Zann Consortium is overpowered if you play them. You can fix this by modding or not playing them. If you don't believe me, you probably will when you play them. Just spam out the hovertanks.I'd give this game a 9/10 because it's pretty amazing. Some people might think it gets repetitive, but not me.			"

												A fantastic, well-developed, excellently made strategy game that is incredibly fun to play, and simultaneously challenging to a very customiseable degree.The rebellion are annoying to fight against, with strong abilities to evade space fights and strike right at the ground, having the most number of heroes and the strongest collection of force users. Their space units aren't too shoddy eitherThe Zann consortium are a nice, interesting faction, able to corrupt planets to make invasions easier. they have the most credits of anyone, and are incredibly survivable compared to the other two factions, able to stick around through deviousness and stealth, like the rebels. They lack any particular strengths in terms of space or land, but their Droidekas and Canterous Tanks make excellent ground forces, and their Keildabe-class battlecruisers aren't too shoddy.The Empire is glorious. Pilot the SUPER STAR DESTROYER Executor in climactic (and very one-sided) battles across the galaxy, exploding space stations and planets with the Death Star and being incredibly intimidating and awe-inspiring. The Empire, despite less population space in space, is clearly the winner in any machup, and on ground the formidable arsenal of AT-AT's, Stormtroopers, AT-AA, Sith, and repulsor tanks makes them nigh impossible to remove without heavy losses or superior tactics.Empire at war is for anyone who has ever wanted to feel the sheer power of commanding thousands of units into space battle against thousands of other units. For the Empire!			"

												Fun Star Wars game. Bad RTS game.You can play as either the Empire or Rebels. Both play very differently and require full attention in all the battles. The difficulties are minute in difference and the AI is garbage. The good thing from this game is Galactic Conquest mode, which feels like you are actually taking over/freeing from the enemy for complete domination.The Gold pack includes Empire at War and the expansion 'Forces of Corruption'. Both are the same technically with the add on of a few new models/units and a new faction which brings a new experience to the game that doesn't focus on combat. The new faction lets you play as a pirate faction call the Zann Consortium. your main focus is to corrupt planets and do ""side battles"" which let you sort of unlock another way to corrupt a planet. Corrupting a planet doesn't give you full control but you can sabotage buildings, unlock tech, or bribe past planets.If you like having outrageous Star Wars battles then I highly recommend getting this game.

												dont know why im able to review this game because I dont actually own it. however i have played it a fair bit. its really good and kinda complicated, and scratches a personal itch with the films. you see it urks me that farmhands that ""reckon they can shoot good"" with no training can beat fully armored, military trained, disciplined and equiped with the best armor and blasters stormtroopers. (that and sticks and stones can pierce the armor and kill them instantly........yeah....no) so now with this you can squash the scum! i literally never played the rebel filth. you can conquer the galaxy using all the iconic vehicles and troops from the films. i cant describe the rebels much as i never played them (empire only). but what i can say is that you can have famous imperial (and a certain sith) as units to use (they are really powerful! badass too) and some of the agents you can use are also iconic (such as being able to use a certain green bounty hunter to root out spies and smugglers). I assume that the rebels do a similar thing, having iconic rebel characters and functioning in a similar way (but also die pretty good, their buildings are also pretty when they explode). you can build buildings that supply troops and money and research for tech (only the finest for the glorious imperial army). it is kind of hard though, and as someone who hasn't got a mind for RTS's (yet loves them with a passion, my favorite genre of games). i found that the only way i could win sometimes was to simply bring bigger numbers of troops (overkill planets basically). theres also an overlaying story. now whats REALLY golden here, is that you can play as a crime syndicate faction. with loads of new shady activities you can do (its really fun) and some awesome story missions about your characters rise to a seat higher up then jabba the hut! personally I mainly undermined the rebels in this factions playthrough (but uh also did some business with them, i am a shady faction afterall). if you love star wars and like RTS's. this games for you, as steal at this price (and is on sale in the christmas sale at the time of this review)			"

												one of if not the best strategy game EVER!although i should technicaly say ''games'' as this is the combination of both the original and the expansion.  this game seemlessly combines a civ builder and a strategy game together to fully emerse the player in the star wars universe WITHOUT screaming ''star wars om nom nom.  only star wars fans all others excluded''  (infact many star wars fans of other star wars games feel alienated by this game)  however for the fans they will find many of thier favorite ships aswell as some interesting new ones and allot of backstory and info they might not have nowne otherwise.  as for the game?  its a fun ALL real time strategy/civ builder.  everything is in real time.  everything is linked together.  from strategy map> space map> ground battles> taking over planets for the strategy map in a fast paced but fun way.  of course if you simply want to see GIANT ships firing HUNDREDS of lasers at each other then you can simply jump into the battles with space and ground skirmishs.  and the expansion? no it isnt some small add on or a tiny little pack but a full new campaigne and my favorite faction.  enter the consortium, a chaotic space mafia bent on ruling the universe!(ses economy) consortion adds not just new ships but also a unique and interesting and totaly new tech level upgrade sytem... stealing.  you can even steal ship disigns from the other factions and make them your own (though technicaly... uh oh that would be a spoiler)  the multiplayer is fun though it is an old game and therefor its probably best to find a friend that plays it.  additionaly the factions arent balenced very well but the expansion does add some balancing by making the rebel faction dominate the consortiom but not to the level that the empire dominates or the consortiums pure awsomness.  a multiplayer co-op campaigne would also have been cool but alas we can only dream.  there is however, a multiplayer co-op skirmish that is an interesting take on an age old idea (by that i mean starcraft :P)			"

												This game is highly repetitive, simplistic, ground combat are annoying, space battle are the same all the time. The units are cheap and badly balanced. The only reason why it's actually fun to play is because it is Star Wars.So if you like Star Wars, that a fine game. If you don't like Star Wars  you probably should avoid that game no matter the price.			"

												I got this for $10 during last year's winter sales. And I can confidently say that it's worth much more than $20. In fact, before I got the Steam version, I used to play the Gold Pack religiously on a disc before it got scratched up. Empire at War and its expansion were definitely what happened when LucasArts and their developers had good ideas. If you are a fan of both RTS games and Star Wars, you will love this.For an RTS game, it's a 8.9/10. For a Star Wars game: 9.5/10.			"

												I don't know much about RTS games, in fact I know next to nothing, but I do know that this game is incredible. I first got this close to when it came out and spent hours trying to conquer the galaxy. Eventually, my disc broke and never bothered to replace it. I saw it on sale and picked it up (I don't think it's really worth $20 anymore). I had never played the expansion before and learning how the new corruption mechanic worked was fun. It's not a pretty looking game, and the sense of scale is a bit off sometimes, if not completely, but it is still a very good game and if you like RTS games, but don't want to think very much, then this is perfect for you. Plus, you can use the Death Star to blow up planets. That right there should be enough to sell this to you.			"

												This is a great game for strategy fans, the fact it's Star Wars is just gravy. It's very similar in ways to Space 4X games, like Endless Space. Of course it's not that deep, but Empire at War is a nice mix of RTS and 4X. You Start out on the Galactic Map in most cases, in which there are numerous planets, each producing a certain amount of Credits, this games only resource/currency. You use Credits to purchase buildings on the planets you control, and Space Station upgrades once you purchase a Space Station in Orbit around the planet. You then build/recruit land units like tanks and infantry, or build spaceships ranging from small Fighter Ships, to large Capital Ships. You can create fleets containing Ships meant for battle, or just transport ships to carry troops. You can keep troops on your Battle ships, but I find it better to send the fighting ships first, THEN send the transports to take control of the ground.One thing I like is that in ground battles, you can only bring the units you had brought with you beforehand, and not magically drag them out of you♥♥♥♥♥like most RTS games. The only exception to this is the Skirmish game mode, which tries to make itself more similar to traditional RTS games.Another thing I like is that at the start of the battle, only a handful of units are on the battlefield. To bring in reinforcements, you must capture Reinforcement points, which will allow you to bring in more of your troops from orbit. If you have any that is. Normally for the defenders, they're stuck with what they had on the planet at the time, since in order to engage in ground combat, you must first clear out the Space around it. Not always though, as it's possible to sneak past the Orbital Defenses in certain instances.Space battles are similar in mechanics, except that(don't quote me on this yet) you aren't restricted to dropping(flying?) in reinforcements into Reinforcement Points. I'm still not very well versed in space battles yet, though. I've mostly played the tutorials and mostly ground combat in the campaign, and haven't done space battles as much. They're gorgeous though.Also, In space battles, the larger ships have whats called 'hardpoints', where you can target these smaller areas to disable/hamper the ships shields/weapons/etc.Both land and space have a decent amount of units, however it's not as high as some RTS games.All in all, I definately recommend this to any Strategy, RTS, or Star Wars fan. Especially if you're any combination of those three.			"

												If you like massive spacebattles in a Star Wars theme then this is one of the best games. You can play against AI or players on both the surface of many different planets or in space above them or in fields of asteroids. Empire or rebels the choice is yours, both have their own campaigns. If you add the ""Republic at War"" mod you may play as the Confederacy of Independent Systems or as the republic. Personally that mod has breath new life into the game for me, made me buy it in a non-CD version and play it some more. To be able to swarm the clone troopers with battledroids or hammer the CIS to submission with superior quality is both fun options. The AI in the campaign is not to be taken to lighlty on a higher diffidulty!			"

												Star Wars: Empire at War is not the greatest RTS I've ever played. Actually if this wasn't Star Wars related I'd probably not recommend this game. Empire at War is a game about conquering the galaxy as either the Empire or the Rebellion. Or some third party faction.Ground combat is not the best, I actually autoresolve most ground battles because the real fun is in the space combat commanding mighty Imperial II Class Star Destroyers and tearing through Rebel Escort Frigates.If you get this game I strongly encourage you to check out the two major mods for this game: Republic at War or Thrawn's Revenge. Repubic at War is a full conversion to be all about the Clone Wars and features characters from the TV show. I've never played it but I've heard good things about it. The other, Thrawn's Revenge is based on the expanded universe novels set after Return of the Jedi and it is a lot of fun. Thrawn's Revenge will add a lot more ships and unit types and heroes spanning the events from just after the Battle of Endor, through Grand Admiral Thrawn's Campaign, the reborn Emperor and that crisis, into Admiral Daala's time in command, the Black Fleet Crisis, and ends with the events of the Hand of Thrawn books covering about the 15-20 years between Return of the Jedi and the Pellaeon-Gavrisom Treaty.

												This game is really good.While it is loyal to how a good RTS game should be, you are not likely to have played something like this before. It is really an unique experience to command those rebel forces to destroy the death star and save the galaxy, to create a path of destruction with your imperial star destroyers or to corrupt your way through the galaxy with the Zann Consortium.The game has good graphics (for its age), lots of strategies to try and many different worlds, vehicles and military units with unique traits to discover. While it has a few flaws (the expansion bugs sometimes and the AI is way too predictable when you know how to play), they're not likely to disturb the gameplay too much.Honestly, I think this is an excellent game that is definetly worth trying.

												A top notch and well presentable RTS game, as well as an excellent star wars game, Empire at War is a great game for fans of rts and star wars fans, as it does a great job at preserving the elements and aesthetics of the original trilogy and it exapnding further by adding a few features from the Thrawn/Galatic Civil War trilogy with the forces of corruption expansion set.The space combat of the game alone should be more than enough to attract any space fanatic type of person, ground combat can be boring and can drag on due to the population limit (most units you can have is usually less than 10) and how large some ground maps can be. The game however suffers from a sketchy and out of tune ai, making the game quite unpleasant, espicially during space maps and your own units having a mind of their own and not being able to properly nagivate throughout the map.Another great selling point of the game is its modding capabilites. The modding community is currently alive and thriving due to the large amount of mods and upcoming mods for the game.			"

												This is a great game for strategy fans, the fact it's Star Wars is just gravy. It's very similar in ways to Space 4X games, like Endless Space. Of course it's not that deep, but Empire at War is a nice mix of RTS and 4X. You Start out on the Galactic Map in most cases, in which there are numerous planets, each producing a certain amount of Credits, this games only resource/currency. You use Credits to purchase buildings on the planets you control, and Space Station upgrades once you purchase a Space Station in Orbit around the planet. You then build/recruit land units like tanks and infantry, or build spaceships ranging from small Fighter Ships, to large Capital Ships. You can create fleets containing Ships meant for battle, or just transport ships to carry troops. You can keep troops on your Battle ships, but I find it better to send the fighting ships first, THEN send the transports to take control of the ground.One thing I like is that in ground battles, you can only bring the units you had brought with you beforehand, and not magically drag them out of you♥♥♥♥♥like most RTS games. The only exception to this is the Skirmish game mode, which tries to make itself more similar to traditional RTS games.Another thing I like is that at the start of the battle, only a handful of units are on the battlefield. To bring in reinforcements, you must capture Reinforcement points, which will allow you to bring in more of your troops from orbit. If you have any that is. Normally for the defenders, they're stuck with what they had on the planet at the time, since in order to engage in ground combat, you must first clear out the Space around it. Not always though, as it's possible to sneak past the Orbital Defenses in certain instances.Space battles are similar in mechanics, except that(don't quote me on this yet) you aren't restricted to dropping(flying?) in reinforcements into Reinforcement Points. I'm still not very well versed in space battles yet, though. I've mostly played the tutorials and mostly ground combat in the campaign, and haven't done space battles as much. They're gorgeous though.Also, In space battles, the larger ships have whats called 'hardpoints', where you can target these smaller areas to disable/hamper the ships shields/weapons/etc.Both land and space have a decent amount of units, however it's not as high as some RTS games.All in all, I definately recommend this to any Strategy, RTS, or Star Wars fan. Especially if you're any combination of those three.			"

												On its own Star Wars Empire at War Gold pack may look a bit outdated graphics wise. But with community mod such as 'Thrawn's Revenge: Imperial civil war' the graphics get updated and the game looks much prettier. Even with this game's shortcomings it is still the best Star Wars real time strategy ever. If you're a fan of Star Wars this is probably a must have. The space battles are especialy enjoyable. May the force be with you.			"

												One of my favorite RTS of all time.

												Star war empire at war is a cool little game that will give you a few hours of enjoyment if your a star wars fan.but gets old quickly its missions and battles become very repetitive and feel lazy at some points its a game that you will forget about if your not a star wars fan like myself. thats being said its not a bad game i had lots of fun with it., its fight close up can look really nice and the plant to plant battling i loved it but like i said before it gets old quickly. if you can pick this game up cheap then i recommend trying it out.Star wars Empire at war gets a 5/10			"

												Honestly this is a pretty good game. It has amazing details (especially in space) and my computer runs it just fine. The gameplay is fantastic other than the low unit cap in land battles i think its top notch. Now if your one of those people that likes to make giants armies and crush your opponents utterly, then maybe you should think twice about buying. The units caps are very low and very annoying, its makes it hard to crush your opponents and you just end up beating them. Not destroying or killing, just beating them. The new campaign with the Zann Consortium is nice, its not a ""go there do that"" campaign. It gives you an objective and lets you get there anyway you want(which is nice). So all and all, if you forget the unit cap i would say its a 8/10 game, and its the only star wars RTS game i have ever seen. So if you want to add it to your star wars collection then buy at will,  but i warn you, DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT HUGE ARMIES! If you just want a mediocre force of soldiers go ahead and buy the game. Enjoy! (or don't)			"

												What a classic!Had this on disc for years but time to its toll and both the expanision and base discs got damaged to the point of not being read by any drive I put them in.After seeing this in the sale, I jumped at the chance and instantly bought it.Empire at War is a great pick-up and go game. It's gameplay is fast enough to not get boring quickly but it still maintains the challenge and pace of a true startegy game. If you have a beefy system, I'd recommend modding the game to allow for (virtually) unlimited population caps, especially in space battles. Nothing more fun than playing with friends and having a massive battles spanning across the entire map.Don't worry if your system isn't powerful either, my laptop (AMD E1 @ 1.35GHz) can handle pretty large battles with not a huge loss in framerate. Plus it runs it with max details and AA too so I can't complain too much.As I'm only a user of LAN multiplayer, I cannot comment on the Online support but I believe that programs such as gameranger may help get you playing over the internet.All in all. Do I recommend this game? Yes and no, while I find it fantastic myself, it's not going to be a showstopper for everyone. If you like Star Wars but are still unsure, wait until a sale and give it a go :)			"

												Looks great. Lots of cool mods on the internet. The campaigns are fun, and so is the Consortium campaign. You can use strategy, or spam stuff which is easier. The Consortium is overpowered though. Its super annoying when playing against the Consortium.       The original Empire at War and the Forces of Corruption (FoC) addon are separate, which you can choose when you start the game. The original has the Rebel and Empire campaigns. FoC has the campaign for the Consortium. You can play single player modes on either version.        Playing galactic conquest as Rebels or Empire is terrible. Easy difficulty is too easy, Medium is too hard. Both sides will not give you any breathing room. Consortium can go to your planet and take over your level 5 space station just by being there. WTF? Is this a bug? Their military power is around 95%, while yours is around 30% - 60% if you try on easy mode. I have no choice but to do auto-resolve with a very large force when attacking Consortium on land because they spam tanks and long range torpedoes which can wipe out anything you throw at them.       You can control the super star destroyer, Executor, but only in galactic conquest. The icon looks like Darth Vader. In space, Vader is the Executor. On land Vader is himself ofcourse. You can use the 2nd Death Star which has the ability to destroy any enemy ship, but only in galactic conquest.New heroes: Luke, Yoda, Garm Bel Iblis and his huge hover tank, the Arc Hammer factory ship, Admiral Thrawn, Dark side witch, IG-88, Bossk, Tyber Zann, Urai. Kyle and Mara are removed.       Dark troopers phase 1 - 3, new tie fighters, over powered Consortium capitol ships with big guns and stealth (seriously, Consortium capitol ships are OP), mon cal frigate with cluster bombs, ewoks with bombs strapped to them..., rancors, droidekas. Rebels have not changed much because they already have more units than Empire.			"

												Amazing Game! Halo Wars, but in a Star Wars universe. You are able to, from a bird's eye view, direct your space and land conquests, on a galactic scale, and crush your enemies. Although multiplayer is no longer active through Game Spy, you can use gameranger or LAN(which I find much more fun) to achieve a great multiplayer expierence. If single player is your gam then you can attempt Galactic Conquest and take over all 100+ Planets with epic space and lnd battles as you research new technologies starting with small aclamators and moving up to Venators and the Death Star! And if you don't want to play Galactic Civil War era, then get the Mod: Republic At War and install it to play the Clone Wars. This mod is well made, and basically a game in its own. Pros: - The star wars strategy game everyone has been searching for- AI is programmed very well for being an older game- ""Battlecam"" (spacebar) to watch your battles from a ships perspective- Accurate compared to movies/books (Rebels are horribly nerfed compared to the Empire which is exactly how it is in the movies, however this does not mean the rebels can not win!)- Republic At War Mod is accurate as well to where the CIS can outgun the Republic, however the Republic has better firepowerCons: - Lag. This is an oldgame so it can not take advantage as advanced CPUs and GPUs. Frame lag is terrible when a lot of ships have entered the game (Probably why it is limited to a certain amount of people to be landed) - White screen when changing graphics. Reboot necessary to have changed take affect. - No native support for multiplayer since gamespy shutdown. :( The one ting no star wars game developer has created yet was basically space engineers but in a star wars universe. I really would like to pilot my venator in firts person and have seamless planet entry (no loading as soon as you enter a planet).			"

												Oi, I wanted to love this game I really did.  Ok First things first.  Yes it's a big galaxy strategy game of Star wars, you can build fleets and armies, have land and space battles, build star destroyers etc, it's all there.BUT: When I'm playing it I'm thinking, for every thing the game does well, there's two things that crop up that make me think, 'rebellion did this better six years earlier'.1)You get limited 'command points' so that the biggest battle you get is about 5 star destroyers... if you have 20, fine, they come in one at a time as reinforcements.2) Ships repair automatically, so if you cripple a ship in a hit and fade mission, eg, you play as rebels, fly in blast a big star destroyer, fly out then your main fleet comes in just after, literally 1 second can transpire, which represents maybe 1/12 of a galactic day, and that ship will be completely fixed.  So anything you don't destroy is immediately repaired.  That seems like basic logic has gone WAY out the window.3) You can not sabotage anything, you can only steal technology as the rebels, so usig spec forces or whatever doesn't come into it all.4) Ground battles are  alittle repetitive, and if for eg, you take over a planet, you can't build defences on the ground level until a battle starts... WHAT THE HELL! So eg you can build BIG things like Ion cannons or shields for the planet, but little 'build pads' for local defences to help you shoot down AT-AT's or whatever can't be built until an invading army arrives... what was my army doing for the six months I held that planet, just standing there? Then they go.. 'oh right, the enemy is landing, maybe we shouldn't have been just giving each other piggy back rides this whole time...'These might sound niggly as problems, and  they are, but they and a few more I wont mention REALLy pile up to hold the game back from being great. The story is paper thin, leads up to the destruction of the 1st death star in star wars 1977.THE EXPANSION PACK:In short, it fixes about three little problems, much improved story campaign, you can now sabotage and do things like that BUT ONLY WITH THE NEW TEAM, but the issues above are still largely present.And when you play games with all 3 teams (ie NOT the campaign) You can see how balance was not an issue for the developers.The new team, the pirates are SO overpowered and will absolutely cripple the rebs and imps, so play as them or get angry, that's your choices.So overall, yes I do recommend it, you can see by my hours played that I still gave it a go, and the expansion definitely improves the game enough to give it some reply value. ( I got a MOD with some maps, so I could play the expansion on old maps WITHOUT the new pirate team, thus it wasn't so unabalanced, but could play with the new features, ships etc)Flying into battle with the Death Star II and Vader's super star destroyer with another 4/5 star destroyers is still very enjoyable. So worth a play, but beware its drawbacks.			"

												Amazing Game! Halo Wars, but in a Star Wars universe. You are able to, from a bird's eye view, direct your space and land conquests, on a galactic scale, and crush your enemies. Although multiplayer is no longer active through Game Spy, you can use gameranger or LAN(which I find much more fun) to achieve a great multiplayer expierence. If single player is your gam then you can attempt Galactic Conquest and take over all 100+ Planets with epic space and lnd battles as you research new technologies starting with small aclamators and moving up to Venators and the Death Star! And if you don't want to play Galactic Civil War era, then get the Mod: Republic At War and install it to play the Clone Wars. This mod is well made, and basically a game in its own. Pros: - The star wars strategy game everyone has been searching for- AI is programmed very well for being an older game- ""Battlecam"" (spacebar) to watch your battles from a ships perspective- Accurate compared to movies/books (Rebels are horribly nerfed compared to the Empire which is exactly how it is in the movies, however this does not mean the rebels can not win!)- Republic At War Mod is accurate as well to where the CIS can outgun the Republic, however the Republic has better firepowerCons: - Lag. This is an oldgame so it can not take advantage as advanced CPUs and GPUs. Frame lag is terrible when a lot of ships have entered the game (Probably why it is limited to a certain amount of people to be landed) - White screen when changing graphics. Reboot necessary to have changed take affect. - No native support for multiplayer since gamespy shutdown. :( The one ting no star wars game developer has created yet was basically space engineers but in a star wars universe. I really would like to pilot my venator in firts person and have seamless planet entry (no loading as soon as you enter a planet).			"

												Looks great. Lots of cool mods on the internet. The campaigns are fun, and so is the Consortium campaign. You can use strategy, or spam stuff which is easier. The Consortium is overpowered though. Its super annoying when playing against the Consortium.       The original Empire at War and the Forces of Corruption (FoC) addon are separate, which you can choose when you start the game. The original has the Rebel and Empire campaigns. FoC has the campaign for the Consortium. You can play single player modes on either version.        Playing galactic conquest as Rebels or Empire is terrible. Easy difficulty is too easy, Medium is too hard. Both sides will not give you any breathing room. Consortium can go to your planet and take over your level 5 space station just by being there. WTF? Is this a bug? Their military power is around 95%, while yours is around 30% - 60% if you try on easy mode. I have no choice but to do auto-resolve with a very large force when attacking Consortium on land because they spam tanks and long range torpedoes which can wipe out anything you throw at them.       You can control the super star destroyer, Executor, but only in galactic conquest. The icon looks like Darth Vader. In space, Vader is the Executor. On land Vader is himself ofcourse. You can use the 2nd Death Star which has the ability to destroy any enemy ship, but only in galactic conquest.New heroes: Luke, Yoda, Garm Bel Iblis and his huge hover tank, the Arc Hammer factory ship, Admiral Thrawn, Dark side witch, IG-88, Bossk, Tyber Zann, Urai. Kyle and Mara are removed.       Dark troopers phase 1 - 3, new tie fighters, over powered Consortium capitol ships with big guns and stealth (seriously, Consortium capitol ships are OP), mon cal frigate with cluster bombs, ewoks with bombs strapped to them..., rancors, droidekas. Rebels have not changed much because they already have more units than Empire.			"

												Honestly this is a pretty good game. It has amazing details (especially in space) and my computer runs it just fine. The gameplay is fantastic other than the low unit cap in land battles i think its top notch. Now if your one of those people that likes to make giants armies and crush your opponents utterly, then maybe you should think twice about buying. The units caps are very low and very annoying, its makes it hard to crush your opponents and you just end up beating them. Not destroying or killing, just beating them. The new campaign with the Zann Consortium is nice, its not a ""go there do that"" campaign. It gives you an objective and lets you get there anyway you want(which is nice). So all and all, if you forget the unit cap i would say its a 8/10 game, and its the only star wars RTS game i have ever seen. So if you want to add it to your star wars collection then buy at will,  but i warn you, DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT HUGE ARMIES! If you just want a mediocre force of soldiers go ahead and buy the game. Enjoy! (or don't)			"

												I have played this game for a long time since before I got steam, To this day it's one of the best RTS games out there. Vanilla game is pretty lame with bad voice acting in some parts but all in all a solid game. I want to review this game with the Thrawn Mod however.The good: Even to todays standards with the Thrawn mod ( can't think of the legit name I got it on moddb) are pretty sweet.Lots and Lots of units space and land.Fighting in space then fighting on the planet below I'm still looking for an RTS that can duplicate this.It's Star wars.The Bad: No veterancyEvery other Star Destroyer is Named the Alecto.Very dated (not bad persay but I would love it if Disney greenlit a remake of this with more planets, a cover system for infantry and garrisonable buildings. Think Wargame, Men of War and Star Wars had a threesome and the love child would be this game) If you're a fan oF Star Wars and want to invade the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of some planets as the Empire buy this game now.

												This game is a timeless classic I find myself coming back to when I'm bored. It allows one to take the yoke of the star destroyer that is the empire or fight as th rebels. For yavin to mustafar, you can counqer the galaxy your way. Or free it from the terror that is the republic. NOW I WILL SAY THIS!!! You can NOT mod this game on steam! If you wanna more it, you can pick up a copy off Amazon for 7.00$. That's how much I got mine. Now I fight in the clone wars :DOverall rating?9/10			"

												This is my favorite Star Wars game. I remember playing this as a young child. Star Wars: Empire at War is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game. You are able to chose to play as the Rebel Alliance, and bring peace to the galaxy, or as the mighty Empire, and take over the galaxy. You are given command of squadrons of soldiers, and you can increase the number of soldiers you have and use different units such as tanks or heavy soldiers, etc. Multiplayer doesn't work anymore, sadly, but you can try it with Tuungle. The graphics are not up to shape, but again, this is an old game.  You can play the campaign which has quite the engaging story to it, especially the ""Forces of Corruption"" DLC. There is no steam workshop attatched, but with some decent researching on Youtube and websites such as ModDB, you can play the game with mods. If you love Star Wars and RTS games, especially old style ones, this game is for you.			"

												An invigorating taste on the StarWars franchise, putting you as a commander, on ethier side. Its an incredible RTS game that feels great as you manage a small economy, unit cap, capturing planets and creating installations. What sets it apart from other StarWars games is that you can battle in space and ground as well as managing planetary defenses and creating ground troops for planatary assults. This may all seem confunsisng at first but I suggest running throught the tutorial then the campaign for beginners.			"

												might not be the best rts but its definatly a good star wars gamecommand your armies to take over the galaxy     pretty straight forwardwhats special about this is you got two forms of combat, land and space which really makes capturing a planet a process since you have to get both to have full control of the planet,though you can send smaller units, particularly heros and you wont have to deal with the space battleunits are broken up into infantry\fighters, light vehicles\small ships, artillary (or what would be called glass cannons), heavy vehicles\big ships and heros heros are pretty self explanetory, the characters you know can fight on ground battles and some in space, alot of them can land on planets undetected and have special abilities, once a hero dies they will recharge before they can be brought back in againin the galactic modes you can build structures on planets that allow you to build units, get upgrades, etcevery planet can build a space station which like some ground stuctures provides free garrison units when the planet  is attackedships and space stations are build up of hard points, hard points normally contain various types of turrets, shields, hangers, engines and special weapons, i thought this was really cool considering you can focus your forces on the most important hard point similar to how you attack the enemy ships engines, bridge, communication and life support in star wars battlefront 2 however these hardpoints contributes to the ships fuction and if they are destroyed they are gone for the rest of the battle (ex your engines are destroyed you go really slow, your shields are destroyed you have no shields) one of the things that i disliked about the game is that you can auto result a battle which will automaticly complete the battle and show you the results the only problem is it decreases your winning chances signifgantly, auto battle is only a viable option when you want to give up a planet but want to take some forces with you but sometimes it wont even do that and if you do win you will get signifigant losessome units arent even properly balancedanother thing is that the galatic conquests maps are always so split aparti enjoy the mode the most when you start off on less than 6 planets and have to beef up your defenses before going on the offenses, the problem is either your planets are two and far apart or you have too many planets and not nearly enough time or money to prepare your planets i wish there where more galactic conquests though because skrimish is well skrimish and campagin is obviously very directedbut then again you can always download custom ones so thats not a big deali highly suggest getting the republic at war mod it really adds alotall and all its a enjoyable rts but not perfect			"

												First off: Great game.  This RTS is just what all star wars fans needed back when it was released, but what has kept people playing has to be the modding community.  The clone wars, Republic at War (My favorite) Mandalorians, and so much more.  This game is truly a game that all fans have enjoyed, and hopefully many more will enjoy.			"

												Excellent RTS. Battles are fun and dinamyc and the galactic conquest mode depicts the star wars universe pretty accuratly. The exapansion is also a lot of fun. It adds a playable faction with unique units and buildings and adds a few units to the republic's roster and the rebel roster. This game is set in the starwars universe in the context of the first trilogy.  If you are interested in playing the clone wars there is an overall mod called Republic at War (RaW). This mod is perhaps the greatests overall mod I have seen in a video game.  It is even closer to the star wars universe than the base game. You can play as the confederacy fielding a variety of droids and massive spaceships. Or the rebublic using battalions of clones recruited straight from kamino. This game is worh getting just for the expansion. I find it better than the base game anyways.			"

The thing I dislike most about this game is the lack of Workshop support for the mods, but with a bit of effort, one can get mods that dramatically improve the game.   Once again, I would highly recommend this game.			"

												7/10I love this game so why 7/10? Let me tell you... Corruption!!! Why isn't there some kind of tech or what ever to help control this super annoying feature? Many fan boys have complained about this and yet nothing was ever done. Two: No one is faster than the computer so why can't the player start to move their units on the campaign map in pause or during the start of a battle? I find some times I go from battle to battle without being able to react to anything on the campaign map. Just give me 1/2 a second to move my units. Good Lord! And, this is a big one, multiplayer isn't supported anymore!!!! WTF!?!?Well, that was my two cents. Oh and don't expect updates with any of Petroglyph or LucasArts' games. Won't ever happen because they don't think they make money from fixing released games. Yet they still sell them and at full price almost ***6 YEARS*** later! humm? Shame on you!! If they would fix these three things I could recommend getting this game at full price of $20 but they won't so get it on sale for under $10 or even $5.			"

												Remember playing this game for hours a few times, its very imperium galactica 2 meets star wars, which is why i like it so much, because both of them are alike in a lot of ways.While i like playing this game a lot, i think it would be best if it were played in compatibility mode, playing it from win 7 i am having frequent issues with the game bugging in graphics or glitching during specific moments like the ui disappearing on me, including the planet names and fleet icons. frequently needing to shut the game down and start it up again in order to cure the problem. the latest trouble i have run across is starting the empire campaign, you get the initial planets plus taris and everything else is locked out, but from thyferra or abragado to taris, it is not accessible to be reached. this is just after the first mission on the empire side.graphics are now more dated then games on more modern standards, but that does not matter too much. as long as the game is fun and engaging, it is enough.Edit: I wouldnt recommend the expansion though, the first hit impression wasnt good, and after now playing a number of hours on it, i do not like it; the auto resolve ground fight more often than not end up with losses mounting, the single player campaign isnt that accessible and the balance is woeful, your ground forces just die all too easily. this becomes a problem when the ai takes a few swamp speeders to your landing zone as you are landing forces. within 10 seconds you would of lost 3/4 of your standing forces before you can get any control of the units to attack back which more often than not, happens. so while the EAW gold i would recommend, the expansion is something i would not recommend.

												The game is extremely enjoyable, and at least to me does not have any rage moments. However the game does get boring after awhile and seems to rely on mods to be an amazing game. The normal(or vanilla) game is fun, yet short. The mods are what make this a good game, and it is still an amazing rts for its age. 9/10 by me			"

												Space Battles are pretty nice, though rather limited in scope. Quick paced economy keeps things brisk and the reinforcement mechanic is perfect. Land Battles aren't my thing: I'd rather just play Star Wars Battlegrounds, it's deeper and suits my turtle tactics much more. The AI is somewhat disappointing, but I suppose I've come to expect that at this point from RTS games. Haven't even tried the campaign, since a) it's Star Wars, I already know the canon and b) it just... doesn't interest me. Not a great excuse, I suppose, for leaving the game ""unfinished"".If the game were exclusively ""Space Battle"" focused, I'd love it, but as it is, it's okay.Dunno who thought the Proton Torpedo Spamming Frigates were a good idea, but that person needs to get kicked in the crotch... talk about OP.Other than that, edit an .xml to boost the pop cap, make a map in the editor (downloaded seperately, google it), and have at! It can be great fun!			"

												Easily got over 500 hours on the old disk version because its just so damn good, Galactic Conquest will keep you entertained for hours just like the campaign will. Skrimish matches are also real fun when you have a 2v2 Hard. When you get bored of the base game you can then hop on over to Moddb and get some amazing mods like Republic At War, Rise of the Mandalorians, Empire at War : RE and a ton more. If you have friends with the same game and mods you can play against or with them on Tunngle, Game Ranger or Evolve, and also play custom maps.This game gets a 10/10 from me simply because it made you feel like you were in the Star Wars universe, Especially when there are massive space battles going on, Lasers everywhere, TIE's and X-Wings dog fighting, Star Destroyers and Mon Calamaries blasting eachother to peices.You will buy this game.

												Play regular EaW and FoC until you get bored, then get mods for FoC to make the gameplay last longer, with a fresh new take. I recommend Thrawns Revenge, as that takes place between episode 6 and the Vong invasion, and there are multiple factions to choose from (more than 3), it places a graphic overhaul, and units and galaxy map are larger and more canon			"

												This Game Is very Good fun The Camra angle can be anoying at times and the AI aint pefect ether and sadldly it looks like there isent any maltiplayer anymore witch they should of mentiond in th games discription before you buy the game but other than that yea its a good game for the right price runs almost perfect on my computer and you get the DLC with the game shame steam dosent have republic at war though if your not a huge fan of RTS like this though I would maby recomend to wait until steam sales but again at £14.99 I think it was it's not a bad game it is however probely lower down in the list of my favorute RTS games RTS bing my favorute game type but again thats only because its beng bet by the best of the best RTS games like command and conquer (any one until 4 coz that ones is bad) age of empire 2 and 3 (because I never played the first one) RUSE a Great world war 2 RTS that has huge maps and is fun Company Of Heros another great world war 2 RTS game (in a mutch smaller skale as far as maps go) and many more but yes I recommend this game If you are a RTS fan you will love it if you are an RTS fan but more towards the Command and conquer type wait until its on sale or maby give it a miss.

												Probably by far one of my favorite RTS's to this date, and it came out around 2004.The space battles are incredible. You actually have to think about the maneuvers of your ships as well as their strengths and weaknesses.Land battles are some times lacking, the AI is pretty smart in this game so watch out, they will rush you.The only thing that I dislike about the game is that some times, escpecially the Rebels (Scum that they are), the AI will research to the point they get that one good unit, and spam it to high hell. Get used to seeing mutiples of the same unit in armies towards the end game.Been playing with Zann's boys mostly, favorite faction to date. (MANDALORIANS!) Their bonus, as well as the bonus added into the expansion pack, are perfect.And if you love star wars, you WILL love this. I guarantee it.			"

												Honestly, it doesn't seem like this game came out 5 years ago. This is one of my favorite RTS's of all time, right next to AoE. The dual plane RTS mechanic is what makes this game a great balance between combat and building your empire. I have yet to replay  through the story, but I recall it being really fun and quite long (If you consider the different story lines just one campaign, it is even longer). Also, being able to refine and hone in your ground combat skills in the skirmish mode is very helpful, since you don't have to initiate an extensive galactic conquest match. Since I don't want to have a wall of text, nor feel like making an in depth review, just buy this game. Here is a synopsis of why you should:+ Star Wars+ Really great space battles+ Fun ground battles+Great sounds and sound track+ A good learning curve; this game can appeal to casual gamers as well as hardend RTS players. It just depends on how much time you want to put into the game, and if you want a challenge (the CPU opponents can get pretty feisty lol)+ A plethora of units from the entire Star Wars galaxy + The cinematic view is cool+ Space battles in particular are super fun to just sit back and watch. Something about them lasers...Really the only con(s) would be- Price. But the game gives you so much content for a fraction of the cost of a big name companies would charge. That said, I'd suggest getting it on sale if you still have reservations about buying it- Graphics. The game is 5 years old, what do you expect? Even so, it really isn't that bad maxed out, it actually looks quite good for its age! All in all, great game. I have yet to find anything bad/wrong about the game. 10/10EDIT:I've since played throught the campaign, and its really fun. Not necessarily note worthy story telling, and there isn't much of a plot, but I still found it entertaining to play through. It isn't as long as I recalled, being that it took me ~5hrs and I was purposely taking my time.			"

												This is one of my favorite games ever. The Space combat is hands down the most enjoyable part of this game and it feels like I'm partcipating in a Star Wars space battle. The Ground combat is a very slow and does not feel very natural it is very hard to control anything. While there is alot in the base game and its expansion Forces of Corruption the real fun comes with the insane amount of mods that the community has created for it. They come in many ways for example if you love just the base game but wanted more ships and ground units then getting Absolute corruption which adds countless ships to each side and adds units to ground combat to make it less annoying. However if you want a total conversion then there are two mods I would point to, they are Republic at War and Thrawn's Revenge. They each put the game into different Eras of Star Wars and do very unique things to the game that makes it feel completly different. This is one of the best Star Wars games that you can get right now.			"

												This is one of my favorite games ever. The Space combat is hands down the most enjoyable part of this game and it feels like I'm partcipating in a Star Wars space battle. The Ground combat is a very slow and does not feel very natural it is very hard to control anything. While there is alot in the base game and its expansion Forces of Corruption the real fun comes with the insane amount of mods that the community has created for it. They come in many ways for example if you love just the base game but wanted more ships and ground units then getting Absolute corruption which adds countless ships to each side and adds units to ground combat to make it less annoying. However if you want a total conversion then there are two mods I would point to, they are Republic at War and Thrawn's Revenge. They each put the game into different Eras of Star Wars and do very unique things to the game that makes it feel completly different. This is one of the best Star Wars games that you can get right now.			"

												Even though this game is dead, and there isn't any trailer- this game is worth so much more than that. Disney should approach this game and try to add new DLC and stuf. If you want to command the death star and ACTUALLY blow up a planet, wreck face with darth vader, sneak around the galaxy with the millenium falcon, and so much more star wars stuff this game is awesome for you. Not only that, but You can play through the destruction of the death star, destroy the rebelion, or corrupt all the things (which btw is is dlc). It's like star wars and stratedgy had a baby!			"

												Had to defend my lonely level 2 space station on Kessel from several Rebel corvettes and fighters. I was tempted to click Auto-Resolve, but I gave it a try. Might as well lose with honor. I fight the corvettes off valiantly and the fighters don't put a dent in the shielding. The few squads of fighters I had from the station's hangar bay helped, but only for some extra firepower. They quickly died.Then, a wonderful voice came over the communications system. ""Reinforcements en route.""I glanced near my space station. Sure enough, 3 Tartan Patrol cruisers came in from hyperspace and instantly fired upon the foe. The rebel fleet fought and fought, but alas, they did not succeed.I just won an impossible battle. Without reinforcements, I would've surely died.10/10 "

The mods, though not steam supported are very fun, my personal favorite being Republic at War, so even if you like clones you can play. There a few bugs and the map of the original one is slightly weird with hyperspace lanes not making a huge difference for they are not placed well, but get it, if you don't like it, download Awakening of the Rebellion, for an awesome original series, however note that the mod is german, so you won't understand everything.

												This RTS tops every single RTS that I have ever played. I enjoy every single second playing EaW, And this brings back memories of when I first played it when it came out on disc. My favorite parts of the game is what make's the game very uniqe to other RTS games out there, the BATTLECAM, wich allows your to watch the fight in a cinematic view. Ashame that the multiplayer is nolonger available. But if you care more about the story than the game, then I recommend watching the movies first, (if you havn't allready) because the ending of the game lacks some story in it.			"

												It is a fantastic game, I would highly recommend it. Especially to any Star Wars fans out there.However the game has one flaw on steam, the launching of the expansion (that steam thinks is a DLC) doesn't work properly. Therefore you must right click the Star Wars: Empire at War Gold pack, open properties, set launch options and type in the following: swfoc MODPATH=Mods\When you now click launch FoC (Forces of Corruption), it will now correctly launch Foc instead of Eaw (The basic game, Empire at War). I hope this will help new players of the game that encounter this problem. I also wish you a fun time with the title, and don't forget to check out the mods. There are several set in the era after the original trilogy (Thrawn's Revenge, Awakening of the Rebellion) and quite a few set in The Clone Wars era (The Clone Wars, Republic At War).Have fun, and may the force be with you.

												It was hard to not give this game a 'not recommend' because of nostalgia and the fact that it is an okay game, that being said there are quite a few problems with it. Mostly they are just balencing issues with some of the units being far too overpowered or weak. The biggest issues are in the conquest mode with the Zann Consortimum being unbalenced (""Your structure on Coruscant has been destroyed! Your structure on Kessel has been destroyed! Your structure on..."" so on and so forth), you can hear enemy fleets approaching because of the massive alert it gives you but you can't see where they are moving or where they are attacking just that they are attacking so most battles end up like 1 battlestation and a frigate against an entire fleet (IT ENDS PRETTY FAST) also the ""autoresolve"" function hates you if you have a army (or fleet) that is one of everything you will win most battles by autoresolving because of a countering system that the autoresolve goes through, on the other side of that though if you just spam only fighters like the A wing prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥(Brother made 500 A-wings I was it was stupid he kills entire fleets with them, I stand corrected apparently it was genius). But for a game it's really fun it is, and the space battles have the cool function of shooting at specfic parts of ships which makes for interesting gameplay. The conquest and land battles are fairly bland though as nothing much happens other than those small fast ending battles and land battles are just... well boring. But it is definatly fun to play and I remember why I enjoyed it as a little one. "

												Star Wars Empire at war is not what I expected. I bought this game hoping for a solid Star Wars RTS; however, I ended up sadly disappointed. The campaign mechanics are broken to the point where you can just form a blocade of a space fleet around planets, spam credits, then demolish the enemy fleets. Now with all of this being said I still enjoyed this game just for the Star Wars aspect of it. If you love Star Wars RTS games, or you are a Star Wars fan I do reccomend this game, but if you are a hardcore RTS player I do not reccomend this game Score:5-6/10			"

The enemy Ai are response to combat it very Good , and give you a challenge, the planets give you disadvantages, and advantages.  Certain plants have wild enemies that attack you and the enemy AI, forcing you to change your tactics. Space battles are a lot of fun, the multiplayer is really good. The story line for the campaigns are well told but could have been better. All and all I give this game 9.9/10, I would recommend this game to any one who loves star wars and strategy players.			"

Any way moveing on from that the game can entertain you for hours upon hours even if your young, the graphics don't bother me the game is old so there fine for me people love the game and some of the people who posted negative reviews have played maxiume 40 hours and minmume of only 0.2 hours which makes me think that they played for some time it got to difficult and posted a bad review so yeah this I a great game and I recommend buying it.pros:challenging AIgreat ship combatdeath starA GIGANTIC modding community on moddbcons:clunky land combat the Empire is slightly unbalenced in both space and land combat.auto resolve weak rebellion units unbalanced AT ATtoo little planets7/10 must get game on saleNow then there is forces of corruption the expansion to empire at war and right off the bat you can see that the zann consortion (or however you spell it) has THE most broken ships in history of broken ships.pros emersive gameplaynew shipsnew faction new way to playconsthe zann somthing somthing is completely unbalancedthe empire becomes the weakest of the factions the rebels are complete and utter morons one time they sent a nebulan b frigate agianst my aggressor class star destroyer (from wookiepedia)the kebal battleship and the aggressor are completly over powered I had one kebal battleship vs 3 imprial star destroyers and won!?!5/10P.S. most of my time playing this is with mods			"

												This RTS tops every single RTS that I have ever played. I enjoy every single second playing EaW, And this brings back memories of when I first played it when it came out on disc. My favorite parts of the game is what make's the game very uniqe to other RTS games out there, the BATTLECAM, wich allows your to watch the fight in a cinematic view. Ashame that the multiplayer is nolonger available. But if you care more about the story than the game, then I recommend watching the movies first, (if you havn't allready) because the ending of the game lacks some story in it.			"

												Extremely fun. Recommened on hard or medium, easy is just so OP for the player. The mods, though not steam supported are very fun, my personal favorite being Republic at War, so even if you like clones you can play. There a few bugs and the map of the original one is slightly weird with hyperspace lanes not making a huge difference for they are not placed well, but get it, if you don't like it, download Awakening of the Rebellion, for an awesome original series, however note that the mod is german, so you won't understand everything.

												It’s a great game the campaign keeps you occupied for hours being able to play as empire and rebels the add on is really good being able to play as the pirates. BUT the programming of this game is bad when on galactic conquest the main aim of galactic conquest is to defeat the other fractions e.g. rebels and the playable pirate fraction but soon as you defeat one the program by passes having to defeat the other fraction and says you one the game which is really short if you’re the empire and have the death star. Also the add on may not work on newer systems so if you have windows 7 or newer then it’s a 50/50 chance it might work you just have to hold your breath. The game worked on my system which has:Windows 8.1 64bit16gb RamIntel core i71tb hard driveGTX 860 2GB GDDR5Overall it’s a good game and I would recommend it. "

												It was hard to not give this game a 'not recommend' because of nostalgia and the fact that it is an okay game, that being said there are quite a few problems with it. Mostly they are just balencing issues with some of the units being far too overpowered or weak. The biggest issues are in the conquest mode with the Zann Consortimum being unbalenced (""Your structure on Coruscant has been destroyed! Your structure on Kessel has been destroyed! Your structure on..."" so on and so forth), you can hear enemy fleets approaching because of the massive alert it gives you but you can't see where they are moving or where they are attacking just that they are attacking so most battles end up like 1 battlestation and a frigate against an entire fleet (IT ENDS PRETTY FAST) also the ""autoresolve"" function hates you if you have a army (or fleet) that is one of everything you will win most battles by autoresolving because of a countering system that the autoresolve goes through, on the other side of that though if you just spam only fighters like the A wing prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥(Brother made 500 A-wings I was it was stupid he kills entire fleets with them, I stand corrected apparently it was genius). But for a game it's really fun it is, and the space battles have the cool function of shooting at specfic parts of ships which makes for interesting gameplay. The conquest and land battles are fairly bland though as nothing much happens other than those small fast ending battles and land battles are just... well boring. But it is definatly fun to play and I remember why I enjoyed it as a little one. "

												/!\CAUTION/!\ I have a lot of nostalgia towards this game. I don't know if Nostalgia is blinding my judgement or not!Star Wars: Empire at War is a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game set in the Star Wars universe. It got an expansion pack which expands the game a lot.Good things:-The main game has 2 campaigns, 2 factions, and a lot of planet to play with. Meaning a lot of different ways to win/lose.-Battles on Foot AND in space. And in the WHOLE FREAKING GALAXY.-Newcomer friendly. This game got me into strategy, and seeing as how I f*cking love this genre, it's a VERY good thing.-It's about the Galactic Civil War. Meaning you get to play as DARTH VADER.-The expansion packs adds a 3rd campagin, faction, and a dozen of planets.-With the expansion pack, you get to chose your base's layout. This may not seem like a huge thing, but it can be important depending on your playstyle.-You get to use THE DEATH STAR(s).-The 3rd Faction has Destroyer Droids. Nuff' said.Bad things:-This game's graphics aged REALLY badly.-It's set in the Galactic Civil War. Meaning you don't get to play as CRISTOPHER LEE (R.I.P.).-Boba Fett is Empire only. Even with the 3rd Faction.-The Death Star may make your game crash. (That's not a good thing in case you're wondering)-If you don't have the Expansion Pack, Luke is Space only. And with the Expansion Pack, he's on foot only.-The main game has cinematics in case you lose/win. The Expansion Pack doesn't. Because F*ck you.			"

EA bf no space no clones/droids few planets few heroes ;/ what game would u rather play a FULL game at relice or 1/3 of one? any way enough about my rant ON EA BUY THIS and have fun conquring the galaxy ;)			"

												If you are a fan of Star Wars and RTS Games. Then this is literally heaven, the game is old but is very fun.Being able to have The Death Star and Blow up planets is Pure amazing. The Space battles are always fun, especially with massive fleets.I truly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RTS games and Star Wars cause this is a Master Piece.			"

												This RTS tops every single RTS that I have ever played. I enjoy every single second playing EaW, And this brings back memories of when I first played it when it came out on disc. My favorite parts of the game is what make's the game very uniqe to other RTS games out there, the BATTLECAM, wich allows your to watch the fight in a cinematic view. Ashame that the multiplayer is nolonger available. But if you care more about the story than the game, then I recommend watching the movies first, (if you havn't allready) because the ending of the game lacks some story in it.			"

												Not a bad RTS if you like Star Wars. The campaigns, however, I don't know. I would have like a standard campaign, but instead it's ""galactic conquest"" with some voice acting and some story missions, but in the end you're just going to conquer as many planets as possible in a boring ""strategic map"". Graphics are kinda dated as well and on Win 10 at least I can't alt tab out of the game or even change the resolution without causing the monitor to not recognize it anymore.Still, can be enjoyable, if you're into it.

Game implements some stuff from Star Wars universe quite well but on the other hand there are some thing which should feel like Star Wars but they just don't.

												This game is a must for strategy and Star Wars fans, While the base game (and FoC) are great and fun games in their own right, the real reason this stands out is the amazing mods the community has made. Here are two I would highly reccomend.Republic at War: Puts you in th clone wars era, difficulty is definately raised here, somewhat unbalanced but really doesn't take away from the experience.Thrawns Revenge: This is my personal favorite for many different reasons, There 5(or 6?) factions and most of them are playable, It adds a metric assload of new units (Both space and ground), its very well balanced and challenging, and it changes up the combat in some neat and good ways.

												Let me see..it's star wars and it's an RTS. Frankly I havent seen a good SW RTS since galactic Battlegrounds back in the day ( Mention Force Commander and I will shoot you)  It's a solid game and the galactic conquest mode will forever remain my favortie. Empire or Rebels both sides offer so much  to do for either space or land combat.Only draw back is the limited troops you get in certain maps and in skirmish mods, I like grand scale battles in my RTS but apart from that it's a very good Star Wars game. 7/10			"

												20 bucks for an 11 year old game thats boxy and stretchy faced on some of the units? just cuz its star wars doesnt mean you can slap any price tag on an old game.... still fun and the space battles and story line ( rebel, empire, and the other one cant rremeber at this moment. corrupted side? idk) is really fun  and there are alot of mods to keep it looking good. but the price can go eff itself. i give it 8 thumbs up, 2 thumbs down, 7 ring fingers to the side one pinky in the stink and 2 fingers in the pink with a squee squee here and a whine whine there, here a whine, there a squee, old george lucas has a franchise and he knowes we will pay anythingggggggggggg *seppuku			"

												Let me just say this, for what I paid to buy this game, $5.99. I feel like I nearly stole this game. It's also a litte odd that I've some how manged to avoid playing this game after all these years.  I'm a serious RTS fanand I never once thought this was a game, for what ever reason that now escapse me, was worth buying.  It is. Oh boy, its really unlike anything else. I mean sure it borrows peices from other games and other games have borrowed from it (Warhammer 40,000) but it really is it's own thing. I highly recommend if on sale, which is not to say its' not worth 20 but concidering its age, a price drop is just what I needed to say yes and now to tell other people, yes its worth buying!			"

												A must-have for strategy fans and Star Wars fans alike. Granted you'll need a little time to get the hang of what unit is strong against what unit but once you have that and how the campaign map works then you'll have a blast. I recommend playing as the Empire first because their strategy is simply seize each planet one by one due to their powerful units and vast resources.			"

												Having completed all three campaigns and one game of conquest my worst fears are confirmed. EAW is an RTS hybrid that tries to be many things but is tripped by technical issues, bad design decisions and a clear lack of testing. The end result is a game that is mediocre at best and only held together by the magic glue that is Star Wars. Only recommended for fans who are willing to suck on a lollypop made out of pure salt just because it's shaped like Darth Vader's helmet.+Authentic Star Wars music and sound effects that leave nothing to be desired. Sometimes even the voice acting is surprisingly good+Graphics seem fairly timeless with some space battle effects still looking pretty sweet+Space battles are fun most of the time+Asymmetric factions (Empire has bigger ships with free fighters, Alliance has better fighters that require no carriers etc.)+Multiple campaigns and conquest mode scenarios+Dropping the screen filling Executor in the middle of a battle for the first time should make any nerds inner fascist climax immediately-Doesn't seem to play nice with Win10 and has no borderless window support. If played fullscreen while Alt-Tabing can put your Windows in a state where you have to reboot to get anything done. I recommend running it in a maximized window instead.-Game breaking bugs include disappearing critical characters, inability to task units to campaign critical missions, disappearing units etc. These issues can be somewhat circumvented with furious saving. Always save to a new file!-A multitude of UX issues that range from fighters needlessly blocking capital ships from selection to the way save files are handled: latest saves don't always show up first, save files take too much space etc.-AI blatantly cheats both by its very nature and also seems to gain scripted fleets out of nowhere for the campaigns-AI sometimes just freezes and does nothing with its ships in battle-Unit AI is atrocious and does not seem to do any target prioritization whatsoever for any attacks. Pathfinding gets progressively worse with unit size to the point where units like AT-ATs, artillery units and Star Destroyers sometimes require near constant micromanaging so that they move the way you need-Being unable to assign any movement orders on the galactic map in pause mode makes no sense-Forces of Corruption doesn't integrate to the main game and is actually a separate game that feels like it was cheaply hacked together in a hurry-While the original EaW is somewhat balanced, the Consortium faction in FoC is completely out of whack and seems to have the best in almost everything in addition to their frustrating corruption mechanic that requires constant fiddling especially from the opponents-Ground battles are usually horrendously repetitive and tedious-Battles can be autoresolved, but the logic for resolving them is completely ludicrous and can lead to massive casualties even if the opponent doesn't actually have any chance of fighting back-Very limited amount of units and ships in a battle at any given time (for example, you can have 6 Imperial class Star Destroyers if you have almost nothing else) and the rest have to be drip-fed into the battle as reinforcements when previous units are destroyed-Player can't choose which units enter a battle first in EaW (mostly fixed in FoC though)-Flying units can't actually fly over many obstacles in ground battles-Some of the writing and voice acting is very cringeworthy especially in FoC. A few characters also use quotes from the movies to a ridiculous degree even for fanservice-The Alliance can commit genocide without any issues and can actually get more funds from it			"

I never had such issues with the older retail version (and I can confirm that the retail version still works without issues).  Fix yourself, steam! Hang your head in shame!A good game, but dear lord steam have made a hash of this one.  I cannot recommend buying it via steam. "

												(note: this review is comedic, i did nothing in this game or in real life specified) I requested more characters, and now we have more. all good... exept, now they are impossible to kill. also, we need more maps. So. Youre still reading? ok, how was ur day? i am literally talking to nobody i am actually doing a really long review because... why not? Wanna hear a joke? what do you call a 3 humped camel? answer? Too bad because its a bad joke and zootopia was overrated. I might have ADHD. I am really getting off topic. Like what am i really writing about? Eww. Thats a really wierd pimple umm... gotta pop it. K brb. Ow that hurt. ever wonder how they got lead in pencils, or how that guy invented mr patato head? or why people still make 8-bit or 3D-8-bit games.i liked the game empire at war, thats a fun game. i should write a review for that.10 outta - i like camels, do you, im still talking to nobody. what was i writing about? oh yeah, world war 2The Second World War was arguably the most significant period of the 20th century. It brought about major leaps in technology and laid the groundwork that permitted post-war social changes including the end of European colonialism, the civil rights movement in the United States, and the modern women’s rights movement, as well as the programs for exploring outer space. The primary combatants were the Axis nations (Nazi Germany, Facist Italy, Imperial Japan and their smaller allies) and the Allied nations, led by Britain (and its Commonwealth nations), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America. The Allies were the victors. the nazis must have had ADHD because they lost, im a part of the allies because i like camels. im going to go ride a camel. Ow i fell off... thats a really wierd scab. *picks at scab* OW its bleeding really bad. ow. that was just scab fluid. wait- scabs dont have fluid OMG- i still like camels.			"

												If you love Star Wars and the entire franchise, then that is absolutely wonderful; however, this Star Wars RTS game doesn't feel like a true RTS. It lacks that simple enjoyment that you get when playing similiar games like Warcraft, Age of Empires or Total War. It just lacks those features and replaces them with a complete automated system. You can't place your own buildings where you would like them, they are done for you. Getting resources? Automatically done. All you do is upgrade and build troops while conducting a small micro deployment here and there in terms of reinforcements. I've seen far much better with competitors, save your time and money. Just stick with the non-gaming franchise and go watch the movies and collect memorabilia! I didn't enjoy this game and regret buying it!			"

												Great game, but Steam functionality is awful. Forces of Corruption, which is the expansion for the main game, doesn't launch on PCs with more than 2GB RAM - it either flashes the launch box, or ends after a few seconds with 'running' changing to 'syncing', and the patches for it don't work either. Unofficial, manual patching is required to get it to launch through the directory, and even then, mods - crucial for me in Empire At War, don't work at all.			"

												I really like the game, but there are 3 major things that make me mad about the game, the difficulty, the Corruption, and the lack of maps. I will explain the three in this review.The difficulty has a major jump of difference from normal to hard. Normal being super easy if you can build up and defend yourself for like 50 days and hard being just a pure ♥♥♥♥ing headache. The Empire and Corruption just team on me on hard and just keep on sending excesively huge armadas just like 5 days in the game. And it's so hard to spam out mining facilities when A. they're being blown up and B. you have to make a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of space units to defend. The Corruption is horrifically overpowered. Being able to ""Corrupt"" plants. After being corrupted, you can either slip through the planet's defences and go to another enemy planet, or blow up ground structures. On hard, the Corruption will pretty much just destroy a building every oppertunity they have. Making it difficult to make an economy because your mining facilities are being blown up. Not to mention the fact that it is QUITE expensive to remove it unless you have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of planets.The lack of maps make it just boring to play, they don't even seem to be that well made. Like in Equal Footing all of the factions' worlds were spread out and difficult to defend UNLESS you're Corruption. tl;dr unless you like a challenge, (don't play corruption in galactic conquest) You will propubly find some aspects of this game a pain. (Oh and I stupidly pressed ""press this if you got this game for free"". This is not part of the review.			"

												Once the game was brilliant. In my opinion now the game is too old. And I am not talking about graphics.Mechanics are too simple and linear, shootouts between troopers are unrealistically long, limit of units per map is small.We came back to play a few maps in co-op but the game seems boring.It is still good in aspect of multitasking and resource management but for a good Star Wars atmosphere I better recommend you to play Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds.

												Empire at War is probably the Star Wars' most serious foray into the strategy genre, and I hate to say it's mixed at best. While the battlescapes make for some really impressive visuals, the game falls flat on its face on the tactical map.It's one of the worst I've ever seen in a strategy game. It's real time with a pause, which wouldn't be an issue execpt the game refuses to let you make any meaningful orders while paused. It will only be an hour or so before you started getting bombarded with battle prompts (which you can autoresolve) back-to-back, and it just becomes completely unmanagable as your attention is constantly divided. It seriously plays like a turn-based system that was retooled to realtime at the very last second, and its shows. I cannot understate how frustrating it is to deal with. And while the battlescape is fun to play on, it also has issues. Pathfinding for you or the AI is atrocious, and you'll often have to bear ships taking a full minute to turn around when they could have just moved forward. On top of some pretty awful unit balance, battles are always completely lopsided and predictable. Do not get this on anything but the cheapest of sales. The cool battles might draw you in, but the game turns into a slog very, very quickly.			"

												The original is a surprising rts - simple-looking but deceptively deep and most definitely playable. Excellent job particularly in space battles of capturing the feel of Star Wars. Regrettably, network play is completely inert in this release... one would have hoped some effort to facilitate Steam net play would have been made, but no. Even virtual networks seem to fail to get multiplayer up & running. Forces Of Corruption is exactly that: an imbalanced force that corrupts the integrity of the base game. The new faction itself is horrifically overpowered making Imperials and Rebels alike look feeble. Silly. Ignoring that expansion pack, if Empire At War were ever repaired, it would be worthy.			"

												TL:DR - If you're looking for a more casual RTS - This isn't it.So, I can see how this would be something many people could like. It is Star Wars after all. But after playing for a good 5 hours, I can tell that this is not a Star Wars game that I like. Which is very rare for me. My experience with it so far has been pretty horrendous, mainly through seemingly cheating AI mechanics and sudden difficulty spikes. Naturally, I was playing on Easy, and I'm not great at RTS, but I sort of assumed it would be more like C&C where you would have time to build up your forces and then assualt the enemy. Its not like that at all. My experiences come from C&C Red Alert and Generals and I've also played a fair amount of Shogun Total War. My issue I feel is that the time scale of the game literally leaves you behind within 30 seconds. In Galactic CQ, I am frequently being raided and out-gunned within the first 5 minutes of play. The AI steam rolls as it doesn't seem to be confined to the amount of actions a human could physically decide upon and take. The AI is so precise and clinical in its processes, that within the first 5 Galactic days, the Rebellion already has amased an economy 5 times greater than my own. I've been through forums and such and there seems to be no real answers about why this game is so different in play style to C&C or Shogun. But I feel its the fact that the AI moves so fast.Personally I was looking for a more casual Star Wars C&C clone. This is not what this game is, unless you're already good at such game. I feel like I would have enjoyed it more if I had time to learn and not be swept off the game board almost immeditly by huge fleets which can't physically have been created with only a starting credit cap if 5K. Inexperience is also a deciding factor. The tutorials are decent, but they don't really provide you with the load of how much you have to do and organise. Also, the reinforcement mechanic which the player is forced to use, but the AI can happily spawn tanks etc against you... is just broken. Also, don't bother playing the expansion. The 3rd faction is so OP that there is literally no point, unless you like seeing all of your ""owned"" worlds, completely corrupted and leeched within 30 seconds.Just glad I bought it on sale. If we consider £1 for 1 hour of play-time, I'd say the game at least achieved that.			"

												Horribly unbalanced and dated game.While the graphics may look appealing, even today, the gameplay is an entirely different story. Both on land and space battles, there are units and certain aspects of different factions that you can exploit to garantee a win. If you decide to play a conquest game, beware when fighting against the Empire. If they are able to build a death star, it can quickly decimate the areas you control. When defending against it in space, you will have a couple of minutes to try and destroy every last space craft the enemy has, before they'll be able to use the death star to instantly destory your space station or planet, forcing you to lose the battle. The Consortium is just as bad. While they have most of the cool and fun to use units, all of their units are designed to ignore your units shields, auto kill any fighters you have, etc. while they have individually shielded structures, and gain bonuses to what really matters (space station wise), hard points.Most larger ships and space stations have things called 'hard points', such as turbo lasers, ion canons, proton torpedos, engines, and shields. Once destroyed, they can not be recovered. While the Empire and Rebels usually can increase their shield strength or firepower, the Consortium increases the armor on their space stations hardpoints. Why this is so important is because each faction has at least one or two units that can bypass shields, usually missile ships or bombers, so shields aren't entirely important to bolster. Being able to better defend your hard points is a little more effective. As for on the ground, both the empire and rebellion have a unit that can fly, a special, unique kind of unit that ignores most rules of combat. Bolstering incredibly high mobility and decent firepower, they can skip the ground combat and go right for the enemies base. With a large enough force, most units wouldn't be able to shoot them down, while you quickly wittle away at their forces and structures. Seriously, they are just that powerful. This doesn't mean I hate the concept of this game. Rather, I hate how little thought and care was put into the game. It had the potential to be so much better, and I would love to see someone try and remake the game. I strongly recommend not buying the game for more than $6. "

												Sluggish controls, tactical map unit caps, and a real time macrostrategic map of the galaxy make this a pain. Yes, there's a pause button on the galactic map, but you can't do anything while paused like move fleets or build units. It only works on the tactical map. Also, some of the scenario maps seem glitched on tech levels. If you go to advanced settings and reduce the starting tech level while playing on hard, then you start with reduced technology but the computer starts with regular technology. Having X Wings, Y Wings, and basic frigates doesn't really match top of the line Imperial Star Destroyers.There's also no hold position command. You can tell units to stop, but it's very easy to lure or get lured, especially when units won't respond instantly after being lured. This creates a very annoying situation where rocket infantry wreck light tanks, anti-infantry vehicles wreck light infantry, and aircraft become pointless (although aircraft dominate easily until AA weapons are around). In space, it means fighters and bombers won't withdraw from cruisers, and larger ships that are slightly misoriented beacuse they advanced two inches too far take forever to turn around.The game really isn't that bad, but it's like they choked it for no good reason and ruined the experience. If the units were responsive, tactical map unit caps didn't exist, the galactic map was turn based instead of real time, and the pause button let you issue orders while paused, then this would be an easy thumbs up. I have no idea why they ruined their own game with arbitrary restrictions.			"

												I loved Galactic Battlegrounds and have enjoyed many others in the same genre, like C&C, AOE, etc.I feed stupid for saying it, but this was too difficult for me.  The first bit of the tutorial was a breeze, but as soon as the second one started, I was lost.  Drag this there.  Zoom in.  Click that.  I followed what I was told to do, but didn't have much comprehension as to why.  There was too much information given to me in that second tutorial and I was unable to absorb it in order to use that knowledge in-game.I skipped the rest of the tutorials and started a campaign (on easy) to see how much the information on the second tutorial impinged on the game.  On the second part of the campaign, I was presented with the world map - right there, I was lost.  I dragged R2-D2 onto the planet I was meant to, and did the same for a couple of troops, but when I zoomed in to that planet, it said the battle was starting so onto the ground I went.  Moved right a little while and found a laser turret, quickly followed by more troops than I had.  Didn't last long before I was wiped out.  The commentary said to call for reinforcements but I'd no idea how to do that.Should I have dragged more troops on before getting to the planet?  I understand that Empire at War can't just be more of the same that was presented in Galactic Battlegrounds, but this was too much of a departure/advancement for me.  I'd far rather be put on the planet and have to build my base before encountering the turret and troops - I could then have built more if needs be.Given I'm fine with other similar games, I blame the tutorial.  If it was anything like the one in C&C Red Alert 3, it could impart as much new information as it needed to without the user feeling lost.  I understand I'm in the minority here given 93% of users recommend this - perhaps if I sat with one of them and have them walk me though the basics, I'd have a better chance of enjoying this title, but as it is, I'm sadly deleting it in frustration.

												Terrible.  Before the expansion, Empire at War was a below average strategy/rts game that I went ahead and played sometimes anyway because it managed to pretty faithfully create a Star Wars feel.Then I bought Gold to get the expansion, even though I didn't enjoy the original very much.  I was thinking I would get some more ""hero"" characters and maybe the new faction would be nice.  The new faction is not nice.  Almost nothing that comes with the expansion is from Star Wars--most of the hero units you get are characters that I guess came from Expanded Universe or one of the animated series, or maybe created originally for the game.  Whatever they are, new hero units are terrible.  They don't fit with the original character and stand out like a fist-full of sore thumbs.Why fill my Rebel Alliance hero roster with all these off-brand characters such as ""Garm Bel Iblis"" when you still haven't added a Princess Leia character?  The new faction is the worst.  The Zann Consortium--a criminal empire, is made up almost entirely of ""Not from Star Wars"" units such as Urai Fenn, and Tyber Zahn.  Why not make it Jabba the Hutt's faction and use all the bounty hunters from Empire Strikes Back for the Hero units?  They did include IG-88 and Bossk at least, but overall this faction doesn't feel like it came from Star Wars at all.The Empire is full of weird characters too.  If this game has moved away from Star Wars, then why the Hell am I playing it?  Not for the gameplay, that's for sure.Space Battles are kind of fun.  They look good, and feel like Star Wars, at least until the new, wacky Zann Consortium ships show up.  Ground Battles are terrible and have been terrible since the original game was released.  Ground battles are clunky, simplistic, poorly balanced, and just plain not fun.  And now that there is a bunch of Not From Star Wars units running around, I'm just playing a poorly designed, generic sci-fi rts on the ground.So lame.The Strategic Game/Empire Management?  Not very good.  Kind of boring--you play it because its Star Wars and it vaguely feels like you are commanding the Empire/Rebellion.  Again, the more the game moves away from actual Star Wars units and feel, the more Im asing myself why I am playing a clunky, poorly designed RTS game.  The answer is, I'm not.  I'm done with this crappy game and I do not recommend that you buy it.			"

												I remember this game rather fondly when I played it when it  first came out a few years back, Playing it now I only have one word, for it: Stale.It's kinda hard to pin down why, because on paper it all should work. It's a Star Wars game where they add Ground control style combat on land, Star trek Armada Style space combat (which was a pretty good RTS, not AMAZING but it worked) with Hyperspacing mechanics that allow you to reinforce just about anywhere.  Complete with a ""Risk"" style map ripped from Dawn of War. EDIT: I derped, Dark crusade came after this  Sounds great right?Well it just doesn't play as well as it sounds on paper. Again it's  hard to describe but it all just feels so bland. The units aren't terribly interesting (except some heroes), the textures are plain, yet muddy, and it all feels like they took a lot of concepts that were AMAZING in other RTS games (Ground Control's Dropzone mechanics, CNC Tanks, Company of Heroes' Squads, Dawn of War: Dark Crusade's Risk map, Yes I am aware some of these came after this, but they still did it better) but didn't properly understand WHY those mechanics worked the way they did in those games and thus it ended up watering it all down.Granted if you are a fan of the Extended Universe before Disney De-canonized it you'll get a kick out of the extra units and characters (Where else will you have Kyle Kataran throw down with Mara Jade?). but all in all, to me it feels very bland and watered down.

												Imagine Total War scale battles but with Star Wars!  Now take away everything interesting about Total War and add in easily exploitable tactics and lots of spam!Empire at War may have been ""good"" a decade ago, when you were younger and thought it looked pretty and thought that Darth Vader was cool, but there's a bit more to a game than the characters in it and how nice it looks.  Like having ♥♥♥♥ing balance, and not making 95% of the battles boring because of the simplistic, stupid AI and arbitrary, manufactured maps that  slosh together.  The space battles are fun to watch play out, but the game likes to ♥♥♥♥ up and you'll have to work around the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unit management to get them to do what you want.In fact, just wait till Creative Assembly makes a Star Wars game, or get a mod for one of their games that does just that.  Because this, this isn't fun.  Playing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and pretending it's enjoyable because it has the star wars license is not fun.			"

												The expansion pack to this game, Forces of Corruption has containd a game breaking bug since it was initially released; to this date it has not been fixed.  The issues is noticed during the main campaign of the FoC; where, if a player corrupts a planet that one of the main characters is suppose to do a campaign mission on, then there is a chance that the character will become stuck on that planet, invisible.  The player will have no way to interact with the character or start the mission.  How you will notice, is that the character will suddenly vanish off of the map after completing the corruption mission.  No matter where you look, it won't be visible.  If you click on it's icon in the upper corner, it will direct you to the planet where the character was suppose to do the mission.  The reason is, because that character is stuck on the planet; just invisible.  This breaks the game.  The only thing you can do is return to an older save and avoid using corruption when you last did it.The fact that such an aggrivating bug exists in a released product, is enough to earn it a poor rating.Edit: I deleted some comments due to fallacies.  Just because you never experience a problem with a product; doesn't mean no problems exist.  You can go to the Star Wars wikipage for FoC and see the campaign bug mentioned on the page.  Granted it says that it was patched; but, obviously it wasn't done so effectively if it still persists for players.  There is literally a recent steam community discussion you can look up, where someone is describing the exact issue and multiple other members are trying to help them trouble shoot the issue.  The final concensus was: you guessed it, restart the campaign.			"

												Thanks Knalluminati, edited:I played this for a bit before realising just exactly the problem was. The core gameplay sucks. It's rock-paper-scissors with one item taken out. Combat is just boring spamming units and making sure they shoot the right thing. Even compared to older games like StarCraft and Age of Empires 2 this feels simplistic.On top of that, the management element in space is shallow and a matter of going-through-the-motions. I liked how the two factions are distinct, but there are so many better management and RTS games out there that it's not worth it at all.			"

												this falls short of letting the gamer live out epic moments from the starwars franchise in part due to poor economy managment, unbalanced factions and units, and very restricted battles that allow the use of few units most of which are left in ""storage"" until other units die. While the soundstrack and some of the animations have the look and feel of the starwars universe the gameplay itself is a mess and is not very fun to play. RTS and starwars fans alike should stayaway.This review does not take into account any mods made for this game			"

												Played this back when it first came out in 2010 or so. It crashed pretty frequently-- usually during cut scenes.It still crashes during cut scenes, which is basically all the time. And it's the type of crash that freezes the system, forcing a restart.----------------------Did some recommended updates and reinstalled the game. Runs pretty well now and it doesn't crash nearly as often (but it still does).The original is pretty fun. Really interesting game, scratches the ""star wars galactic conquest"" notion but there's some weird mechanics.Hero units are ridiculously overpowered. Remember when Chewbacca and Han Solo killed a swarm of stormtroopers and ATSTs? Me neither.During battles the defending base generates a free unit, and will regenerate the unit whenever it dies- giving the defender a suicide trooper to constantly use. You'll see this in the first battle-- xwings constantly flying to their deaths. Random troops constantly charging your ATST. The attacker brought 100 stormtroopers? Well, you're going to get a free unit every 10 seconds so send that SOB in. If the attacker doesn't rush you basically win. But then this gets ridiculous when you have a higher-end factory and you get a free tank squad constantly.And then the expansion breaks the game. Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge was a great game. Yuri was pretty imbalanced but still beatable. In this, the ""whatever they are/pirates"" basically can cast spells to literally ""take over entire system""-- and you're constantly ""uh... why'd I just lose that system?""And then they're on a different research tree. The Rebels and Empire research new/upgraded units and build those. The ""pirates"" research upgrades and then the units receive those benefits. Suddenly the 10 fighter swarms that die in seconds have shields and bombs and are decimating your forces. And the pirates are still dumping those level-1 units out for the same price.Stick with the original. Or find a game with mods.			"

												This game has the problem of being... no where near what I remember. When I first played it on the retail version it was really fun, and space combat is still fun, it's just that ground combat sucks♥♥♥♥♥ The campaigns were boring as hell and I couldn't complete them because of that and they still are and same deal, the game stops working when you want to blow up a planet outside of the normal space combat using the Death Star. This game is also, as quite a few people have been saying, extremely rock-paper-scissors, there's not real strategy to the game. It's pretty much build up a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of dudes and launch them at them. The graphics are pretty bad, but that would be dealable if the gameplay wasn't pretty bad as the only fun part of the game Galactic Conquest is ruined by the land combat, the Death Star bug (which never happened on my CD version ever it's only happened on Steam's version), and the Not RTS gameplay, not worth a buy just save that 19.99 for something better like KOTOR.

Wrong.First a couple of issues....if you already bought the game (on CD / retail box version) and wanted to play your friends that just got the game from steam's download.......you going to have huge problems playing them online, through steam.Frankly, it won't happen....you will have to figure out how to play though the game's internal multi-player Internet (which will want you to make yet another account , email and password)So, after 3 hours of frustration of the CD not wanting to update from version 1.01 to 1.5.....you desided ""FRAK IT"", and buy the game though steam.Well, be prepared to kiss $8 good-bye.......because after you paided for the game, and got it installed, you will get hit with steam's Error :: Failed to Contact Key Server.So...once again, a good running game that worked well on CD, has been turned to crap when downloaded threw steam.Thanks alot, Steam. --Way to Go.

												On Steam it says I've barely played this game, but I played a TON of it when it first came out and didn't have it on Steam. Anyways, it's an old game, and I HATE to say it, but it has not aged well. At all. In fact, if I ever play it again, it will be entirely for nostalgia's sake, unfortunately. The problem is the balance, especially in land battles. The way everything is set up just feels weird. It feels like vehicles can die too easily, the Empire infantry weirdly stack up into box formations that just doesn't really fit with the Star Wars atmosphere, and the rocket artillery on the Rebel's side is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥LY overpowered, to the point where they can almost take out your entire military force at the beginning of a match (yet when you use them, they don't feel nearly as powerful). It's just kind of a weird game, and yes, the space battles are cool, but they have also aged to the point where unfortunately, it's just not worth it anymore. The meta game  (galactic conquest or whatever it's called) is also weird. A lot of time there are strangely fast time limits to win the game, which annoys me because it gives little time to really develop a nice army and tech that can really do damage. And since it's all in real time, it sometimes devolves into a game of tag, where each side has their core planets, and then all the outlying planets are taken by one side, then taken by another, and so on and so forth, and this is due to the unit cap, which restricts you from truly building a large enough force to take over the empire. There's so many connections to all of the planets that it's not easy to actually form a stronghold, and while there is strategy in that, the game isn't quite good enough to compell you to want to develop the skills to master that strategy. I don't think I ever finished a single galactic conquest map. I ended up just reverting to multiplayer (which I can only assume is dead now).If you played the game before, and just want nostalgia to kick in, maybe pick it up on a sale, but if you've never played it before, I'd say move on to better RTS games.

												Star wars Empire at war is not the best RTS in the world with each faction haveing a differnt game play you think it would've been intersting right? Wrong! The game gets boring after a while due to a lack of units and reserch options. Its wierd and awkard to use ground forces and it glitches a lot.			"

												I like Starwars but this game controls like♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you right click repeatedly to move units(like any other ♥♥♥♥ing rts game) they just start twitching(right clicking restarts the walk animation  everytime). You can only click ONCE or nothing ♥♥♥♥ing happens. I don't feel like I'm fighting the empire it feels like I'm fighting with my own squad of dumbasses who would rather shoot down a wall rather than anything posing a threat. If you've never played an RTS and LOVE Starwars this will be great, If you have ever played starcraft or any of that just don't bother.			"

												I cannot reccomend this game because there has been no way to get the multiplayer to work in the entire time I have owned it. I have tried other user suggestions but it does not cooperate.For single player, space combat is great... land combat is terrible. THe land combat is a grind. I have never met someone who enjoys the land combat. Buy it for the space combat if its on sale for less than $10 but otherwise cannot reccomend given multiplayer problems			"

												Fantastic game for the most part. Typically keeps me entertained but eventually becomes painfully boring due to long hours searching for that last troop on a massive map. Also when fighters are put against one another (Like me vs NPC), the fighter icon goes next to the enemy fighter icon and nothing really happens. Also the drivers of the ships arent very smart either because they never attack or move where you want them to move.			"

												The space combat is simplistic, the ground combat is even simpler and very tedious, and the strategy map aspect of the game? You guessed it: Simple and basic. The old Rebellion mod for Homeworld 2 is better. Check out Sins of a Galactic Empire mod for Sins of a Solar Empire if you want Star Wars strategic combat. This is a rubbish game with an expensive license tacked on.			"

												It has potential. I like the idea with the galactic conquest where you have to attack the planet from space, then attack by land. The whole Galactic Conquest is really all it has going for it though, since multiplayer is soon to be shut down, and land battles suck so much. Space battles are good though. However, because the land battles suck so much, it even ruins the Galactic Conquest. That is the entire reason I really dont like this game. The land battles just completely destroy the experience for me. I dont understand the whole, click a button, and units go into automatic cover and are completely invinsible. I also dont understand the whole thing with 1 infantry can kick a tanks♥♥♥♥♥ For a person who has never played an RTS before, I'd say go for it, you'll get used to the whole combat system better than I did. If you are and RTS fan, then no, this game, in my honest opinion, sucks because the land battles just really, really make the game awful. If your just gonna buy it for the space battles, than go for it, but in that case get it on May 4th, but it is not worth the $20 price tag it has now. It had really good potential, but the land battles just totally destroyed the experience for me. I know I only played 3 hours, but it only took me 3 hours to just say forget it.			"

												This game makes me mad and i regret thinking it would be like Star Craft or Age of Empires. It looks and feels a lot like those games but it lacks the ballance opposition, clarity of objectives and ease of interaction that those games did so well. This game has the longest most-annoying tutorial i have ever seen in a game and STILL teaches you prectically nothing about how your units might be different in some way... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! By the time you finish the tutorial, you won't want to play it anymore.  Watch the idiotic AI stand there and get killed by the enemy while chase them all ofver the map when they run away! I like being able to micro manage my Army; i don't like being required to micro manage every move of every troop just to prevent them from doing the stupidest thing possible. I'm an expert RTS gamer, but this game is nothing but hot mess of confusion. How anyone can play it at all is beyond me.			"

												Unimaginative and poorly made.I bought this game thinking that ""Oh, I've always wanted to play a true Star Wars RTS!"" and was very excited when picking this up.  Sadly, I was met with poor gameplay mechanics, tiny maps, and unimaginitive features.  It feels like someone came up with this idea by saying: ""Hey, let's make a Star Wars RTS!""""That sounds like a great idea, what should we make it about?""""I don't know, lets wing it!""I'm not going to harp on how none of this makes sense lore-wise, because the fun and value is in the gameplay.  That being said, the gameplay is slow, repetative, and bland.  I played it for an hour-or-so, got off, and never wanted to go back.People claiming that this game is the ""Best Stragety in the Star Wars Franchise"" are, in my opinion, proping this game up too much.  There aren't many strategy games for Star Wars, but this is like saying ""Halo Wars is the best strategy of the Halo Franchise!""  Tl;dr if you are a fan of Star Wars or the RTS Genre, don't buy this game.			"

												I thought this would be more fun than it was. Seriously have to micromanage combat troops. And what made me dislike it the most was that it seemed that instead of combat strategy winning a situation, it was more about the numbers of troops. Although I still want to play more of it to win over part of the galaxy. I will probably find a way to cheat since my first battle was not saved, and the battle took a long time to finish in the demo (but I won several), but I don't think I was able to beat the first few battles in the actual game. Which is sort of frustrating that I could in the demo, but not in the actual game. idk, maybe the AI is much smarter in the full game.			"

												The first of the Star Wars titles to enter the grand strategy genre, Empire at War was highly anticipated but failed to meet expectations. Major flaws plague every aspect of the game. The developer made the poor decision to make the strategy map run in real-time rather than in a turn-based fashion, resulting in the need for constant pauses and frantic clicking; land battles are campy and boring; and space battles leave no room for tactics, as the bigger fleet nearly always wins by default. This game was created with an obvious degree of laziness, and the result is a frustrating experience. One can only assume that this arose from complacency on the part of the developer; perhaps it was believed that the Star Wars factor would compensate for the game's obvious shortcomings. If so, the developer was very incorrect. Don't buy this game.			"

												One of the best Star Wars games currently on sale, gives access to lots of different units and combat abilities, allowing for epic ground and space battles, well balanced factions, will you take down the Rebelion with the Empire, of liberate the galaxy from the tyranny of the Empire, or even take over the Zann Consortium and corrupt the entire galaxy This game brings real time stratagy to a new level, it is fully modable with lots of mods freely avalible.This game has both a single player campaign and a galactic conquest with different goals and tech levels, along with the ability to have all three sides fighting in a single player skirmish in a massive 1v1v1 space or land battle.If you are a Star Wars fan or just love real time strategy games, I would highly recomend this game.

Its tons of fun, you get to deploy from both space and ground and have large armies attack each other even though the limit count is 10 but if they were come out with another then it be unlimited^^I would have Army of AT-ATS Tie Walkers and the Rebels automatically surrender XD!

												This is the only Star Wars game i put over KOTOR in how much i like itI first picked the gold pack up a few years ago before i had steam, the game has 3 campaigns, one for the empire, one for the rebels, and in the forces of corruption expansion you get the consortium's campaign.The game looks great, although it dosent actualy look too good compared to the screenshots or other modern strategy games it holds up very well. It has a very good variety of units, although the balance on the consortium may be a bit off on the op side, its hard to notice when storming them with AT-ATs. The galactic conquest mode however is where most of your time will be spent, as it allows you to conquer the entire galaxy as your chosen faction. There is also skirmish mode but compared to the other modes you will not spend all that much time in them.10/10			"

												Quite an interesting RTS format, with a galaxy wide strategy mode and both space and land battles that are very exciting!Land battles are a bit different to typical RTS games, in that there's no real base building. The units you get for a battle are all the units you brought with you for the invasion, no more no less. You start out with just a few on the board, but by capturing control points around the map you can bring down additional forces via dropship.A few minor nitpicks: The 'accelerate game time' button (which you will use a lot, as you wait for buildings or units to be built in the galaxy overlay) isn't really that fast, and battles can feel a little sluggish at times.Apart from that though, definitely worth a look. There are mods out there for those who prefer Clone Wars battles, too!			"

												Decent RTS with a mixture of space and ground combat with some planetary management and heroes thrown into the mix. Now I can't say I was wowed by this game like I was with Homeworld or even the first time I delved into starcraft, but I also can't say that I was bored to tears by it. This game can be challenging at normal difficulty if you are like me an not a RTS master in ground combat, though space combat (what you REALLY look forward too) can be a bit too easy sometimes once you start fortifying your planets with high level space stations.

												Simply put. The venerable ""Mac Daddy"" of (non story driven) Star Wars video games.Sure theres a story but, who does that when you can conquer the Galaxy with a fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers, or crush the Imperial war effort with squadron upon squadron of X-wing fighters and Y-wing bombers, or even indulge your inner Hutt and corrupt the galaxy with slavery and intimidation.Sure the graphics are dated and theres a limited amount of playability in the main story. But with a host of mods online ranging from simple ship re designs to full scale Clone Wars overhauls (complete with Episode 1-3 heroes and villains from tv shows and movies), The range of galactic conquest ideas goes on and on, What happens if the Imperials wiped out Dantoine and Hoths rebel bases, what if the Rebellion retook courscaunt? It's all in your hands... or steam library so go on.Rule the Galaxy!			"

												Honesly one of my all time favorite RTS's. Its a blast and there really aren't any bugs that I'm aware of. There is one annoying thing though. When you're in Galactic Conquest, and it's paused, you are unable to move unit formations in a fleet until you unpause it. Just a minor annoyance, not even sure if it's a big or not.Honest score: 9/10 Very very fun, especially with mods. Just be weary about any AI's over easy in Galactic Conquest; They'll bombard you with attacks that hold like 30+ infantry or fighters or something mundane to defend against. Also, auto-resolve is horrible, don't trust it. You'll lose waaaaaaaaaay more than you would normally. The way auto-resolve works is dumb, it's a number game; Whoever has more units, will almost always win (the game counts unit points, so 3 or 4 fighters (in a large battle) is equal to a capital ship)			"

It is like Star Wars and Total War had sex, then this is the third-trimester aborted result of that sex. It is alright, if you are really into star wars. It is alright if you want a casual strategy game. However, there are better examples of both genres out there.			"

While at the same time, finally gives a chance for the player to engage into epic battles between the Empire, Rebels, and the Zahn Consotrium.  Finaly pit your Calamari captial ship against Emperial Star Destroyers and watch the carnage unfold.  Many hours can be spent playing campaign mode.  Or just get in and play a ground or space skirmish.  The choice is yours!			"

												this is an excelent star wars game, and easily one of the greatest strategy games of all time, it offeres hours of fun and although they shut down multiplayer, its modability still makes it enjoyable. and any star wars fan must at least try this game. 11/10 worth every penny also get the legacy mod, it greatly improves the game			"

												This game is the best of all the series posted here on Steam. If your looking for a game to micro manage units, build complex bases and defence, and lots more this is the game for you. Think of it as CIV 5 , expect better in everyway. You get to move units in real time no ""taking turns"", if you attack a planet ( city ) you get to send in your infantry/tanks/etc giving them specific orders of where to go, and depending on that, how much damage you will do to their base. Even with a simple squad of infantry, they can sneak around and destroy a building before escaping, breaking down your enemies defences for the main armada.The only bad thing about this game is that the developers left the game alone. And in turn  leaving the multiplayer lacking in players and ""issues"" take some time to fix if they do.Overall: a great game that more developers should look up to and reach for this games level of complexity. The graphics are still pretty decent for being made around 2009 and later.. which i can't say for some of these newer games like ""Rust"".			"

												This game is truly a treat to strategy gamers.I would call myself a strategy fanatic since mostly the only games I ever play are strategy, and I will easily recommend this as being one of my top five. After the Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds installments, it seemed pretty hard to be able to follow up another decent strategy without making it too modernised and missing out key elements that make true strategy games, especially a Star Wars one also. But I can truly say they pulled it off with this game. This game is a crystal to the RTS genre and provides players with the ability to be able to Strategically take over the Galaxy, as three different factions fight for power - you have to use all assets at your disposal to assert your faction above others. This power can be asserted by RTS space battles, in which huge fleets massacre eachother, or in RTS ground battles, where every unit has a weakness and strength, meaning that combat must be played strategically.I recommend this game to anyone looking in the RTS genre, as even for the 20+ hours i've played it, it is a gem to the RTS genre.

												  I bought this game on May the 4th (thanks Gaben) and I've been wanting it for a long time after wtaching some gameplay videos and it was really fun. You could do skirmish, campaign and multiplayer (which doesn't work unfortunately). skirmish is where you could chose a space or land battle, and chose any map, then you would face off some bots. Multiplayer (I imagine) is where you could chose a land or space battle and then after trying to find a match you would face-off an actual person. You would need lots of patience to play this game because if you play skirmish or multiplayer it would usually take a long time since you need to slowly level up to the highest level in order to attack. Campaign is just, well campaign. As the Empire, your goal (I'm guessing) is to conquer as much planets as possibe until the enemy (or Jedi) has been defeated. Same thing works with Jedi as well. Overall this is a very good game and I recomend it.			"

But single player or multiplayer skirmishes in space are what really makes me come back to play this game every once in a while. Despite its age its still a pretty fun game. Getting to use the Death Star and Vader's Flagship make this game really exciting as the Empire. And the mods folks have put together for the clone wars are pretty awesome too. 7.5/10			"

It is alright if you want a casual strategy game. However, there are better examples of both genres out there.			"

Whether its campaign, skirmish, or galactic conquest, you can liberate, dominate, or corrupt the entire galaxy as you wish.

												Now this is a game I've been playing since 2006. Star Wars never had any good strategy games (Galactic Battlegrounds was just a pallette swap of Age of Empires II) until this game came out. This game has great graphics and has incredible customization and mod potential. This game is more about macro-managment, it's always great to see fleets collide and trade fire above a contested planet. Think of this as a poor man's version of the Total War series - more approachable and action oriented with lots of lasers and explosions. Can't foget those.			"

												Empire at war is pretty fun. The mixed Space and land battles are an excellent switch from just plain old on the ground fighting (not that that isn't fun). The game is even better in galactic conquest, however the game is not very Tactical and doesnt have a complex unit pool or tactics, and can get pretty dry after awhile unless your playing online, against friends; or unless your a die hard Star Wars fan. But either way, it offers me a no nonsense Strategy game when I dont wanna worry about complex resources, and just get in there and blow something up. And empire at war will deliver that, every single time. Cheers.			"

												I first played Empire at War when I was 9 and I have been hooked ever since. Now I'm 15 and I am still loving it. Although I personally never get tired of Story Mode and Galactic Conquest Mode, I occasionally look up mods (this game has some of the best mods of all time, even if you don't have the DLC expansion pack) and I love those too. I usually compare this game to Halo Wars on Xbox 360. The gameplay is very similar to upgrading buildings and telling troops where to go on the battlefield, and the space combat is exactly the same. There is an out of battle part of the gameplay (unless playing Skirmish Mode) where you send fleets and troops to other planets to attack, reinforce, or retreat. You also train troops and build ships and space stations for when you actually fight in this part of the game. There are heroes in the game you can play as (Darth Vader, Boba Fett, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker (Red Squadron in base game only, Jedi Knight in DLC only), Yoda, and more). This game was a gateway drug to strategy games for me and I was obviously attracted to it as a Star Wars fanboy, but this really did get me into strategy games. The only thing I might be worried about is the fanboy level in this game. If you are not a fanboy, this game is still worth trying, but you might get bored way too early.			"

												If you like Star Wars or science fiction in general, and have an interest in real time strategy, I recommend this one. In single player there is the option to pause even during battle, so you don't have to worry about controlling all of your units with keyboard inputs.The space battles are the highlight, I personally enjoy the ground battles as well though. I have had limited success with the multiplayer. In gameplay terms, the Empire is more about brute force, the Rebels are about smart tactics. So you can look at it and see the Empire as easy mode and the Rebels as hard mode, or being two different playstyles.Though if you enjoy messing stuff up, play Force of Corruption and take Darth Vader into a space battle. Super Star Destroyer > All.			"

												I am mostly going to review the Forces of Corruption expansion and compare it to the base game. Although I will also say that this is one of the best Real-time strategy games I have played so far. The new things that were added to the campaign are the ability to sabotage Rebel or Empire bases in other planets as well as the ability to view their formations secretly. The expansion also gave the ability to travel to other systems undetected using bribery, which could prove extremely useful if you do not want to engage a considerable fleet and rather just simply bypass them. Although the Zann Consortium has only 4 buildings in which it can produce units which is a drawback for me as the enemy AI has fewer buildings to destroy in Skirmish or Galactic Conquest mode, it is rectified by the ability to corrupt planets in the Campaign or GC mode. Once you corrupt a planet, either Rebel or Empire, you have the ability to acheive a unit exclusive to it (such as a Tartan Patrol Cruiser or a Marauder-Class corvette) using the balck market and other benefits such as Bribery and Corrupt Militia. The best addition to the game is that they added a few more units in skirmish mode, in addition to more buildables in skirmish games. The new units and ships in-game means that you would have more options into bringing reinforcements as opposed to just simply generating all the units and sending them all in one skirmish game. Another great addition is that three-way battles are now playable on certain maps in both land and space battles as well as the AI in skirmish games improving considerably.  Even though the Zann Consortium has fewer ships and units than the Rebels and The Empire, they rectify it with the firepower they have such as the Aggressor-class Star Destroyer and the Destroyer Droid Mark II. Overall, this expansion had more postive aspects than negative ones and I enjoyed the additions this game had to offer. Dissapointing to note though is that they completely shut down the multiplayer servers back in 2014. At least the LAN option is still available.			"

												I onw nearly every RTS and 4X pc game, and this one is still my personal favorite. The modding community in this game is amazing. The vanilla game is a great experience on it's own, but the mods you can get on ModB turn this game into something that you won't find elswhere.			"

												I'm only recommending this game as it has a great story, as well as you being capable of commanding fleets and such into battle, though it's sad that online play was discontinued. Tried playing this via LAN with a friend through a virtual LAN emulation program, and it still will not work (much Googling was done) so it's practically a single player game now. :(			"

												If you enjoy Star Wars then this is a must! I have yet to play a better Star Wars game. The ability to not only build a space army, but also build land defenses and bases makes this the perfect combination of everything that made the movie battles so exciting. Forces of Corruption added even more to the game with the introduction of the 3rd faction and new units for Empire and Rebels. No matter what side you play you are sure to have an awesome time.			"

												go 500+ Hours on this game and never was their a time that i felt that it was slow or boring although the base game can be ""Lackluster at times"" that's where the sprit of the modidng community comes in. With a varity to choose from (Personal favourites being Alliance mod, Star wars the clone wars, and Yoden 2017 mod this game is now 11 years old and is still managing to keep up with triple a tiltles today. The only Negative i can think of is that mods can be probelmatic and rage-indusing for beginners because there are sometimes hiccups in installion Final verdict 9.9999999/10  "

												A great strategy game for Star Wars fans. From blowing up Alderaan to destroying the Death Star, space battles is where Empire at War thrives the most. The space battles are as good as most sci-fi, strategy games today. The ground battles are enjoyable, but not as enjoyable as games like Age of Empires 1 and 2. The campaigns are alright and do expand on the EU and some missions are really enjoyable. The Galactic Conquest mode is probably the best gamemode for Empire at War because it allows you to build the Death Star as the Empire and yes you can blow up planets. You can also conquer planets from the movies, like Tatooine and Coruscant. The expansion pack even takes the game further, by adding a new faction and allowing the Empre and the Rebellion the ability t build new ships like Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer (Galactic Conquest only). Also, the mods for Empire at War expand the galaxy even more. Empire at War is a great game for Star Wars and strategy games fans everywhere and I highly reccomend it to anyone reading this.			"

												As a strategy game, Empire at War delivers a true Star Wars experience. If you're into AT-ATs stomping around battlefields, Darth Vader knocking over 20 soldiers with Force push, or space battles thick with dozens of fighters swarming in between gargantuan capital ships, Empire at War will deliver all that in a fun, compelling package. You can't really lose in any game in which you can blow up a planet with the Death Star, can you? Combined with a presentation that is as epic as the films that inspired the game and a slick, dual-layered strategy design, Empire at War is easily recommendable to any strategy fan, especially those who are fond of George Lucas' space classic.

												Jedi can be killed. Same with Sith. Just send in some tanks. A lot of them. You know what? Forget it, it'd take too long to raise the funds to kill one Jedi. That's what I learned. Playing as the Consortium made me feel bad for all those faceless, nameless, untrained bad guys I killed in KOTOR 2. That sense of hopelessness that you cannot kill a Jedi, no matter what you did. Overall, 8.9/10. This game is great but the replay-ability is kind of whack after conquering the Galaxy 6 times, corrupting over 90 planets. At least I killed Luke 2 times, Vader 3 times (once in the Bespin level), and the Emperor 17 times. Obi-Wan, why must you always run away?			"

												""I love this game how it has that relationship with Total War games. Although it has totally different ways than Total War Games"".One of the best Sc-Fi games I have ever played. Better to play the game with the DLC which includes transports and bombardments. Would recommend if you are a big Star Wars fan!			"

												This Game is incredible! I just bought it a few days ago, and It is, to me, the perfect RTS. I love Star Wars, and this game doesnt disappoint. I love that In order to control a planet, you have to fight in Space, AND land, Both missions are awesome. I love that You can use the Death Star, and how simple and easy to play, and yet complex to master. I have played RTS from C&C Red alert and Generals, to Starcraft 2, and this Game is my second favorite or first. SO fun! get it, you wont regret it!			"

												A good bundle and a good set of games, with one serious flaw....The Forces of Corruption mission to Saleucami is corrupted, this has been a known issue since 2006. There is a work around, you must choose to corrupt the planet via the option that DOES NOT require the hero Urai Fen. Using him will cause him to glitch out and he will be unusable for the rest of the game, which is a game breaking glitch. You will either have to start all over or load an earlier save.Other than this serious glitch, the game is very fun, both the original game and the expansion. The original game has no glitch that i have experienced.Because the game is so old, the multiplayer function DOES NOT work, it says so in the game details if you missed that part.			"

												Good game, alot of fun, also a bit of good and bad. Firstly the battles are very enjoyable, Sometimes the AI will scum you but you can do the same thing to the AI if you play correctly. One issue I have is with the republic campaign, it is centered around the time prior to the movie A New Hope and continues until the end of said movie. This very much disapoints me because content from the other two original movies would have made for an amazing campaign. I would have loved to fight the battle of Hoth, or blow up the Death Star a second time. Other then that, and the population limits on the battlefield I would say this is a good game; I have had hours of fun with it and I am sure any other Star Wars fan would also.			"

Except for the online part... but they have a note on the Steam page saying the online support went away back in 2014. Game is a fun RTS though. Supreme Commander is slightly similar.

I flew them out to a random planet with no space garrison and dealt with an attack from the Rebels. I heard an explosion and checked my notifications.

												This game rocks. I've always loved rts and I've always loved star wars and this game really does a great job of combining the two. The split between empire-building by controlling and upgrading facilities on different star systems and the real time strategy of both space and land skirmishes remind me a of the Total War franchise and I like it a lot.The real time missions though are what gets me. You can just jump right into them from the main menu without doing a campaign - a live action space or land battle at your fingertips. Did you ever have those little figurines off the millenium falcon or of some star destroyers or x-wings? I used to play with those things; flying them around and making up little battles and narratives to go with them. This game gives you what you always wanted that experience to be. Good sized fleets and armies to fight even though you'll still find yourself wanting more. There are a couple of maps that allow you to fight more than one AI but not too many. The game does allow for the play of custom maps which is really neat in concept, if a little bit of a hassle to get too for....uh. well lazy people like me when it comes to these things. Overall this game is great and I would definitely reccomend it. Disney, this game would make for a great sequel, especially with the great reception of the recent Total War games (once the bugs were fixed). I would love bigger maps!			"

You can make your own dream scenarios in the map editor (which is somewhat confusing but I figured it out after awhile and it's simple for quick skirmish maps.) Modding gives it high replayablity as well. It's a shame GameSpy (I think they were called?) shutdown all the servers... you can still play LAN though if you have buddies nearby if you want to play multiplayer.			"

												It's a very interesting game, you have elements of a 4x4 game, a normal RTS game, and capture point RTS.Simple explantion of a game: Many planets, some have perks. You first sent your fleet over, than you attack it and take control. You have pre-made units that you deploy to the plant. Than you build on the planet whatever you want. I enjoyed the concept that you need more than one fleet to protect choke point planets and sometimes you need a ground presence, but generally if your fleet is destroyed and your planted is invaded it's not going to be much of a battle because you can only keep ""X"" amount of units actually on a planet. The game starts to go wrong half way through the game:1. Space battles. As the Empire you can not build normal tie fighters, they come from your crusiers. The Empire does feel stronger in space when you are the rebels, but when you play them they are capped at 20 compared to Rebels being caped at 25. Which would be fine, but you're two major big ships cost more points compared to the Rebels big ships. Overall the space battles are interesting but at the same time you're fleet doesn't seem to respond very well to what you want them to do. More so when you hit a ships special ability. 2. Ground battles When you play as the rebels your missle soilders are a key fuction, they deal a great deal of damage to vehicels. When you play as the Empire they seem to do even more against you. Which is fine in the long run, yet as the Empire you don't have any missle toting storm troopers. Vehicles are too easily defeated, they seem to die quicker than soilders. More so they don't seem to deal a lot of damage, even the big ATT shots at the rebels soilders and the damage isn't near what you would think it would be. Yet somehow you need them.The speeder bikes for the Empire are sort of pointless. They are suppose to drop a little bomb, but by the time you click on it your bike is blown apart, and your lone storm trooper is doomed. They are meant for exploring and doing quick bombing runs but it never works out. You don't need to scout...You know there are a ton of baddies (or goodies-depends how you feel about the rebels) in the location where you are sending them.The Rebels assult speeder is basically untouchable, nothing the rebels have can really damage it. It's not like they do a lot of damage, but they can bring down your ATT with the cable lines. Since none of their soilders or tech have something to bring a flying unit down you have to hope there is a pod where you can build a missle bay. Even than your range is very limited. The main isssue is the balance, there is not a lot of countering. Your standard battle is mostly about getting another capture point to bring in more units, and getting close enough to do a bombing run which destroys a building in one shot along with anything around it.  It's pretty much a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥contest latter in the game and you fighting till you can bomb again, 2-3 bombing and a capture point is how you win.  Strategy goes out the window. With that said it's a fun game and even when the game isn't on sale it's worth playing. This is one of the games where it's not a thumbs up or a thumbs down, it's just OKAY. Hardcore Star war fans will probably love it, but it just seems like they could have done a lot more with the game.  "

And in SWEAW: Forces of corruption they focused too much on the Zann Consortium and it would also be nice to have the Hutt Cartel as a Playable faction Or atleast a NPC Only faction. It may not be the best Star Wars games out there but its one of the few SW RTS Games Out there. I rate this 8/10			"

												This game is great and all already. But it's nothing compare to all the mods you can get for free. Thrawn's Revenge, Republic At War, Rise of the Mandalorians, etc. These are some of the best mods available for this already amazing game. Many issues in this game can be fix with these mods.			"

If you are familiar and comfortable installing mods, this game has a very large and quality selection on MODDB and other sites (recommend Absolute Corruption mod). If you enjoy RTS's give this game a shot and watch out for the SSDs!			"

												This game was a gem for me when i was younger, it was... it is still amazing, i really hope that there will be more Star Wars RTS games in the future.Pros:+AT-ATs!+Almost every single (MILITARY) vehicle known to Star Wars and more!+Space combat is very fun, but so is ground.+NPCs on certain planets, ex: Tusken Raiders on Tatooine, will attack you.+Voice acting is great, Boba Fett sounds just like a Clone! (he is supposed to)Cons:-AIs seem to cheat? Or gain troops faster, even though you are trying to build up.-Some units move strangely, can't do certain actions like move through a canyon on Hoth that clearly they could!-Only GOOD Star Wars RTS. (This could be positive, but it's negative because i want more of them)-The Add-On: Forces of Corruption didn't feel very complete/fulfilling.			"

												Let me start by saying this game is not flawless by any means. It can be a bit simple, especially compared to other RTS games like Starcraft. However, the voice acting, character design, references to the explanded universe, and multitude of units make this game a ton of fun for a seasoned star wars veteran, and nothing beats getting into a space battle and bringing in the Executor, Vader's mammoth star destroyer, and ripping your enemies in two. Similiarly the ground battles are a ton of fun. My main complaint with this game is in its expansion, Forces of Corruption. It adds another faction to the mix, that in my opinion is incredibly unbalanced, particularly in Galaxy Conquest where their use of Defilers can constantly destroy building, requiring you to clear the corruption with either Thrawn, Vader or the Emporer. Overall a great game, witha few nagging problems.			"

The space battles feel amazing with a large amount of detail being put in such as subsystems and fighter craft. With all of the above and the battlecamera it makes for some amazing screenshots. However I would like to see the AI fixing a bit, they are a bit too unforgiving on easy and are able to magic fleets seeminly from thin air. But it is not impossible just a challange.			"

												Personally, as a casual strategist, I think that this is a really great and fun game. Overall, most of the controls and mechanics are solid, and of course it doesn't look fabulous, but the graphics are not bad and, to me, the game looks fine. Besides, a little less graphical quality helps it run better on non-dedicated gaming machines. The AI in the game are not super hard, and you will find things about bad ground AI, but to me the AI in ground battles has been fine, and the space battle AI is still good. Really huge Star Wars fans would love this game, as well as many casual strategists.Rebel campaign, in my opinion, seems a little harder early on - you don't really have a ship equal to light Imperial cruisers, though you do have bombers.Besides, some of the space battles can get pretty awesome, with large fleets of Star Destroyers or Mon Calamari ships.For those who don't want to do a lengthy campaign, there is a solid skirmish mode.Overall, a solid game that looks alright and is pretty fun for most strategists.SIDE NOTE: One of my favorite, somewhat ridiculous battles that I had was as the empire in the campaign mode.(LOOKS AT INCOMING FLEET) 1 missile ship, okay.6 corellian corvettes: my Acclamators can handle them.21 squadrons of Z-(21?)s: That's alot.56 squadrons of X-wings: This is going to take a while.Proceeds to epic battle as hordes of X-wings pummel helpessly at the shields of my Cruisers as they laser the Corvettes into oblivion and then slowly mop up X-wings, since they are not good anti-fighter ships.

												I've played these games (EAW and FOC) since they came out and bought the gold pack on steam a while ago.The campaigns are fun and interesting if you're a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy. In EAW you may play as empire or rebels. While two different stories they both lead up to the construction of the death star.In FOC you are a third factor, the pirates of the Zann Consortium, and the time line is from some time before Return of the jedi and beyond.There are still some bugs in there, and if you want a competive RTS there are better options due to bad game balance. In particular this is a problem in the expansion where the Zann Consortium are ridiculously powerful. But if you are a Star Wars fan you will love this game and spend many hours in single player mode.			"

												This is a great addition to the Star Wars gaming universe. Although it is ancient, it's still a really good and entertaining game and boasts a great real time strategy campaign system. Playing as the Empire or the Rebels, one can see what it is like commanding the armies that participated in the Galactic Civil War. You have the fate of the galaxy resting in your hands. How will you win? By Rebel subterfuge? Or by blowing up Rebel planets with the infamous Death Star I.Empire at War Forces of Corruption was alright. I liked some of the additions but the campaign was ultimately a little dull and rushed. If one plays as the Zann Consortium, the game is really easy. If not, you will get screwed by them. The new planets were cool. I also liked some of the Empire troops like Dark Troopers and Tie Interceptors.Ultimately, this game is worth the money. Getting the RaW (Republic at War) mod is also pretty cool as it takes the scope to new levels but that is independent of Steam. Good buy. Been playing this game for almost ten years since it came out and it hasn't gotten old.			"

												A older game in which you play as the overall commander of either three sides, the Empire, the Rebellion, or the new faction, The Zann Consortium. Throughout this game you build ships, fighters, vehicles and troops. Furthermore you get to fight with these forces in space and on the ground on any number of different planets and space areas. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Star Wars and not hugely in depth RTS games, just wants a okay RTS with an amazing campaign, or just wants to blast apart your enemies with a star destroyer.

												The game is fun, especially if you play as Tyber Zann, because it introduces a new concept to Star Wars games: CRIME. The Zann Consortium is infinitely more interesting than most Star Wars factions, at least to me.Simply put, the only issue with the game is repetition. The game itself really only offers 2 single player modes: campaign and conquest. The former has a short storyline that you can beat in a couple of hours (if you take your time) and conquest is just capturing planets, over and over again. This is essentially the same for multiplayer.The bottom line: If this game is on sale for a few bucks, I'd say it's worth it but I wouldn't suggest spending 20 bucks on it. It simply doesn't provide enough replay value, unless you reinstall it once a year or so.			"

												The game was first released in 2006, and the graphics are very much of that time.  But the gameplay is still a classic in terms of strategy base-building games.  There is a narrative to the game but that is mainly to flesh out a plot for you for to build an army and to attack and invade planets.  Ground warfare consists of taking landing zones to gain not only a foothold on the planet, however, it is also to increase the size of your army due to the cap level placed, and as your tech upgrades furthers your army's capabilities, so does it make your space fleet stronger, and space is the gem of where this game is at.  Corruption brings to bear all that is shown in Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi, employing everything from X Wing and Tie fights, to superstar destroyers and death stars.  Quite simply, this game is brilliant, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to play a simple build and conquer game.			"

												The concept of this game is pretty fantasitc. Other RTS's, such as: Warcraft III and Starcraft and Command and Conqore with Red Alert as well, you build your base and then your army, and then you attack/defend. This game you build your base  on other planets, then your army, then you take your army and attack the enemy base which is on another planet. The ideal behind this is the person playing defense has the advantage. They have factories that will constantly put out troops, while you are limited to the troops that you brought. You attack their space station and their defenses, while they continually get backup. So you have to work quick to bring them down. Making this a unique and interesting approach to the classic RTSHowever this game is not without its quirks. It is starting to show age and some of the units are not fully balanced. But since the multiplayer really never kicked off, they didnt keep messing with it. Yet this doesnt take away from the fact that it is a fun game to play, especially when you are with your buddies/roomies and just have a lan party for an hour or so, or just play single player. The skirmish battles with a hard AI is quite the challenge.So dispite its setbacks, this game still pleases, even after all these years.8/10			"

												One of the best RTS games ever made and probably amongst the best Star Wars games, too.In Empire at War, you'll have the option to command three factions (assuming you have the Gold Edition): The Galactic Empire, the Rebel Alliance and the Zann Consortium. Each faction has dozens of unique unities with unique habilities assinged to them. There are many modes of play available, including a campaing for each of the factions, the Galactic Conquest mode, which will have you using the best of your habilites to complete specific objectives in the galactic map and the well known skirmish mode. There is also, of course, multiplayer.Graphics are great, sound effects are flawless, soundtrack lends from most of the original tracks from the trilogy of movies, so you can bet your♥♥♥♥♥there is going to be some great music playing while you blast your way through the galaxy with the Death Star at your side. All the characters you expect to see will be there plus a few more. Played this game pretty much in every possible way before I got bored back when it came out.  Replayed it on Steam all these years later and it haven't aged a day, still had fun with it. If you're a fan of the genre, there is not much to think about. There might be a few flaws here and there, like the camera zoom being locked pretty closed and the actual amount of units permitted per battle being rather low, but this game is unbelievably good. Get it.Gameplay - 7/10Soundtrack - 10/10Graphics - 7/10Content - 8/10Challenge Level - 8/10Replayability - 8/10			"

												i'm not very good at RTS games, mostly playing the UFO: aftermath,Aftershock games, Halo wars and Xcom games..but i'm enjoying this game tremendously.  havent tried forces of corruption cuz i want to beat it as rebels, then reclaim it as the empire and then move onto corruption, but so far it's been fun.  one gripe i have is with protecting npc's in a warzone.  i have always hated escort missions, and in the heat of battle i dont want to have to micromanage some idiot npc that wants to charge headfirst into battle while im trying to take down a power generator (im looking at you Rebel pilots on Fresia).  but, im sure that's just a small part of the game, other then that im enjoying it, and the graphics arent too bad.  however, if anyone has any advice for an RTS novice, i'd welcome the help ^^Update: still liking the game, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ some of those space battles are unbalanced lol			"

												A suprisingly good starwars game despite the glut of terrible ones produced by the late Lucas Arts.  It has a very strange system that I have not seen in a game that I remember.  You have the campaign map, but it is not static.  You generate money pretty quick and the enemy can attack you at anytime.  The land and space battles are similar to say what total war is on a much smaller and different scale, but there is no pause after on the campaign.  The difference in difficulty between the rebel campaign and the imperial campaign is huge.  As the empire you should have no problem steam rolling the alliance.  Imperial ships are heavily armored, carry free tie fighters, and have more fire power than most rebel ships.  Your land units will also destroy people.  ATATs can produce squads of free storm troopers meaning you have the best anti veicle and decent anti infantry that cost nothing.  The alliance campaign on the other hand can be frusturating.  Get read to have the auto resolve tell you that your fleet can own 10 victory star destroyers only to play it out and be destroyed.  Because you rely on figters so much, and the Y wing is your only chance against imperial capital ships, its devastating when a Tantun cruiser kills almost all of them in 10 seconds.  Managing ships is hard.  With the empire you just send in your gugernauts and they kill everything.  With the alliance untill you get the assault frigate expect to see your capital ships blown out of orbit.  The nebulon B frigate (medical frigate) is really only good at giving Luke a robot arm and being blown to peices.  Luckily even if you cant hold space, you can hold planet surfaces if you invest in defenses.  The battles can be tense though.  But just as shields are hard for you, they are for the enemy.  Rebel infantry are really good, just watch out for the over powered tie maulers who can just run your entire army over at 60mph.  Still the best starwars RTS I can think of, and there are lots of mods.  I think there is even a 40k mod.			"

												I've been wanting to check out this game for a while, and now that I've played it, I'm happy I did.From my initial experience, the tutorials only give you the basics of how to play (even the advanced tutorials). So when I was playing my first skirmish, I found myself being bombarded leading to an embarrassing defeat. This in no way was a negative thing, for those that might be deterred by games that are difficult initially. The real learning experience and enjoyment comes from learning your own way around (which really shouldn't take over a few hours) and then seeing your strategies come to life as you obliterate those rebel scum!If you're a lover of RTS games or even just strategy, I implore you to play this.

												This game rocks. I've always loved rts and I've always loved star wars and this game really does a great job of combining the two. The split between empire-building by controlling and upgrading facilities on different star systems and the real time strategy of both space and land skirmishes remind me a of the Total War franchise and I like it a lot.The real time missions though are what gets me. You can just jump right into them from the main menu without doing a campaign - a live action space or land battle at your fingertips. Did you ever have those little figurines off the millenium falcon or of some star destroyers or x-wings? I used to play with those things; flying them around and making up little battles and narratives to go with them. This game gives you what you always wanted that experience to be. Good sized fleets and armies to fight even though you'll still find yourself wanting more. There are a couple of maps that allow you to fight more than one AI but not too many. The game does allow for the play of custom maps which is really neat in concept, if a little bit of a hassle to get too for....uh. well lazy people like me when it comes to these things. Overall this game is great and I would definitely reccomend it. Disney, this game would make for a great sequel, especially with the great reception of the recent Total War games (once the bugs were fixed). I would love bigger maps!			"

												Is this a good strategy game? I find your lack of faith disturbing!Diverse battles in land on space where new environments present new challanges, and two diverse sides (three with DLC) provide a variety of diverse and iconic units to do battle with. The conquest mode allows strategy to be complemented attacking and defensive thinking. If thats not your style the instant action modes allow you to go straight to the action and build up age of empires style in a single battle.My personal highlight was in a s rebels in conquest fighting of 6 different imperial invasion of my space using just a couple of squads of x wings and y wings (and a handy nebula with electrical storms).

												The concept of this game is pretty fantasitc. Other RTS's, such as: Warcraft III and Starcraft and Command and Conqore with Red Alert as well, you build your base and then your army, and then you attack/defend. This game you build your base  on other planets, then your army, then you take your army and attack the enemy base which is on another planet. The ideal behind this is the person playing defense has the advantage. They have factories that will constantly put out troops, while you are limited to the troops that you brought. You attack their space station and their defenses, while they continually get backup. So you have to work quick to bring them down. Making this a unique and interesting approach to the classic RTSHowever this game is not without its quirks. It is starting to show age and some of the units are not fully balanced. But since the multiplayer really never kicked off, they didnt keep messing with it. Yet this doesnt take away from the fact that it is a fun game to play, especially when you are with your buddies/roomies and just have a lan party for an hour or so, or just play single player. The skirmish battles with a hard AI is quite the challenge.So dispite its setbacks, this game still pleases, even after all these years.8/10			"

												I had the disc version and lost it so I had to wait a year or two but the game is better than ever. Campaigns are what make this game shine in my opinion. But if you get old of the regular game then hit up Youtube or Moddb and get some mods. There's still a modding community for this game after all these years and its only growing stronger and bigger.""I remember when there was this thing called Gamespy.

												I don't know what it is, but something about this game keeps bringing me back, and I have logged countless hours playing it now. For those who don't know, there is a rather extensive list of mods available for the game. My personal favorite is AEM, the Absolute Enhancement Mod. It adds tons of new units and raises unit caps in both space and ground battles, and just overall makes the game even more fun.			"

												A must buy for any Star Wars fan who happens to love RTS games. The space battles and gameplay are what make the game for me. Galactic conquest is awesome and is somewhat similar to the mode found in Battlefront II. Ultimately, I rate this game a 9.5/10. Only down side is that it doesn't include any ships/units from Episodes I-III, but that is easily fixed with a mod.			"

Since the Gold Pack included Forces of Corruption (wich is the sequel) it offers even more game play then just Star Wars Empire at War. So if you asked me I would say bye the game and enjoy the fun times destroying your enemys on ground in space or conquering the whole galaxy!- Written by Rj Jones 14 year old			"

												The campagin is interesting, as its made in a way that I have yet to be seen done. The gameplay seems good enough and the game itself has aged fairly well especially with mod support. The main issue that I have with the game is the CD key issues that were happening during a sale and apparently I cannot play online because the key Valve gave me is invalid. If it works then the online goes down on the 30th and I know no way of hosting a private server. If you are interested in playing a good star wars game that isnt simple then this is a good one to play, but only for single player, if you want to play online with friends like I did then you will be very disapointed and is a must not buy.

												If you like Star Wars or science fiction in general, and have an interest in real time strategy, I recommend this one. In single player there is the option to pause even during battle, so you don't have to worry about controlling all of your units with keyboard inputs.The space battles are the highlight, I personally enjoy the ground battles as well though. I have had limited success with the multiplayer. In gameplay terms, the Empire is more about brute force, the Rebels are about smart tactics. So you can look at it and see the Empire as easy mode and the Rebels as hard mode, or being two different playstyles.Though if you enjoy messing stuff up, play Force of Corruption and take Darth Vader into a space battle. Super Star Destroyer > All.			"

												Out of all Star Wars themed games,this has to be my most favorite of all time.  It is a RTS that examines squad based ground tactics.  While at the same time, finally gives a chance for the player to engage into epic battles between the Empire, Rebels, and the Zahn Consotrium.  Finaly pit your Calamari captial ship against Emperial Star Destroyers and watch the carnage unfold.  Many hours can be spent playing campaign mode.  Or just get in and play a ground or space skirmish.  The choice is yours!			"

												This is probably one of the funnest RTS games I've played. Its time consuming, and has immersive gameplay. If you love Star Wars as much as I do, then you'll gladly pay $20 for this iconic game. I reccomend this game with 5/5 stars!			"

												Bought this off steam 2 days ago and already logged 30 hours (after logging about 500 hours from owning disk, but I misplaced that). Fantastic game, non-debatable. Space battles are amazing and sometimes require tactics, great feature, but land battles are mediocre, and playing ""cat and mouse"" with that last dammed platoon of Plex soilders isn't the best thing to look for.

												Don't let my time online discourage you, I've played this game to death offline.Empire at War is a stunning Real Time Strategy revolving around the 'Rise of the Empire era' Star Wars universe. The main game allows you to take the sides of both the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance across varied planets and participate in epic space battles above said planets. Famous environments such as Hoth, Endor and Coruscant return as well as lesser known planets from spin offs and extended universe canon.Ultimately you control either faction with the goal of controlling every location in the galaxy. Along the way you will participate in skirmishes with land forces and space fleets and combat your enemies in engaging and clever ways. Land battles see you build bases and call in ground troops from your fleet in space to wipe out the enemy presence while space battles see you attacking or defending a space station with a wide range of units such as fighters, frigates and capital ships.The expansion pack, Forces of Corruption, adds a third faction and a wide array of new locations, units, and ways to play.  You can now play as the Zahn Consortium, a group of intergalactic space pirates who want their own share of the galaxy. The new setting takes place during the galactic war and sees you entering the fight between the Rebels and the Empire.This is an amazing RTS that really captures the feeling of being a part of the Star Wars universe. If there's only one Star Wars game you should play, this is it.			"

												As your Star Destroyer enters the system only one task remains: Destroy the Rebel Fleet. This game may be old but it still is better than most RTS games out there. Its fun and entertaining. Easy to get into and has a lot of replay value. Buy this game its worth it.			"

												Despite its age, its gameplay is still extremely solid. In my opinion, it is still one of the best games for small scale space combat RTS and has extremely nice gameplay and engine details.Furthermore, the modding community is truly amazing.			"
