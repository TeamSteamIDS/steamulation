												This is my first review, i dont do reviews. Before anything, excuse my english.After I bought this game, i feel in debt with humanity, i have the duty to tell: this game sucks, hard.a) Its a facebook game - i will not elaborate beyond that (poor graphics, gameplay, etc...)b) Its a free game you can play from www.ufoonline.dec) In the steam store there is no ""Play for free"" option. GGThere is no much else to say. I feel like i just light up 6,79 usd and smoke it.			"

												As a mega fan of the original UFO Enemy Unknown, X-Com series, and even the UFO trilogy.  I gave this game a chance keeping an open mind.  While already receiving negative feedback, I thought ""give it a go at least"".  What disappointed me the most was waiting for the game to load into missions.  Concept in general is pretty good, yet too complex for my likings.  And I DO NOT like the idea of having to purchase additional credits (or diamonds) throughout the game.			"

												This game has nothing to do with classic UFO. It's no different than any browser game with ""tactics"" in its name. made in flash right mouse button opens adobe flash player pop up very slow opens in full screen on the primary display device, not possible to change it no strategic part of the game: no income other than from missions no economy no detecting or shooting down UFOs single base only base expansion is limited to upgrading 4 rooms poor tactical part of the game: soldiers have a predefined class which defines their skills and equipment they can use there is 5 weapons only, one for each class; they are exclusive to use for this class only the equipment is limited to weapon, armor and two slots for usable items poor leveling system - acquring new stats is made by creating a path on the large triangle (see screenshots), you can get only a skill which is adjacent to previously chosen skill character level is limited to 20 making it impossible to acquire all skills slow experience income putting soldier on watch (so it shoots during opponent's turn) consumes action points in both current turn and player's next turn - i.e. it counts as if the shot was made during player's next turn; putting soldier on watch costs more than making a single shot very limited ammo on the missions, it's likely that you will run out of it knife (scout's main and only weapon) requires ammo weapons have min/max range and optimal range - shooting outside min/max range is not even possible, shooting at range different than optimal is most likely to miss and even if it hits the damage will be much lower. And so sniper rifle has range 4-14, 10 optimal, pistol has range 1-4, 4 optimal, minigun has range 1-4, 1 optimal. There is enemy at distance of 6-7 squares? You are unlucky. limited storage for items, at the beginning you can store only ~15 items, later +1 per level of the storage room (max level 30) multiple interface bugs it is sometimes not possible to move an item from soldier's inventory to storage room or the other way round sometimes interface freezes during mission while the turn timer is still counting down, after 30-60 seconds interface unfreezes and starts processing all mouse events so if you clicked in multiple places you are likely to end up with your soldiers moving to places where you never inteded them to go selected soldier sometimes becomes unselected without reason if you try to give an order to the soldier during animation, the soldier becomes unselected, the order won't be executed - generally you cannot use mouse during animations sometimes it's not possible to scroll the map during oponent's turn - so you can hear your soldiers getting shot without knowing where and by what sometimes movement paths are not cleared as all browser games, it is a pay-to-win - you can buy diamonds for real money and use them to buy absolutely anything in the game one of the ""campaign"" tasks cannot be completed preventing you from getting further ""campaign"" tasks some of the daily tasks require you to spend ~12h to complete them (e.g. kill 500 aliens where on mission is ~10 aliens and it takes ~15 minutes to complete a mission); you have 24h to complete a task once started game requests administrator permissions on every startup starter packs give you soldiers at maximum level with super equipment - the game becomes pointless, because the only thing left is research and upgrading rooms upgrading rooms and researching is done in real time (e.g. 2 hours) "

												It's free to play on website, but you can buy steam packs too.  Almost better to go free, unless you want bonuses.  You get what you pay for with the packs, it saved a good 10-20 hours of game play to level up.Great game.  Only about 10-20 hours of new content, but it repeats and has pvp.  It's a browser game and it's okay if you need something to play at work or on a laptop or on the go devices.It's not a graphics powerhouse, but it gets the job done for some fun in the office.			"
