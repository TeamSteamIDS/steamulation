												Patrician IV, henceforth known as ""Patty IV's"" is in something of a niche genre, in that it is a Renaissance trading simulator set around the Hanseatic League in Northern Europe. Doesn't sound like the most riveting game now, but when I rephrase that as TIME TRAVELLING DOSH SIMULATOR 1420 EDITION it starts to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ing dank. (Note to self, make montage video with that title)Patty IV's behaves something akin to a sandbox, and the main campaign introduces you to the core concepts in a really intelligent way rather than simply throwing a standard tutorial at you, whereupon you start with modest resources as a simple hemp smuggler operating out of Lubeck aspiring to grow his empire until you control all the booze and kush in Denmark.The difficulties in the true sandbox mode work pretty well too, they basically make more bad things happen the higher difficulty you select, like pirates stealing your♥♥♥♥♥♥or bad winters freezing ports over as well as ramping up the costs of production, so that in order to maintain a decent profit margin you actually have to spread your goods out intelligently. Because of this, on the higher difficulties you truly end up as a wicked beer baron, having to ship your product all over Europe to find enough people keen for your booze and bud (Stockholm can't get enough hemp for some reason).Once you've gotten enough dosh behind you from your 'legitimate businesses' you can move into the world of protection, racketeering and exploitation. You can create fleets of pirate vessels or hunt the pirates that menace your trade. You can be 'elected' in charge of a town and pay off the local authorities to leave you in peace. You can build 'schools' where the goal is to design bigger guns for you ships or ways to grow danker kush. You can even pick up some wench and start 'The Family' (watch that ♥♥♥♥♥, I caught mine cheating once).Have I mentioned that it doesn't stop there?WELL BUCKLE UP KIDSIT EVEN HAS A GODDAM CO-OP MODE FOR TWICE AS MUCH DOSH.Because by know you're already clicking add to cart I'll discuss the DLC now, so you can wrap it up in one easy purchase.The expansions adds some pretty legit content, so if the gold edition is an option go for it, but the game isn't fundamentally handicapped by missing it out. I even managed to drop about 50 hours into the full edition before finding the key feature of smuggling booze and 'exotic spices' overland that the DLC introduces. It seems like there were a lot of little tweaks that were added with Rise of a Dynasty too, including some fixes with the aforementioned co-op mode, however, so I would recommend picking up the pack if possible.This is a ♥♥♥♥ing wicked game, potentially the best game to play while you're browsing the net or whatever at the same time, which is ironic due to it not being terribly casual. The reason it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ metascore is because all the reviewers are cowards that don't want to put any effort into learning how the systems work, which are relatively easy to understand and smooth to operate. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are too busy giving 9.8's to on rails shooters to learn how to run a criminal syndicate, uh, I mean 'trading syndicate'. I wouldn't say the game is immaculate, but it's challenging and interesting in a fun way, and I don't regret sinking plenty of hours into it. The ship combat is a little dry too, but that's not the focus of the game.If you like simulators or relaxed strategy of any kind I'd say it's a must buy.Overall I'd give TIME TRAVELLING DOSH SIMULTOR 1420 EDITION 80/100.

Note: I copied a good portion of this review from my review of the base game. I'll be adding on some stuff for this DLC towards the end. Also, for the people thinking of buying this game and is just checking out the DLC too, I recommend getting the DLC with the base game. Rise of a Dynasty adds a lot: Land based trade routes, treasure hunting(by collecting map pieces), Online/LAN Co-op, and lots of Graphical improvements, among other things. So it's definitely worth getting both.Patrician is a great nautical trading game. You buy low, travel to another city, and sell high. As you gain more money, you buy more ships so you can carry more goods. Then you can start a second Convoy(a team of ships basically), and assign it a route. A route tells the ships which cities to go to and what order to do it. You can tell them what they should buy and what they should sell in that particular city. And they'll do all that without any more input from you, and they'll be earning you money in no time.You can even start producing goods yourself, and have dedicated ships to deliver it to another city either to sell high, or give it to another goods producer you own so they can make more complicated, and therefore more valuable goods to sell. You gain favor in a city by selling them goods that they are low on, which makes them like you more. Once they're happy enough with you, you can start buying buildings in their city, and producing goods unique to them.You can also take up Contracts/Missions/Whatever at the Pub. This ranges from delivering a certain amount of a specific good, or even hunting down a specific pirate or rival.One thing it's starts losing quality on is sea based combat. Most of the time, you'll just want to let the fighting resolve automatically rather than take control yourself, since it's rather boring. Once you start getting more well known in the game, your ships will be attacked by pirates more often, and sometimes not even towards you specifically. Sometimes they'll park their boats outside a cities port, attacking anyone who comes or goes. Most of the time, if you lose, they'll just take a large amount of your goods, and sometimes a ship, and let your convoy go. To counter this, you can assign specialized boats with armor and weapons to fight, protect, and even scare off pirates on occasion. You can even put cannons on your merchant boats, however, this subtracts from overall storage space, but it's worth it if a specific convoy gets attacked a lot. Sometimes though, they're just a pain in the ♥♥♥, and you'll have to send your own specialized combat convoy to take them out permanently, since no one else will do it.There's a lot of trading to do in this game, and the DLC will add quite a bit more. I'll need to write up a review for 'Rise of a Dynasty' too, but later.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys trading games,			"

												This game has advanced considerably from the original Patrician in 1993.  Various advancements came along with new versions until this 'Rise of a Dynasty' was created in conjuntion with local players.Trade, build, store, exchange, transport and sell are all in a day's work.  Fight a pirate, pay off a Prince with tribute and carry out the requirements of the Hanseatic League Alderman.Rise to Mayor, Lord of your own town/city, Alderman of the Hanseatic League.New towns , land routes and wagons, such a wide area of trade.One little problem, don't lend money to Princes, because they do not pay you back.Otherwise play and enjoy this for the next year of two.

												Most of the negative reviews have little to do with the experience of this game.   It is a trading/economy sim, at it's core, and it's a pretty serious simulation, taking into account the production and transport of goods throughout most of northern Europe.   The political simulation element does feel a little tacked on, but it does serve as a sort of tangible demonstration of your achievements.  It's largely a sandbox simulation--nobody is there to hold your hand and tell you what to do next, and there isn't going to be very much help in game telling you where to buy and sell your goods.   It is a slower-paced game; about strategy and planning.   It rewards you for long-term planning.   For those familiar with the series, it is a very faithful recreation of PIII, with numerous interface tweaks and some additional content.  It's not for everyone.  But for a trading economy simulation, it is the finest of its kind, and you'll enjoy it.			"

												At the beginning Patrician IV is a simple little trading game--buy low, sell high. As you become wealthier, it instead becomes a game in logistics. Successful players will find themselves creating spreadsheets calculating distribution of goods among their many towns. This uncommon feature at this stage of the game makes the game worthwhile for those who like challenges that make you think.			"

												The best market simulating, wealth and empire building game to date.  German games have a habit of being ruthlessly difficult to master and this game is no exception - however the key that makes this experience fun is that it is so easy to learn and build up your empire.  Worth the time and money you put into it, but be warned: this will take about an hour to really learn the basics and spreadsheets will definitely help.			"

												It's addicting if you like trading.  I thoroughly enjoyed climbing up the ranks to Patrician.  Multiplayer is stupid and doesn't allow both players to start in their own cities but equally control one ship, etc and is quite obnoxious.  Still, single player is a good time.			"

												If you like Economy and City building, Patrician IV is just for you. I feel like the trading and citybuilding and planning is very well made. And as you progress you will unlock more political features, which gives longevity to the game.  If you are looking for games like Total war, this is probably not for you. Patrician IV is all about conquering through trade, and the combat aspect is somewhat lacking.			"

												This is a great game.  Really...Edit:Okay, let me expand on that.  First, as in the base game, you start with a small business and a ship.  Primarily thru trade do you grow your wealth, although you also can set up your own supply lines throughout the Hanse.  The businesses that you need for that need workers, which need food, which need etc. etc. to maintain production.  This is the heart of what makes it fun, and seasonal challenges (the game is played day by day) keep it interesting.For example, from memory spring time was a good time to start new ventures or ideas.  Winter time was good for selling off certain goods that get expensive in that time of year.And as for conflict, the Pirates scale nicely to keep you challenged.  Though the battles are a bit like a boring minigame, they're still fun enough.In conclusion, this is a really good sim.  Fairly simple and focussed on trading and growing cities organically.			"

												I was a fan of P3 so I had to buy this as soon as I saw it on steam (conveniently it was also on sale)It's almost exactly the same as the last game with a small number of critical changes that I found really dumb. There's now an AI for your automatic trading; which does save you a tonne of time setting up trade routes it also removes alot of the challenge and reward from playing.Honestly Just buy Patrician III. I mean they look almost exactly the same, just play the older and better one.3/10			"

												OK I wrote a review earlier and I dont know what happened to it but I will restate what I said and add more. The good first. Theres a nifty little campaign quest for people who have never played these games. I have been a  long time player of Patrician games. I have played Patrician 3 and loved it. This game is not as nice as Patrician 3. Theres a nifty little campaign quest for people who have never played these games. Well, so far thats it. The bad. One of the first quests in the campaign is to begin hemp production. A little later you will find hat most other cities produce hemp and it is not in demand so you end up with a stroehouse full of hemp. The trade system is glitchy. For example, if you send a convoy to a city you cant have it drop off one item and load another. its all or nothing??? I wanted to bring salt from Lubeck to Aalborg and pick up meat from there to trade but you cant drop off and pick up its either one or the other. Combat is not good. Yes, you can auto combat but the AI isnt good or youcan manually fight which is more drawn out, you can't board and capture ships like in this games predecessor and you can only capture the last ship remaining IF you are in manual combat or you completely dwarf the enemies fleet in auto. In combat you can just simply set your ships to auto engage the otehr ships and then watch.  I have invested some time into this game and I think I am done. If this game is on sale I would recommend it as a traine, but Patrician 3 is better but the politics seems more complicated.			"
