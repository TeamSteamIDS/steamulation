Know that there is zero support for any of the games in the series 3. Expect problems, and don't expect the fixes to be easy. The patches and fixes for the retail hard copy of the game do NOT work for the Steam version4. Win7 onward hates these games; high end graphics cards hate these games as well5.

												A great little known classic with many unique RTS featrues not seen in other RTS games up until recently.Ahead of it's time but still a little buggy. An ambitious game that for the most part is a winner.For those who like napoleonic warfare, this is a fun game that has Russian devs that come from the napoleonic re-enactment capital of the world, Russia. A lot of detail to be had here, glorious uniforms and many nations are represented.			"

												While a nice addition to the Cossacks series, if you're looking for the arcady feel of the old cossacks game this game is not for you. This game is great, but has a very distinctively different feel to the older games, so it's best not to go with too many preconcieved notions on how it should be.That being said once you reach a certain mass you will still get the classic ""realism"" feel and the combat has a lot of nice touches to it even though the extremely ""mechanical"" aspect to it does kind of make it less fluid. Both PRO & CON +/- food and resources are based on strategic resource points +/- there is a little more realism to the combat Cons: - combat is a little more stiff then the older games (by design) - the added weight to the combat doesn't seem to add too much depth to it over long gamesPros: + buildings and towns look more realisticly proportioned (especially compared to the first games) + units are more realistic + campaign felt more interesting (from what I played of it) + the new combat mechanics creates nice situations sometimes			"

												Do not get this game. The Steam version is broken and virtually unplayable. Find it somewhere else,anywhere else, and play it. Dont get me wrong, the game is great, but it is not worth the risk that it will almost certainty that it will not work for you. That and the dev doesnt seem to care at all, about fixing the glaring bugs in this version of the game. Maybe if you are tech savvy you will be able to jurryrig the game to work for you but for everyone else stay away. And dont bother with the disc version either, it doesnt work on new systems very well. I havent tried GOG's version yet so I cannot say whether it is any good either. It is really unfortunate that this game has been abandonded the way it has, was really fun back in the day.			"

												Unique game. I was a fan of the first one but the second one is so much better.The best addition here is the ""Battle for Europe"" mode which was later basically copied in COH2 Ardennes Assault. So basically just europe divided into regions and you as the commander of a persistent army rushing through.It's one of the first games that mostly relies on managing an army instead of building it up with resources and such (even though base building is still possible, just not in the battle for europe, which is the best mode).The fights are always interesting since there are many optional objectives which makes it really fun.The feeling of this game is great and I like its looks.

												Cossacks II is a good game. I believe I'm in the minority when I say this, but I oh so strongly believe it.Compared to the original Cossacks video game, it's distinctly different. The visual style, gameplay/gamefeel, and even the setting are radically different from Cossacks: The Art of War. It's not hard to see why fans didn't like this one or it's vanilla version. But if you really give it a chance and look at it as a nonsequel, you may see a very good game in it.For those not in the know, the overall series has features like troop morale, limited ammunition for gunpowder weapons, commanding and management of troop formations, and a visual style that invokes the image of paintings from the era coming to life. It's an extreme different game from say, Age of Empires or Total War, despite the simularities. The learning curve is slightly higher than those games aswell. Battles are often stalemates that have to be broken through concentrated attacks, flanking, and clever usage of terrain features.This game is more or less dead and its developer, GSC Gameworld (Who is known more as the team behind the STALKER franchise of FPS games), is in a state of pseudo non-existance. But please, buy this game. It deserves more love and attention!Add me if you want to play multiplayer sometime, I would greatly appreciate that.And for anyone who disagrees with me on the games quality, come on, at least it's not as bad as Napoleon: Total War...

												***Attention***: From what I've read on the Steam Community, a lot of people have been having trouble running this game on computers with Windows 7 or later. Fortunately this game is listed at the price of $4.99, so if you want to take a chance with it the price isn't that steep. For me, this game is running on my computer (which has Windows 10) with very few problems.SHORT REVIEW:Pros:This is a game that I've had a lot of fun with over the years playing both the retail version back in the day and the Steam version now. It has a decent amount of content, including an excellent ""Battle For Europe"" risk-style game mode. The tactical battles can become very involved and get very exciting, especially when you avoid pausing to give orders and let it all play out. It is really enjoyable to create battle formations on the fly while you are under pressure from the enemy. The game simulates basic Napoleonic warfare pretty well, and the AI is competent and can challenge you in almost every battle you fight it in. The game's graphics are really bright and look good, and the music is decent.Cons:Some people are having serious trouble running this game on their Windows 7 or later computers. I have been fortunate enough that it has worked for me. The gameplay has typical old-fashioned RTS problems, like unit clustering and awkward base building due to size of buildings and map terrain. Also, lack of unit collision for allied units leads to awkward situations, and the fact that units block the line of fire for other units in their army can be frustrating when they start clustering together.Rating:7/10FULL REVIEW:I will admit that this game is a little dated, but that hasn't stopped me from having fun playing it. This game is an RTS set in the Napoleonic Wars era, featuring 9 factions: France, Britain, Spain, Austria, Prussia, Confederacy of the Rhine, Poland, Russia, and Egypt. The game has three game modes: Campaign, Skirmish, and Battle For Europe. The campaigns include one for France, Rhine, Spain, and Poland. To be honest, I've never paid much attention to the campaigns. They seem like typical campaigns in an RTS game (i.e. each mission has an objective(s) and you build a base and raise armies or work with what you are given to complete the mission). Skirmish mode is where you can set up a match pitting any of the factions against each other on a premade map. Under Skirmish mode, you can also play historical battles such as Austerlitz, Borodino, and Waterloo; as well as generic battles focusing on tactics and maneuver rather than base building. Overall, it's a decent amount of content.Battle For Europe (which I hereby abbreviate as B.F.E.), in which I've spent probably 95% or more of my time playing (back in the day and now). In this mode, you play on a sort of risk-style board as one of the nine factions. This mode is a free-for-all, and the goal is to eliminate every other faction from the game. You can can declare war and make peace with whomever you want, and you can negotiate an alliance or non-aggression pact (which are both temporary) to prevent declarations of war and possibly team up on someone (beware though, as the computers can form alliances to bring you down too). The game is driven in a turn-based format. You have a single army consisting of platoons of any combination of your choice (with restrictions on the number of the same type of units). You can move this army across the board at a pace of one space per turn (unless a random event happens).When entering a hostile territory, it initiates a real-time battle that pre-deploys all of the units in your army and the enemy's army on a specially designed map for that territory. Gameplay in these real-time battles is essentially the same as in the campaign/skirmish battles (with the notable exclusion of base building in B.F.E. battles), which is why I've waited until now to explain how they work. On the battle map, your units are divided into platoons of infantry and cavalry, as well as single artillery guns. You can move the infantry and cavalry in different formations that fit the tactical situation. Essentially they can be described as offensive, defensive, and travelling formations. The artillery simply move, get in position, and fire. Tactics on the battle maps generally revolve around capturing/holding towns which provide resources. I find that there is always something to do, with very little downtime. When you encounter the enemy on the battlefield, this is when the most fun of all begins. You will find yourself scrambling to position your troops in the best ways possible while taking into consideration terrain, chokepoints, angles of attack and defense, formations, reinforcements, strength of your troops and the enemy troops, and so on.....ALL AT THE SAME TIME. Yes, you can pause the game and give orders, but I find it much more exciting to resist the temptation to do so and to let it all play out uninterrupted. And when the battles feature approximately 15-20 platoons per side, it starts getting really intense. Managing to create well planned and executed formations and tactics on the fly really creates a sense of achievement at the end of a battle.The AI does a decent job with its tactics and formations as well, and understands and executes basic maneuvers rather well overall. It is also great at micromanaging and can attack you effectively on multiple fronts all at once. The game also simulates Napoleonic Wars era combat pretty well at a basic level, allowing you to order your troops to fire by line or as a whole formation; having different ranges of effectiveness for firing; ordering bayonet and cavalry charges; and the feature that morale is what mainly makes or breaks the unity of a formation, rather than trying to kill every last enemy soldier.When the battle is over, you return to the B.F.E. strategic map and the results of the battle are applied to the map, armies affected, and resources gained/used. This process is continued until all factions are eliminated from the game. Overall, I enjoy the Battle For Europe mode the most and I recommend this game mainly based on this mode as it is that good in my opinion.The game does have some flaws though. As with many old RTS games, units in a battle often tend toward clustering together. Even though I've explained how you can set up well planned formations, when the fighting begins it more often than not devolves into a clustered and chaotic mess (which is how many real life battles go, however, so I don't personally view this as a serious flaw). It is in this clustered mess, though, that some of the goofiness of the game shows. Namely, there is no collision detection in the game engine for units in the same army, so they can walk right through each other as if they don't exist. This leads to awkward situations where platoons can stack on top of each other; and it's even more awkward when your cavalry charges straight at the enemy right through your soldiers without trampling them, which for gameplay reasons is a good thing, but it does take away a lot of realism. Also, while there is no friendly fire, units also cannot fire through allied units, meaning that you can inadvertently block your own shots and leave your troops vulnerable with empty firearms. Also, the fact that artillery consists of only single cannons means that they are often woefully ineffective, and quite frankly whether or not they are even worth the space in your army is seriously questionable. This is unfortunate because artillery was an extremely important part of Napoleonic warfare.Overall, this is a good game that I have had a lot of fun with, and I really hope it runs properly on your computer if you do take a chance on it.I rate this game at 7/10.

												Doesn't work on Windows 10. Had many issues with trying to get it work on Windows 7 and it never fully worked (campaign missions were fine but the strategy map mode crashed every time after 1 battle). I've tried a few fixes and most don't even get it 1 second further into the game. Avoid this if you can unless you have a hard drive with old versions of windows installed as these may work. Don't waste your money otherwise. Steam also don't care as its a ""third party developer"" so they just pass you straight off and copy and paste a response to you. Should have a warning on this game for W7,8 and 10 users as most will struggle to get it to run properly.			"

												The game itself isn't bad. I used to play this years ago and it's a fun game. Camera is a bit too zoomed in for my taste but apart from that it's a lot of fun marching lines towards each other.So why do I not recommend it? It's just incredibly unstable. Not sure if it's a compatibility issue or not, but it can crash on you randomly without providing any error report whatsoever. Not that an error report would help you a lot either because since it's an old game there are no devs around on the forum to help out.If you're a fan of Cossacks 2 and you fancy a gamble or would like to relive line battles, even if only for 5 minutes, give it a shot. Otherwise don't bother.			"

												This game is a perfect old time rts. Cossacks 2 bfe has all what a strategy loving player needs. You have fast economy (building your base in 10 minutes). Massive battles with over 5000 units!!! Perfect tactics, units have formations, morale, stamina.Realistic terrain tactics, like trees make you lose accuracy, you cant shoot over building (only artillery), standing on highland increases the range of your units, units can lose formation and be forced to flee. Each unit can either shoot and reload or fight melee. Realistic economy, shooting is based on resources, you have to have coal to reload. Units can die if you have no food. To get resources you have to defeat and control villages, resources are delivered by mules which gives another tactical advantage.Overall i rate this game 8/10 because it is military/tactic focused. Graphic has practically no requirements. Gives you massive battles and lots of tactical possibilities.Minus:Single player - AI is plain stupidMultiplayer - very few playersBuy this game, and tell your friends to buy it too, get more players because this game is worth saving!gl&hf			"

												Apparently this was released in 2006, but it looks more like something from before year 2000. It's tricky to make it run under Windows 10, and even when it does run it's laggy and practically unplayable, I guess because it isn't compatible with modern hardware.			"

												 If you want to buy Cossacks II only buy this one. Though I don't know why you would. This game takes a huge departer from the orginal and American Conquest. Its more of a defend and couquer game then a RTS. Since your troops  must stick to roads and there is NO navy a lot of the stradegy the original had is lost. Its a difficult game and not very clear, but the only good this is the graphics are very nice. Really though I would just get the original.			"

												It has severe compability issues with current operating systems. At first, the game did not open at all, then I followed a quick guide and removed two setting files, and got the game working. Then I headed to tutorial to get a grip. Then what do I see? The game is running. It's running in 10 fps. And I'm not even the type who would hesitate from a bit of lag. But this was plainly unplayable.I'm sorry, no matter how great this game might be back in the day, I cannot recommend this game under these circumstances.			"

												Overall this game seems to be an unfinished project. Sure, it sometimes can be fun (probably why I still managed to play 100 hours (although divided over 4 years :P )).There are so many bugs, Enemy AI running across the map, own soldiers walking in slow motion (5 minutes to like walk 2 meters!? da fuq, do some cardio). Peasents will often do anything else, than what you command them to do. And the crashes, ohhh,... everytime a new music track starts, every time you click somewhere, every time something happens, the game may crash! The first game from 2001 is way better, than this. If they someday would update and fix the bugs, and perhaps add some extra content it would be worth the 4 $. But currently its not worth it. Dont waste your time and money on this.Instead save your money, and wait for Cossacks 3.			"

												Does not work on windows 7 on most computers.Get a refund on steam:1. Go into "" HELP"" above left in steam window.2. Choose steam support3. Click gamename4.  Choose "" I purshased this by accident""  No other option what I found.5. Choose if u want it to be refunded to your card or steamwallet.Its one of the best rts games but that wont help if its not supported on modern computers,both GSV and steam should be ashamed of letting this product being sold when its not working. ( Also its kind of fun when I want to post this review I´m told that I have to be in the game at least five minutes to make the review, so I just have to let the Crashwindow be up for some more minutes :D )   Solutions I tried:o Changing resolutions,o patching up the gameo Start as admin, changing all settings there in different ways.o Compability modeo + some forum  tips of how to get it to work.

												Another Age of Empires inspired historical period military strategy game, where you can play as one of several historical countries, even play through specific historical campaigns. Overall the graphics aren't bad, what you would expect for a game of it's type and genre. It feels generic when you play, but that could be due to the sheer volume of similar games all aspiring to be the next big Age of Empires hit. In my opinion, there are so many of these types of games out there, this one doesn't do anything extraordinary to set itself apart and thus doesn't earn a thumbs up. Sorry folks, save your money and play one of the more expansive, better known Age of Empires knockoffs, or better yet, just go for the original.			"
