												Warlock - Master of the Arcane is mostly a fantasy army strategy game. The city/empire building management isn't the stand out portion of the game. In that respect the magical spells that you can research and cast don't really stand out to me much either. If you are looking for a fantasy version of Civ with decent combat options for units and don't really care about the building and management of your empire then this game might be right up your alley. If you are looking for an in-depth strategy game with far reaching diplomacy options and deep empire management and combat isn't your primary concern then maybe this isn't the game for you.			"

												Essentially the fantasy version of Civilizations, Warlock is a game that is easy - and criminal - to overlook.  Possessed by a surprising levity to match itself with the common run of modern fantasy parodies, but not nearly as overbearing about it as most, Warlock is a game of many subtle pleasures and joys.  The interface is more accessible than Civ, there is virtually no micromanagement, and there are very few turns of empty waiting for researches to complete or diplomatic tensions to crumble: the world is always larger than it seems and there are always scarier monsters lurking in the wings, protecting prime real estate for colonization.  I have no qualms about calling it the most exciting, entertaining, and most streamlined turn-based strategy game I have ever played.  It lacks some of the sophistication and depth of Civ or the Total War franchise, but it makes up for it in sheer playability.			"

												Certainly found this game to be an enjoyable strategy game - it felt like playing some Civ games, but with two big differences that I saw: the portals allow you to travel to *other* worlds - which is pretty cool.  You end up trying to expand beyond your current map through portals into other worlds, all while continually building up your war machine.  The other difference was the ability to cast spells on the map - this means healing units, destroying enemies, etc.  I like games which give a sort of macro-game like this on top of the Civ hex strategy model.  Definitely an enjoyable game, but I don't know that I would recommend it as the paragon of its genre.			"

												NOTE: Since people will see this game and say: ""this looks like Civilization 5."" I will say it right now that the only similarity between this game and Civilization 5 are the Hexagon Based Grid Map, Leadership Choice and User Interface (UI). Everything else is completely different.INTRODUCTION:Warlock: Master of the Arcane, despite sharing the same look as the more popular Civilization series, is definitely NOT the same game. Warlock: Master of the Arcane plays differently with its own mechanic that delivers a lot of fun to strategy and fantasy world players alike.It is an X4 Strategy game originally released in 2012. It lets the player take the role of one of several 'Great Mages' who vie for control of the world of Ardania (from the Majesty Series of games) using vast armies and mighty spells to aid them in their struggle.PROS:+ Fantasy Theme: -This game places you in a fantasy world populated by different mystic and magical creatures. Raise an empire of the Undead, Monsters, Humans or Elves and utilize a wide variety of magical spells to buff your forces or smite your foes.+ Combat Focused Gameplay: -The Empire building on this game is based primarily on combat, fighting with the other factions and the different monsters that constantly threaten your borders. It delivers a very satisfying gameplay since most Magical Spells will make for some very interesting strategy. (Ex. Having problem crossing that lake? = Waterwalk.)+ Extensive Upgrades: - Each military unit has so many upgrade choices each time they level-up that once they reach max level, they can be called Hero units in their own right. Add to this your Tech upgrades and Spell buffs, then you will have beast of an army.+ Epic World: -The game offers your standard Small, Medium, Large and Huge map sizes but it also allows you to add more 'Worlds' that you can invade. Just look for the portal that goes there and fight extremely dangerous monsters inside before reaping the rewards.CONS:- No Vsync: -This is inexcusable. The game suffers greatly from Screen Tearing and yet the options menu offers no Vertical Synchronization option to mitigate this. The player will be forced to use manual Vsync provided by the Nvidia Control Panel (or its AMD equivalent).- Brain-Dead AI: -The AI really needs some more work to be done. I have seen the AI countless of times mobilize for an invasion, only to cancel it the last moment and just have its army run around in circles rather than coordinate a proper attack. The monsters roaming the country side poses more of a threat than the Faction AI. (It might be different on Hard or Impossible)- Lack of Variety: -There are 16 different Great Mages you can play OR your own Custom Mage, but the bonuses or faction specialty is so negligible that it almost makes no difference. Add to this, there are only THREE, playable starting races in the game.- Poor Research Tree: -Instead of Tech, you research Spells, which is good, but there is no Research Tree available. as far as I know, the game randomly generates 5 spells and will require the player to choose one of those spells to research.CONCLUSION:In its own rights, Warlock: Master of the Arcane is a very refreshing take on the 4X Turn-based Strategy Genre. I definitely feel this game deserve your attention if you are a 4X or Strategy fan in general. It provides a fun and enjoyable experience.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Civilization + Age of Wonders mash-up with magicks, mystical beasts and various races!PRO:+Surprisingly well done round based strategy game with interesting races and ressources+ Level up your troops with important skills! Build smithies and supply your troops with weaponry and armor upgrades!+ Hire heroes, equip them with weapons/armor/wands depending on their class to pimp their combat/spell-capabilities!+ Research and cast awesome spells reminiscient of Age of Wonders that greatly impact combat and economics!+ Modify map tiles to change their bonus ressource output, sink islands to drown troops or create hills to give combat benefits!+ Races all have greatly differing play styles!+ Pick a Lord(Avatar) and personalize your starting spells and skills!+ Multiple planes of existence work seamlessly!+ Finish little quests to boost your finances, defeat ""barbarian""-style beasts and loot their lairs for XP and artifacts!+ Multi-Player has bots!CON:- No Single-Player Campaign! Only ""Skirmish""-esque maps with default bots for solo play!- Gameplay will get repetetive after 3 rounds- Multi-Player is not simultaneous, you have to wait for others to finish their turn before you can act...- Races are not equally newbeginner-friendly- Tech trees not available ingame, google for them/ninja them from the game's webpage- A lot of content splintered over DLC in an attempt to make the Ultimate Edition more attractive- ""Barbarians"" spawning in regularly can become a nuisance later...DLC WORTH THE CASH?Only if you can get the Ultimate Edition cheap, the items and Elf race are worth it to enhance the experience!Recommended purchase if at 10-15 bucks, improve replayability with DLC and multi-player!

												Great game! While you get the feel of Civ 5 with the grid layout, the comparison ends there. The focus of the game is combat and everything you do is related to this. I love how the city management is focused. You can't build every single building in every city you build. You have to focus on which resource your city with produce. And this can change depend on which resource tiles you have in your city limits. This game has hooked me better than both Civ 4 and 5 did. The low price is also a big +.			"

												Warlock is a turn-based strategy game similar to Civilization series with a fantastic world view, full of sorcerers, elves, orcs and legendary creatures. In a nutshell, it is the fantasy version of Civilization but a bit simpler and easier. The player plays the role of a mighty mage, ordering your people to build cities, construct facilities and recruit army to expand your territory. Just like Civilization series, there are many different routes to achieve victory. The player can occupy a specified portion of the world, cast an ultimate unity spell, or conquer all of the other mages to win this game.But There still are some fine features makes it pretty different from Civilization. Firstly, the player study powerful spells in this game instead of technology in Civilization. And differing from other magical games, the player can not only cast combat and healing spells, but also many powerful auxiliary spells to raise the land up beyond the sea level or fertilize the land. Besides, the combat unit the player can recruit needs a upkeep expense, thus limiting the number of army to smaller scale. This mechanism save me much time in mid to latter stage of gameplay. Also from time to time some legendary heroes with special ability might come to seek the opportunity of servicing you, though the expense of hire and upkeep is amazingly huge. They might also turn to service other mages and become your nightmare if you decide not to hire them. And don't forget that you are a mighty mage. You can cast powerful spells to interfere the war when your troop are engaging your rivals on the frontline.Anyhow, if you don't have much time to play a whole campaign in other grand strategy games like Civilization and don't want the gameplay to be as complicated as Civilization series, Warlock might be a good choice then.

												I got this game when it was being offered by the Humble Bundle store for free, and it has easily been one of the best free games I've received in the year 2014. A lot of reviews mention this game to be ""Sid M's Civilization, but with the fantasy theme,"" and they are actually pretty accurate.If you like the Civilization series (especially military victories), 4x games, turn-based strategy, fantasy themes, and disregarding diplomacy, then you should enjoy this game.The aesthetics are great, and there are a lot of different unit types and character models. The detail put into the ""world board"" is very good. The music and sounds are great, and the feedback is always helpful in showing stats like how much damage is done and taken by units. Warlock offers a helpful tutorial for people new to this type of game, however, if you are familiar at all with the Civilization series (or other games in this genre), then this part is easily skippable. Compared to Civilization V, Warlock is much simpler, and also heavily combat-based (as there are no cultural or economic victory routes). The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with turn-based strategies. The gameplay is very fun - you start off by building something in your home city, and the game does a good job (like in Civ) of prompting/reminding you when you still have tasks to do (like building when your queue is empty, or moving idle units). After you building completes, you must wait x number of turns before you can build again, and this is indicated by a number next to your city name, which fills up each turn. I do not believe there is a ""pay gold to rush build (instant-finish)"" option. The diplomacy is actually quite comical, as there is no negotiation ability - if the AI sends you a demand, you have to either accept or immediately go to war. You will probably notice that the AI enjoys making demands then randomly offering peace after a few turns, only to repeat this again and again. Since the game is heavily combat-oriented, you will be focusing on building an army to destroy your opponents. There are also random creeps that will periodically spawn around the map, so it is essential that you invest in home armies in case one pops up close to your cities. The leveling up system for units is similar to Civ V, where you can choose different stats to increase (or perks) every time a unit reaches a new level (from battling). There is a large variety in the units you can create and the buildings you can construct, When you take over a city, you will have access to that particular race's build tree (ex: goblins, humans, etc).In the pre-game screen, you can select from existing races, or create your own (you can pick from a pool of magic skills and perks like extra gold per turn). Periodically, hero mercenaries will come, offering their service. They are very important, and boost your army strength considerably. Also, traders will come, offerring items that can be equipped by mercenary heroes. Consider investing in both of these whenever you have sufficient gold reserves.Magic spells are helpful for winning the game, but not essential if you strengthen your stats in other things, like having a massive army, or a very high-level one. Spells include things like offensive attacks, heals (one merc hero has long range attacks AND heal spells; my personal favorite), summoning different units, and map alterations. Something fun to do to your enemy is to turn all of his city tiles to frozen plains or mountains. Overall, the game is very, very fun, and it is easy to get into the ""one more turn"" mentality that results in you playing for 5 more hours when you originally told yourself you would only play for 1. If you like fantasy turn-based games similar to the Civilization series, give this game a try.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												I got this game free from the Humble Store and this are my first impressions after completing an 5 hours Skirmish match. -There is no campaign, you have only the skirmish mode which you can play offline or in multiplayer.-You get really fast into the game since there are not much ressources and the buildings are pretty much self-explanatory. -Normal units get pretty fast useless when high-lvl heroes appear on the battlefield, since they casually oneshot entire unitgroups with one attack when they are highlvl. -Defending and attacking castles/citys feels cool and not too hard. -The AI is really acting ""nice"". The AI doesn`t send 781 drones into every corner of the map and is building expansions until you give up because the game would take 2 weeks to finish. They try to handle the threats on their own continents, isles and barely explore other continents with ships. - The diplomacy system sometimes doesnt make any sense, they declare you war for no reason or want incredibly stupid high tributes from you to stay in peace. - The graphic looks beautiful and is definetly to enjoy. All those impressions were made on normal mode difficulty 3/5. A few weeks ago I bought Fallen Enchantress...Even if I like the graphics from Fallen Enchantress more, the game couldn`t catch me. I can enjoy Warlock way more, thats why I am going to buy the dlc pack when its on sale. Peace, Hexor.			"

												(This turned out to be rather long. Skip to the conclusion if short on time. Thank you!)I got the original WMotA game for free during some give away I can't remember. Then one day I looked up and the game was upgraded to the ""complete"" version for free too. Mind you, I still hadn't even played the game. I looked up some reviews and got a lot of mixed signals about it being good or not so good. The only constant was that it was a ""Civ 5"" clone. And since I'm a HUGE Civ IV & V fan, I didn't see a point in playing a knock off.  To the point of this review, I made a point of playing this game over the holidays. I didn't want to write a review of it until I played it at least 25 hours and gave it every chance under the sun to impress me. In conclusion, my verdict is...this is an outstanding game! The first thing I want to say is, this is not some Civ 5 clone. And people saying that have no idea what they're talking about. Just because it has a hex-based tile map seems to give WMotA some stigma of being ""like"" or ""a clone"" of Civ5. There are tons of games out with the same system, so that characteristic is more than unfounded to say this game is ""like"" Civ 5. In Warlock, you will master economics, amass a versitile army, strategize, and FIGHT! Furthermore, unlike Civ 5, you will not have a DULL moment before pushing the ""end turn"" button. That's what I hate about all Civ games. You will get to a point where entertainment turns to a chore...and there's nothing you can do about it. And unlike Civ games, each turn in WMotA matters! You not only get to pick what building you want to build for what city, but where to place them in your region. That's part of the fun in the city-building aspect. Each tile may give a specific bonus and it's worth checking out what gets placed where. It's worth checking out if you have a resource in your region you can exploit. In Civ games, you just worry about the percentages despite its land resources. In WMotA, you can research spells to change the dynamics of the tile...which in essence, changes the percentages or bonuses of that tile. And there are a ton of spells to do a ton of different things. Too many in fact to go into. But volcano spells and removing swamps to make fertile terrain is pretty epic in this game. You'll see when YOU play.But what I like most about WMotA is its variety. Look folks, you will never amass the amount of different units you can...collect...in this game and even remotely compare it to Civ 5. I mean (laughing histerically) this is supposed to be a fantasy game, right? But you got armored soldiers from a Civ game; you've got fantasy units from an Age of Wonders game; you've got undead units from a Lords of the Ring game; you've got blood sucking units from a Van Helsing game; you've got badass bears of all types from every game...I mean...LOL...it's ridiculous. And here's the kicker: No land-based melee unit can attack a flying range unit. So you won't see a knight on a horse killing a blackhawk helicopter like you WILL see in a Civ game! In WMotA, these units serve purposes true to logical gameplay. Not just some random point system statistical outcome.And then there are the portals that send you to other worlds. Where the hell is that in a Civ 5 game? In Civ 5 you play on 1 map; O-N-E!  WMotA has the main map, and then there are portals that can send you to as many other maps as you request in the game setup. Listen folks, I selected the XL map (the largest) with six alternate worlds (the most) against eight other mages (the highest) on the difficult setting (the default). It was a mad house... A MAD HOUSE! I had no idea I had to fight monsters and rouge civilizations along WITH the others mages in the game. Everybody was fighting everybody. It was insane! It was wonderful!!In fact, the only, and I do mean only, downside to the game was its diplomacy aspect. It truly sucks. I can't even begin to lie about that; especially when compared with Civ games. I guarantee (unless you're a lousy player) that any ""demand"" from the enemy AI given to you will result in WAR. You're not even going to consider the ridiculous stuff this game offers you to keep from going to war. The other stuff though is plausable and makes the game fly by unscathed.But back to the portals, man. They occasionally send up these strong monster units, and if you aren't ready for them, they will wreck havoc. Then there are the quest (again, nothing like Civ 5) that sometimes make you defeat enemies you've never even heard of, man. Like the time the game dropped this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off supernatural ghost smack down on my settlement without a hero in sight. That green ghost...man...he laid a smack down on my candy♥♥♥♥♥like The Rock. I finally got my hero chick over there to battle it. They fought for five turns until she finally overcame him and I won the quest. Got some sweet rewards too. Yet, that was only a SMIDGEN of what was going on with my other endeavours during those turns. So I got pretty confident in my efforts and decided to send my tanked-out Hero Knight into one of these portals. When the map switched over...LOL...I was SURROUNDED by doubled-headed dragons, Fire Elementals, and other high-powered monsters I can't even name. I could not believe what quick work they made of my Rambo-Lancelot. I was truly butt-hurt after that encounter. I called the game a cheater and hurled all sorts of foul insults at the monitor for hours before quitting for the night. Heck, I almost quit the game twice after that beatdown. But guess what? The next day and several hours later, I researched a spell that would bring my hero back to life. Not only did I finally get him back, but he was still tanked-out. I love this game. The next time, I sent a few zomie units to another portal to check THAT world out. Of course it looked TOTALLY different. Nice diversity in the maps here! My zombies didn't last long either but the spolied sacks of meat had like 60 hit points apiece. They lasted longer than the Hero Knight did. P.S., did I tell you one of my zombies was walking around on fire...after getting blazed by that two-headed dragon?BUGS: Believe it or not, there aren't many bugs in this game. In fact, I really searched and only found 1; and it isn't even that major. What happens is you sometimes get double event screens but you're only able to see the last event. So you can't close the first event or see it for that matter. You have to hit the escape key which takes you to the main menu. Select ""resume"" and you're back to your game and are able to close the last event screen. It's not as bad nor annoying as it sounds once you understand what's happening. It also doesn't happen that often. You can see what you missed at the top of the menu bar where the quests are kept. I know this was long (much longer than I meant it to be) but I wanted to express my disagreement with some of the claims out there. This is no Civ 5 clone. It's a great turn-based/action/strategy/4x game that fixes a ton of stuff that Civ games and Endless Legend gets wrong. You can hire heroes and equip them with armor, weapons and artifacts much like Endless Legend & Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes. In conclusion, thank you for reading my review. This is my opinion showing no bias for nor against other reviews or reviewers but solely based on my gameplay experiences. In final, this game's sole similarity to Civ 5 is its hex-based tiles. With that in mind, I found WMotA to be a Civ 5/Endless Legend/Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes chimera. And it would be WELL WORTH your time to experience it at least once for yourself. Thank you for your time. GO PLAY SOMETHING!			"

												This game was free for 2 weeks and I'm glad to have shared it with all of my friends, this game is what civ 5 wanted to be but couldn't because they are restricted by being realistic. And even though they are making the same type of game in the same style, it doesnt feel the same, the magic and magical qualities of everything add a very fresh feel to it, it has a much different progression path and includes spell research.If you like civ 5 and you like magic, you really need to get this game, chances are a lot of your friends got it for free too, so there even should be a good ammount of players playing it.Also my only complaint to have about it is that there are a few bugs, and it says that the game is final release, so these bugs which were fairly easy to find will not be fixed, the main problem with the bug that I'm thinking of is that its game breaking and is able to be used in multiplayer, which is generally not accepted as ok.Story (Actors): 10/10 (The characters you can choose from have funny personalities, they're unique and fitting)Gameplay: 10/10 (This is the same type of game as Civ BUT it also includes magic and type resistance, oh man this game is great!)Presentation: 10/10 (Doesnt take itself too seriously, perfect for a game this style)Soundtrack: 9/10 (Umm yeah whatever, bonus points for the Boing sound effects for undead arrows)Replayability: 10/10 (50 Hours in already, spending days playing with friends. its a GG)			"

												This is a fantasy themed modification of Civilization V. Some of the same core mechanics are here; research, city building, army building, war and combat, leader traits and multiple paths to victory. Resource management, commerce, trade and diplomacy are also here, but are heavily simplified and limited compared to Civ V's mechanics; land management and building management have been combined for example. This game is geared much more towards war and combat.Wonders have been replaced by Gods who grant rewards based on your favor with them. Technology is replaced by magic spells, but magic spells do not operate like technologies do in Civ V. Magic spells require mana and time to cast and do not provide civilization wide changes like technologies do. Most magic spells provide only small changes to the game such as damage to all units in a small area, the summoning of a unit or the raising or lowering of land and are not as important to the game as technologies are to Civ V.The Civ V religion system is gone, there are no great people and many other mechanics of Civ 5 are gone as well. Some of the unique additions to the game are quests that randomly appear and grant rewards upon completion, 'Heroes' which are powerful units that can be purchased or found and Temple units which are powerful units granted by Gods. As said earlier, this game is geared towards war and combat and most of the additions to gameplay reflect that.It's built on Civ 5, a solid and widely enjoyed game. In turn, it is a solid albeit simplied game that many would enjoy especially if war and combat is what you enjoy most in Civ 5.			"

Posted: December 6, 2016
												What can I say about this game? At first glance, it looks very much like a clone of civilisation, but with a magic and monsters veneer. That impression is wrong. Very wrong. Sure, it's superficially civ-like, but it plays very differently. It's much, much more combat focused, and more or less forgoes city building, research etc. So lets look at what I liked and disliked about it:Liked:1) CombatBecause you can build buildings and units at the same time, you'll quickly find you have a lot more bodies to throw at the enemy. Where in civ 5 each unit counts (at least into the medieval era, and often later) you'll pretty rapidly have hordes of little men, goblins and skeletons running around in Warlock. The world itself fights pretty hard against you at times, with dangerous monsters appearing from portals, mass spawns of demons and other monstrosities, and if you delve deep into the alternate dimensions flocks of dragons and greater elementals massing to deny you victory. The enemy AI is decent but not spectacular, and you'll be able to win pretty easily on the first 3/5 difficulties, but it can give you somewhat of a challenge I guess. 2) MagicSure, you can throw fireballs and enchant weapons and heal units and things like that, which is kinda okay, but terraforming is where the real fun and strategy of the magic system comes into play. Did your AI neighbor betray you and is now massing armies at your border while you lie defenseless? One mid-late game spell later and there's a mountain range there to protect you. Or conversely, your enemy has naval dominance and thinks he is safe from invasion? Guess he wasn't expecting you to raise the seabed to create a giant landbridge to his continent. Turn those swamps in your way to verdant farmland, curse the pleasant bonus-causing terrain in your opponents city to barren wasteland, raise a freaking volcano and surrounding lava fields in an enemies expansion route. Most of the magic is relatively forgettable (although there are exceptions like granting trolls the gift of flight for a nasty surprise) but the terraforming magic is something I dearly wish I could do in civ or endless legend. It's probably the part of this game that will stick with me the longest3) Portals. You can more or less ignore portals if you feel like it, but if you invest the time to clear out the high-level monsters within and colonise these alternate dimensions you'll emerge with powerful dragon armies, late-game ""temple units"" (the best units your faction can create) and rare resources like Adamantium and Nevril. I haven't quite decided whether it's worth the time required to clear these portals out, but they're a fun distraction that really ups the power of the wandering enemies and gives you something to do. I feel like a lot more could have been done with portals (how about alternate dimensions that can connect to each other and not just the hub world (Ardania) you start on? Or being able to enter a portal and through a short trip through another dimension rock up on the other side of Ardania. These are major missed opportunities that may or may not have been used in Warlock 2 (which I haven't played yet). But still, the portals are fun. 4) It's just cool to have armies of trolls and dragons. What I disliked.1) There's no option for playing tall. You pretty much just spam cities everywhere you can find a few spare tiles2) City building is vastly inferior to games like Endless Legend and Civ 5. Vastly, vastly inferior3) Trade and Diplomacy is near nonexistent. This game is built for war war war. If you approach it as a wargame, it's decent fun. Don't approach it looking for a science victory type thing4) Speaking of science, there's nearly no research in the game. Sure, you research spells, but I feel like the game is poorer for the lack of tech-driven gameplay changes5) The game feels a little too silly for its own good, but your milage may vary. I actually quite liked it for the first 30 hours. Overall I liked the game, but it is more shallow than Civ or Endless Legend, both of which I would recommend above this game. That said I've put 40 hours into this game and can feel myself likely to put in another 20 or so before I put the game down (I want to experience the apocalypse gamemode before I uninstall and try out Warlock 2) but yeah, it's not quite as compelling as I would have liked. It's a decent, relatively solid game, but its flaws prevent it from achieving greatness "

												This is a pretty decent turn-based stategy, quite similar to Civ 5 in style, but in a fantasy setting. It does have a few downsides- the UI is a little bit clunky with you using left click to do everything which is quite unwieldy. It would be better if you used the strategy convention of left click to select and right click to give commands. You can only cast one spell per turn, which means that I don't bother casting most of the available spells, because healing and damage spells are the most useful. It's still worth getting.			"

												I have played, alot, of this game. It focuses mostly on the 4X's but little on the negotiation between players mostly its about combat. All players have 3 ways to think about you, helpful, ignore and enemy; depending on if you are in an alliance, have a non-aggression deal, or by being at war/acting hostile. The game is similiar to civ 5 so I'll list the differences instead.      Making units depends on having the building like in starcraft, but they always come from the city.      With the elf DLC you can build or control any unit in the game, otherwise your limited to 90% of them, see above.     Their are three main branches of unit types: human, undead, monster, and DLC branches koatl, elf.     Their are heroes in the game offered randomly to the player at a price.      Magic, anything can be enchanted/have a spell cast on it.     The game has two types of unaffiliated factions, neutral and monsters.     With the armageddon DLC their is a mode where everyone must fight together against a new threat, CIV needs this.     Their are dungeons which can amp up the difficulty if you choose to explore them called world portals.a Starcraft and Civ mashed-potato with magic gravy			"

												Personal Rating: Great Game, balanced, addictive and features rich.Classic Rating: ★★★★☆I loved it from the first match - which i lost :)As you know this is a fantasy turn-based strategy game: what i liked most is the great variety of mages (lords), troops (from humans to goblins to undead), monsters (snakes, bats, wolves, bears) and spells (elemental, arcane, attack/defense, healing/blessing), at your disposal.You are never bored, even when you have to wait some turns in order to gather your resources.. moreover, the game HUD offers a truly good aid telling you which actions can be taken at your turn (build, research, attack, trade or diplomatic affairs).The game automatically saves your match (you can save by yourself anytime, though); gameplay is basically one single battle against one or more enemy mages, over one or more worlds, till you achieve the victory or die trying. Multiplayer is supported too but i haven't tried it yet.IMHO, one thing could have been done better: tutorial and general guidance through the game when you play it for the very first time: it's not that easy to be ready to go but the learning curve is not that high either.. once you start exploring menu and icons you get the feeling on what is what and how things work.Strongly recommended, you can't miss Warlock: Master of the Arcane.

												Civilizations 5 meets Heroes of Might and Magic in this great little game that is essentially a light-hearted fantasy take on Civ. Combine this with the fact that it is part of the iconic Majeshty! series and it's trademark Sean Connery-esque narrator in the world of Ardania and you have a charming, addictive little Civ-scape that is easy enouh for your kids to learn but challenging enough to frustrate you.As a confessed Civ junkie, this game is a candy-cane version of an old classic and a very well-executed one at that. A steal for $10 or less, especially if you can rake in the DLCs. All in at $7 and I feel like a thief because I robbed the Devs on this little gem. Enjoy, Majeshty! Your Shteed Awaitsh you Shire! Who'sh Shean Connery Majeshty? (Really, the accent never gets old,)			"

												This is a great fantasy strategy game that has incorporated a large number of intricate details and features that make it even better and not what you'd expect in a profit-based market of today. For those who have played the civilization games this will be a great ride where you'll finally be able to enjoy fantasy warfare with a large collection of units from different civilizations, many different resources with their own uses, you'll be able to turn the table by casting spells that improve your units, your economy and much more!The only downside I have found so far is that the gameplay tends to be repetitive after a certain point but its well worth its money. Plus, it features 5 very cheap DLCs that enhance the game greatly and makes you start again. I have played about 25hour worth time in the first week.			"

												Think Civilization V except more ""RTSey"" and a much worse interface.I say more RTSey because you pretty much play it like one; you get resources, you build barracks/factory/spaceport etc, you expand to wherever there's resources. There's no unhappiness and ""growth"" is a static number on your city so you just put down as many cities as you possibly can to try and grab up everything while building up as large an army as possible. It's fun for a bit but the AI is not very challenging at all, and the lack of depth regarding anything but the fighting is really off-putting later when it becomes tedious putting down the nth market/farm/mana farm because that's all cities relly do mostly.The UI is also problemmatic because you left click to select and left click to move, meaning you can pretty easily accidentally click the wrong tile and waste your hero's turn, forcing you into a bad position you might possibly have to reload from. There also seems to be a memory leak becuase performance gets steadily worse the longer you play. If you do get it, restart the game occasionally...It was ok, not something I'd recommend friends though.			"

												As of now, this is the most-played game in my Steam Library.  I played this obsessively for a few weeks, giving up entire weekends to it.  When you start one of these games, be prepared to give up the next 20 hours of your life, because that's how long some of these games can take, depending on the game setup (difficulty, world size, victory conditions, etc.)The graphics, music, sounds effects, and gameplay all perfectly complement each other, and they don't get old even after hours of gameplay.  Because you don't want to leave a game unfinished, you end up saying, ""Just one more turn, then I'll take a break.""  Three hours later, you're still playing, literally starving because you can't leave the game to cook some food.  The game takes so long because it takes time to build up your force enough to overcome an enemy.  There are also neutral monsters which pose a threat.  Not to mention, you have to wait for the AI to finish their turns.  The wait is totally worth it, because the feeling of slowly overcoming your opponents is addicting.  The AI isn't super smart, which is good or bad, depending on your perspective.  Personally, I liked taking advantage of the flawed AI strategies, like sending their entire army to me by boat, which I destroyed before they could even land.  Diplomacy with the AI is somewhat of a joke.  They might make a truce with you, but they'll break it on a whim.  I tried to be honorable with truces, but after you've played awhile, you start to understand the motivations of the AI when they make a truce, and you can tell when they are about to break it.Another great aspect of this game is the random world generation and fog of war.  From the initial setup, you have an idea of what the world is like, but not the details.  Curiosity and fear of the unknown helps to maintain your interest as you explore the map.  After playing this, I tried Civilization 5, and personally, I hated it.  I'd rather take a history class.  Personally, I don't like playing games that remind me of reality.  Warlock is a fantasy escape into another world, and it really absorbs you.  I can't recommend it highly enough.   "

												The spiritual successor to Civ 2: Test of Time's Fantasy Game Mode that Firaxis likely will never give.The game basically plays like a Civ game with a fantasy mesh. A Civ 5 game ofcourse, but a Civ game nonetheless, only there is actual difference between the races in the game in how they operate at the most basic of levels.There's Human, Undead, Elves and Monsters and they all work differently.Each race has different units, though they do share some specific units and they all also have a few unique buildings, but share mostly all the same ones.Humans are balanced, because uncreativity.Undead eat Mana and are really good for taking out neutral cities early-game.Elves are powerful and can research Spells the fastest.Monsters can produce more food than any other race, meaning more cities earlier on.The game doesn't suffer from any Arbitrary systems that people have grown used to and grown to accept, such as Happiness, Culture, Religion or Tourism. There's none of that. Instead every building and every unit requires some form of upkeep. Some requiring food, or gold, or mana, or two of those, or all three I think.Instead of following a rigid as crap tech tree, you only research spells, which are situational abilities that cost mana. you accumulate it overtime like gold, and spend it on these spells, and the spells range from creating temporary units, damaging or buffing existing ones, or even altering spaces on hte board, like making more land. Yes, one spell turns ocean into land.With tech out of the picture, you may ask ""Well how do you get the cool units then?"" well dear reader, you build stuff in cities. Progression is entirely based on what buildings you have in your cities, which each building occupies a space, and you can't pillage anything.In my opinion, the game is criminally underlooked.That being said, here are some issues I have with the game...Unlike in nearly any other Turn-based Strategy game ever, once moves are playing out, you cannot do anything until it ends, though you can easily Left click to skip them and finsih them instantly.Some controls (like moving and doing unit actions with hte left click) are a bit backwards when they feel like they shouldn't be (after all, it's common that LEft click selects, and right click does orders. It's a rule of all strategy games ever. Why not do that? It's simpler and easier.).There's no actual in-game help, which there always should be in games like this. Even just control help would be useful. Meaning you need to refer to a Wiki in order to figure stuff out, or take forever in comparison, and learn what makes certain things go.All in all, this is a game that any civ player should get, it's better than Civ 5 in my eyes and this is hte civ 2: Test of Time Fantasy Mode that Firaxis will likely never give again.I give this game an 8/10.The soundtrack is great, voice acting is fitting and nice, and the game just looks like a gorgeous fantasy world.Bonus points for using Multi-Map, which is CRIMINALLY Underused, like... Seriously.It's worth getting.			"

-Quick Review-Warlock - Master of the Arcane is a turn-based strategy game, like many strategy games, the longer you play, the more elaborate the tactics get, and the longer your turn gets as your control over the world increases!...or you get constantly bombarded by random world events and you can't expand because you're fighting off hoards of giants, dragons, undead, and random quest heroes. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  Welcome to Adrania, maybe you've been here before, maybe this is your first visit, regardless welcome, welcome. This land has appeared in numerous games, the first game I played in the series was ""Majesty Gold Edition"".In this game, you are one of (X) amount of Mages/Warlocks, depending on the world size you may have more or less mages/AI/NPC's in the game. The more AI the more competition in the game. (But on the flip side, the more people fighting back the wild landscape... and trust me, it's wild) Game Play: Starting with the most basic explanation about the game play, you have Hex's which represent segments of the land, very similar other strategy games, some hex's increase gold, food, or magic... while others are just taking up space, or even reduce values.I compare this game to one of the Civilization games except that you're fighting with magic instead of science, and the ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" game of Land, Air, and Water units. It is now more like ""Rock, Paper, Scissors, TNT, Chuck Norris, God""; There's magic that you can cast, there's magic units, heroes which can be equipped with better armor and weapons, you can upgrade them with gold, in addition to the typical ""ship, flying, and land"" units.I need to point out I haven't played the multiplayer yet. However, after looking it up, the game doesn't have ""simultaneous turns"", so the multiplayer will be at an even slower pace. You probably don't want to get into a very large game, smaller skirmishes so you can play the game for a day... ...instead of spanning over several weeks. Achievements: There are no steam achievements for Warlock - Master of the Arcane. Price: Warlock - Master of the Arcane is priced at $24.99. For me personally, strategy games have always had a high value because I play them long and really enjoy the challenge. I won't lie, I picked this game up for free from Humblebundle, but this game on a 50% or better sale is definitely worth it. Conclusion: The first time I played Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim (released in 2000), was when I was in highschool, I had no idea that there were more games from the same universe! So once I heard the announcer's voice I thought ""NO WAYYYYYY!!!!"" I'm happy to have returned to Ardania!As I said earlier in my review, this game is basically Civilization with Magic. While it's not the most well made strategy game out there, there's definitely enough fun stuff you can do in the game to keep you entertained for a long time. I find myself thinking ""okay... one more turn, then I'll go to bed"" And just keep telling myself that for another hour.I recommend this game for standard strategy game fans, Chances are if you like Civ5, you can pick up this game... but you will find Civilization has been made much better and tighter fitting then Warlock - Master of the Arcane.

												I've been on Steam for years, and I cannot recall writing a review; this game begs to be an exception (and rightly so), so here's my short n' sweet:- Old time gamers remember Master Of Magic from the 90s? If so, good...- Current gamers ...have you played Age Of Wonders 1, 2, or 3? If so good...- And/Or, perhaps have you played Elemental: Fallen Enchanter or Sorcerer King (Starkdock)? If so, did it feel so-so, or the artistry not your flavor? Regardless, keep reading...- And/Or, have you played any CIV 1-6 game? If so, good...If you are familiar with any of those said games, then you'll be right at home with this one. Paradox really got a lot of things right in this game, like:- The AI actually has personality! While no game's AI is w/o flaws, I can honestly say that is was immensely refreshing to have a game's AI at least *try* and behavior in a human thinking fashion. Depending on your Mage/alignment/religion/other factors, certain other Mages will either gravitate toward you or away from you. In this, the AI is *NOT* bashful about requesting alliances with you, offer to trade gold/mana for its own purposes, go to war against you, pursue alliances w/ other mages, or attempt a ""frienemy"" stance with you...until the time is right to attempt a back-stab at ya. Bottom-line is: I actually felt, at times, that I was playing against another player and was impressed on how the AI attempts to use alliance/bartering in an attempt to pursue its own victory/expansion. WAY TO GO PARADOX on nailing this one - other companies need to learn from you on this one! This really makes re-playing the game worth-wild and keeps things interesting - don't leave your border defenseless ....or you will eventually learn the error of your ignorance!- Civilization players will feel some basic similarities, like: resource management (food, gold, mana, and research) through city buildings/spell upgrades, army movement, and hex map world setup. Additionally, there are rare material tiles  too (silver, gems, pigs, etc); these additional rare material resources offer a very flavorful variety of choice to the game! For example, let's say you're city has a ""Gems"" resource tile. You have 2 choices:Jewelry Shop - 4 Gold / 1 Mana Building Upkeep CostPerk: Protection Amulets - 35 Death/35 Elemental Resistance (100gp/per unit upgraded; one time cost)Eligible Units: Fighter, Creature, Ranged, Caster, HealerGem mine - +20 Gold Production- And here's another example:Adamantium Smelter - 10 Gold / 3 Mana Building Upkeep CostPerk: Adamantium Armor - 45 Melee/45 Death/20 Spirit Resistance (250gp/per unit upgraded; one time cost)Units: Fighter, Ranged, Creature, Caster, Healer, ConstructTransmutation Facility (Elves) - +15 Gold, +15 Mana, +15 Research- Each spell serves a tactical purpose that enables a variety of play-styles! Furthermore, I found myself using spells I'd research, didn't think I'd use, but then come to use them later on (i.e. teleport; great for moving a hero quickly / raise land; great for adding more tile opportunities to your city vs. being stuck with water tiles, OR useful when you want to create a mountain range barrier between you and another mage!). It was VERY refreshing to use a variety of spells from my spell book! It makes you FEEL like an Master Mage, which is why you're playing the game - right?I could go on, but I'm already turning this review into a lengthy wall of text. If you are a beloved fan of Master Of Magic, Age Of Wonders, CIV 5, etc. then I recommend this game hands down. It's fun, addicting (""just one more turn"" ...hours later), requires some actual brain power and thought process, and it has a wonderful replay value vs. price point. Final highlights:- Graphics 4/5- Sound/Music: 4/5 (overall, the spell, unit, and ambient sound is 5/5; however, limited music tracks leaves me wondering why not when everything else feels so polished; I solved this by playing my own favorite fantasy music in the background, on low setting so i can enjoy the ambient game sounds)- Unit Diversity: 5/5- Spell Usefulness/Diversity: 5/5- Map Sizes: 5/5 (Maps can be huge! Not to mention numerous ""outter planer"" worlds that add to the sheer size of the game your playing; you can alt to play with or without them)- Exploration Opportunities: 5/5 (play on a huge map, with 5 outter worlds, and you'll find yourself with A LOT LOT LOT of exploring to do. I've played games where I barely saw more than 50% of what I could have explored - when taking the outter worlds into consideration!) - AI : 4/5-Replay-ability: 5/5Buy this game, go have fun, and feel like the bad♥♥♥♥♥world dominating mage you were meant to be! Cheers!(Paradox - well done! This game has a wonderful balance of game mechanics, and nothing feels ""over-powered"" or ""under-powered."" Easily in my top 10. Thank you!)			"

												Here is my crack at reviewing a game, I have played a number of turn based strategy game. It looks like what would be a MOD for Civ V with fantasy elements. In a sense it’s actually that Civ V with wizards, dragon, etc. However there are clear differences. In this game you play as a great mage, you decide the race, some races have an adherence to certain gods more so than other (that benefit is really clear when you are deciding to build a temple or completing a quest for the Gods). Don't feel flustered when choosing a race, you have a chance to invade and take over lands, and incorporate the people to your own army. For example if you are a goblin race who has taken over a Rat owned land, you now have the power to produce Rat soldiers and Goblin soldiers. This is similar to Civ V's aspect of taking over lands. The difference is that from my experience there is no corruption that is clearly seen when you force control other's land. Another difference is that, even on the hardest setting the game is doable, in other words you can last at least 100 turns. I found the most difficulty is with not the other great mages you fight, but the ""wildlife"" elementals, dragons, etc. You get Hero type characters at random times, they can be augmented with artifacts. The ""Heroes"" are similar to great people in Civ V, but they usually help to ramp up your army (as I found they are superior to normal creatures you recruit) they aren’t like great engineers or culture enhancers. There are limits to how many Hero type characters you are allowed.Buildings in the game are not built freely they are built when you level up your Castles (which are your Cities) you may build buildings and creatures at the same time (you may build creatures at any time given you have the improvements that allows you to do so). There is no starvation in any city, but if you accumulated many foods, excess will go into gold, if you are wanting to build great vast armies then having a lot of gold per turn is a good thing. Keep in mind that sometimes military creatures may take up gold, food, and sometimes even mana per turn. Development in your castle is notoriously slow. There are no workers to alter your lands, improvements to lands are done with buildings within the city/castle.....OR by you yourself...... but these improvements aren't necessarily land alterations but land utilizationWays to utilize your lands. Throughout the game you can accumulate food, mana, and gold through city improvements, similar to Civ V. The difference is as mentioned before no workers, and also no wonders. Research is essential to gaining tools necessary to gain an advantage. In this game instead of discoveries or technologies, you learn spells. These spells are reusable they never expire, however there is the occasional prep time that requires two turns to use one spell, some can be used twice in one turn. In addition to the time required to cast a spell there a mana cost. Spells as mentioned previously are researched. Spells vary from direct damage, helpful enchantment, detrimental curses, to land alterations. You can scorch the land make it pretty much unusable, restore it, raise it (really nice feature), or lower it. A feature in the game is that if you hate water make land, if you can’t pass mountains lower it. The elevation levels are this: mountains-----hills----plains----water. (raising or lowering brings it up one or down one elevation level, you can use them repeatedly on the same lands) Mountains are unusable and impassable and you will benefit a great deal if you lower them. The water provides a tax in traversing, you also benefit by making new land from it. There are spells that make lands more food, gold, or mana productive. This is great when looking into resources found in the game.Resources can provide a boost in gold production, special military units, or a boost in food production. This is similar to Civ V’s use of resources. Nothing really can be said hereTroops that you recruit generally move faster than in Civ V (from my experience), and gain perks every level up (same as Civ V).There are portals that traverse you to different realms that are usually inhabited by strong creatures. Overall this game was a good play, I got this game through a humblebundle, but I would highly encourage an hour of play to get it right, sometimes the hints are stuck and you would not be able to exit it out. I recommend turning the hints off altogether or press escape.  "

												It's hard not to start a review for this game with ""Civilization V in a fantasy setting"" so I decided I won't.Won't not, that is.Because this is very, very much like Civilization V except in a fantasy setting, and that is by no means a bad thing.In case you've never played a Civilization or more generally a 4X game, you're tasking with the survival of a faction and will need to manage cities, armies, diplomacy and the discovery of the world around you.There were barely any features truly unique to this game, in fact the only thing that appears to be without a direct Civ V parallel would be the magic system.I would definitely recommend this to people that want to play long campaigns guiding a civilization as it develops in a fantasy setting. The game did exactly what I hoped it would and I had no technical problems or concerns about design choices at all.Whether you'll ever prefer this to Civ depends on what you want, this being slightly more focussed on combat and less on development, but it's definitely a fun game to play.

												A great game in the spirit of Master of Magic.In my opinion from all the games that tried to clone MoM, Warlock - Master of the Arcance came closest to the original. While it looks like CIV5 it's an independent game with his own engine. As the original MoM the game focus more on combat and tactics than building an civ-a-like empire .One thing the game really sticks out are the astonishing graphics. Stop for a moment, zoom in and enjoy the incredible detailed building and unit models that are unique to each of the 3 races. (Humans, Monsters, Undead) (check my screenshots)			"

												I bought this game cause it screamed Master of Magic, one of my old timey favorites. It was okay. The entire game plays like MoM shoved into a much simplified version of Civilization V. The result is a game like Civ in a fantasy world, that focuses much more on units and combat, but doesn't really bring much new to the table. There are spells and resources and tile upgrades, but it really all exists just to help you produce more units to crush your foes. A nice idea, but there are much stronger turn based strategy options out there.			"

												First Glance (~2h played)Take the old classic Master of Magic, mix with Civ5-like terrain and UI, throw in a hint of HOMM and add decent if not great AI. What do you get?- You get racial specific, balanced units which can be buffed or upgraded.- Lots of fighting between Mage armies, minor cities, monsters. This is the main focus of the game.- There's lots of units, and you dont depend on one race, only start with one.- Only three races, but at least they're balanced and there's a boatload of indipendent units.- Simple spell research in place of tech.- Ability to unleash said spells to modify units, terrain or cities.- Simple but honest Truce, Pact or War diplomacy.- A world to explore and expand upon. Then another world when you find a portal link to it. And another one after that...- Guarded loot as in MoM, monster spawners, rampaging monsters, and other map features to keep exploration interesting.- Some spells are fire&forget, others are buffs that require upkeep.- Simplified economy. Few resources to manage, all directly related to keeping your war machine on the march and growing.- Slightly convulted way in which buildings unlock other types of buildings or even troops.- Very little terrain feedback! (Archery bonuses, terrain defense, etc).- Oceans that are worthless except as passages.- Pumpkins as a resource on which Shrines of the Rotting Pumpkin can be built. ikr, awesome!- Resources that grant bonuses or allow for units to be built in the city.- AI that can fight. (turn up the difficulty)- AI that ... will occasionally attack Ghosts (weapon immunity) with a common melle unit (uses weapons). Genius, but doesnt really work.Also:- Gods, ability to anger gods, and become destroyed by angry gods.- Multiplayer, so you can throw fireballs at your friends like they were pies!- A dose of humor, as the game doesn't take itself too seriously. Unit responses and even unit names can be humorous.Between Master of Magic, Civ V and Heroes of Might and Magic, Warlock mostly resembles MoM, but with tactical combat replaced by Civ's system. Why did i not know of this game before? Granted that it's not one of the best ever made, but it's very good and can favorably be compared to Civ V (IF, and that's a big IF, you want the game simplified and focused on combat). I think the name is stupid, that's probably worth 10% of a review score right there.			"

												This game reminds me of good old ""Master of Magic"" and I recommend it to everyone who likes that kind of games. The metascore doesn't give the game full credit because many great features were added months after its launch (especially hero units and items). The focus is clearly on unit management and fighting. The city and resource management is rather limited to finding a suitable place and expand and build fast. An interesting aspect is to take over cities of other races so that you can also use their race special abilities, units and buildings (and even build new cities by using peasants of that race).One weakness of the game is that it kind of always plays the same (at least for me). Expand fast (with some luck of enemy and especially monster positions). Build, upgrade and buff your units. Fight until all enemies are dead. You can also try to focus on your magic power but since it is rather easy to create nearly unbeatable units (especially heroes) I find it more attractive to just build a handful of super units and kill everything on sight. I personally love that approach of warfare but whoever prefers big armies of cannon fodder or diplomatic victories might not like the game as much as I do.Update: I have to say that when you are looking for a remake of ""Master of magic"" I suggest to try ""Fallen Enchantress: Legendary heroes"" which is even closer to the ""original"". It features turn based combat instead of worldmap combat and is a lot harder but I like both games for what they are.			"

												A bit basic as far as 4x games go, but the combat and ability to cast magic is fun and the ability to make decisions regarding exploiting resources you find (do you build a mine on a source of silver to make money, or set up a forge so you can reinforce your weapons with it?) and explore and settle portals to other worlds guarded by powerful monsters.  Probably the best feature is the ability to build a temple to one of a pantheon of gods which will give you access to powerful unique units and spells related to that god, but anger their rival gods.  On the downside, it's kind of unbalanced (spamming cities is the best strategy and management gets super tedious) and the AI/diplomacy isn't too hot so it's a little bit lacking in lasting appeal.  The Armageddon DLC provides a structured, meatier challenge and is also well worth picking up.			"

												I actually like that there is a chance that you can be in dire danger within a few turns, on even the easier levels.  I also like that can make custom warlocks, specializing in anything from farming to instructor to etc.  There is a lot of replay value.  No two games truly will not be the same.  Sometimes perfect landscape locations.  Other times not too far from a volcano.  Sometimes foes are far away, an other times, you meet them in a turn or two.  I also like the almost like Sid Meier's like system of spell advancement trees, which at times look like they may be no real patterns.  Combat is fun.  The less health a unit has, the less power it has.  One also has to keep track of economics, food growth, and magic power available.  You may not be able to afford to keep that new awesome lord you want to recruit.  It is different, even though it may have the outward appearance of a hybrid.  My son got the demo,  I never played the demo, but told him if he did some chores I would get it.  He has yet to had the chance to play it.   it has been ALL dad time...Now that I have over 100 hours on it, I find it even more awesome.  The different types and species of heroes make it fun.  There so many ways to meet the challenges, and likewise there are ways to meet defeat.  I'll be back at 250 hours. :)			"

												This game is amazing.First off if you were lucky you got this game for free, if not it goes on sale for less than $5 everytime.The first thing you will realize is that it is a civalizations type game.It starts you off as one of 12 (might be more) different wizard lords bound to their own cause, but free to become your own.Instead of having pesky villagers you have to worry about dying, you have city extensions that produce resources and other bonus wonders.You should play this like you play Sid Myers Civ 5, and you will be fine, but in case you need it there is an in depth tutorial that doesn't bother you or drag on forever.Instead of advancing to the next stage in technology like most strategy games this keeps it cool and stays in the same era of weapondry, which is one thing that bugged me when playing the Civ Games. There is nothing more lorebreaking like seeing the Myans with robots nuking and anchient Chinese Empresses.The game has a large variety of units and has a large focus on casting badass spells if you have the mana.The enemy wizard lords AI lacks a large variety of negotiations, but at least you wont have Ghandi yelling at you for being a Warmongrel.FInally, and at long last, I would say this is a very fun alternative to Civ 5 and is significantly better for the low price.8.75/10 Good job Ino-Co, I'm hooked.

												I am so glad I got this one (the whole package including main game and extensions). I hesitated to get it since so many people said it is a clone of Civ V (another game I really like). As it turns out there are some common elements: cells can only be occupied by one unit, cities grow their borders, peasants build new cities, etc. But the emphasis here is on combat. This is an RPG combat strategy game first and foremost with some simple empire building and diplomacy elements. The main selling point is that the combat is on fantasy setting: minotaurs, fire elementals, paladins, vampires, trolls. You start by choosing  one of  four races to begin with: elves, humans, undead and monsters (ratmen). Each has a very distinct feel, pros and cons versus the other races. From time to time heroes offer their services. There all sorts of upgrades for your units. Some you gain from combat. Others you get from having a specific resource inside the city borders and having constructed a building to harvest this resource. Same goes for the units you can hire. They can be hired only after you have built the specific structure. Since resources are limited you will be making the usual decision: should you get a really strong unit? Or should you get a new upgrade and pay the costs of upgrading less powerful units? And if so which upgrade? Should you attack another civilization or expand your empire into unexplored territory? The game uses random generation to great effect: there are random events and quests such as killing a powerful enemy that suddenly spawns. This causes disruptions to your plans: should you go for it or continue expanding? you can use all sorts of spells (once you research them and the system selects randomly which will you have available). Spells can heal and buff your units (at a mana cost) and even do terra-forming.			"

												Smart (grand and tactical) strategy with hi-fantasy; together again.Remember the classic hexagonal war series Panzer General? The series went onto make all kinds of sequels, one of which was Fantasy General.  That game scratched an itch for me in that I like Grand Strategy War games and I like Fantasy games whether strategy, tactical, role plying or other.  It was a solid effort but something was missing.  Warlock re-treads this ground in Wizard’s robes and does it quite well.  It has the tight and balanced combat of the PG series with plausible and clever (role based) fantasy units brought from several traditions. The Bonus to me is that there is as well a generous layer of Civ-5 era Civ-type flavour heaped on.  Research tree, Religious favour, building wonders (sorta), and cultures with distinctive units all have their place in the overall game play and strategies. This game may not have the most original ingredients but it has taken the right amount from each of it’s influences and mixed them well.Although I like this game quite a bit, I do have some complaints: - There does seem to be a memory leak where one needs to reload the game every few turns to prevent processing slow down.  - The underworld's populations seem to grow exponentially out of control by mid-game. Overall I would recommend this game to gamers who are any flavour of strategy enthusiast or specialize in turn-based-strategy, hex war games, fantasy strategy or are looking for fantasy/strategy options away from the main stream. - Overall: 8/10. - Tighten up the scripting: 9/10.

Rule the world with some side quests/Little hard to start playing this, because it wont raise your awerness to all gameplay elements, you will be just thrown into the game. This is my first game of this type.

												Over 1400 hours in and I'm finally getting around to my review...This game is great for scratching the 4x itch in a fantasy setting.  It worked great for me on Windows 7 and 10.  I rarely found any bugs, although there are some lurking.  The diplomacy options aren't the deepest, and the AI behavior isn't the most sane, but they suffice.  It takes a while to figure out what game setting are most fun for you, so make sure to try different world sizes, numbers of AI players, islands versus continents, victory conditions, and setup of your great mage.  I've never tried the multiplayer, so I can't comment on that.  Of my Steam games, this is the original and one of the best for my money to this day.  If you're a fan of fantasy 4X in an interesting and different setting, give this one a shot.			"

Posted: October 3, 2015
												I am recommending this game (the Complete Edition is best) with some serious caveats. First, the good bits... it is an entertaining, light-hearted, turn-based, fantasy 4x strategy game that is quite good at evoking that infamous ""one more turn"" feeling. The unit voices and descriptions are hilarious and there are a lot of fun units and spells. The skills your units acquire as they gain levels are also a lot of fun. It should be noted that the game puts you into conflict with other mages really quickly, so expect to be battling right away. If you like subtle victory conditions in your 4x games (diplomacy, intrigue, culture, research, etc.) then this is not your game. This sucker is all about stomping your rivals to goo with the biggest, baddest units you can muster. While that's not terribly deep, it's strangely gratifying to just bash the hell out of everybody.Now for the bad bits. The game is horribly unoptimized (every spell effect in the game causes the graphics to stutter), quite buggy (there are even some game crashing bugs here along with the little stuff), and there are gameplay aspects that REALLY need improvement. The game is particularly bad at providing information you need to make good strategic decisions, such as telling you the prerequisites for buildings and units or telling you what a skill will do if you select it when upgrading a unit. Want to recruit an Elder Vampire unit? The only way to get one is to randomly build stuff in your city until you accidentally bump into the ones required. You can look up all that stuff on a wiki, but unfortunately, you can't do that while playing because alt-tabbing out introduces graphics refresh problems on the overland map. The final issue is the developer simply stopped supporting Warlock to release Warlock II, which appears to be just a badly patched version of Warlock. It feels a bit like Warlock was a scam to get people to buy something that was never going to be finished so they could charge us again for patches. If Ino-Co Plus showed ANY inclination to support this game and fix the issues, I would whole-heartedly recommend it, but they have not released a patch since December 2012, so it is obvious they intend to let it rot. I hold Paradox Interactive (the publisher) to be somewhat at fault here too for not insisting that Ino-Co Plus provide proper support for Warlock before agreeing to publish a sequel. I'll be very leary about purchasing anything published by them in the future.If the game still sounds interesting to you, I recommend you only buy Warlock if it is heavily discounted. It's just sad when a developer has so little pride and sense of responsibility that they would leave their product in such an 'almost done' state. I'll certainly never buy anything developed by Ino-Co Plus again. There really are some good things here and ultimately it manages to be quite enjoyable in spite of itself. I've certainly gotten my money's worth out of it, though I'm glad it cost me less than $10.			"

												Fun, but for something that calls itself ""Master of the Arcane"" there's awfully little arcane, relying on pushing units around the map.One or two spells per turn on average, versus countless units, I would have prefered it the other way round. Plus, casting a spell is pretty much the only thing it does not remind the player to do. I do like the unintrusive way it reminds me of other things, so that's a plus on the interface.A minus is that it doesn't show me what units I can build where in the city list, so I'd have to guess and check all of them. It also isn't very informative on what I need to do to get what. One of my cities won't let me build a Mana Trap, and I have no idea why. Earlier I wanted to research Fertile Lands, but had no idea how to get that either. At some point I could suddenly cast it (I assume I found it).A few more postives: - Customizable Win conditions. No need to keep an opponent alive (like I used to in Master of Magic) to cast the Unity spell, simply untick the win option of beating all opponents.- Go-to orders come AFTER I did my turn (after pressing end of turn), so I can still change their orders before that, and it's still/again my turn when they end up with movement points left after they arrived. (I hated having to wait through all the go-to orders in Civ before I even get to do something.)And while you can't disable movement animations/showing enemy moves, clicking somewhere cuts that short (the plain info of ""Enter ends your turn"" under the purple button at the bottom right corner is perfect for that).- Little gems of humour hidden away, sometimes referencing films and possibly other media. They always make me smile.A drawback is that the game slows down after a while on my computer (which isn't that old), with a noticable delay when I click on one of the reminders mentioned above, before it gets to the relevant place. So I have to save, quit, and start the game again to get normal response time again. (Edit: Friend told me how to fix or at least delay that: don't use the wide option of the spellbook.)But that's not the only problem. With graphics on max, even the Steam chat input was delayed, huh!? (The reason I have the graphics all on lowest. Which still has all the animations active. The tiny figures doing stuff is very cute and well done, but it would be nice to disable that.)Right now I ran into a graphic glitch that keeps turning up when I capture a certain city.


Looks like a graphic glitch, but won't go away with just loading again.

You are a faction, build up your cities and armies in a world made out of tiles, and fight evil beasts and enemy factions. However, its the combination that makes this game so fun.You can choose between different nations like elfs, beasts, undead, humans [...] and then build up your empire. Spells, buyable heros, neutral cities and tons of hostile beasts roam the world. This is not about going through the time, but creating your own one. You can jump through different worlds, find powerfull artifacts and even worship good or evil gods that grant you immense bonuses. It's basicly just a Civilization game in a Fantasy Setting.

												This is a fun, little strategy game where you try and defeat your opponents. The game can somewhat be compared to Civilization 5 but in a fantasy setting. The combat is done the same way.Warlock also features ""other realms"". Which may contain stronger monsters but also more/better items/resources.Upgrading units can only by done by upgrading buildings in cities, which are placed on the map, so you can't build everything in every city. Additionally, every city can have a specific race like elf or orc, which also changes what units they can produce.Additionally, you have Hero units which can be recruited by random events which can be equipped by items you may find scattered on the field. Of course, is no fantasy game complete without magic. Thus you can research spells and cast them them to damage enemies, buff units or summon an army.It all is a fun concept and it plays very nice too.However, ever game has its flaws and so does this game.The AI, for example, loves to declare war at you, even when they can't reach you and then settle for peace. All the time.The battling/Sieging AI is also not the best, sometimes retreating randomly when they destroyed nearly all defences.Technically, that would be the biggest problem as the rest, are all small annoyences, rather than actual problems.For example, I notice you can only end the turn when every city is atleast building something when there is a slot available or that units you control must move every turn. (I could be wrong here but I never noticed the opposite)That is just one of the small ones. Most are hard to explain and only really be noticed when you played the game.It's a great game with only some small annoyences and I would really recommend it if you enjoy strategy games in a fantasy setting. Additionally, a Warlock 2 is coming soon, so if you read about these annoyences, you could hope 2 removes those.			"

												I started playing this game not expected much, but it turned out to be a great game.  You choose a faction and slowly start producing units and expanding to take over resources and local hostiles.  You get spells and heroes to recruit and upgrade toward your liking.  Coming across other factions proves to be a difficult experience that you might consider creating temporary alliances instead of a full take over.There are also other worlds you can venture to which I assume are progressively more difficult, but I have not yet got to the point where my nation is stable enough to consider attacking.

												A well-crafted, easy-to-play game with an entertaining fantasy bent, Warlock will have you staying up nights. The lack of depth does wear thin over the long-haul after you've played a bunch of match to their conclusion, but you may find yourself reluctant to let go until you've fully experienced into each faction's magical might.The game perfectly fulfills the expectations raised and offers good content at an affordable price. And this is quite important these days.			"

												It plays like almost exact clone of Civilization V set in fantasy universe. Additional features like heroes you can hire, spells you can learn, magical artifacts you can find, etc. are interesting. VERY addictive like Civilization V, 'one more turn', 'one more turn', 'and just the last one more turn...' can keep you glued to the screen for hours.			"

												Great game. Basically its your typical hexbased strategy game but with magic. If a battle isn't going too well, BOOM! Fireball! I found it a good way to pass the time when I was listening to podcasts or radio shows in the background. It can be a bit easy on the normal setting especially if you just build a pile of towns very quickly but the expert difficulty seems like more of a fair fight. The ai can be a bit stupid and I did have some screen tearing on my old computer that were a bit awkward to fix but overall no huge problems to report. A-			"

												Very fun beautifully crafted 4X. I love the civ-like interface- Fans of the genre can basically sit down and start playing. All concepts from prior installments are there. Reasonably priced. I'm docking a point for lack of sandbox/map creation. Prior installments also lack this important feature- This alone keeps the series from attaining legendary status IMO. (That clumsy addon they released for the last game is practically useless). Also, I hoped they would have incorporated base production/mana etc.. values for tiles. Other than that, this game is a solid, good-looking title worth owning.			"

												One of the games I have spent more time on than any other, and still one of my favourite fantasy-themed 4x-strategy games.Hex-grid, city-building, empire-building, heroes, wizards, dragons, ogres, goblins, and rotting pumpkin shrines.Great fun.Comes with caveats though: this game will tell you pretty much nothing.You can either figure out how it works as you go along, through trial and error (as I spent many unfortunate hours doing).Or, you can look up the Wiki.Having gone the long way, I suggest using the Wiki.Don't get me wrong, I spent many an enjoyable and challenging hour playing this game. But I also spent many frustrated, irritated hours being angry at the Devs for the plain unhelpful interface, and lack of pretty much and guidance or feedback.

If you are willing to trial-and-error it, or do a good deal of reading, highly recommended game.

												I love this game. It's definetely very fun. It is similar to Civilization V but with different play mechanics. In Civ V one of the things that I really didn't like is that it starts out very slow. In this game, you get melee units from turn one with a city that has enough population to build things. It starts out very fast and you can start attacking other cities very early on. This is why I like it. As many have pointed out it is about war. Granted there are other ways to win, it's mostly about capturing capital cities of enemies. There's a lot of variety when it comes to monsters. There's all kinds of creatures from rats to fire shooting golem elementals (the Fire Elementals). I recommend this game to those that like strategy based games, especially Civ V and more especially to those who love war victories (like me).			"

The main problem is the poor AI on the computer opponents and that will ultimately limit the enjoyment of the CIV series veterans.			"

												Fantastic game for people who love Civilization series.It's a mixture of Civ5 (mostly), Heroes of Might and Magic (You have heroes that gain exp. and different races? Pehaps species would be a better word. This include Humans, Undead and various insect, and dragonlike species), and of course for fans of Majesty there is Ardania, and couple parallel (for the lack of better word) worlds. No to mention whole tree of Magic to research. And here is the only bug I've encountered. If you want to see all the spells, you've researched, you have to use smaller, not extended version of Magic Book. But this small bug, while may be annoing doesn't cloud the fun I had playing game. After over 200 rounds in one game it still manages to suprise me (in a good way), and it seems I will be playing it for years. 9/10 or 4,5/5			"

												Simple 4x game, nice introduction to the genre or a nice casual experience for the pro.It's not got the complexity of other 4x games, instead Warlock goes down the route of funziez. It's a very casual experience that after a while can lose it's charm and turn into mediocrirt but for the first 10-20 hours will hold your attention competently.Don't bother putting it on the highest difficulty, the ai spams an ocean of units and it's just ridiculous. There are many types of units with various abilites but nothing really new.I like how your spells can interact with the landscape to create mountains and oceans. Levelling up was fun but a clear rip off of civ 5.eventually the game feels stale, lifeless and mundane. It's probably you won''t finish a campaign before your too bored to go on.not a very good 4x but fun for a good while. Worth it for £5 even if you've played all the other 4x games or are not up for learning anythign complex.			"

												As long as you think of Warlock as ""Civilization Fantasy Lite"", you'll have a lot of fun. Just don't expect a deep tactical strategy game, though. Almost everything about Warlock is extremely simplistic: from spells to combat to enemy AI to diplomacy, there's very little deep thinking in the game. Diplomacy in particular is a bit daft -- there are few options aside from trade and basic alliance requests, and the only choices when facing an opponent's demands for physical goods are ""Accept"" or ""Declare War"". Also, as i s the case with virtually every Civ-like strategy game ever made, the AI will start to cheat once you gain an advantage.Overall, Warlock is pretty addictive. There are a ton of different units and abilities, and each race has distinctive perks. But as of now, it's way too easy to steamroll the closest AI opponent early on, thereby allowing you complete domination of your region before even setting sights on the next AI player. Hopefully the devs fix the inconsistencies.			"

La gran diferencia está en que aquí el único camino posible para la victoria es la guerra: estarás todo el tiempo ocupado resistiendo ataques por parte de los magos rivales o preparandote para tu próxima campaña militar, siendo la expasión por el mapa una mera excusa para obtener más recursos con los que aumentar tu ejercito. También tendrás la posibilidad de investigar hechizos y lanzarlos en cualquier punto del mapa, como no podía ser de otra manera.Le falta aún pulirse y expandir algo más ciertos puntos de su mecánica de juego, pero en su estado actual es endiabladamente adictivo, como todo buen clon de Civilization.

												THERE IS NO CAMPAIGN! - for those who may be buying to play through some Epic 4x story mode.This game is all skirmish all the time.Pick a pre-gen'd mage or make your own with a selection of portraits, name change,  spells/traits/start bonuses and the choice of commanding 1 of 4 different races (each with their own benefits of course) as your main ""civ""5 difficulties to accompany all players and to increase as you become better.4 different map types (based on Water : Land ratio), and 4 map sizes. And the option of cylindrical or flat (so you can either exit one side and appear on the other, or have to run right to the other side all across the map in ""flat"")Able to face 8 Rival Mages (so 9 players inc you), and this wonderful feature called ""additional worlds"". Portals in game that lead to magical worlds riddled with dangerous enemies and loots! With the possibility of 6 of these!So at max you may have 9 players, on the biggest map, with 6 additional worlds to roam to. And that's not to mention all the monsters in the game that spawn with you, the ones that spawn via random events (which can inc loot drops n such) AND Neutral Cities which act like lesser ai and are at multiple levels, so capturing isn't always easy.Other stuff in the game includes  random quests, Religious Alignment, Powerful Hero units, Spells and Spell Research and Diplomacy. Along with a multitude of different buildings for each race and appealing graphics. I feel the game runs really smooth as well, atleast on my rig.I HAVE NOT PLAYED MULTIPLAYER so i can't comment, though im sure the same settings apply, exept with other humans of course.Games can be quite long as well, even on small settings.For example im playing on the second difficulty ""casual"" (though i could play higher, still trying to learn the game more), on a small world, 1 enemy mage, 1 additional world and it still takes me 2 hours to win. Though you can win in probably half that, im the type of guy who likes to explore the lands and kill all the monsters and get loots and build heaps of cities and stuff, always more than i really need.I just recommend this game to anyone into Turn Based/Fantasy/RPG/4X/Strategy and even probably City Builders.I believe it has something to appeal to all and once you've gotten through your first 1 or 2 games (with very helpful tutorial tooltips which you can enable on and off, so if you forget, you can just play a normal game again and have em pop up without having to do an actual tutorial mission) you will finally start enjoying it atleast twice as much and start thinking of strats and combos and cool ways to play!I got this for free, but do i think it's worth $25? Hell. Yes. Even without a Story Mode. The amount of content and options is worth, let alone the value for multiplayer. And remember it's for the complete addition which includes the base game and 5 other content packs.So if it sounds very appealing to you, $25 would be a good investment I feel, and if you score it on any kind of sale even 25% off, bonus!

I've played a few tributes to the original, and this is one is pretty much the best of them all.very flowing gameplay, meaning it is dedicated to your pacing. lots of spells to research, and tons of manipulation you can do to the land-units, your enemies, which can be a really fun tide-turning points.I think you should be very happy playing it if you are a fan of the original like me. the mini map for combat is not there, instead its on the map itself. so part of the tactics remains.kept me enthusiastic for a few weeks. well worth the money.one thing you should keep in mind- it isn't as easy as today's games, especailly on later difficulties. which makes it much more fun. I've replayed it 3 times after seeing i have no way of winning. until i've realized the best strategy to win, that's part of the fun in the game. finding it. well at least for me.			"

For the price,it puts these high priced buggy monstrosities that get released to shame. Im looking at you sword of the stars 2 (£30 ish with so far, 11 hours of frustrating seemingly alpha testing) / legends of pegasus (£34.99 - 97 minutes of buggy unplayable hell).The latest 1.3 patch has introduced a few bugs.1.5 fixed most.

												No other game has done a better job at paying homage to Master of Magic than Warlock - Master of the Arcane.  This is once heck of a ""just one more turn"" game. Fantastic graphics, deep strategy and so many ways to play.  Great fun and a grand game. Honestly, maybe a bit better than Warlock 2, as that game suffers from a much narrower campaign.  Warlock is a must have for fans of MoM and MoO style games - and the great humor of the Majesty universe shines throughout. 5 outta 5 wands up!			"

												Remembering back to when I first played Civilization, Masters of Magic or Masters of Orion...these are the originals in many ways. Seems like as 'improvements' are made, some of the original fun became 'work'. More stats, more management, slower gameplay, more variables, more of what sometimes seems...just more of for the sake of more. Yes...sometimes deep is okay if that is what someone is looking for, but sometimes these type of games were just a distraction and that distraction became more of a job, more of a headache when that is not what was being looked for.Warlock took me back somehow....back to an enjoyable game without so much work. It seems like many try to remake a classic...and in doing so, try to add and improve it. But, the ""improvements"" many times change the character...the feel of the experience. It is hard to explain this formula....as it is different for different people. All I can say is that, for me, Warlock was this feel I have wanted to feel again for a long time.Does it have faults? Sure. Is it the perfect feel? Hmmm....probably not. Will something else come along? Yes. But, for a time....Warlock has been that game that I can go back to after a LONG game of Endless Lengends (Great game by the way!).And, just like past titles....they tried to 'improve' in Warlock 2....and, for me....I go back to Warlock - Master of the Arcane. If it ain't broke...don't fix it. (Well, except for bugs...some balancing...oh, and let's add...nevermind lol)			"

												When Warlock was first released it seemed to me to be a disappointingly shallow 4X with diplomacy that only seemed to be in the game so they could say it was there and an annoyingly random research system.All credit to the developers they have been adding content to the game with free patches which have since added more depth, character and even online multiplay. They have done enough to raise my estimation of the game to the point that I would actually recommend it.For me, Warlock is the perfect after work slice of strategy gaming. Where Modern Manshoot 5 is just to brainless and Complicted Inaccessible Grand Strategy is too complex. Warlock sits in a comfortable niche of being accessible but thoughtful.It's not the sort of game you'd lose a weekend to though. "

												It's like a magical game of Civilization.It sucked up around 2 hours of my life and I felt like I'd been playing it for only a few minutes. It's pretty good. The worlds can be extremely huge, and there is the possiblities of other worlds if you decide to go into a portal and crap.You can also hire these special units for money, I guess you can call them heroes, because they just own anything. Pretty much like a hired boss. There's also monsters on the sea!My one gripe, however, is that there really isn't a tutorial, just a bunch of hints that tell you what to do. So, by the time you build something, you wouldn't have known that you could upgrade troops with money if you have a building that lets them upgrade. And it never tells you the importance of anything, so you have to figure out everything on your own.The diplomacy is a kinda weak and you don't really feel like your creating your own sort of country/kingdom/whatever.The game is pretty much a smaller version of Civ, I'd just get that if you could afford it, but this is a really good alternative.Oh yeah, also, you can use magic and stuff from having mana, so you can heal a troop on the spot, or just kill them. Oh, even better, you can use it and raise land.And yes, you can basically make a bridge through the ocean.			"

												Only downside I'd like to point out is multiplayer. You have to wait other human players' turn in real time, which could take more than 5 minutes per player in mid to late game. (some other games in the genre covered this issue smoothly to make it less of a waste of time and more fun to play multiplayer.) Apart from this, there's no reason to not play this game. Armageddon DLC adds a huge and original challenge which makes already awesome game pretty flawless.DEMONS LAND NEAR YOUR BASE, BUILD A HIVE, CORRUPT THE TERRAIN TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO COLLECT RESOURCES AND THEN EXPLODE ONLY TO MAKE IT ALL WORSE, SO PREPARE YOUR BODY SONBut again, that multiplayer issue bugs me.11/10 will definitely wait for my friends' turn for centuries again.

												Solid for a budget title but could have been great if they fleshed out some of the non-combat mechanics -- this undercuts three of four of the victory conditions making 'domination' the only relevant/interesting choice (and then it is simply a matter of capturing the rival capitols).  The Armageddon DLC salvages it a bit with the new victory condition of survivng waves of an invading force and ultimately requiring you to defeat a 'boss' after you've held out long enough.  Still fun but a lot of wasted potential that could have possibly been realized with another six months to a year of development time.			"

												Great for those who like the Civilization series.I saw a few reviews for this game just before it was released and was looking forward to it. When it came out, I was first abit confused, I was expecting as a veteran Civ player to just jump straight into this game and off I go but was initially upset with the game. This was down to me though, as once I stopped comparing it to Civ (and trying to play it like Civ) I noticed how much this game has to offer.The basics are similar to Civ series games, but the difference really make this a work of art. This isn't an AAA title, but for a small dev game its really good and I have had rather alot of fun with it, I havn't played it in ages and should go back to see how its developed as tonnes of stuff has been added since I last gave this ago.Pro'sLike the graphics, very vibrantNice and fairly original mechanicsEasy to pick upCon'sNot as indepth as other stratergy gamesToo much combat focus Overall I would recomend this game only to those who already enjoy stratergy games, if you are on the fence, probably not something you would enjoy.

												Pros: A good game, with lots of random specialised units that are appointed to your council, that stop the game from becoming too repetitious. Tactically the gameplay isn't bad at all, turn based, a lot like freeciv. Cons:The controls are horrendous. Everything is menu driven, and the menus are really sticky. That is to say you open menus up by accident and they wont ♥♥♥♥ off. Initially you will watch your units charge towards their doom, simply because you can't get the menu to go away. I had to restart the game 6-7 times because of issues with the controls. Absolutely horrible. Once you get used to them though, the game is actually pretty good. The other thing i guess was the monster spawn policy. It got pretty crazy towards the end.I'd give this game a solid 8/10 on the strategy side of things.			"

												I really like the world of warlock - master of the arcane. everything looks decent and the way things work is easy to understand and pretty straight forward. i keep the game installed just to return from time to time to mash up some cities with my fav undead armies. however, there are some flaws. the AI is not really intelligent to a point where it can detect a stronger foe or loosing battle and act accordingly in politics which makes the game quite easy even in harder difficulties. in addition games tend to grow quite a bit tiresome when you have to manage 20+ cities, units and events each turn but i dont have a solution myself for this yet so i wont complain.the biggest flaw in my opinion is the lack of a campaign and i dont really understand why this is the case. the framework is really good and it shouldnt be too hard to do one. in fact they decided to work on a successor instead which was not better at all so i dont really get what they are thinking. anyway warlock - master of the arcane offers a pretty solid fantasy world in which you can easily burn some hours while thinking about how to backstab your friendly allied neighbor country. 7/10!

												At first glance, this game is like Civ 5. A fantasy version of Civ 5. A half-done fantasy version of Civ 5. I was wrong and right at the same time.This game - as I just said - is pretty much a Civ 5 clone at first glance, however later on you learn that this game is not quite. With game mechanics that parallel them, this game still has plenty of other ideas, concepts and such which are completely different. The first that springs to mind are the spells.Spells are either the worst thing you in the history of ever or the best thing ever. Depends purely on which side you're on. These are an interesting - though unsurprising - element added to the game. Their near unlimited number and their wide range of effects can basically make you god-like, however these spells require mana and time to cast and if they are ongoing spells, mana for upkeep. However if you have tonnes of mana and little gold, fortunately you can just have the mass of your army be summed creatures that simply require mana for upkeep rather than gold (Some require both. Awesome...)An unusual set of elements are artefacts and lords. They randomly come about throughout the game and can be purchased/hired so long as you have enough gold to afford their upfront cost. Although you can find them in the map at various locations, I seem to find them a lot more of them to purchase at the start of the turn. The lords are a lot like their common unit counterparts, however with unique perks and abilities with the ability to equip artefacts to them to change or add more abilities. One lord got my attention and stood out from all the rest. It is - and I'm not making this up - the infamous rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I have screencaps of it if you don't believe me. The funny thing is about this creature is that it is one of the most OP units in the game Arm the rabbit with a broomstick and it can fly, crossing all terrain with no movement penalty and the ability to take on any creature. However there are stronger lords beyond this one so [OP intensifies].The game also has pocket dimensions and they are randomly scattered through the map (supposing you have enabled them) and are infinitely useful once you managed to capture one, drive out all the late-game monsters and in general wrestle them under your control. However once one is under your control, you essentially increased the power of your empire without the further need to war with other Great Mage (players or if you don't have friends like me, the CPU). Even then, if the wars do happen, the other Great Wizards are going to go through hell to reclaim any pocket dimension.The communication and interaction with the Great Mage is fairly limited compared to those in Civ 5, with no request there being something that can have a minor result if you decline. If someone either demands resources from you or has a request, declining it can either result in outright war with the other Great Mage or destroying your alliance if it's a request. It would be great if declining wouldn't be so extreme and would simply just decrease the Great Mage's attitude towards you rather than... this. Another thing that bugs me is that either there's no option to request a war with another Great Mage or I've missed it entirely.The same applies with quests. These are also unusual game mechanics that at some times can be VERY ANNOYING! Why? Failing to complete a quest can result in a punishment. Usually they don't amount in much e.g. some gold/mana lost, but some can be kinda... dumb. For example, one god losing favour with you simply because you couldn't build a church in time. For that to happen, you need to get yourself some holy ground and if that's in anothers' land, you have to go forcibly take it from them. Something like that isn't usually done in a small space of time. Taking a city can take many turns, even with a decent, strong army. Fortunately, some quests seem to last forever so you have plenty of time to do that quest. Unless you forget the quest and do other more presssing matters at hand.Overall, Warlock is a pretty good stratergy game but could do with a bit more effort towards the interaction with other Great Mages and a bit of rebalancing with their lords.

												I ended up getting this game for free through a website promotion. The interface is clunky and not fluent at all. The game looks great and is pretty fun to play until EVERY leader demands gold and resources from you, every 4 turns. So you're practially going to war with everyone you meet right off the bat, unless you have the gold and resources to spare. This game is pretty much a spitting image of Civ5, with a few different aspects. The combat system is different, though I enjoyed the combat system in this game much more than in Civ5. You don't need workers to build stuff for you, your city automatically does it based on sufficient population of each city. Has a grind-ish aspect to it, has a large amount of monsters (barbarians) that attack your city and are placed around the world. Overall an OK game, ofcourse I got it for free so I'm not complaining.			"

												Absolutely brilliant fun. I got this free from Humble Bundle the other day (September 2014), and played it for the first time expecting just to have a quick look and then leave it for ages. But I'm still playing my first game, and it's still excellent.If you've ever played Civ you'll be right at home. Age of Wonders and Eador fans (among others) will also appreciate it for the fantasy armies. It's nice and easy to get into, everything is very intuitive and not over-complicated. Polished interface and detailed, crisp graphics, and a nice variety of SFX for what it is.Negatives? Well, at this early stage I might call it 'lite' strategy, although so far the AI has been robust and interesting and it's clear that this, like Civ and AoW etc, is a long-haul experience. Really, there's nothing to dislike just yet.			"

												I recommend you Warlock if you're a fan of Turn Based Strategy games. I play Civilization, Galactic Civilizations and more, while most of the time I go for passive/defensive victories and boost my civilization, Warlock is mostly about war, diplomacy is nice, improved, but still not very complicated, the city management has been improved too, but still pretty easy to figure out. Generally speaking, the game is easy to learn especially with previous experience and the HUD, the notifications, the info about units lets you figure out the game pretty soon, but it's still fun as hell and not so easy to master. Some say this is the spiritual successor of MoM or Age of Wonders, it does give this feel but it's easier and as said before more war based, you should focus on troops and spells to support them or some offensive spells. The game however has been continuosly fixed and improved to this day, even multiplayer has been added on 1.2! I had great fun in multiplayer, definitely one of the best additions for an already superb game. You may try the demo, which is the old version and then buy the game with the awesome DLCs and see a much more improved and polished Warlock, but yeah do try the demo, it's the one that convinced me. Oh yeah, about that war-based, you can still be passive/defensive with the unity spell which is a technoligcal/wonder victory, but the fighting is so fun even I got sucked in it.			"

Reminds me of Civilization 5 with the tile turn base strategy gameplay but I would rather play Civlization 5 as there is more depth to it. This game does have a unique spell system but it is not as fun to progress through like Civ’s tech tree.

It's as if the game was put together from scraps that devs salvaged from ALL of their latest games (Majesty 2 and Defenders of Ardania in particular), without being particularly discreet about it. *ahem* But I digress...Pros: 4x gameplay with entertaining combat, plenty of units and perks, muiltiple worlds to explore, good replayability and you can skip your opponents' turns (THANK GOD). Very dynamic and fun overall.Cons: TERRIBLE AI that favors swarm tactics, diplomacy is a joke, game is occasionally a little buggy, no complexity or depth.THE pros: Werewolves with tophats.Wait for sale and get this game with DLC in a single package if you want it to be worth the money spent.

												- 8.5 / 10 -This game is truly magnificent! it's a turn-based 4X strategy / RPG-ish game in the style of the Civilization series. Yet it focuses more on action / combat & RPG-like unit leveling / upgrading, less so on civil management - it's the perfect balance between city building, resource economy & combat / leveling. The spells, heroes, unique items etc are great fun, practical & make expanding / progression both rewarding & engaging. Graphics look great & gameplay is solid & intuitive. Good tunes too.You basically assume the role of a Great Mage, build / manage an army & expand your kingdom while battling other Great Mage's, doing (or failing) quests given by various Gods - which determines a reputation rating - casting spells that rain down AOE fire-balls upon your enemies from the safetly of your castle or summoning creatures to your aid - this game has it all! It's a great system all round, gameplay is fun & the mechanics instill a sense of progressive growth. It's a truly satisfying, visceral experience. So much fun!			"

												Sometimes you just want something to kill and take over cities or empires. Use gargantuan ogres and vampiric rabbits as well. The GREAT feeling when you use just one unit of knights to take down a capital. Having one unit so overpowered it seiges an entire city all by its lonesome. Cast spells that will cause the others anguish; bless your cities and units with holy spells. Also maybe a little of turn based action as well if that's what your into...then maybe you have the patience for the multiplayer because I sure don't.This game is fun for reason's I just can't even comprehend. Although it is tedious for waiting for the monster's turn and such, it is really fun just killing them for making you wait so long then capture all their land so they can't even spawn anymore. I think this game deserves some more sugar and crack money because this makes me high and can't get enough(even though I haven't touched the game in a while).			"

												Usually I try not to make arbitrary comparisons, as one-liners are often not enough to explain intricate games. In this case though, I thought it might help some niches weigh off choices. Warlock takes the best element of Civilization V, namely hexes that enhance strategic gameplay. It takes the best of Civilization IV with its deities and random events. And it takes the best of Civilization Revolution, which is the much faster pace, without toning down the experience. It leans the most on the latter and is most reminiscent of fantasy title Master of Magic, but without the lighter aftertaste. Take that as you will.			"

												For someone like me who prefers Real-time strategy games, playing Warlock - Master of the Arcane was a very pleasant experienceI had played Civilization V before and I liked it. But for some unfortunate circumstances I couldn't get it on Steam, so I settled with this one. Turns out this game wasn't that different from Civ V, all the core elements are there, with the addition of a fantasy setting, mythological units and the ability to research and cast spells.The goal of the game is simple enough, all you need to do is to defeat the other mages in the map. To do this, however, you need to manage your cities and resources, expand your empire, explore the game's world and capture important resources, research the right spells that match your strategy, and guide your troops and upgrade them. On paper it doesn't seem different from a RTS game, but the turn-based system is a bit more tricky. Unlike RTS games, it does not emphasize on micro-management, but careful planning before making any move and having a strategy.The game has some optimization issues, the story is non-existant and the game could get a bit repititive if you don't know what you're doing. But it's still worth every penny (and seeing how the game is on sale all he time, it won't cost you much anyway)I say it's a decent alternative if you can't afford Civ V, and a good start if you want to give this genre a try without spending much on the other more famous titles.

You have to click on them again to deselect, but that cancels their last orders. No messages when enemy units attack or throw spells, so sometimes, you don't know what killed your unit.

												Civ 5 with wizards.You have 3 resources, gold, food and mana. You use mana to maintain enchantments and magical units, as well as cast spells. Food goes to supporting cities and units. Gold goes to building and army upkeep, as well as buying new units.It's simpler, but still crazy addictive. There are also 'Lords', basically hero units that require a lot of upkeep but can equip artefacts and are essentially more powerful than standard units. Seriously, if you pile the enchantments on, these guys can get ridiculously OP, it's so fun.There's a religion system, where you do quests to earn favour with gods that govern particular spheres (such as death, strength or the sun). At first I thought, oh great, another list of made up deity names for me to learn, but there's not so many and they all make sense. It's especially easy to remember as they have polar opposite gods as well, e.g Dauros is the god of order and law, his rival is Fervus, god of chaos and nature.I'm not a massive strategy fan and I love this game. Fans of the 4X genre might want something more complicated, but this is a worthy buy for me.			"

												It's a remake of the classic 1994 4X game Master of Magic.  That game was a masterpiece.  With incredible combinations of units and spells to make for unique game play.  That game had tactical combat, which this game has stripped out.  Tho that is not really such a bad thing.  There are some fun races and buildings to build in this game, but ultimately, the game is over too fast and it is too easy.  Also, spell casting and research depth is lessened by the fact that you cannot choose your spell category.  It is still fun, and I still reccomend it, but it does not replace MoM which I still, in fact, play.			"

												Warlock is more combat-focused than Civ, so dimplomacy and city management aren't quite as good. The fantasy elements, such as spell casting, damage types, planar travel and the pantheon of gods makes up for this. Resource management also has deeper strategy; for example, on a silver node, you must choose if you want to build a mine to gain more gold per turn, or build a forge to outfit your legions with silvered weapons to combat ethereal foes. You can manipulate the terrain with magic! How cool is that!? Lower an area into the ocean to provide passage for your navy (although naval combat can be completely ignored on most maps), or raise up mountains to provide a natural defense. Curse your foes' farmlands into a desert wasteland, or bless your own to gain increased yields. That volcano's dangerous lava flow is in your army's marching path? Freeze a safe passage through! (Disclaimer: You often can't do all of these at once. Some spells are only offered by certain gods who happen to hate eachother, so you can't be good at everything).Each faction has a primary resource focus which changes the way you play. For example, food production can be ignored by the Undead, while it is almost exclusively focused on by the Beasts. The player also controls different units based on your faction, which are further suplemented by the gods you choose to worship. Varied buffs provided by equipment, buildings and spells, and unique items coupled with the large selection of units allows a wide variety of combat strategies available. Choose from a selection of Lord units with varied upgradeable abilities to further enhance your force.The Armageddon DLC is a fun and difficult race against the clock; the squabbles of nations are inturrupted by an invasion of hell-like creatures that permanently corrupt the land. An enemy mage defeated by the invaders becomes a shade and joins their side, making it more difficult for everyone else. I wouldn't recommend enabling this on your first game. My favorite victory conditions are Conquest (kill everyone) and the Armageddon victory if you're playing with it. The Avatar victory (kill a god)  is pretty cool, but it can be cheesed, and Unity (science victory) is the best option if you're turtling, but feels rather lackluster. I'd recommend turning off the Holy Sites condition (control 50% of all holy sites), as it just gets in the way of the others. TL;DR: There's Giant Turtles.			"

												This is one of those games that can very easily put off first time players, with no tutorial and an extremely complicated layout that doesn't look at all user-friendly. I was indeed one of those people who was put off, so left the game alone for quite some time. But i decided to give it another and while it still took a whie to get to grips with it, i finally discovered that the game is actually fairly straightforward.This game is made by the same team who brought us the the Majesty series... visually it looks quite similar, and in terms of sound is extremely similar, thanks to the same bloke doing the voice over as he did in the Majesty games (so yes, it is the same awful Sean Connery impression). Thankfully, for those people who hate the butchery of the Scottish accent, he doesn't speak nearly as often as he does in any of the Majesty games.Given how they introduced their own unique slant on the RTS genre with Majesty you'd be forgiven for thinking they would do the same for the turn-based strategy genre here, but this time they haven't and stick with the popular turn-based formula that fans of the genre will instantly recognise. This is by no means a bad thing.Once you get past how complicated the game looks and get just half an hour of it under your belt, you'll be hooked. It's well worth persevering with as this is a great game that is certainly deserving of your time. It's also frequently included in Steam sales, so is often available at a bargain price. Pick it up during a Steam sale and you won't be disappointed at all.			"

												Excellent strategy game that's all about conquest, leveling up your units to ridiculous levels of power and supporting them with all kinds of spells. Best dev support ever: since game release they've added Multiplayer, heroes, artifacts, a better UI, terraforming and in DLCs, a new race and the new Armaggeddon game mode.The demo has not been updated with those features so it won't give you a correct idea of the game.While people who don't have much of a strategy game culture will compare this to Civ V, developer Ino Co have been masters of hex-based strategy games for a long time, with Fantasy Wars (http://store.steampowered.com/app/63900/) and the Elven Legacy (not on Steam for the moment as its publishing deal ended) series. They basically took the kind of gameplay they know well how to do and added Age of Wonders-like spell research and city management. There is no tech tree, complex diplomacy, cultural trees, no real research besides random spell picks or any of those Civ trappings, it's mostly about warfare.My only complaints would be that the AI is not evenly challenging and that endgames can verge on the boring when you know you have the power to crush the enemy but sieging cities takes forever. And don't leave your cities unguarded, as some random events spawn powerful creatures behind your lines.All in all though, highly recommended. Looking forward to the sequel!			"

												Things I like:- Several options when creating custom game.- Terrain around your cities will directly affect your building outputs.- The game has humor.- City size decides how many buildings you can have total. This makes you care for your population.- All units will level up and get new features.Things I don't like:- Lack of information about game effects, when creating custom games.			"

												This game sucks.  It could be great but it fails at very basic things like being able to easily see what is going on (how long will it be until my building is finished?  What am I currently researching and how long have I got left?) and being able to do common tasks such as creating buildings and units.There is a lot of potential here and it could be more interesting than Civilization but it just fails at doing the basics.  If they get those things right then this game could be better than Civilization but as it is don't bother (and I got this game free from Humble Bundle) it's just too frustrating.I also got sick of it telling me that ""an enemy is at the gates"" but I couldn't find said enemy and nobody attacked.

												Civ meets RPG/Fantasy.Really fun 4X.Imagine you could cheat in Civ, yet it was balanced, that's Warlock. Each round, based on your mana pool, you can cast spells that influence your units or other aspects of gameplay. From increasing your food supply to levitating your infantry units so they can pass over the water.The different races have a different play style too and benefit from different priorities. If you capture cities owned by other races however, some of their unique perks can be supplied to your units. Vampires with Silver Weaponry? Why not!You can even build a multi-cultural army later on, so you're not overly hindered by your initial choices.I give it about an 8/10, just a few annoying glitches here and there (if you alt-tab out to use the internet, you get massive keyboard lag). A lot of the smaller icons Would benefit from a null space behind them as if you misclick slightly you can give out orders you did not intened to.But minor gripes. Very good game.			"

												The game is a TBS similar to Fantasy Wars and Elven Legacy.Good things: Dozens of different and varied spells Dozens of building types Dozens of unit typesBad things: No campaign or story mode. Only skirmishes. Lots of bugs Dumb AI Random mob spawning Some spells are overpoweredThe game is fun, but has too many downfalls to enjoy for long. My biggest concern is that the enemy player AI is really easy to beat. They don't have a strategy, they don't match attack types to defence types, and they randomly proclaim peace or war. Even on the hardest difficulty they're easily beaten.To compensate for the lack of difficulty, the game introduces random mob spawnings. The strength of these mobs seem to be random, so it's very possible that you get wiped out early in the game by a mob spawn. They can spawn anywhere and at any time, which makes it hard to create a strategy to defeat an opponent. Even worse are the Dremer, who also spawn with gates and contimate the lands. This gets really tedious after a while since there's nothing you can do about the spawning, and they just serve to increase the game difficulty in an obnoxious way.Another thing are the spells. You can resurrect any unit, but not always a hero. You can lower the land and put tough enemy units in the water, making them easy to defeat. You can cast mana drains on your enemies or erupt vulcanoes on their lands. This severely debilitates them, but they never apply these tactics to you. So after some time, the gameplay becomes the same. Slowly advance towards the enemy while dealing with the random spawns until you kill all. It gets tedious after a while, which is a shame as I really wanted to like this game.			"

												This game is not a Civ5 clone!!!With that out of the way, what exactly is Warlock then? The resemblances are so similar it looks like a cheap knock off, but is it? I am happy to say that the answer is no. While there are some similarites between both games, warlock focuses purely on war. You build military on a seperate queue from regular buildings, you have no workers to manage, no happiness to keep positive and by extension no luxury resources, everything you see and find is for war.You can win by owning most of the land, or researching the ultimate spell, or capturing all capital cities. Don't these victory conditions sound familiar? The only problem is, you will never have a game that lasts long enough unless you intentionally drag it out to achieve any other victory except a war/domination victory.This game begs for multiplayer, which thankfully it does have! The netcode is pretty okay too. The downside? No simultanious turns. You cannot take your turn (or seemingly do anything) while your foe takes their own turn which means that games drag on way too long! This is a game about war, I have a large military to move every single turn and so do my foes! This limits multiplayer to 1v1 because large groups are not going to finish a match in a day.Warlock is fun, the mechanics are engaging, the lore is rich and humourous in places and playing 1v1 with a friend is very stimulating. If I could rank a game as neutral then this one I would. But I can't so I can't recommend this game. One last thing, enemy AI. They are brain dead. You can win games by simply leaving the AI alone long enough to die to wild monsters. I am not even joking. They have no concept of how to play the game and certainly no idea of how to win it. If you played Civ5 and thought the AI there was bad, then that AI will seem like HAL from a space oddysey after you have seen the bone-headed bizaare AI that this game offers. The wild monsters (barbarians) are more of a threat than the actual opposing leaders.

No diplomacy beyond NAPs, no research beyond spells, powerful neutrals that come from nowhere....I don't get it.  Civ 5 was difficult and complex, with loads of options for research and empires, a fun challenge.  This is not.

												When I was buying this game, I expected Civ 5 in phantasy setting. However what I got was a strategy game for 8-year olds. The interface is clumsy, there are ocassional freezes and half the time it doesn't really matter what choices do you make. The spells are weak or pointless and limited once per turn. The city management is basically about supporting your units and building defences and new units.I was playing this game for a while, trying to understand what it's all about. The development was taking too long and it was becoming increasingly inconvenient to overview my cities. I was getting more and more bored. And when I understood that this game is only about expansion and battles, I quit.I like researching, upgrading and building unique buildings and then crushing my enemies with powerful and well organised army. This game does offer that, but in a dull and boring way. This game focuses on unit spawning and territory expansion and it's just not enough for me.My overall rating: 5/10.			"

												The concept is great and thats about it. The first dozen turns or so of each game are fairly interesting but the ridiculous reward provided by just plopping down as many cities as possible and the painstaking slowness with which any interesting spells can be cast turn the late game into hours of waiting for enough money to purchase and upgrade your powerful units while you click to build the same things in 50 different towns. the main problem with the game is definetly the ""population"" focused cities theres essentially no way to influence your population growth substantially and yet it completely defines how many buildings you can have in each city. This combined with poor balance between spell power and the time it takes to cast it (spells that give 50% boosts to existing units combat power take 1 turn and spells that summon mediocre units take 2 as an example). Overall it's not really a BAD game but you're probably better off playing Civ V while a Harry Potter movie plays in the next room over.			"

Overall description:In short: If you like other turn-based strategy games, you will like this one as well.Things it has in common with other turn-based strategy games:Randomly generated maps.Everything is on hexes.Growing cities.Settlers that build new cities.Negotiations with other Warlocks.Warships for sea battles.etc...This this game does differently, compared to other turn-based strategy games:The city upgrades are visible on the map, but can't be destroyed by enemies.You can build Forts and Magic-towers that, along with the city, can fire on nearby enemies. These two buildings can be destroyed.Each unit and hero takes up one hex on the map, you can't combine them.Each ground unit turns into its own transport ship. The ship disappears when they land.You can cast offensive, defensive, and even map-changing spells.There are alternative worlds that you can raid.Constant random map events.Not overly complicated.etc...At first, some people will feel weird with each unit taking up on hex, but you get used to it and actually learn to like it. As your troops and heroes level up, get more upgrades, and become stronger, you learn to value each unit and want to keep them alive.You research spells and harvest mana to cast them. Each spell has a mana cost, but there is also a limit on how much you can use per tern. Spells will use up a small part of what you can use per turn, a big part, all of it, or even take several turns to charge.Some of the most fun I had in this game:My enemy had a large fleet of ships that wanted to invade me. I held the beach with three melee groups, one archer group, and a healer hero that had a healing aura passive ability.I was destroying his ships before they landed and bottlenecking anything that landed. A lot of spells were used and a lot of people died... it was glorious! The guy offered resources and begged for a non aggression pact after I held the line.In another game, I kept trying to assault a guy, but I got pushed back several times because I was outnumbered. I lost a lot of heroes and a few really upgraded units. In my last push, I sacrificed two really good heroes and took two cities. Then I built forts and mage-towers between those two cities to draw the border line. I help it with Stubborn Knights, two groups of heavily upgraded Elven archers, a healer hero, a flying Elven boat, and two groups of druids. After holding the line and devastating the enemy capital with spells, all the land was cursed and filled with tentacles from all the spells. I devastated his army and blew up his capital city... I loved it.You don't really get moments like that in other games. In Total War, you have something similar during the RTS, but it's a lot more fun with spells blowing things up everywhere and randomly appearing armies.If you decide to get this game, be warned:The game is not very well optimized and there are a few bugs. The game may crash and may even freeze your computer.There are typos and it's clear that development was abandoned, but it's a fun experience. I got the game from a pack for 1$, but it may be worth buying when it is on sale.			"

												Fun fact, my review of Warlock MoA was actually one of the earlier reviews I did. Where is it, you might ask? It was lost to the void of the internet when a page got accidentally refreshed.Many months later and I’m still butthurt about losing it, I worked really hard on it because I felt the game deserved it. So here is my very very abridged version:Warlock: Master of the Arcane is a Civ knockoff. It’s not bad but it has some key flaws. The most glaring is how cumbersome the UI is. Coming from Civ is also annoying because basic shorthand like right clicking to move a unit is a completely different function. The verdict is that if you’re hard up for some Civ-like gameplay, Warlock is alright, but I personally would rather just play more Civ. The theme change doesn’t justify the feeling of having to relearn the genre.			"

												So many tiny things that are messed up that could have made this game great.1. Units have no auto explore. This has been a part of 4x games since Civ 3 I think. It is absurdly frustrating and time consuming to have to literally click on every unit every turn. 2. Clicking: WHY did you not use both the right and left mouse buttons? It's insane. The clicking over a unit to then do all actions with the same button is very frustrating and often leads to multiple clicks to get one action done. Also click zones are very tiny and leave you inching your mouse to get the right thing.3. Minimal control of your economy and tech tree. Basicly you have no input onto what is happening. Should I build more gold or more mana collectors, who knows. Oh I'm suddenly bankrupt, but wait, it has no effect because the next turn I'm fine. WIthout some kind of feedback into your economy/techtree the user is very disconnected from the guidance of their own civ.4. On that same note, you elminated so much of the users investment in their character by nutering the character design. I know this is just a reskinning of Master of Magic so I'm not expecting anything groundbreaking, but by removing the faction aliance to life/death/fire/air/etc you took away the special feeling of a character growing and learning a certain type of magic for a certain philosophy. Now all characters are bland and seem to take magic from all schools. 5. Never ending enemy spawn. Now I get that this is a core part of the game but it's also unnecessarily frustrating. As a builder I want the sence that I'm taking over this land and making it safer/better for my people. What's the point of me having magic walls around my cities if skeletons, vampires, and cheap humans just suddenly appear. On the same note they really don't do anything to you except attack your cities again and again and very rarely can they beat your cities ability to heal, essentially making them just a nusiance. 6. Oh last but not least, Users CAN'T SKIP ACTIONS! I don't care if some random village was built and I don't care if a sea monster is swimming past my capital. I should not have to bomb every enemy that walks by. I should have the choice.Overall I cannot recomend this game. The reskinning of MOM is long awaited and the graphics for the most part are great, though many buildings are difficult to distinguish adding another minor frustration. This game was almost good but overall I say skip it.			"

												I thought that I couldn't have an interest in turn-based strategy games like this. I was wrong.So, yes, this game was basically my introductory game into this particular genre. I got this for free from Humble Bundle , and then finally picked it up after a few weeks. After one playthrough of the game, I'd have to say that it was a good introduction. I can't really compare it to other similar games, so there won't be a wall of pros and cons, but this game proves to be simple and fun. It does get a little bit more boring late-game but I still found myself coming back to play at least a few more turns frequently.			"

												Warlock - Master of the Arcane is pretty much a cheaper, indie version of Civilisation V. I has the same gameplay, mechanics and similar graphics. The main differenece between Warlock - Master of the Arcane and Civilisation V is that Warlock - Master of the Arcane has a fantasy theme, whereas Civilisation V has a historical theme to it.The developers have put alot of time into Warlock - Master of the Arcane, to fine tune its mechanics and add buffs/debuffs to all the characters. I believe that Warlock - Master of the Arcane is highly underrated and is a great addition to anyones library.			"

												I bought this years ago following an RPS feature and trying the demo. It’s really good, as much fun as I rememebr the demo being: I find it hard not to have one more go. Probably because it makes it so easy to track what you need to do each turn, and the number of units hasn’t got overwhelming. My favourite game is HoMM2 – this sort of scratches a similar itch but is vastly different enough to not seem over-familiar. Also Paradox support were great (and you don’t have to create an account to contact them, unlike most companies nowadays!) I'm looking forward to trying out different options when my current game ends in inevitable victory (mwuhahaha).I’m just playing on the default settings for my first game, but have grown fond of my hero champions, slowly upgrading them as “rewards” whenever they do something successfully. Very sad when my bumbling ogre got taken down by a load of ships shooting him as he walked along the coast. I think the fact that the game doesn’t take itself too seriously is part of the charm, with units like the stubborn knights – armoured knights riding donkeys. Very Don Quixote [pun intended]. The tone is a cross between Heroes of Might & Magic, and Magicka.			"

												Great turn based strategy game.Very similar to Civilization in its core but has a lot of unique things to offer.almost feels like a rpg with the lords and spells and stuff.researching technologies is replaced by spells.and you can build stuff in cities when it grows instead of the worker business.With spells you can curse, buff, damage and move units.You can also change the terrain and cast stuff on rival mages.The game world can be pretty big with max 6 additional worlds which is awesome.You could almost go play this without rival mages and fight the neutrals and the mosters in the world.If you are concidering buying this or the second one id suggest the first one.The second one has stuff like unhappiness and allies share vision and bunch of other stuff I personally dont like. I have one complaint about the game atm and its the fact that enemies in mp can see how much mana/gold you have and what spells you have that they dont.i feel like this is way too much information id like to give.Also a minor issue is that when something that i have previously explored ( like a city) updates even when im not there to see the change.

Multiplayer is still on beta but i prefer humans than AI when i play. You must play strategic, that mean master technologies trees & use divinities bonus to win to success difficile/impossible games. I'am sure this game will be epic when it become bugless. If you can get it when promotion it worth money spent.			"

												Do you like the Civilization games? Do you like fantasy? If so then this is a great game for you its basically a simplified version of civ with a fantasy theme. The managment of cities is simplified and makes for a more straight forward type of gameplay although dont be fooled in multiplayer the games might take even longer than civ games. I personally prefer it to the civilization series because of its straight forward simplified gameplay.			"

Multiplayer is still on beta but i prefer humans than AI when i play. You must play strategic, that mean master technologies trees & use divinities bonus to win to success difficile/impossible games. I'am sure this game will be epic when it become bugless. If you can get it when promotion it worth money spent.			"

												The easiest comparison is Civilization 5 with magic. Alright, review over, that was easy!Okay, really though, it LOOKS like Civ5 at first - it's a city-building game with hex tiles and units that don't stack - but it actually works fairly differently. To explain:1: There's a whole lot less focus on cities. In particular, there's not even a research tree! Each city instead has a progression of buildings it can produce and... well, to avoid getting into details, let's just say that every city is just going to specialise in producing one resource and it's nearly always obvious what to build next. It's very simple compared to Civ5.2: On the flipside, there's a whole lot more focus on military. In particular, constructing units does NOT slow down constructing buildings, instead costing their own resource (gold) to produce. And there's always wild monsters of varying toughness to kill. The end result is that, rather than in Civilization where peace is the most beneficial option, in this game EVERYONE has an army!3: Spells. There's a LOT of spells, and they do a lot of stuff - from hurting and healing to buffing and nerfing to summoning units to changing the landscape to, hell, there's even city-wide buffs in this game. Spell research is what takes over regular research in the Civ games.This is all leaving out the other big details, like heroes and gods and the nifty way you get better units. But that could go on for a while. And it's got some problems of its own because it lacks polish, things like a point where micromanagement gets annoying, and that you can't turn off animations (although you can skip them every time), and there's no synchronous multiplayer turns which it so desperately needs. The lack of polish is why I'm really looking forward to Warlock 2.But the short of it is: I really like it! On it's own, it's really not as good as Civilization 5, it just didn't have the budget to be. But if you love playing super-aggressively in it, this is a game made all about that!Oh, as for DLC? Elves adds a new race focused on research and Armageddon introduces a rather nifty man-vs-monster mode, so they're both great. And the rest... isn't worth it. Although really, if you haven't got the game yet, you should just get the Ultimate Edition, it's definitely worth the extra cost!			"

												Yesterday I finished a match with 4 mages (1 me 3 cpu) on Large map with 3 underworld maps. It took me 12 hours, victory by conquering. Game is similiar to Civ5 - many things are similiar and some were simply copied without alterations. Although in here instead of research you have spells (that can be powerfull) and on the first plane are not towns and civilization - but heroes. They gain levels and are more powerfull and ALL buildings eiher give the ability for you to PURCHASE perks for each individual hero (not globally but micro-management) in addition to choosing traits after each level. Other buildings allow you to promote unit to more powerfull type or unlock new ones. There are 3 races: Humans, Goblins and Undead each with complete upgrade system that relies heavily on resources scattered on the map. They allow different things for different race, but play a while and you will be able to produce settlers of each nation (if you conquer their city). All majesty2 units are here :)			"

												As far as TBS games go, this one is terribly simple to the point of insulting to those with any experience in the genre, with AI oppenents that are simply laughable even on the hardest difficulty. City growth is pointlessly limited and constricting, not to mention slow, with games being as good as over before getting past your basic warriors. The magic system is an enjoyable power trip once you learn to use it ,then a terrifying fall back to reality when you realise the enemy can too, then back to power trip when you see that no, they really couldn't use magic to save their lives. I would recommend this game to someone new to the genre as a whole, as the game itself is fun with all the mechanics meshing together rather well with alot of room for error, and is a good judge of whether you may like the strategy genre, but for those looking for a deeper experience I would recommend they look elsewhere.

												Combat-oriented turn-based strategy game structured like Civ 5. There are a 3 races (plus summoned units) and hero units which have a lot of punch with their own equip and special upgrades. Instead of research you learn spells; however, there doesn't seem to be a tree for them so it can be frustrating trying to unlock a specific spell you need. Diplomacy is really shallow and the biggest disappointment in the game for me because you can't have an allied conquest victory. The non-conquest victory conditions are really hard to complete but hopefully they will allow allied victory in the future.The devs have been hard at work on patches for Warlock and seem to really care about it. Multiplayer was added the past week along with hero units and bug fixes. If you enjoy Civ-styled games but want a fantasy twist then this is worth picking up.			"

												This is one of the few games I paid full price for.  I remember when it came out, I downloaded the demo and just could NOT stop playing it.  Back then the AI was quite stupid and on the hardest settings I could skip 20 turns before starting to play, and still beat it (someone else had pointed this handicap out to me as they were using it).  That has since improved, although I haven't kept up with the game's progress recently.  Still - the various races and related build options make this a great game.  Certainly worth trying the demo for yourself to see how it suits you.Cons:  The game does devolve into a click-fest after so many turns and so many units.  That would be slightly improved if city's had rally points (they don't) and other obvious improvements the developers are undoubtedly aware of.  [I've read comments to the effect Warlock 2 suffers from the same problems.]			"

No pressure, just play.Cons:- No story line… Sorry, the “story line” is introduced in Warlock 2 (Which is basically Warlock 1 with story line and extra race) - Optimization is just awful – game seems not finished.- All the game is like some beta access game not a finished product- Music, was there any music?- Bad graphics- Gets boring really fast… because there is no reason to play it really. Except for multiplayer with is full of glitches as well.- Devs do not give a toss about this game... No support. no bugs fixesConclusion: That could have been a really nice game but it is just unfinished. It feels like only half of it was made and only half of this half was tested.My rating 4/10			"

I must be one of the few people who are experiencing this issue.Update: If you can live with not finishing the starting quest, pressing ESC or disabling tutorials will allow you to continue playing the game. I still can't recommend it until this problem is resolved, because the most efficient way to learn how to play is through the tutorial.			"

												A game full of promise and potential ruined by exceptionally brain dead AI, poor interface, the occasional bug, and features that make the game waaaaay too easy.Everyone seems to love Warlock. I'm not sure why. Once you know the ins and outs of the game, there's nothing to it and it becomes very boring and uninteresting. Occasionally the AI opponents will declare war on you for no reason. Occasionally monsters will randomly spawn in your territory for no reason. Often times there's zero threat and even on the harder difficulties, these messes can be cleaned up easily. Its less fun and more annoying than anything else.Warlock is in desperate need of more variety. For game that comes across as a fantasy version of Civilization, it instead chooses to ape Warcraft 3 making for a weird turn based version of it. Ripping off Civ would have worked more in its favor.Then there are other things in-game that need clean up. The spell book for instance is disorganized listing the spells in order you learned them vs alphabetically or by spell type. In fact, some of the spell descriptions need to be revised for the simple fact none of them tell you who or what it targets. Then there are also redundant spells that are slightly more powerful versions of what you already have. Would've been great if they kept it to a single spell but added a new power level to it in order to decrease disorganized clutter, but whatever.I bought this game on sale with all its DLC for $6 and pocket change, and I don't feel it was worth it. Not recommended at all.			"

												This RTS has some innovative medieval slash fantasy setting where you handle a city as an archmage along with your troops and familiars and conquering cities or destroying your opponent although this game is just solely focus on how to overpower your own troops and grinding them to levels....it's kinda bored me a little because of little to no diversity.Overall if you don't have Sid Meier Civ games this is the best alternate for you.

												If you're bored by the safe, advancement-by-way-of-historic-precedent style of the Civilization games, you may find something to love in this stratigic time-sink. At every turn, you are given the oppertunity to exploit the possibilities of playing in a midevil fantansy setting. Rather than research technologies, you research spells. The map is crammed with fantasy creatures that will try to kill you. You're free to play as other races, not merely humans, and the styles of the other races carry over to thier units. Everything that has annoyed me about civilization games (too little innovation in units or setting due to prior-mentioned historic limitations, a strictly watered-down pro-western view of history in general, and lack of alternative paths to established ideas) is absent from Warlock, while the interface and presentation is as intutitve and clutter-free as Civ5. In fact, one of my few problems with Warlock is how much like Civ5 it looks and feels. Warlock is not perfect. There is a ""quest"" system that constantly bugs you with optional objectives that may not be helpful to you in any way, and some of them carry a price if you ignore them. In terms of diplomacy, the other races seem quick to go to war. Despite its appearence, Warlock is a game that encourages combat, so stay away if you just want to let your borders extend on their own like in Civ.If you're looking for fantasy city building + war, this may be a good game for you.

MULTIPLAYER ONLY REVIEWReally disappointed with how big a mess attempting to player multiplayer in this is. I was looking forwards to very jolly 4X gaming, and then we have buggy help texts covering quest messages, requiring you to press Esc to close the help text that otherwise doesn't close, which also rejects the quest, as well as some bonus network desyncs. After a few hours of frustration from that and other bugs we ended up giving up. IIRC you can't even tab out of the game without issues.Also, letting people take turns at the same time or at least do *something* while the other players are doing theirs would go a long way.If you don't mind the game balance being so-so overall, it's a servicable SP game.

												So you know how there are B movies you can enjoy and B movies you hate?  Well, Warlock - Master of the Arcane reminds me of those B movies.There are a lot of problems: the AI is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ may as well assume constant war with everyone...  The borders will randomly disappear or render incorrectly...  The portals to other worlds are useless because of the previously mentioned constant war...  Made units become increasingly useless as the game progresses and heroes become unstoppable killing machines that can walk through armies...  Missions are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because you can accept or refuse them, but refusing them makes you pay the same price as failure.  There are more problems than there are good things.At the same time, it is ridiculously silly how overpowered your heroes get, so there is a bit of enjoyment in your godslayer taking on literally every unit an enemy has.I would not recommend it to anyone, but it is not unplayable or even unenjoyable.  There are ideas that seemed interesting and there are a good number of units to toy with.  It is just really badly done.This is one of those B movies that if it is on and you're bored, well, you may get a little fun out of it.  I wouldn't recommend you buy it, but if it is playing anyway and there is nothing better to do, there are worse things to waste your time away with.			"

												Overall, this game is simply unimpressive, and not worth the price. This game's DOS predecessor, Master of Magic, had more mechanics despite being programmed on a much lower budget. Throw in the reality then, that this game's graphics are not top-end, and you end up with a subpar spiritual successor.There's a lot to be said for a game that lets you customize a president-wizard with chaos and holy magic and lead a nation of vampires and undead against the elven necromancers, but once the inital glee at customization wears off, the game has shallow mechanics for combat, no population happiness/revoltrisk like in other civilization games, and a meagre selection of units. Winning is just about expanding with generic ""settler"" units, building the same buildings, and researching a limited selection of spells. Even though there are multiple ways to win the game, they all work around this same principle: there's no real way for small kingdoms to win.If you want a fantasy civilization game, I would suggest searching for Civilization IV or V mods, or going back and playing the original Master of Magic on DOSbox.

												Civilization V with far slower gameplay in general, less control on what happens and a focus more on killing everything than everything else such as population / city managment, economy managment, religion control and other general stuff in civilization V.I would say just give this game a miss, it is not as good as Civilization V and doesnt feel enjoyable at all as it is just far to slow and you have 0 control on how you expand or handle your empire.

												I will start this review with a question. Have you ever played Civilization V and do you like it? Well this is the same game practically as if it were modded to be a sword and sorcery world with magic and monsters and elves, dwarves, etc... its Sword and Sorcery meets Civilization V. you play a wizard who controls a Civilization in a fantasy setting. It's got good graphics and is almost identical to the Sid Meier game but is not based in reality or History as that game is.			"

												This one is a turn based strategy game,I really liked it, Why? Let's explain.First of all I got the idea of the game in 20 minutes ~ and then I started rocking, the tutorial explains a lot about the main things so you will get the idea of the game in no time (I've played only empire earth in strategy games category).You can control and change game settings so it will match your own taste and difficulty:You have 5 different difficulty levels which you can choose.You may choose up to 5 (I think) extra worlds.You may choose how many rivals will be.You may choose faction, your character, your starting race and starting spell.And the terrian of the world (flat or not).And some extra things:There are some states between factions:Peace, War, Alliance and anti-aggresive. These made the game really cool and not boring.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but the controls are so backwards compared to other 4X games I've played, I just can't break out of old habits.Unlike Civ, Endless Space, etc, movement is on left click, not right click, and you can't left click and drag to move the map around. This makes it harder to manage units, because I'd try to move the map and end up moving a unit I didn't want to move...If you can look past that, it seemed like it would be a fun game, but I didn't make it very far in.

												Got the game for free. While the game looks quite good and original (is every turn-based strategy with hex tiles just a clone of Civ V?) at first... somehow I'm not able to select tiles. So I can't properly move my units, I wasn't able to start building construction, after ten minutes of clicking around like hell I gave up, the game doesn't care. Not sure what went wrong, I would never say there could be such an issue in a turn-based strategy - You can't select tiles. What the hell is wrong?			"

												Crappy civ like game with bad optimization, medicore graphics, shallow as hell diplomacy, and a lot of wasted potential.edit- Figured I should add some detail since this is on the front page. So I gave this game multiple tries wanting to like it since I'm rly into 4X games, but it lacks enough to set itself apart from other games likes civ 5 or endless legend. It copies the UI from civ 5 and the combat is exactly the same. The diplomacy is extremely shallow for a 4X. After playing this game I feel more like I am playing a unfinished mod for civ 5 rather than completely different one. It's a real shame they didn't put more work into this since it could have been a great alternative to civ 5.			"

												I was hoping for a modernized version of Master of Magic, or something similar to that.  What I got was a dumbed down version of Civ V with wizards, undead and monsters that feels like it's a demo version, or a pre-alpha.  Simply put - it doesn't feel like it's done yet.  On top of that, the annoying voice - you know the one . .   the over done Sean Connery wannabe, from the Majesty games - is back, too, which is enough for me to want to turn the sound off.Despite all this the game is not too bad.  Despite my issues with it the game still manages to be fun.  It isn't half the game Master of Magic was - but it's got the potential to that and more.  I hope the devs keep working on this game.			"

												Awesome game. you have to like the genre before you even begin to like the game. It's a cross between age of wonders and civ. its a very agressive fast paced game with tons of combat, heros and leveling. the resourse section is simple to understand. you have gold, food and mana. this game is almost too easy to grasp. the AI is alright. some such as the dragon queen are so agressive you will almost always be at war. the combat doesn't seem like anything to special. but the beauty of the game is trying to keep soldiers alive and buffing them. nothing will make you happier then seeing a cruel creature ( a bunny) slaughter an entire enemys kingdom because they didn't have any magic. i have too many good things to say about this game. I bought it on sale for really cheap, but would buy it now if i didn't have it. depending on enemys difficulty, amount of other worlds, how agressive you are, type of world and amount of enemys, games can take a long time, but i have played an impossible AI on a small map and had it last only a couple hours. but if you go 6 impossible AI on a huge map with 6 other worlds, be prepared to have a long game. 8/10 game score			"

												Ever since Master Of Magic came out back durig the mid 1990's, I can't stop playig that game, even though it's over 15 years old. Over the years, many game companies have been trying to bring back or remake a lot of the original older games with modern day technology. Such games include Duke Nukem, Shadow Warrior, Wizardry 8.When I first played the game Civilization V, it was very remarkable and I had a great time playing that game. Now, they designed a game that plays just like it, only it's this game, WARLOCK. This is a fantastic remake of the classic ""Master Of Magic"". Although the original game company is no longer around, this is not to imply that this IS the remake, because it's not... not officially anyways. But this game comes so close to Master Of Magic, I just love this game.It plays just like Civilization V, only you also learn spells, summon monsters, and hire heroes to help you protect your kingdom and realms. With so much to do and so much more than Civilization V, you only thought that you played the best strategy game. Get ready to be a Wizard istead of a Mayor. Power in the palm of your hands, literally.			"

Easy to learn, comp A.I copies a lot of the♥♥♥♥♥♥head attitude of Civ A.I's.. absolutely no online community since no ones ever heard of this game or it's series. Either way: it looks good, doesn't lag when things get huge, and it has this VERY interesting mechanic of ""other worlds"": portals leading to maps within maps that I think bring a new and interesting aspect to an otherwise bland cut and paste copy of a Civs game.

												Being a huge fan of turn-based strategy hex games like Civilization, I felt compelled to buy this amazing game. To give you a bit of backstory on this, you are basically a Great Mage that came to power in a time of great turmoil who is obsessed with expanding, conquering and any other goal associated with infinite power. The game itself has an easy to understand UI, great music (although a bit repetitive due to lack of tracks to squeeze into the hours of gameplay), good graphics and character design and other mechanics that I leave out to make this review as short as humanly possible. The heroes, however, I find to be REALLY overpowered. There's even a hero that's immune to every kind of damage imaginable, and it makes finishing the game a cakewalk. Overall, this game is very good and is definitely a must buy!			"

												The closest game yet to being a proper successor to Master of Magic.  Tactical battles on an overland map, city building, a variety of units that don't simply follow a rock-paper-scissors paradigm.  Terrain and unit types allow creation of choke points and standoffs and your overland spell casting helps you to overcome them.  Smooth interface, quick gameplay, and a lack of emphasis on creating a superstack and dashing around to protect/steal everything are advantages over MoM, but MoM was superior in terms of encouraging unbalanced experimental gameplay and had those fun late-game global enchantments like Armageddon and Time Stop.  Warlock has excellent options for maps and victory conditions.  The computer map generation here is very well done, essentially equal first with what MoM achieved in the industry.  Each piece of Warlock DLC adds something useful and I don't see anything that breaks the original game balance.			"

												Very cool TBS game, in an age where TBS is a niche market.Do not be fooled, this is not a civ-like game. There is no deep political/cultural aspects, very little diplomacy, and the AI admittedly could be stronger.What there is there though, is chaos and mayhem, with very interesting combat mechanics, exploration, pve, backstabbing and leveling up of every single unit. Exactly what the doctor ordered.			"

												Ever since Master Of Magic came out back durig the mid 1990's, I can't stop playig that game, even though it's over 15 years old. Over the years, many game companies have been trying to bring back or remake a lot of the original older games with modern day technology. Such games include Duke Nukem, Shadow Warrior, Wizardry 8.When I first played the game Civilization V, it was very remarkable and I had a great time playing that game. Now, they designed a game that plays just like it, only it's this game, WARLOCK. This is a fantastic remake of the classic ""Master Of Magic"". Although the original game company is no longer around, this is not to imply that this IS the remake, because it's not... not officially anyways. But this game comes so close to Master Of Magic, I just love this game.It plays just like Civilization V, only you also learn spells, summon monsters, and hire heroes to help you protect your kingdom and realms. With so much to do and so much more than Civilization V, you only thought that you played the best strategy game. Get ready to be a Wizard istead of a Mayor. Power in the palm of your hands, literally.			"

												This is a nice turn-based strategy game that looks a lot like Civ 5 but is nowhere as deep.  There are lots of different soldier types {monsters-humans} with various strengths and weaknesses that can help you out of a tough jam.  It's a good game with tons of replay power although researching magic can sometimes become a chore because there will be only a handfull of spells you may use during a playthrough.  But if you get the Armageddon pack be ready for quite the adventure!			"

												While not as deep as the Civilization series, Warlock instead emphasizes war more than diplomancy, with a huge variety of fantastical units, powers to bombard cities and armies, tile effects and natural disasters that greatly weigh the outcomes and multiple dimensions to conquor in one map to another in a single game, it makes it more unique that it's inital appearance might convey.

												I have poured quite a few hours into this game, and I can say that I enjoyed most of it.  It is a 4x hex based game (expand, explore, exterminate, and exploit), akin to Civ 5.  My very limited exposure to Civ 5 leads me to halt any more comparisons there, however I have read there are significant differences between the two games.  I've seen it most compared with Masters of Magic.The single player can be quite fun due to the interesting characters that exist within the game.  It's also got very solid gameplay and the balance isn't too bad.  The main gripe I've seen about balance is Undead and Favor to Grum-Gog, since it allows the expansion phase to be dominated by the player who chooses it and abuse the fact that Undead don't use food to spam Strong Rats, who use only food as a resource. This can also be abused in multiplayer (which is currently deserted).  Also another gripe I have is the maps are randomly generated, which for the most part is okay, but if I were to take this game super seriously and decide to be competitive, I'd want to be able to make maps to make sure they are well balanced and strategic.The base game features 3 different races that you can start off with, and each are different enough.  As you take over other towns which belong to a different race than what you start with, you can use their technologies and units to add to your army.  There are dozens of spells that are available that you can use on average once per turn, unless you use a spell that reduces casting time.  The spells range from pure damage to buffs and debuffs to units and global as well as city buffs.  There are also spells you can only get if you worship one of the eight gods, like the Summon Strong Rats I mentioned earlier.The DLC is decent, one allows you to have hero characters which you can customize with up to three items, one introduces an entire new race, and another allows for a more difficult challenge.  I'd probably get the Armageddon DLC if anything just to make the game a bit more difficult, since the AI's in this game are pretty limited.  The extra race isn't necessary, but it's unique and the hero units are really very strong and can be buffed to ridiculous levels.Also, before now there was no hope of this game going anywhere.  But there is a new subforum on the official forums for modding.  Before now, Ino-Co or somebody didn't want this to be modded at all, and in turn it pretty much killed the forum community since the game stagnated and there was no more DLC.  Though it looks like that may be reversed soon, which would be way cool.  tl;dr version: 4x game, decent balance, random maps, lots of spells, cool characters, ok DLC, currently no modding, maybe modding later. Good game.			"

												This is a pretty fun game.While on the surface it's clearly a Civ V clone, the added flavor of the Majesty universe really helps this game stand out on it's own. The three core playable races are interesting and different enough to add some variety and the alternate planes make it possible to expand even in the endgame. That being said, there are some problems.The diplomacy is terrible. Every demand, request, etc. only ever has two option: accept or declare war. On top of that the things that effect your standing with another Wizard/Mage/whatever are shifted heavily towards the negative. Heck one of the biggest negative impacts is ""Envy of the Leader"" if you, you know, actually play to win and don't putz around.Secondly, the costs are insane. The resource and upkeep costs for units (particularly elites) are massive. While the idea make sense: they're elites, you're not supposed to have a lot of them, the execution is poorly done. This also applies to certain ""special"" units like Elves (without the Return of the Elves DLC), Dwarves, or Minotaurs that require special buildings on unique hexes to attain. While some hex resources like Gold or Jewels can help aleviate this it takes only one Temple or a unit from them to negate any bonus. It's not uncommon for you to be in the red in terms of gold or mana income for a while until you can build cities to specialize in resources. This brings us to our next problem.The expansion of your city can take forever. Since it's so similar to Civ V I'll use that as a comparison. In Civilization you're not limited by population size when it comes to building structures in your settlements and cities and territory for upgrading resources hexes. If you have the tech, space, and hammers you can build it. This is not so here in Warlock. While the resource hexes exist and are a lot more varied than in Civ the various buildings, monuments, and wonders that are built simultaneously in the cities don't exist. This means that the only bonuses you can get for the cities are upgrades for your hexes. This would be fine except that you can only build one upgrade/building per population point. The game will give you a notification that your settlement is ready for a new structure, you assign it to be completed, and you wait for your city to grow bigger so that you can repeat the process. The whole system can be annoying especially coupled with the upkeep costs  and the rush to acquire space and resources at the beginning. You end up creating specialised cities that deal in each indiviual resource which works until something happens and the flow is interrupted and you find yourself with a big red ""-30"" next to your gold counter while you're at war and trying to expand or upgrade your army.All in all this fits the Paradox formula. It's a good game with a creative idea but it's kept from being great by gameplay issues. This is great if you want to play a fantasy Turn Based Strategy but if you're looking for a more in depth game that's *slightly* more balanced you're better off with a game like Civ V.			"

												Sooo... This game is a simplistic, fantasy themed Civ V.Nah really that's it. There's not much happening here. There are three resources to manage, three different races to play, you can kind of choose different 'civ leaders' to play but you can edit them easily because they're literally a few buffs for resource gathering and a few staring spells, you have a bunch of units whose stats are pretty straight forward and you can improve them but they don't really 'advance' other than leveling up and building improvements, your civ researches are replaced with researching new spells, there are neutral 'city-states' that you can fight and take over because there's no diplomatic options with them, there are monsters you can murder, and there are multiple worlds that function somewhat similar to the one you start on but tend to have more and higher level monsters.That's everything. That's all the game's features, right there. I might have missed one or two things but there's just not much to 'get' from this game. There isn't even a campaign, it's just skirmish or multiplayer. Having played other turn based strategy games, this one seems like it would be good for someone who's never played one before. That said, it's not bad. Everything in it is functional. You do have to have graphical options above a certain point or a lot of the game's UI features don't work, at least for me, but really it's not terribly intensive even on the higher settings.If you like turn based strategy and fantasy, this is okay. It does a lot of macro-level controls very well. If you want very precise control, or even a lot of things to manage in your turn based strategy game or, I dunno, a lot of options for things you'll probably want to find something else.			"

												I absolutely recommend this game. It's a lot like Civ 5, but you can actually do things like changing the terrain, attacking with spells, buffing your dudes and so on.With the Ultimate edition, you have access to 4 races which are fundamentally different. You colonize the world civ-style, but you also have access to other dimensions that you can take over via portals. You can also raise or lower the land level, change the land type, and so on.The combat aspect is WAY better than in Civ 5, with buffs, debuffs, 5 attack types, 4 unit types (flying, aquatic, amphibious and land) and such. There is only one majow flaw: There's no hybrid turns in multiplayer. Thus, playing with a lot of people online is not recommended. However, with a small amount of friends and/or AI the game is still a lot of fun.			"

Posted: February 21, 2014
												absolutely amazing. But, let's go into detail as to why.Setting: A high-fantasy setting with dragons and mages and gods and stuff. (If you couldn't figure that out by the title, I feel sorry for you.)Who you play as: A master ritualist, who is able to cast spells clear across the world. You control mass armies with absolutely no minds of their own. (as standard for 4X games)Now to the jucy stuff.How optimized is it? To give you a good idea: I bought a 300 dollar laptop to be nothing but a virus-free stock trading machine, with almost no GPU or CPU power. Runs it just fine. A tad slow, but still runs fine. There is a point here, though, that I MUST  point out. You can NOT turn off animation, by what I can tell. And just about everything has god damned animations. Don't get me wrong they look really nice, and they are well-optimized...but if you could disable the animation, you could probably use a $100 laptop from 8-9 years ago to run this game. Animations, especially for a lot of simultaneous units costs quite a large deal of power.Research is not for typical technology. In fact, technology is not dependent upon research at all. Instead, it's determined by your buildings, which is somewhat odd...yet neat at the same time. Now, what your research IS for: new spells and rituals which you can then cast to either plague your enemy or grant boons to your allies.How is research done? Well, kinda standard: you select what you want to research, then wait for a set amount of time based on points required / points generated per turn. But, unlike most games which have specific tech trees, the spells you get the chance to research are relatively randomly picked, and you get a selection of 5. I think there are some basic requirements before it is in the pool of potential spells, as I never had a top-tier spell show up early on, but I did get like a lesser and a greater version of the same spell in the spell research at the same time.How's the unit selection? Well, it's damn good. Took me a good several games to play most of them, and even now, after 47.3 hours, I've yet to use some, or have them used on me (most notably the incredibly expensive dragon...which takes so long to build, and save up for, it's pretty much not worth it). There are some slightly unbalanced units, at least for their cost, but it's nothing gamebreaking, and even old trolls can be killed quite handily.There are also champions, or basically super minions that must be bought when they randomly appear. This comes from one of the DLC, and REALLY seems like an after-thought more than anything. Some are just not good for their cost, others are quite insane, and snowball so extremely that they single-handedly decimate armies and take entire towns in one shot. Now, several heroes can EVENTUALLY do that, but of course, some are just overpowered, and ramp up far too quickly.Not to mention the only way to attract them is to wait for the RNG to give you the chance to buy them. There is NO way to influence this by my experience. This is a particularly dissapointing part of the game, but, I think the other, more polished features make up for this.Graphics: I really can not comment too greatly on this, as I am no graphic critic, but they looked pretty nice. I also liked the graphic style, but that is nothing mut personal preference.AI: Can be quite punishing. I, however, was never really at any risk of losing...aside from at the very beginning...from an AI. But, they do have no problems with taking your undefended, and lightly-defended cities. The diplomacy system, however, is kinda weak, and kinda lacks a bit of the personality you would like, but it's...robust. It works. You, however, can force someone to bribe you for peace, then just continue to conquer them. I am actually ok with that, but the AI never learns that you do this, so they will keep giving you money to continue your conquest.Maps: there are several parts that make a good map, in my opinion, so I will split this up.Variety: Each map is randomly generated. So yes, it's got a good deal of variety (Screw spelling). There are also a nice, large number of different types fo tiles, and their art work is not wholely independent of eachother. If a plains is by a lava field, the lava art will leak over into the near-by tiles without changing the tile itself. Just look at the screenshots for exampls of this.Shape of tiles: Hexagonal tiles are always the best. It will always take the same number of movements to move from one tile to another, so long as you go directly there, regardless of moving diagonally or up then right or left. How easily can you tell the terrain types apart? Incredibly easily. A swamp looks nothing like a volcano or ocean, a plains looks nothing like frozen terrain. You can easily tell when tiles are seperated by rivers.(OK, my mind blanked right here. I'm going to bed, I might amend the review later when I wake up.)			"

												Great spiritual successor to Master of Magic. The concept is very reminiscent to Civilization although it adds a lot of unique features of its own which creates a really great 4X turn based strategy game set in a fantasy setting. You control an empire as a wizard, where you conduct research and cast spells, wage war, do diplomacy and develop your infrastructure. You can choose between 3 races that are distinct in their own way and require different playstyles. The maps are varied and filled with loot, monsters and tricky terrain. The AI is also really capable and it can be quite challenging.The graphics are marvelous for such a game and so is the soundtrack. I definitely recommend this game for anyone who is looking for an experience like Master of Magic or who want to play a game similiar to Civilization but with a fantasy twist.The only downside that I can think of right now is that there aren't that many factions to choose from and that the map generator can sometimes create really silly maps.

Easy to learn, comp A.I copies a lot of the♥♥♥♥♥♥head attitude of Civ A.I's.. absolutely no online community since no ones ever heard of this game or it's series. Either way: it looks good, doesn't lag when things get huge, and it has this VERY interesting mechanic of ""other worlds"": portals leading to maps within maps that I think bring a new and interesting aspect to an otherwise bland cut and paste copy of a Civs game.

												Over all feal is Civ type game, but with a twist. The game is allright but I would prob wait if its on sale as there are a few bugs still with the game such as: random graphicl errors, game crashes to windows, wont save. Aside from that its an ok game and just like any civ game it takes forever to beat one game. Few minor points ive seen is (wether this was to up the AI difficulty or not but they seem to cast fire storm ever turn without waiting or casting the spell.  Also the demand with other mages...you have 2 options war or just give them what they want....why is there not a NOPE button? In short I see this haveing replay and fun for other so I will still recommend to try it but not a full price do to the random bugs.			"

												Game has promise, but too many 'inconveniencing features' to overlook. The key to deselect units is 'backspace', which is a really stupid key to bind to it, considering how many times you need to hit it per turn. Oh, and also, it doesn't give you the option to remap keys! Oh, well, time to uninstall this and keep playing Civilizations.			"

Now, I've been trying to get into Civ 5 forever, but I never manage to get into it. Warlock, on the other hand, takes the game back to the basics and is engaging from beginning to end. While it may be lacking the level of depth some look for, I had a hard time putting this game down. I recommend it.			"

												I have poured quite a few hours into this game, and I can say that I enjoyed most of it.  It is a 4x hex based game (expand, explore, exterminate, and exploit), akin to Civ 5.  My very limited exposure to Civ 5 leads me to halt any more comparisons there, however I have read there are significant differences between the two games.  I've seen it most compared with Masters of Magic.The single player can be quite fun due to the interesting characters that exist within the game.  It's also got very solid gameplay and the balance isn't too bad.  The main gripe I've seen about balance is Undead and Favor to Grum-Gog, since it allows the expansion phase to be dominated by the player who chooses it and abuse the fact that Undead don't use food to spam Strong Rats, who use only food as a resource. This can also be abused in multiplayer (which is currently deserted).  Also another gripe I have is the maps are randomly generated, which for the most part is okay, but if I were to take this game super seriously and decide to be competitive, I'd want to be able to make maps to make sure they are well balanced and strategic.The base game features 3 different races that you can start off with, and each are different enough.  As you take over other towns which belong to a different race than what you start with, you can use their technologies and units to add to your army.  There are dozens of spells that are available that you can use on average once per turn, unless you use a spell that reduces casting time.  The spells range from pure damage to buffs and debuffs to units and global as well as city buffs.  There are also spells you can only get if you worship one of the eight gods, like the Summon Strong Rats I mentioned earlier.The DLC is decent, one allows you to have hero characters which you can customize with up to three items, one introduces an entire new race, and another allows for a more difficult challenge.  I'd probably get the Armageddon DLC if anything just to make the game a bit more difficult, since the AI's in this game are pretty limited.  The extra race isn't necessary, but it's unique and the hero units are really very strong and can be buffed to ridiculous levels.Also, before now there was no hope of this game going anywhere.  But there is a new subforum on the official forums for modding.  Before now, Ino-Co or somebody didn't want this to be modded at all, and in turn it pretty much killed the forum community since the game stagnated and there was no more DLC.  Though it looks like that may be reversed soon, which would be way cool.  tl;dr version: 4x game, decent balance, random maps, lots of spells, cool characters, ok DLC, currently no modding, maybe modding later. Good game.			"

												First of all - This game is not in any way a Civilization V clone/knock-off. This game only uses the same core elements, but all the rest is completely different.If you're into turn-based strategy games, you're definitely going to like this game. It's brilliant in every way. Though the diplomatics aren't really in-depth, the game is extremely polished. Warlock: Masters of the Arcane also has brilliant lore. Every single unit has a unique description that's written in an informative way to tell you the backstory of W:MotA.Mind you, if you want to buy this game to mainly play multiplayer, you're going to be in for a bad time. Unless you have a friend, there will most of the time be noone in the lobby.And like in every game, there are some bugs/glitches here and there, but there are only a few, and they are usually fixed with a quick restart.

												likable game albeit limited in expanse - you will figure it out almost instantly, now that can be a benefit or hinderance depending on your vibe.  i liked it from the get go but admit it doesnt draw in the hours like Civ.  sometimes you only have an hour before you go out for the night, and deep RTS games or loading a 1000 turn 4x game is too much therefore the simplicity is great.   i wrote this review after scanning my steam library and if you are a gaming veteran (ouch to admit first game install 1986, so if you have any DOS questions on how to load your mouse into HighMem email me) then its nice to have this type of pace game in your library.  i will update this review with more structure, but worthy of purchase imho.

How tiles work are that the tiles within your control are able to be built on. When you build a city, you don't build the buildings ""inside"" the city, you build them on an available hex grid under your control. Very, very cool. Monsters get a turn! They even have Majesty style quests. BUY THIS!			"

												Warlock - Master of the Arcane is basically an arcade version of Civ 5 and could easily be mistaken for a Civ 5 mod. The UI is nearly a pixel-by-pixel clone of Civ 5, but the streamlined combat-oriented nature of the game speeds up the pace a bit.Wandering creatures, aka barbarians, also play a more prominent role compared to the Civ games where they cease to be a threat. Similar to HOMM, defeating monsters on the world map is key to growing your territory and consolidating your power before taking on the other great mages. Diplomacy consists of ""give us stuff, or die"". Unfortunately, the AI is dumb as bricks which takes away most of the challenge and pretty much kills the replayability. I usually play at Prince or lower in Civ, but I was able to beat the AI opponents in Warlock quite easily on hard; I would not recommend this game to strategy buffs. So in terms of value, it's not all that great, but it's fun for a more beat-em-up style diversion once or for people who think the Civ games are too hard or complex.			"

												For those folks who really like a good turn based strat fantasy based game then this one is worth a look at for sure. Having played HOMM3 for so many years I am not willing to admit publically how much I still play it. This game is a cross between that game and Civ. With kingdom managment and building planning being key parts to your chance at success and always keep a few units near the back of your lines cause them random encounters can make a good kingdom collapse right quick if your troops are too far back from where the problem is. Huge world that is random each time with so many sub worlds that realistically you might never end your game, lol ;) Good luck.			"

												This is a fun game to start with, but against the standard difficulty AI the primary opponents are the randomly spawning monsters.I had one game where I spent the first half completely seperate from the three AI Warlocks that were somewhere on the same map.I finally built up a kill-team capable of fighting through the monsters to try to find them, and it turns out that the area their captial cities were in was surrounded by Fire elementals and Ogre Dens.And, of course, I discovered a portal directly between me and all of them, and said portal quickly began to spit out dragons.I decided I'd just outline my territory with mountains, towers, and archers while I went for the research victory.

												Its an average game, basically just civilisation with a fantasy setting, less trade options, less customizabillity, less units to choose from, citys slowly level up over time, no way to boost them really quickly, comat is the same. They replaced the reasearch tree with a magic generator where is basically randomly produces 4 spells you can reasearch and then you can cast spells for reasearch points. Babarian units randomly spawn. Enemies do lame diplomacy for which there are barely any options and no counter offers avialable. Basically this game is a cheap knock off of an already great game. I can't in good mind recommend this to anyone when CIV series already exists and is a lot more fun to this game. Civ games also dont take as long as this one. Overall this game is average even if i wasnt to compare it to civ. Its got average animations, not very exciting characters or heros, lack of customizabillity and options in every aspect of the gameplay. Overall it just left me wishing it had tried harder to make it more involving. 4/10			"

												I enjoyed this game, similar to Master of Magic from days gone past. It sort of fails in the same area too though, namely there comes a point where you are so powerful you are going to win the game but it will take another 10 hours to do it. gamers like me are suckers for it too.			"

												Its pretty good, considering i havent really liked strategy games before, this was suprisingly easy to pick up and i got alot of enjoyment out of this. If you are looking for a good time with a simple strategy game - this is it. The only complaint however, is that the matches end too soon - you cant conquer the entire landmass in a map. Otherwise, this is a solid game. Even better than its sequel.			"

												This game is really enjoyable, as a fan of the hotm and total war series I have to say this is as close as I have seen to combining them. I bought Endless Legend first and I have to say this game makes that one look so incredibly dull in comparison. The only problem I have with warlock is the difficulty, even on the highest level, impossible, it is actually pretty easy. The ai does not know how to counter spells that affect pathing, so as cool as raising a mountain range to block enemies or beaching enemy ships is the ai does not have an effective way to counter the tactic. The raise/lower land spells come early too so there is really no way to lose if you know how to use them effectively. 90% of this game is fun but the 10% that includes chasing weak enemies that flank you to attack cities or getting to a point where winning is inevitible and spending 5 hours cleaing up is not fun.Conclusion: Buy this game if it is 15 dollars or less, you will enjoy it enough to make the purchase worth it at this cost or lower.

												I got this copy for free. But I still have some time experiencing it.Comparing with Civilization, this game has some concepts I love. Monsters generated in the camp can even strong enough take down the cities that players have. Players can have real heroes used in battle. Warlock have some fascinating magic tricks can used to win an battle.However, it also have its limitation. Buildings in a particular kind of city is limited(like human city cannot build a grave to generate skull archers, but undead can), kinds of resources is not designed as good as Civilization did. High level hero unit is to strong even battle against 6 normal unit surrounding him. In a word, it is not as balanced as Civilization I think.			"

												Great fun.  Takes the old citidael based game format and adds enough extra tweaks to make it fun and challenging.  Turn based and easily saveable, which is great if like me you occasionally want a game you can play while doing something else.For old Majesty fans there is extra nostalgia value because it's set in the same universe so you recognise the races and the gods straight away.  They even have the same old Sean Connery imitator doing the voice over.Nice relaxing game on the easiest setting if you just want something to veg to after a hard shift.			"

												I got this game at a major discount, I is worth a play through a couple of times. Unfortunately it lacks depth. The game is easy to learn to play. There are multiple planes, unfortunately they are simply useless and by the time you get the power to conquer those planes you will have already conquered or killed every other rival in the main plane. It would be nice if size of the other planes were as configurable and as large as the main plane. Drop the difficulty level of the other planes allow them to be starting planes for players and the game would have more depth and greater replayabilty. I recommend this game for 2-3 plays which would take about 10-12 hours. Figure that out in terms of if this is a good cost/playtime ratio for you.			"

Dialog is funny at times, graphics are pretty good, and the gameplay feels balanced enough to provide a modest challenge for new players.  Diplomacy is non existant and eventually this just plays like a military steamroller, which is fine if your into that sort of thing.  Just don't expect a lot of depth or challenge.

												Warlock - Master of the Arcane is basically an arcade version of Civ 5 and could easily be mistaken for a Civ 5 mod. The UI is nearly a pixel-by-pixel clone of Civ 5, but the streamlined combat-oriented nature of the game speeds up the pace a bit.Wandering creatures, aka barbarians, also play a more prominent role compared to the Civ games where they cease to be a threat. Similar to HOMM, defeating monsters on the world map is key to growing your territory and consolidating your power before taking on the other great mages. Diplomacy consists of ""give us stuff, or die"". Unfortunately, the AI is dumb as bricks which takes away most of the challenge and pretty much kills the replayability. I usually play at Prince or lower in Civ, but I was able to beat the AI opponents in Warlock quite easily on hard; I would not recommend this game to strategy buffs. So in terms of value, it's not all that great, but it's fun for a more beat-em-up style diversion once or for people who think the Civ games are too hard or complex.			"

												Type: StrategySimilar to: Civilization This game can't avoid comparisons to Civ, so let's look at the differences. Warlock: * Is more focused on magical/fantasy units* Has hireable champions, after a fashion (Lords) * Has more varied NPC enemies and cities* Has enemy player AI that will actually ally up with you (revolutionary, compared to Civ V's broken diplomacy) * Has quests that feel impactful, opposed to Civ's city-state questing * Has no focus on city production; buildings and units happen in an orderly queue that's only ever several turns deepDownsides to Warlock: * Unit selection feels a little sticky, de-selecting isn't all that fluid (Civ also has this problem)* The game's a bit of a resource pig (try typing in another window while it's up) * There is nearly nothing by way of a tutorial, so get ready for reading up on forums to learn about Religions and the likeThis game is worth a play through and is probably a good pickup for strategy fans if it's in the sub-$15 range. Replay value is moderately high.			"

												It's a good turn based strategy game. Heavily influenced by Civs 4/5. You play as a leader among several others in a world with monsters and other evil factions building cities, conquering, and spawning portals in your territory. It is not a complicated game, do not expect anything involving political intrigue and other forms of diplomacy. You build, you train, you upgrade, you expand.Mana is a resource in the game that allows you to cast spells of a great many kind, more than one would need from what I can tell in single player. A personal favorite involves reworking the plates below to spawn an active volcano at the doorstep of my enemy's capital.This is a fine-working game that doesn't break any boundries but has some hours of fun in it.I wouldn't buy it for 25 bucks, but on a great sale or bundle it is worth the time.

												It's okay. Far from being on par with Civilisation V but a good option. Don't expect to be able to be a pacifist wizard in this game. There is barely any trade between you and the computer players, and when there is it's mostly them asking you to give them stuff and your only possible responses being ""Yes"" or to be at ""War!"" It's mostly a battle strategy game.What makes it very different than Civ is the ability to use spells. You can modify the terrain around you to help you get the upper hand, heal your weakened units in battle or directly attack enemy units. It's a pretty good game that could easily rival with Civ if it was less focused on combat.			"

												This game is pretty nice. Not too bad, for what I played. It's very reminiscient of the old game I had the pleasure of playing called 'Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim'. Though don't confuse the two. The playstyles of each are entirely different. The only thing in common is the game takes place possibly during the events of Majesty II, its sequel, as a war of sorts. Your goal? To conquer the lands as your chosen lord, leading your armies to conquest.You can play a variety of races, from the usual humans to bestial creatures to undead, while being able to use each one's skill to however your preferences are. After gaining enough experience with a unit, the option will be given to promote their abilities at random. This, along with the random spells you get help to make the game interesting. It never becomes too doldrum to enjoy, but it can become complicated with so much happening on-screen at once, and it'd leave the players somewhat confused. Though if you can overcome this, this is truly a unique and challenging game that I'd definitely recommend to any of my friends and any who see this comment.			"

												Those who remember Majesty and the remake Majesty2 will remember the dulcet Scottish ""Connery-esque"" tones of the advisor. This game takes the same mellieu and puts it into a full 4X game.Like all good 4X games, it can be rated on how much ""just one more turn""... happens; and it does for this game. It's not Civ, but then what is?So I will only discuss the flaws. Somewhat sloppy interface; occassional lack of proper focus during NPC turns; ""help"" that gets you started but no further; the manual is not much better (it doesn't even have a tech-tree); graphics that slow and ""judders"" after a time. In short a number of niggling little flaws which detract from this being a truly excellent game. Even with these issues fixed it still wouldn't be Civ, but has many of the elements of it and is otherwise now a very solid game. Metascore underrates the current incarnation of this game somewhat.

												This game gets a 10/10 from me. It's basically Civilization V... but with MAGIC... dragons, gods, mythology, wizards, and monsters. Need I say more? Well here's more:-The graphics... holy cow the fidelity! So vivid, lush and vibrant! Some of the most beautiful environments I have ever seen. Care was even placed into animating city borders. Everything comes together to seriously make you feels that the world you're playing in is filled with magic.-The combat in this game completely blows the Civ5 combat system out of the water. Your units can continue leveling indefinitely and gain permanent buffs from the spells you cast upon them. As a result you end up caring about your units and start to grow with them through the ages. They each become quite formidable in their own right. That archer you started out with on turn 1? Well guess what, he's fighting an immortal god now on turn 80 because you kept investing in him. -There are randomly generating events happening all over the world that affects all players, which is absolutely awesome. You're fighting not just on land and sea but in other dimensions and planetary planes. There is also huge replay ability through the randomly generated maps, and the versatility in which you can play your wizard. Do you want to create the most powerful cities the world has ever seen? Or do you want your units to take on gods? Or would you rather amass the greatest army or navy? Or just burn everyone with your magic!-The units you can build are based upon your environment... that's right... you can potentially get different types of armies every game! You are no longer tied down to your race or class but can scour the world seeking elves, werewolf, or dragon turtles.-The interface looks absolutely breath taking. Someone put a lot of love and care into designing an extremely immersive interface.Cons:-Unit controls and deselection sometimes executes commands you did not intend.-There is no visible tech tree for spells, which I'd imagine is quite extensive, you end up praying for the spell you want.

												Actually a suprisingly fun strategy game.  It is pretty much a civilization clone but with one massive twist.  It is set in a fantsy magic based world.  It is worth the money to any fans of the Civ games or any fan of strategy games.  Also it can tide you over until Beyond Earth comes out			"

												Warlock: Master of the Arcane Reviewby DaniAngione----------------------------Art - 8 / 10Sound - 8 / 10Gameplay - 8 / 10Emotional - 7 / 10Community - 7 / 10----------------------------Overall - 7.6----------------------------** Check my profile to understand my scoring system**If you like the Civilization series and the Heroes of Might and Magic series AND competitive multiplayer, this might be the perfect game for you. This title could easily be given to Fallen Enchantress IF it had multiplayer. Since it has not, Warlock is (so far) the best Civ-slash-Heroes mash-up you can get. (Rumour is that Fallen Enchantress will be getting multiplayer soon(tm))The game plays pretty much like Civilization. In fact it's so identical to Civilization V that I suspect the engine might even be the same (although I couldn't find that info anywhere) so if you're a Civilization V player and likes fantasy, that's probably a must-have. However it's a really limited game. There aren't as many units and nations like you have in Civilization, so variety isn't a plus here. But when it comes to gameplay, Warlock offers several features that are really neat and interesting. Levelling units feel a lot more rewarding than doing so on Civ, since you have many more perks to give them. And the advantages/disadvantages between units are much more clear and functional. City building is fantastic - you really snap buildings into map tiles (hexagons) and there are buildings that have map funcionalities. So if you have a city that's near a mountain pass, you can place a castle on the pass and force invaders to defeat the castle before getting to the city tile. Admitting heroes into your nation feels like the old Master of Orion games and plays like a simplified version of heroes - but it's really enjoyable to see your heroes leading your armies into conquering towns, levelling them and grabbing some shiny gear.Some gameplay features like different planes and the apocalypse game mode (which spawns hell gates, something pretty much like what happens in TES: Oblivion) give it a charm.It's not the best strategy game out there - but certainly can be the best choice if you're looking for some grand-strategy with a fantasy setting.

												absolutely amazing. But, let's go into detail as to why.Setting: A high-fantasy setting with dragons and mages and gods and stuff. (If you couldn't figure that out by the title, I feel sorry for you.)Who you play as: A master ritualist, who is able to cast spells clear across the world. You control mass armies with absolutely no minds of their own. (as standard for 4X games)Now to the jucy stuff.How optimized is it? To give you a good idea: I bought a 300 dollar laptop to be nothing but a virus-free stock trading machine, with almost no GPU or CPU power. Runs it just fine. A tad slow, but still runs fine. There is a point here, though, that I MUST  point out. You can NOT turn off animation, by what I can tell. And just about everything has god damned animations. Don't get me wrong they look really nice, and they are well-optimized...but if you could disable the animation, you could probably use a $100 laptop from 8-9 years ago to run this game. Animations, especially for a lot of simultaneous units costs quite a large deal of power.Research is not for typical technology. In fact, technology is not dependent upon research at all. Instead, it's determined by your buildings, which is somewhat odd...yet neat at the same time. Now, what your research IS for: new spells and rituals which you can then cast to either plague your enemy or grant boons to your allies.How is research done? Well, kinda standard: you select what you want to research, then wait for a set amount of time based on points required / points generated per turn. But, unlike most games which have specific tech trees, the spells you get the chance to research are relatively randomly picked, and you get a selection of 5. I think there are some basic requirements before it is in the pool of potential spells, as I never had a top-tier spell show up early on, but I did get like a lesser and a greater version of the same spell in the spell research at the same time.How's the unit selection? Well, it's damn good. Took me a good several games to play most of them, and even now, after 47.3 hours, I've yet to use some, or have them used on me (most notably the incredibly expensive dragon...which takes so long to build, and save up for, it's pretty much not worth it). There are some slightly unbalanced units, at least for their cost, but it's nothing gamebreaking, and even old trolls can be killed quite handily.There are also champions, or basically super minions that must be bought when they randomly appear. This comes from one of the DLC, and REALLY seems like an after-thought more than anything. Some are just not good for their cost, others are quite insane, and snowball so extremely that they single-handedly decimate armies and take entire towns in one shot. Now, several heroes can EVENTUALLY do that, but of course, some are just overpowered, and ramp up far too quickly.Not to mention the only way to attract them is to wait for the RNG to give you the chance to buy them. There is NO way to influence this by my experience. This is a particularly dissapointing part of the game, but, I think the other, more polished features make up for this.Graphics: I really can not comment too greatly on this, as I am no graphic critic, but they looked pretty nice. I also liked the graphic style, but that is nothing mut personal preference.AI: Can be quite punishing. I, however, was never really at any risk of losing...aside from at the very beginning...from an AI. But, they do have no problems with taking your undefended, and lightly-defended cities. The diplomacy system, however, is kinda weak, and kinda lacks a bit of the personality you would like, but it's...robust. It works. You, however, can force someone to bribe you for peace, then just continue to conquer them. I am actually ok with that, but the AI never learns that you do this, so they will keep giving you money to continue your conquest.Maps: there are several parts that make a good map, in my opinion, so I will split this up.Variety: Each map is randomly generated. So yes, it's got a good deal of variety (Screw spelling). There are also a nice, large number of different types fo tiles, and their art work is not wholely independent of eachother. If a plains is by a lava field, the lava art will leak over into the near-by tiles without changing the tile itself. Just look at the screenshots for exampls of this.Shape of tiles: Hexagonal tiles are always the best. It will always take the same number of movements to move from one tile to another, so long as you go directly there, regardless of moving diagonally or up then right or left. How easily can you tell the terrain types apart? Incredibly easily. A swamp looks nothing like a volcano or ocean, a plains looks nothing like frozen terrain. You can easily tell when tiles are seperated by rivers.(OK, my mind blanked right here. I'm going to bed, I might amend the review later when I wake up.)			"

												This is a pretty fun game.While on the surface it's clearly a Civ V clone, the added flavor of the Majesty universe really helps this game stand out on it's own. The three core playable races are interesting and different enough to add some variety and the alternate planes make it possible to expand even in the endgame. That being said, there are some problems.The diplomacy is terrible. Every demand, request, etc. only ever has two option: accept or declare war. On top of that the things that effect your standing with another Wizard/Mage/whatever are shifted heavily towards the negative. Heck one of the biggest negative impacts is ""Envy of the Leader"" if you, you know, actually play to win and don't putz around.Secondly, the costs are insane. The resource and upkeep costs for units (particularly elites) are massive. While the idea make sense: they're elites, you're not supposed to have a lot of them, the execution is poorly done. This also applies to certain ""special"" units like Elves (without the Return of the Elves DLC), Dwarves, or Minotaurs that require special buildings on unique hexes to attain. While some hex resources like Gold or Jewels can help aleviate this it takes only one Temple or a unit from them to negate any bonus. It's not uncommon for you to be in the red in terms of gold or mana income for a while until you can build cities to specialize in resources. This brings us to our next problem.The expansion of your city can take forever. Since it's so similar to Civ V I'll use that as a comparison. In Civilization you're not limited by population size when it comes to building structures in your settlements and cities and territory for upgrading resources hexes. If you have the tech, space, and hammers you can build it. This is not so here in Warlock. While the resource hexes exist and are a lot more varied than in Civ the various buildings, monuments, and wonders that are built simultaneously in the cities don't exist. This means that the only bonuses you can get for the cities are upgrades for your hexes. This would be fine except that you can only build one upgrade/building per population point. The game will give you a notification that your settlement is ready for a new structure, you assign it to be completed, and you wait for your city to grow bigger so that you can repeat the process. The whole system can be annoying especially coupled with the upkeep costs  and the rush to acquire space and resources at the beginning. You end up creating specialised cities that deal in each indiviual resource which works until something happens and the flow is interrupted and you find yourself with a big red ""-30"" next to your gold counter while you're at war and trying to expand or upgrade your army.All in all this fits the Paradox formula. It's a good game with a creative idea but it's kept from being great by gameplay issues. This is great if you want to play a fantasy Turn Based Strategy but if you're looking for a more in depth game that's *slightly* more balanced you're better off with a game like Civ V.			"

												This is an ambitious game that's pretty well-made, but ultimately is just very...middling. It's a very combat-focused 4X game, but since everything is for the ultimate goal of combat, it ends up feeling very narrow. The world has lots of NPC monsters that create a cool world, but they quickly become just background annoyances that you have to spend resources to control.To be fair, I only got about two hours into a game after playing the demo several times, so maybe it gets way more interesting later on (for instance, I barely got to explore through any of the portals), but I just got bored and didn't want to see any more. If the demo REALLY grabs you, you may also like the main game, but otherwise, I'd go elsewhere for your 4X strategy fix.			"

It has the fantasy elemts of M+M but the map layout of civ 5.Controls are simple and quick to grasp although the tutorial elements are very basic. It is not complicated though and easy to work out. This game is pretty heavily focused on combat with lots of spawns of aggressive monsters and somewhat fickle AI cities.Probably would not pay for this as the games it issimilar too are better value but as it was free can't complain too much!

												Sooo... This game is a simplistic, fantasy themed Civ V.Nah really that's it. There's not much happening here. There are three resources to manage, three different races to play, you can kind of choose different 'civ leaders' to play but you can edit them easily because they're literally a few buffs for resource gathering and a few staring spells, you have a bunch of units whose stats are pretty straight forward and you can improve them but they don't really 'advance' other than leveling up and building improvements, your civ researches are replaced with researching new spells, there are neutral 'city-states' that you can fight and take over because there's no diplomatic options with them, there are monsters you can murder, and there are multiple worlds that function somewhat similar to the one you start on but tend to have more and higher level monsters.That's everything. That's all the game's features, right there. I might have missed one or two things but there's just not much to 'get' from this game. There isn't even a campaign, it's just skirmish or multiplayer. Having played other turn based strategy games, this one seems like it would be good for someone who's never played one before. That said, it's not bad. Everything in it is functional. You do have to have graphical options above a certain point or a lot of the game's UI features don't work, at least for me, but really it's not terribly intensive even on the higher settings.If you like turn based strategy and fantasy, this is okay. It does a lot of macro-level controls very well. If you want very precise control, or even a lot of things to manage in your turn based strategy game or, I dunno, a lot of options for things you'll probably want to find something else.			"

												This game is great. It seems like this game is more ""accessible"" than Civilization. A hexagonal, turn-based Strategy game where you build towns and conquer them, as well as expand them or raise an army.Set in a fantasy world where you, a mage, can cast spells, command troops, and build, as well as, expand your citires. The spells you can cast can be to rain fire upon foes, heal a unit, aid your city, or change the landscape. Troops you command range from hand-to-hand troops, ships, archers, wolves, etc.The reasorces you need are Coin/money, food, mana, and knowledge. Also, to build a structure, a city must have the needed population for it. You can build unites even though some cities may not have enough food, but still important to have food, as well as coin, to upkeep a unit. IMana is needed to upkeep some buildings, and to cast spells. There is a list of spells that can be researched and a list of buildings that can be built. You can use several mages, some are human, some are monsters/beast, and finally demons. It is mostly for the type of spells or bonuses you get for using a specific mage. One mage, for instance, aids more with healing units.You can conquer ciities from other mages, or other cities scattered about. There are random enemies that hold no alliegience to any mage and they are a cool, and sometimes annoying, groupd of enemies.You can make peace or forge an alliance, and brake the allience or end peace time. There are main worlds within a game single playthrough, and there are side worlds which you can conquer or avoid.I highly recommend this to the people looking for a Civilization-style game, and to those looking to try something new. Play the Demo and see for yourself.			"

Nonetheless, I gave another copy to a friend, and that was that. He played it then seriously reccomend I actually try it, and it was amazing. It was simple, so as not to be too confusing, but it's not so simple that it becomes boring.

												I had high hopes for this game. I thought it might be somewhat similar to XCOM, which was my first foray into turn-based strategy games. No such luck. Warlock - Master of the Arcane has no story, clunky controls, annoying voice-overs, cliche lore, and is painfully sexist. There is apparently no real campaign, just quests that randomly appear. The controls work some of the time, and there is no menu to map controls to different keys. The voice acting is stilted at best, and tends to be jarring. Play is slow and uninteresting. Out of all the character options (~12) there are two females - a healer and a dragon queen. There's no female undead character, or a female battle-mage, which was extremely disappointing. The only redeeming qualities? Well, the graphics are nice enough, but the best thing is I got this for free in a humble bundle, so I can throw this abysmal excuse for a strategy game away with no regrets. 2/10			"

												Interesting game.  It's a cross between civilization and might and magic, done ok.  Battles are a bit lopsided as the bad guys get units that kick the crap out of yours early on and tha tis on NORMAL mode.  It takes awhile for you to get enough units to fight one of theirs...as it often takes 10+ units to take out one of their ""special guys"".  Normal units die just as easily as yours.  Strategy wise I dont' really see too much of it.  Other than you have to have area of control to use certain buildings to get certain units.  It is more of a build this to attack kind of a game than having an overarching requirement of strategy.  If civilization is too complication or slow for you, this is the game you want.			"

												I'll probably play it some more, but the game is not particularly challenging. The AI is really weak even at the hardest levels. It seems the computer doesn't play smarter, but with a dramatic income boost, which is useless as it doesn't research or colonize beyond a couple of bases. It can be fun, but it lacks the subtleties to deserve a positive review. It puts more emphasis on exploration than strategic competition, which is fine, but the exploration isn't quite enough to stand on its own. If the AI were a bit smarter/more aggressive, it would be a good buy.			"

												A surprising and refreshing twist on the Civilization sort of gameplay.Graphics wise the game is nothing too special to look at.  The visuals are pretty nice and certainly help draw you in a little bit but only as much as a top-down perspective really can.  Despite being turn based if you really get into it the gameplay can get the blood pumping quite a bit.The game has plenty to offer and multiplayer can be an engaging playthrough as well.  The sounds and music can be fun and help to draw you in as well and sometimes it can just be kind of funny hearing some of the things that the units spout forth such as ""Best archers in the world"" from the goblin sharpshooters.My overall rating for this game as compared to games within the same genre, particularly big name games like Civ?  8/10 as some things could have been done better.Complaints?  Well the neutral spawns, this game's equivalent to Civ's barbarians, can be a little uncompromising and tough but it adds some things to the game.			"

												This game is pretty nice. Not too bad, for what I played. It's very reminiscient of the old game I had the pleasure of playing called 'Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim'. Though don't confuse the two. The playstyles of each are entirely different. The only thing in common is the game takes place possibly during the events of Majesty II, its sequel, as a war of sorts. Your goal? To conquer the lands as your chosen lord, leading your armies to conquest.You can play a variety of races, from the usual humans to bestial creatures to undead, while being able to use each one's skill to however your preferences are. After gaining enough experience with a unit, the option will be given to promote their abilities at random. This, along with the random spells you get help to make the game interesting. It never becomes too doldrum to enjoy, but it can become complicated with so much happening on-screen at once, and it'd leave the players somewhat confused. Though if you can overcome this, this is truly a unique and challenging game that I'd definitely recommend to any of my friends and any who see this comment.			"

												Those who remember Majesty and the remake Majesty2 will remember the dulcet Scottish ""Connery-esque"" tones of the advisor. This game takes the same mellieu and puts it into a full 4X game.Like all good 4X games, it can be rated on how much ""just one more turn""... happens; and it does for this game. It's not Civ, but then what is?So I will only discuss the flaws. Somewhat sloppy interface; occassional lack of proper focus during NPC turns; ""help"" that gets you started but no further; the manual is not much better (it doesn't even have a tech-tree); graphics that slow and ""judders"" after a time. In short a number of niggling little flaws which detract from this being a truly excellent game. Even with these issues fixed it still wouldn't be Civ, but has many of the elements of it and is otherwise now a very solid game. Metascore underrates the current incarnation of this game somewhat.

												Imagine Sid Meier's Civilisation, and then add magic.This turn based hex strategy is fun and has amazing replayability. The only downfall it has is the multiplayer play makes you wait with nothing to do while your opponent makes their move. They should allow you to review your troops, lore, stats, history, cities, formations, and plan your next move. All you can do while you wait is watch your rivals do their moves if you're in range of them. But if you're voice chatting your friends also playing the game, then it's bearable.6/10 Multiplayer, 8/10 Single player.			"

												Type: StrategySimilar to: Civilization This game can't avoid comparisons to Civ, so let's look at the differences. Warlock: * Is more focused on magical/fantasy units* Has hireable champions, after a fashion (Lords) * Has more varied NPC enemies and cities* Has enemy player AI that will actually ally up with you (revolutionary, compared to Civ V's broken diplomacy) * Has quests that feel impactful, opposed to Civ's city-state questing * Has no focus on city production; buildings and units happen in an orderly queue that's only ever several turns deepDownsides to Warlock: * Unit selection feels a little sticky, de-selecting isn't all that fluid (Civ also has this problem)* The game's a bit of a resource pig (try typing in another window while it's up) * There is nearly nothing by way of a tutorial, so get ready for reading up on forums to learn about Religions and the likeThis game is worth a play through and is probably a good pickup for strategy fans if it's in the sub-$15 range. Replay value is moderately high.			"

												This would probably be a really fun game, except that one main part is exploring fantastic worlds through portals from the beginning world. In the beginning world, there are exceptionally strong ""crystal elemental"" combatants. Once you defeat them and actually enter the portal, you are swarmed with more of these crystal elementals and are completely encircled by more combatants on all sides. Since a player is only able to send a small army, which is advised by the gaming studio, you are totally wiped out. It really doesn't seem worthwhile to leave the beginning world in my opinion. Although the game can be entertaining, this is immensely frustrating. I could only give this game a 2 out of 5 Star recommendation.			"

												This one positively surprised me. Got this for free during the Humble Bundle thing and had a great time with it ever since. Warlock - Master of the Arcane is a turn based strategy game about a warlock (surprise, surprise!) battling his colleagues in an epic battle for a world filled with Gods, parallel worlds, and more monsters than you can count. The game itself shows a clear influence from the Age of Wonders series. Research spells and unleash them to grant your troops new abilities, weaken and damage your enemies, or change the face of the world around you. Water blocking your way? Raise the land and create a passage for your troops that doesn't put them at the mercy of naval monsters! Mountains slowing down your troops? Flatten them. The mountains, not the troops. Just make sure you have the mana to sustain all your permanent spells. There is little as terrifying as a flying ogre with a vampiric regeneration and an area attack.Mana, as well as gold and food (your main resources) are generated by city buildings. You can found or capture cities, although make sure they have enough room to grow. Place them near strategic resources for some special buildings, depending on the faction that lives in your city - the undead will utilise a pumkin patch different than humans would. Depending on which buildings you have, you can purchase powerful upgrades for your troops, ranging from a slight defense bonus to health regeneration each turn. They will also gain experience from battles, and you may choose an improvement with every levelup as well. Battles are fairly simple. Move your troops on the hex of the enemy you wish to attack, and they automatically fight. Damage is determined by the health of your troops (full health = max strength), as well as their damage type and the enemy defense. Heroes on either side, like the aforementioned flying ogre, might turn the tide of a battle, and placing your troops in cities or on mountains might give you the edge you need. Randomly given quests by Gods, guilds or an advisor will offer you some short to middle term objectives and keep you busy for a bit, as you wouldn't want to anger a God. Especially the Divine missions often offer a great reward as well, be it a spell or a troop tied to that particular deity. You wouldn't want to miss out on those now, would you?All in all a great game with a lot of unit variety, customiseability and a weird sense of humour. One minor issue, though... please don't use Google Translator for in game text. I originally installed the german version, and promptly found some rather glaring issues with that (Close was basically translated to 'near city view' as opposed to 'close that window', for example). Luckily, Steam allowed me to easily switch to english.			"

												Master of Magic meets Civilization 5 and the result is pretty good. There is some problems with details, but overall it works. I'm going to make a lot of references to Master of Magic (MoM) because I love that 20 years old game and this one reminds me of it in a good way. For example:The research system is reserved to spells, but there is a tech tree of sorts to the units too: In order to build units you need buildings and more advanced buildings for more advanced units. To build the advanced buildings you need to have the basic buildings first. The difference to MoM is that the buildings occupy hexes and there isn't necessarily room to build everything... until you learn the landscaping spells to make more room, that is.MoM had the other world besides the main map: Myrror. In this game there can be several alternate worlds, though they are smaller than the main map. They are not as developed as Myrror, only filled with dangerous monsters. Also there seems to be only one portal to each, which could be a bottleneck.The different races with unique buildings and units, though this game has only 4, while MoM had 14.This game also adds to the mix a parthenon of deities, which is a pretty standard thing in fantasy literature, but usually missing in these games. There are divine spells, which are mostly slightly powerful or a bit easier to cast versions of regular spells, that you can only research and cast if you are in favor of that deity. You can gain favor by doing quests and building temples on the holy ground. While you bow down to one god, you show your backside the opposite god. One way to win the game is to get one god so angry that it manifests on the map and then destroy it. Religion also affects the relationships between the wizards. It's a nice system.Speaking of quests, they kind of suck. You just get some random build this building/found a city/kill these random enemies that popped up here/capture this city/defeat this player that just pops up. Same with random events being just monster lairs popping up on your lands. Definitely the weakest part of this game. MoM's events had much more style. Some might argue that the AI not being able to handle the complexities could be a bigger problem. I didn't play enough to be sure, but it seemed to be struggling with it. Not worse than Civ 5, but in this game it has to handle with the parallel worlds, terrain changing by spells and stuff like that too.All in all a very nice concept that could use some tweaking and filling out the content to be really great. I'm glad I got this free from Humble Bundle. Made me put Warlock II high on my wishlist.			"

												This is where I wish reviews had a 'Meh' or ""Neutral"" or a ""Maybe"" option(s): Warlock is, on its face, a Civ 5 clone with many interesting features. Closest I can make for an anology would be Lords of the Realm or Lords of Magic, brought into the Civ5 graphical engine and gameplay. It is hard as hell to play . Don't DARE go into the other universes without the understanding that even the friendliest is Dark Souls level difficult. But if the guardians of the portals don't lend to this than you are more hearty than I. Play this if you want a tatical combat challenge. If you're more a city builder, hit up Civ5 (or earlier).			"

And you'd be pretty accurate.On the other, you could call it a surprisingly deep and funny hex-based grand strategy game with clever tongue-in-cheek flavor text and voicing to back up a fast-paced, engaging, and interesting gameplay that will always leave you with plenty on your plate to work on and plenty to look forward to until the moment you win.You will probably never run out of world to explore, even after searching most of the primary map, since the best resources are off in the distance, hiding, and the alternate worlds have even better loot to find, and you will probably never be able to dedicate as much of your resources as you'd like to exploring, because there are always monsters or angy neighbors on your doorstep just waiting to punch you in the face when you aren't looking.While it puts just a little much value in the city-spam, Warlock is a fiendishly fun and interesting game that is yes, like Civ, but also independent of it in character and style. And is extremely fun.			"

												I think it's a good game and others have said much of what I would say already for the game's good points.I just want to point out, that it seems to be VERY poorly optimized. Even on the lowest settings, because of all the effects and what I can only assume is an unoptimized graphics engine, the game will start to tank later into a match on mid-to-low end systems. My own laptop can usually handle some pretty high-end games on low settings, but Warlock started freezing up and eventually crashed late into one of my matches against the AI. It seems to be tied to the number of units and cities active on the map, since I had no issues at the start.Great game, but you need a strong computer to run it, even on the lowest settings.			"

												I like to think of this game as a more thematic civ 5, and i'd say civ 5 (Without expansions) is worse than warlock. Warlock takes the simpified 4x gamplay of civ 5, but gives it a combat focus. There are a massive variety of troops, and spells. The spells almost all have a combat focus, and they add another element of management and combat options to the game.			"

												Game has promise, but too many 'inconveniencing features' to overlook.

Oh, and also, it doesn't give you the option to remap keys! Oh, well, time to uninstall this and keep playing Civilizations.			"

												At first glance, before you immerse yourself in the AMAZING that is Warlock, it will look and, for the first few turns, feel like Civ. Once you get into the game, you realize Warlock brings a complexity that even Civ can not compare to. There is no AFK gaming here. You must pay attention, lest your army starve, random minions destroy your empire, all while your opponent mage is draining your mana. Very easily one of the best turn based RTS games out there!The only downside, the UI can feel a bit clunky and ""demandng"" at times. 9/10! This is a must have for any RTS fans!			"

												Got the main game for free from the Humble Store then bought all the DLCs at 75% off here on Steam.  I've spent 28+ game hours and so far, I am still very much fond of playing Warlock.  This was released in 2012 but the graphics is still very good. The gameplay reminded me of the classic ""Master of Magic"" from Microprose and of course of ""Sid Meier's Civilization"" series.  ""Warlock: Master of the Arcane"" isn't without fault though as I experienced a crash or two... but still, I haven't felt this excited again to play a game for so long until now.  This one is very absorbing and quite addictive.  It is truly superb value if you can find it on sale else I suggest just getting the second iteration: ""Warlock 2: The Exiled"".			"

												If you like turn based 4X and fantasy this is a pretty fun game to dump some time into.  It shares some elements with Civ5, Heroes of Might and Magic and of course Majesty.  Diplomacy is a little lacking and schizophrenic so it's really war heavy, I've found it necessary to constantly sign and resign non-aggression pacts in order to stay at peace when my army's busy clearing another realm for expansion.   The spellcasting is a really neat element though and a lot of fun to play with especially the terraforming spells.  Need a land bridge between continents?  Raise one.  Farms not producing in your frozen tundra?  Make the land fertile.  Don't be afraid to enchant away either, the upkeep really isn't bad considering how much mana you eventually bring in.  The difficulty is a little on the weak side though and once you get the hang of the mechanics  it's not really challenging in the long run, then again that's a problem most 4X games have so I wouldn't let that influence things much.

												Being a huge fan of turn-based strategy hex games like Civilization, I felt compelled to buy this amazing game. To give you a bit of backstory on this, you are basically a Great Mage that came to power in a time of great turmoil who is obsessed with expanding, conquering and any other goal associated with infinite power. The game itself has an easy to understand UI, great music (although a bit repetitive due to lack of tracks to squeeze into the hours of gameplay), good graphics and character design and other mechanics that I leave out to make this review as short as humanly possible. The heroes, however, I find to be REALLY overpowered. There's even a hero that's immune to every kind of damage imaginable, and it makes finishing the game a cakewalk. Overall, this game is very good and is definitely a must buy!			"

												The closest game yet to being a proper successor to Master of Magic.  Tactical battles on an overland map, city building, a variety of units that don't simply follow a rock-paper-scissors paradigm.  Terrain and unit types allow creation of choke points and standoffs and your overland spell casting helps you to overcome them.  Smooth interface, quick gameplay, and a lack of emphasis on creating a superstack and dashing around to protect/steal everything are advantages over MoM, but MoM was superior in terms of encouraging unbalanced experimental gameplay and had those fun late-game global enchantments like Armageddon and Time Stop.  Warlock has excellent options for maps and victory conditions.  The computer map generation here is very well done, essentially equal first with what MoM achieved in the industry.  Each piece of Warlock DLC adds something useful and I don't see anything that breaks the original game balance.			"

												Master of Magic meets Civilization 5 and the result is pretty good. There is some problems with details, but overall it works. I'm going to make a lot of references to Master of Magic (MoM) because I love that 20 years old game and this one reminds me of it in a good way. For example:The research system is reserved to spells, but there is a tech tree of sorts to the units too: In order to build units you need buildings and more advanced buildings for more advanced units. To build the advanced buildings you need to have the basic buildings first. The difference to MoM is that the buildings occupy hexes and there isn't necessarily room to build everything... until you learn the landscaping spells to make more room, that is.MoM had the other world besides the main map: Myrror. In this game there can be several alternate worlds, though they are smaller than the main map. They are not as developed as Myrror, only filled with dangerous monsters. Also there seems to be only one portal to each, which could be a bottleneck.The different races with unique buildings and units, though this game has only 4, while MoM had 14.This game also adds to the mix a parthenon of deities, which is a pretty standard thing in fantasy literature, but usually missing in these games. There are divine spells, which are mostly slightly powerful or a bit easier to cast versions of regular spells, that you can only research and cast if you are in favor of that deity. You can gain favor by doing quests and building temples on the holy ground. While you bow down to one god, you show your backside the opposite god. One way to win the game is to get one god so angry that it manifests on the map and then destroy it. Religion also affects the relationships between the wizards. It's a nice system.Speaking of quests, they kind of suck. You just get some random build this building/found a city/kill these random enemies that popped up here/capture this city/defeat this player that just pops up. Same with random events being just monster lairs popping up on your lands. Definitely the weakest part of this game. MoM's events had much more style. Some might argue that the AI not being able to handle the complexities could be a bigger problem. I didn't play enough to be sure, but it seemed to be struggling with it. Not worse than Civ 5, but in this game it has to handle with the parallel worlds, terrain changing by spells and stuff like that too.All in all a very nice concept that could use some tweaking and filling out the content to be really great. I'm glad I got this free from Humble Bundle. Made me put Warlock II high on my wishlist.			"

The three different factions have their own unique feel to them, and still manage to have their strengths and weaknesses. Btw, the descriptions of heroes and units are great pieces of hidden humour.

												While on the surface Warlock may look a lot like Civilization V, someone looking for a similar fantasy experience will be disappointed. Instead this is more akin to a turn based tactical game such as Advance Wars or Battle Isle. Warlock is all about war, with only a token amount of research and city development which offers more of a nod to Masters of the Arcane than Civ. While this makes it more limited in scope there is no denying that there is a repeatable enjoyment in plotting the demise of your opponents by the use of vast armies of fantasy creatures.			"

												decent turn based strategy game.The various ""factions' coplement each other sort of well though, as some of them are better equiped than the rest, and the paper-rock-scissors effect is somewhat biased.Still a pleasant game, one i recomend, provided your expectations are not too high, and you find it with a generous discount.

												If you and your friends enjoy games like Civilization and some fantasy atmosphere then you will definitely like it. Play it in multiplayer - scenarios and game modes are exactly the same in multiplayer as in singleplayer so there is no point in playing alone. It can be a lot of fun if you can gather few friends to spend long hours in this fantasy civ world. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it because it can get repetitive after playing through couple scenarios alone.			"

												I think it's a good game and others have said much of what I would say already for the game's good points.I just want to point out, that it seems to be VERY poorly optimized. Even on the lowest settings, because of all the effects and what I can only assume is an unoptimized graphics engine, the game will start to tank later into a match on mid-to-low end systems. My own laptop can usually handle some pretty high-end games on low settings, but Warlock started freezing up and eventually crashed late into one of my matches against the AI. It seems to be tied to the number of units and cities active on the map, since I had no issues at the start.Great game, but you need a strong computer to run it, even on the lowest settings.			"

												I'm really enjoying this game still. It's got a great deal of depth. There are 3 major races, all sorts of special resources some of which give you additional military units or other bonuses, 8 gods, up to 8 planes of existence, perks, special spells depending on divine alignment... the list goes on and on.Get the ultimate edition if you can - the DLC isn't essential, but it does add a number of fun features I like to play with.If you`re interested, there`s a free demo to try out too. It gives you about 50 turns of gameplay to try out, and gives you a decent starting taste of the game.For those looking for game comparisons, it`s probably most similar to a very old game called Master of Magic. It runs on the Civ 5 engine, though, so it`s very pretty. There are some background story elements loosely borrowed from Majesty (the choice of gods and to a loose extent the races and creatures), but it is a very different kind of game than Majesty was.

												This is an ambitious game that's pretty well-made, but ultimately is just very...middling. It's a very combat-focused 4X game, but since everything is for the ultimate goal of combat, it ends up feeling very narrow. The world has lots of NPC monsters that create a cool world, but they quickly become just background annoyances that you have to spend resources to control.To be fair, I only got about two hours into a game after playing the demo several times, so maybe it gets way more interesting later on (for instance, I barely got to explore through any of the portals), but I just got bored and didn't want to see any more. If the demo REALLY grabs you, you may also like the main game, but otherwise, I'd go elsewhere for your 4X strategy fix.			"

												A Wonderfull return to games such as Heroes of might and magic, a hexagon based strategy game where you play the archmage, a leader of a group of people of various races. You set out to build your empire and cast global spells that change the world around you as other archmages and local wild life tries to wear you down to nothing! If played on the higher diffeculty settings, you will be tested to no end, the game will seem unfair to the dim witted, but in the end, it was your own failures that brought defeat. This game has been pure bliss for me ever since i got it.If you are at all interested in a strategy game set in the style of Heroes of might and magic, then give it a try. it's worth every damn penny its asking for.... why are you still here?

												It grips me a lot stronger than other titles have before. Generally, it does a good job of preventing early-game rush, although random and frequent spawns of neutral armies can cause large amounts of unbalance over time (relatively short, only 100 or so turns). Besides that, I like it quite a bit, and every so often get back to it to play another round or so!			"

												On one hand, you could call this game fantasy Civ V and leave it at that. And you'd be pretty accurate.On the other, you could call it a surprisingly deep and funny hex-based grand strategy game with clever tongue-in-cheek flavor text and voicing to back up a fast-paced, engaging, and interesting gameplay that will always leave you with plenty on your plate to work on and plenty to look forward to until the moment you win.You will probably never run out of world to explore, even after searching most of the primary map, since the best resources are off in the distance, hiding, and the alternate worlds have even better loot to find, and you will probably never be able to dedicate as much of your resources as you'd like to exploring, because there are always monsters or angy neighbors on your doorstep just waiting to punch you in the face when you aren't looking.While it puts just a little much value in the city-spam, Warlock is a fiendishly fun and interesting game that is yes, like Civ, but also independent of it in character and style. And is extremely fun.			"

												Every review of this game mentions the Civilization series, and since I just did, this will be no different. This game is basically Civilization, with a fantasy setting. The tech trees are replaced with spell research, which is probably the weakest part of the game. Some of the spell ideas are great, like the ability to change terrain to different types to either boost your cities or mess with opponents. For the most part though, it feels like a bit of a pointless endeavour. In general though, it's a solid 4X game, which I've put a lot of time into. There's enough that's new about it to keep it interesting, and the gameplay is solid and fun enough to feel classic.			"

												Warlock - Master of the Arcane is basically an arcade version of Civ 5 and could easily be mistaken for a Civ 5 mod. The UI is nearly a pixel-by-pixel clone of Civ 5, but the streamlined combat-oriented nature of the game speeds up the pace a bit.Wandering creatures, aka barbarians, also play a more prominent role compared to the Civ games where they cease to be a threat. Similar to HOMM, defeating monsters on the world map is key to growing your territory and consolidating your power before taking on the other great mages. Diplomacy consists of ""give us stuff, or die"". Unfortunately, the AI is dumb as bricks which takes away most of the challenge and pretty much kills the replayability. I usually play at Prince or lower in Civ, but I was able to beat the AI opponents in Warlock quite easily on hard; I would not recommend this game to strategy buffs. So in terms of value, it's not all that great, but it's fun for a more beat-em-up style diversion once or for people who think the Civ games are too hard or complex.			"

												A surprising and refreshing twist on the Civilization sort of gameplay.Graphics wise the game is nothing too special to look at.  The visuals are pretty nice and certainly help draw you in a little bit but only as much as a top-down perspective really can.  Despite being turn based if you really get into it the gameplay can get the blood pumping quite a bit.The game has plenty to offer and multiplayer can be an engaging playthrough as well.  The sounds and music can be fun and help to draw you in as well and sometimes it can just be kind of funny hearing some of the things that the units spout forth such as ""Best archers in the world"" from the goblin sharpshooters.My overall rating for this game as compared to games within the same genre, particularly big name games like Civ?  8/10 as some things could have been done better.Complaints?  Well the neutral spawns, this game's equivalent to Civ's barbarians, can be a little uncompromising and tough but it adds some things to the game.			"

The only downfall it has is the multiplayer play makes you wait with nothing to do while your opponent makes their move. They should allow you to review your troops, lore, stats, history, cities, formations, and plan your next move. All you can do while you wait is watch your rivals do their moves if you're in range of them.

												I like this game. I played it for 20+ hours offline so it wont show on my steam profile. 20+ hours translates to 2 and a bit games, its not fast. This is a good variation on the civilization theme of gaming, with a fantasy bent. Good news includes that it doesnt punish you like civ 5 does for doing what you want to do (build a large empire). The things that might bother you include that it takes a long time, including a long period after your opponents are no longer a threat but you havent won yet. Then there is the depth of the game, there is a lot there, but you dont need it to win, the only way to do about half the stuff available in the game is to delay winning while you do it.			"

												At first glance, before you immerse yourself in the AMAZING that is Warlock, it will look and, for the first few turns, feel like Civ. Once you get into the game, you realize Warlock brings a complexity that even Civ can not compare to. There is no AFK gaming here. You must pay attention, lest your army starve, random minions destroy your empire, all while your opponent mage is draining your mana. Very easily one of the best turn based RTS games out there!The only downside, the UI can feel a bit clunky and ""demandng"" at times. 9/10! This is a must have for any RTS fans!			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization: Warlock - Master of the Arcane is truly a gem among modern games. A fine UI, large selection of units, and in-depth religion system will keep you playing for days. You even get Sean Connery as your advisor! Make children rage by spawning multitudes of volcanoes in their kingdom, absolutely destroying 80 turns of hard work in just 6 turns!(seriously though, this game may rip off Civ 5 a lot, but it is still really good. The spell system gives the game some real flavor.)			"

												Those who remember Majesty and the remake Majesty2 will remember the dulcet Scottish ""Connery-esque"" tones of the advisor. This game takes the same mellieu and puts it into a full 4X game.Like all good 4X games, it can be rated on how much ""just one more turn""... happens; and it does for this game. It's not Civ, but then what is?So I will only discuss the flaws. Somewhat sloppy interface; occassional lack of proper focus during NPC turns; ""help"" that gets you started but no further; the manual is not much better (it doesn't even have a tech-tree); graphics that slow and ""judders"" after a time. In short a number of niggling little flaws which detract from this being a truly excellent game. Even with these issues fixed it still wouldn't be Civ, but has many of the elements of it and is otherwise now a very solid game. Metascore underrates the current incarnation of this game somewhat.

												Great casual game with high replay value. I recommend that you turn the sound off and put on a nice comedy series or something on tv and let the casual gaming begin.Hex grid at its finest, the settings make it possible to create challenging games that will take ages to finish or kindergarten-level games that will be won in an hour. The three different factions have their own unique feel to them, and still manage to have their strengths and weaknesses. Btw, the descriptions of heroes and units are great pieces of hidden humour. I've started games with the sole purpose of acquiring a specific unit so I can read their descriptions!			"

												This is an excellent Civilization clone in a fantasy setting, slightly similar to the old Master of Magic, but much more varied. I'm not sure why other reviewers are comparing it to HOMM and its clones, I don't think it really is like them at all.The exploration and conquest are mostly open-ended, you are fighting generic fantasy enemies without any specific goals or personalities, just for the sake of conquering them, just like in any Civ game. Unfortunately the AI lags behind the rest of the game quality-wise. It is rather predictable and tends to make stupid decisions. There are also bugs that should have long been corrected, especially the interface becoming unusable because of a pop-up window that can't be closed properly. Right, there is an easy workaround, but this is no excuse for not fixing a bug. Otherwise the user interface is exactly what you would expect in a Civ game, very functional and comfortable. The graphics are excellent as well. I wouldn't recommend buying it at its full price, but it has been included in many bundles and even given away for free on various occasions. I think it's definitely worth picking up for a few dollars when given the chance.			"

												Master of Magic meets Civilization 5 and the result is pretty good. There is some problems with details, but overall it works. I'm going to make a lot of references to Master of Magic (MoM) because I love that 20 years old game and this one reminds me of it in a good way. For example:The research system is reserved to spells, but there is a tech tree of sorts to the units too: In order to build units you need buildings and more advanced buildings for more advanced units. To build the advanced buildings you need to have the basic buildings first. The difference to MoM is that the buildings occupy hexes and there isn't necessarily room to build everything... until you learn the landscaping spells to make more room, that is.MoM had the other world besides the main map: Myrror. In this game there can be several alternate worlds, though they are smaller than the main map. They are not as developed as Myrror, only filled with dangerous monsters. Also there seems to be only one portal to each, which could be a bottleneck.The different races with unique buildings and units, though this game has only 4, while MoM had 14.This game also adds to the mix a parthenon of deities, which is a pretty standard thing in fantasy literature, but usually missing in these games. There are divine spells, which are mostly slightly powerful or a bit easier to cast versions of regular spells, that you can only research and cast if you are in favor of that deity. You can gain favor by doing quests and building temples on the holy ground. While you bow down to one god, you show your backside the opposite god. One way to win the game is to get one god so angry that it manifests on the map and then destroy it. Religion also affects the relationships between the wizards. It's a nice system.Speaking of quests, they kind of suck. You just get some random build this building/found a city/kill these random enemies that popped up here/capture this city/defeat this player that just pops up. Same with random events being just monster lairs popping up on your lands. Definitely the weakest part of this game. MoM's events had much more style. Some might argue that the AI not being able to handle the complexities could be a bigger problem. I didn't play enough to be sure, but it seemed to be struggling with it. Not worse than Civ 5, but in this game it has to handle with the parallel worlds, terrain changing by spells and stuff like that too.All in all a very nice concept that could use some tweaking and filling out the content to be really great. I'm glad I got this free from Humble Bundle. Made me put Warlock II high on my wishlist.			"

If you like magic and you like heroes and you like Civilization style games, this game might be for you! The graphics are much improved from the old Master of Magic days but it maintains a lot of similar gameplay aspects. On occasion it gets a bit slow and tedious from the perspective of gameplay, but this game does maintain much of what I enjoyed of Master of Magic and I will keep playing and recommend it for those reasons alone.

												Ever since Master Of Magic came out back durig the mid 1990's, I can't stop playig that game, even though it's over 15 years old. Over the years, many game companies have been trying to bring back or remake a lot of the original older games with modern day technology. Such games include Duke Nukem, Shadow Warrior, Wizardry 8.When I first played the game Civilization V, it was very remarkable and I had a great time playing that game. Now, they designed a game that plays just like it, only it's this game, WARLOCK. This is a fantastic remake of the classic ""Master Of Magic"". Although the original game company is no longer around, this is not to imply that this IS the remake, because it's not... not officially anyways. But this game comes so close to Master Of Magic, I just love this game.It plays just like Civilization V, only you also learn spells, summon monsters, and hire heroes to help you protect your kingdom and realms. With so much to do and so much more than Civilization V, you only thought that you played the best strategy game. Get ready to be a Wizard istead of a Mayor. Power in the palm of your hands, literally.			"

												A surprising gem!  I got this as part of a bundle without knowing anything about it at all, and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a hex-based strategy game which is realtively light, and whose mechanics keep it tight the whole way through.  The gameplay is sort of like Civilization 5 minus Civilization 4 - city building and resources are dealt with in a minimalist style, and the hex-based combat has a similar feel to the best of Civ 5, with an expanded system for damage types.  It also has an overland magic system that will remind you of Master of Magic.  Apart from tight mechanics, this game is also very colourful - visually appealing with an entertaining roster of units, and a sense of humour which isn't forced or overlaboured.  The only real downside is that the animations are too long, and you need to skip them to play at any rate - doubly bad as that detracts from the atmosphere and also gives you RSI.  Would still strongly recommend if you're looking for a combat focused turn-based strategy game that's a bit more lightweight than other games in the genre.			"

It has decent graphics for what it is and is customizable enough to provide hours or even days of play on a given map. I love the units' speech.If there were a downside to this game, I would suggest that you might start seeking some additional complexity after a while. I personally went on to the latest Civilization game and a few others. That doesn't detract from this game at all. Warlock is what it is and it is very good for the niche it fills.I heartily recommend it.			"

												A well-crafted, easy-to-play game with an entertaining fantasy bent, Warlock will have you staying up nights taking one more turn to blast King Rrat to kingdom come. Think of it as Civilization V but with a fantasy setting. My biggest gripe with the game, that you can't refuse a demand. It's only accept or war. Which is annoying. However, it's everything one may want from a serious turn based strategy. It looks and feels like civilization, but has the intensity of Command and Conquer with the in-depth unit levelling system of Majesty. No steam workshop support but you can't have it all. It's a fun game that you will be saying to yourself, just one more turn.			"

												As far as strategy games go, it doesn't get much better than this.  Cities don't require a ton of micromanagement, while each choice is still important.  Every unit has it's advantages and limitations, and can level up in order to gain small bonuses or even entirely new abilities.  Vampires, for example, if leveled high enough, grant an aura effect to allies units that allows them a vampiric effect - 40% of the damage they deal, they get back as healing.  Terrain modifiers can easily make or break a battle, and powerful spells can alter that terrain.  The high level of freedom can also allow for many outside-the-box strategies, as well.  In one game, I used the ""raise land"" spell to create a small island, and then used the teleport spell to slowly ferry my troops across the ocean.  This allowed me to skip waiting on my navy to clear the ocean of sea monsters, and probably sped my conquest of a mostly empty continent by around 20 turns.The whole atmosphere of the game is light hearted, with a good deal of humor hidden within the description of the various units.  Even the units themselves can be good for a laugh, with anything from goblin archers saying reversing whether to aim or shoot first, to the fact that one of the strongest units in the game is a giant, fire-breathing turtle.  The game is still medieval fantasy, but it definately has a bit of fun with it.One common mistake I see, however, is the belief that this game is a clone of Civilization V.  In fact, this game isn't based on Civ V, it's based on another, much older game.  It does contain many modern updates of the old turn based strategy game design, such as hex grids and 3D graphics, as well as some entirely new material, like the terrain altering spells.  Still, it's long been the nature of every game to be compared to a single, super-popular game within it's own genre.  Kinda like how World of Warcraft is mentioned in virtually every conversation of whether some MMORPG is a good game or not.Overall, the gameplay is fantastic, the potential for strategic thinking is very high, and aside from an AI that makes me want to punch the other leaders in the face (mostly due to their manipulative design), I really do enjoy this game.  Heck, I've even found some ways to turn the AI's back-stabbyness against them.  Now if only the sequel would hurry up and get here.  =)P.S. Try the demo.  If you like it, consider Ultimate Edition, because there isn't a single expansion or DLC I didn't like for this game.			"

												I think it's a good game and others have said much of what I would say already for the game's good points.I just want to point out, that it seems to be VERY poorly optimized. Even on the lowest settings, because of all the effects and what I can only assume is an unoptimized graphics engine, the game will start to tank later into a match on mid-to-low end systems. My own laptop can usually handle some pretty high-end games on low settings, but Warlock started freezing up and eventually crashed late into one of my matches against the AI. It seems to be tied to the number of units and cities active on the map, since I had no issues at the start.Great game, but you need a strong computer to run it, even on the lowest settings.			"

												After played 12 hours, i deleted game.Dont understand the game is bad.Just 12 hours was enough to play for me.I recommend the game for Turn Based Startegy (TBS) lovers.When i started to play, game was perfect for me but the most lacking element of the game is ""story"".Theres no story in game.You just select your hero and world size, spells etc than you play with computer.No story, no RPG.Aim is to destroy other mages.Than you finish game and starting same things again.Thats why i deleted game after 12 hours.For example , couse of the excellent story i played Might and Magic VI nearly 250 hours.Couse all game steps connects to a story and you always want to play next part when you finish the last one.But if you play games with computer and if you dont need a story to play a TBS, than buy and play this game, you will like it.My point for this game is 7/10.

												This is definitely a warfare-focused 4X - diplomacy and trade are minimal, and most systems ultimately feed into warfare one way or the other. If you're looking for a more comprehensive fantasy 4X, try Endless Legend, but if war's what you're looking for, it's well worth it to give Warlock a go.Pros:- Tons of unity variety, a lot of it tied to local resources rather than faction- Interesting map generation- Good sense of tension even in the late game- Can summon volcanosCons:- Constant monster spawning via events is annoying- It can be hard to identify monster lairs on the map, as the art style is noisy and cluttered- The diplomatic AI seems fairly dumb, at least at lower levels, allowing me to make peace whenever it's convenient for me so I can heal my forces and hunt the monster spawners before declaring war again- Cannot summon volcanos directly underneath cities			"

												This is a really great hex-based city-building and conquer game. It's a lot like a trimmed-down civilization game except with a fantasy theme based on the Majesty series. The connection to Majesty doesn't have much effect on the gameplay, it's just provides a background for the units and world and makes for a few good chuckles and a sense of belonging for those of us who loved Majesty. The strength of the game is in single player but there is a very noticeable lack of any campaign and the multiplayer was very limited last I checked. It has great potential if these are added/improved and is worth the buy now if you enjoy longish civ-like games against a computer opponent.			"

												I had high hopes for this game. I thought it might be somewhat similar to XCOM, which was my first foray into turn-based strategy games. No such luck. Warlock - Master of the Arcane has no story, clunky controls, annoying voice-overs, cliche lore, and is painfully sexist. There is apparently no real campaign, just quests that randomly appear. The controls work some of the time, and there is no menu to map controls to different keys. The voice acting is stilted at best, and tends to be jarring. Play is slow and uninteresting. Out of all the character options (~12) there are two females - a healer and a dragon queen. There's no female undead character, or a female battle-mage, which was extremely disappointing. The only redeeming qualities? Well, the graphics are nice enough, but the best thing is I got this for free in a humble bundle, so I can throw this abysmal excuse for a strategy game away with no regrets. 2/10			"

												Given the price this is often at these days, this game is a great buy for anyone who ever played and loved Master of Magic.  I adored that game and still consider it the ultimate 4x experience.  The inspirations are obvious and many features and concepts are carried over here, including:Square/hex based fantasy 4x TBSMultiple dimensions (Warlock has more than one)Heroes (which again are overpowering later with enough enchantments)Hero equipment (Artifacts, which can be crafted here also)City management with buildings, resources, and enchantments (though not self-contained like in MoM)Even unit orders like Sentry and the waypointing systemIt should also be noted that this game is in the lore of the Majesty series of games, and you'll recognize much of the irreverent humor and religious pantheon.  The graphics and sound design are gorgeous as well, and I've not once had the game crash on me yet, even while on a 12-hour bender, saving and loading games multiple times.I think I still would prefer a modern remake of Master of Magic with multiplayer, but I definitely recommend Warlock.

												I wasn't really sure I would get hooked onto this game...  but after many hours later....  oh yea, this is a very interesting game.It does have some flaws, and probably need a bit of fixing in terms of AI. They would just declare war, without much warning or reason, until I realised I need to keep trying to renew the non-agresssion pact with them as soon as they break them.But other than that, is a worth addition to my turn based strategy game collection.

												Failure diplomacy: You can't reject proposed deals of AI opponents, this automatically means war. This is annoying! Sure, I see no problem in AI opponents attacking me, if I too often reject them, but the automatism is tedious. (In Civilisation I like the fact hat all AI ​​opponents have a ""mood"", which can be influenced by the actions of diplomacy.)Failure control: Units can not wait permanently / are put to sleep. At the next round you have to give new commands to each and every one. Once you have more than 5 units, it's annoying!Failure options: You can hardly adjust something in the options for gameplay. For example: You must always watch combat animations and your units running around. If you do not want this, you have to click for every damn unit. For experienced players this should be adjustable.Failure steam: On the steam-start-screen you can choose whether you want to play right now or only read the manual. If you choose the manual, you get the message that this was not possible, because of some kind of “application error” and that you should contact the steam support.If you are looking on the internet, you will find no guidance. The steam support refers to the manufacturers and your are send to a forum (where you can ask questions if you log in with an account). All unsatisfactory and very awkward.A link will help:http://warlockmota.wikia.com/wiki/Warlock:_Master_of_the_Arcane_WikiAnd opening a PDF file: http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/203630/manuals/PDX9405EU_Warlock_Onlinemanual.pdf?t=1385627678Otherwise the game is graphically superb. (And would make a total of more fun when the controll-settings and especially the KI would be better.)Manko Diplomatie: Vorgeschlagene Deals von KI-Gegnern kann man zwar ablehnen, dies bedeutet aber AUTOMATISCH Krieg. Das ist nervig! Klar kann einen der KI-Gegner angreifen, wenn man ihn zu oft zurückweißt, aber der Automatismus ist langweilig. (An Civ gefällt mir, dass die KI-Gegner eine ""Stimmung"" gegenüber anderen Spielern haben, die über die Aktionen in der Diplomatie beeinflusst werden können.)Manko Steuerung: Einheiten können nicht dauerhaft warten/schlafen gelegt werden, spätestens zu nächsten Runde muss man ihnen wieder neue Befehle geben. Sobald man mehr als 5 Einheiten hat, nervt's!Manko Optionen: Man kann über die Optionen kaum etwas für das Gameplay einstellen. Mann muss sich immer die Kampfanimationen ansehen und seinen einheiten beim Rumlaufen zusehen. Wenn man das nicht will, muss man bei jeder verdammten Einheit klicken. Das zieht für erfahrene Spieler Runden unnötig in die Länge und sollte einstellbar sein.Manko Steam: Im Startbildschirm von Steam kann, man wählen, ob man direkt spielen oder erst die Anleitung lesen möchte. Wählt man die Anleitung, so kommt die Meldung, dass dies nicht möglich sei, weil eine Anwendung fehle. Man solle den Steamsupport kontaktieren.Wenn man im Netz sucht, findet man keine Anleitung. Der Steam-Support verweist einen einfach an die Hersteller und die schicken einen in ein Forum, wo man dann Fragen stellen kann, wenn man sich dort mit einem Account einloggt. Alles unbefriedigend und sehr umständlich.Ein Link hilft: http://warlockmota.wikia.com/wiki/Warlock:_Master_of_the_Arcane_WikiUnd das sich öffnende PDF-File: http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/203630/manuals/PDX9405EU_Warlock_Onlinemanual.pdf?t=1385627678Ansonsten ist das Spiel grafisch gelungen.

												This is a great TBS in the style of Age of Wonders and Master of Magic. A lot of the systems are made simpler (like city management doesn't involve endlessly building things, you just build a new building every level of population, which comes every 1000 population) which makes it pretty easy to pick up and play. My major gripe is that the game is REALLY easy, the AI puts up no fight whatsoever. As long as you don't make any MAJOR screwups in the early game and have even a decent grasp of the major game mechanics through the middle of the game, you will probably win.			"

												This game is really enjoyable, as a fan of the hotm and total war series I have to say this is as close as I have seen to combining them. I bought Endless Legend first and I have to say this game makes that one look so incredibly dull in comparison. The only problem I have with warlock is the difficulty, even on the highest level, impossible, it is actually pretty easy. The ai does not know how to counter spells that affect pathing, so as cool as raising a mountain range to block enemies or beaching enemy ships is the ai does not have an effective way to counter the tactic. The raise/lower land spells come early too so there is really no way to lose if you know how to use them effectively. 90% of this game is fun but the 10% that includes chasing weak enemies that flank you to attack cities or getting to a point where winning is inevitible and spending 5 hours cleaing up is not fun.Conclusion: Buy this game if it is 15 dollars or less, you will enjoy it enough to make the purchase worth it at this cost or lower.

												Got this game for free. First time I played it, 2 years ago I played all evening and night and completed the game. That's right, I played for 14 hours straight, the first time I played this game, and I have never played something like this before (not Civ5 etc.). At this point I knew it's dangerously addictive, I just want to make my units stronger, my kingdom bigger, defeat all other mages, see what creatures I can get. Everytime I tell myself: ""Just one more turn, then I'm call it a quit"".now 3 days ago I started a new game. And see here; 20 hours later I completed it. Done in 3 days.This game is truly a good game, it is simple but you can immerse yourself into it as much as you like it.

												It's a fixed Civ-like game where you control a fantasy race trying to take over a map.  Diplomacy is hilariously lackluster since you'll probably go to war after another civ demands all of your mana or gold, but that was never why I played these anyway.  Another thing is that you can cast various spells to affect the board such as summons, attacks, buffs, debuffs, and so on.  Units are also really important to keep alive since they gain feats when they level and keep all the feats when you upgrade them to the next type; you can also buy armor/weapons for them that stay, so they become a long-term investment most of the time.  It lets you skip through opponents' turns quickly so that's a HUGE plus for me, but at the end of the day you go through everything you can make in game pretty quickly, and these types of games usually don't hold my interest too long.7/10, awesome if it's on sale, but you'll probably find better value/fun elsewhere			"

												This game randomly appeared in my games library, I didnt buy it. However im rather enjoying it to say the least.Plays like Civ, But more enjoyable personally. The Magic aspect changes the whole game the longer you play. Which means you need to change your tactics constantly. Your also able to go to other worlds if you have a powerful force. But this also works the other way around, They eventually invade your world.I would actually recommend this game.			"

												An interesting fantasy 4X, that risks to be overlooked in favour of more recent or more famous titles.While it is no masterpiece, it certainly has its perks:- races- magic- different resources, not your usual- still easy on the eye- really challengingTo be honest, I must also recognise its cons:- factions of the same race are all the same, regardless of their different leaders- no technology, only spells to research- compared to a historical 4X (e.g. Civilization), it lacks depth and direction, but I feel that this is a pretty common problem with fantasy 4X- occasionally brutal, even at the lowest difficulties- some mechanisms are not intuitiveIt kind of feel like a con, but I couldn't put it together with all the others, since it is really not the game's fault: recently, the market has been invaded by fantasy 4X, and this one lacks such a personality to break the mould. If you like the genre, you should give it a try, because it still is a nice game, but if you already own Age of Wonders, Fallen Enchantress, Endless Legend, etc, you probably won't find anything to really set this game apart from the others.

												This is definitely a warfare-focused 4X - diplomacy and trade are minimal, and most systems ultimately feed into warfare one way or the other. If you're looking for a more comprehensive fantasy 4X, try Endless Legend, but if war's what you're looking for, it's well worth it to give Warlock a go.Pros:- Tons of unity variety, a lot of it tied to local resources rather than faction- Interesting map generation- Good sense of tension even in the late game- Can summon volcanosCons:- Constant monster spawning via events is annoying- It can be hard to identify monster lairs on the map, as the art style is noisy and cluttered- The diplomatic AI seems fairly dumb, at least at lower levels, allowing me to make peace whenever it's convenient for me so I can heal my forces and hunt the monster spawners before declaring war again- Cannot summon volcanos directly underneath cities			"

												Got this game for free. First time I played it, 2 years ago I played all evening and night and completed the game. That's right, I played for 14 hours straight, the first time I played this game, and I have never played something like this before (not Civ5 etc.). At this point I knew it's dangerously addictive, I just want to make my units stronger, my kingdom bigger, defeat all other mages, see what creatures I can get. Everytime I tell myself: ""Just one more turn, then I'm call it a quit"".now 3 days ago I started a new game. And see here; 20 hours later I completed it. Done in 3 days.This game is truly a good game, it is simple but you can immerse yourself into it as much as you like it. It sucks you in, and doesn't spit you out until you completed it.10/10 Ruined 4 nights of sleep.			"

												This game is really enjoyable, as a fan of the hotm and total war series I have to say this is as close as I have seen to combining them. I bought Endless Legend first and I have to say this game makes that one look so incredibly dull in comparison. The only problem I have with warlock is the difficulty, even on the highest level, impossible, it is actually pretty easy. The ai does not know how to counter spells that affect pathing, so as cool as raising a mountain range to block enemies or beaching enemy ships is the ai does not have an effective way to counter the tactic. The raise/lower land spells come early too so there is really no way to lose if you know how to use them effectively. 90% of this game is fun but the 10% that includes chasing weak enemies that flank you to attack cities or getting to a point where winning is inevitible and spending 5 hours cleaing up is not fun.Conclusion: Buy this game if it is 15 dollars or less, you will enjoy it enough to make the purchase worth it at this cost or lower.

												It's a fixed Civ-like game where you control a fantasy race trying to take over a map.  Diplomacy is hilariously lackluster since you'll probably go to war after another civ demands all of your mana or gold, but that was never why I played these anyway.  Another thing is that you can cast various spells to affect the board such as summons, attacks, buffs, debuffs, and so on.  Units are also really important to keep alive since they gain feats when they level and keep all the feats when you upgrade them to the next type; you can also buy armor/weapons for them that stay, so they become a long-term investment most of the time.  It lets you skip through opponents' turns quickly so that's a HUGE plus for me, but at the end of the day you go through everything you can make in game pretty quickly, and these types of games usually don't hold my interest too long.7/10, awesome if it's on sale, but you'll probably find better value/fun elsewhere			"

												Got me hooked... again. Another late night, just one more turn, where did all my beer go? game. Like Civ, its a turn based 4X (whatever that means) strategy crawler that just won't cut it with the shooter crowd. But hey, nothing cuts it with the shooter crowd, they even complain about their favourites until they get nerfed to heck and go plan another shooter to moan about. THIS game has spells, and dragons, and plays like civilisations worst wet dream, just without the ridiculous evolving through the ages bollix. Go get it, play it, then tell your newly estranged partner that it wasn't your fault, Skull sent ya.			"

												A well-crafted, easy-to-play game with an entertaining fantasy bent, Warlock will have you staying up nights taking one more turn to blast King Rrat to kingdom come. Think of it as Civilization V but with a fantasy setting. My biggest gripe with the game, that you can't refuse a demand. It's only accept or war. Which is annoying. However, it's everything one may want from a serious turn based strategy. It looks and feels like civilization, but has the intensity of Command and Conquer with the in-depth unit levelling system of Majesty. No steam workshop support but you can't have it all. It's a fun game that you will be saying to yourself, just one more turn.			"

												This is a very light-weight Turn-based strategy game that is perfect for those new to the turn-based strategy genre of games. It has decent graphics for what it is and is customizable enough to provide hours or even days of play on a given map. I love the units' speech.If there were a downside to this game, I would suggest that you might start seeking some additional complexity after a while. I personally went on to the latest Civilization game and a few others. That doesn't detract from this game at all. Warlock is what it is and it is very good for the niche it fills.I heartily recommend it.			"
