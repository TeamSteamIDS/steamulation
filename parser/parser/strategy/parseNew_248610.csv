												Door Kickers is one of those pleasant surprises that comes every now and then.This is essentially a Top Down SWAT Team Simulator that is extremely Tactical. (And I'm not using the word just because it's cool)How would I describe Door Kickers ?This game reminds me of older releases that change the way FPSes are played such as Rainbow Six and SWAT.This is a slow and methodical game as it'll brutally punish you if a mistake have been made. Thought and precise movements must be taken into account if you wish for all of your troopers to survive that one bloody great gunfight.How does this game differ itself from the rest ?First of all, it is innovative. This is done in the style of the briefing phase in Rainbow Six, but it is completely real time with pausing mechanics so you are able to change your plan on the fly other than having to exit to the planning phase and change your movements and start over.How is this game tactical ?Well, the RPS 'Best Tactics of 2014' says for itself.Not enough, aye ?Fine. Door Kickers is one of those games that shines during situations where you can't just go guns blazing.For example,there is a hostage taker standing right behind the hostage facing toward the only entry point of the room.Now, being the Top Down game that Door Kickers is, there is no third dimension so when your team step into the room, the hostage taker will open fire and hit the hostage before he hits you.So what do you do ?1. Bang the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... I meant a flashbang. Blind him so your team has time to move around and neutralise him without harming the hostage2. If there is a window, you can send a trooper to flank him from a different angle.Multiple ways to problem solve, is it enough evidence that this game is tactical ?No ?Well, the game has different kinds of situations that you have to adapt to, such as- Eliminate Hostiles : It's basically Terrorist Hunt. Go in, kill all the baddies, win.- Hostage Rescue : It's just like Terrorist Hunt, but with Hostages in it. Possibility of an Execution though.- Stop Execution : A baddie in the area is about to blow the brains out of someone and you have to stop them.- Bomb Defusal : Well, the name says it all.- Dope Raid : Recover evidence mainly dope, and dope papers.- Warrant Arrest : Again, name says it all.- Protect VIP : ... I don't really have to describe this one at all, do I ?- Robbery in Progress : Somehow, the devs know how lazy I get when I need to describe things.What ? Still not enough ? Are you kidding me...Fine.The game has an arsenal of trooper classes, weapons, and equipment to outfit your team to suit the situationClasses include (If you haven't seen the video above)- Pointman : Only armed with a pistol, has the highest mobility and is the fastest during entry, but isn't the best at range- Assaulter : Guy with the guns. Basically, guy that shoots all the baddies for you.- Breacher : As the name implies, he breaches door ways, clear rooms, and corridors in hasty manner. I like to call him ""Hobo with a Shotgun""- Shield : The guy that you would want to bring when the baddies bring their big guns.- Stealth : Shhhh... I'm trying to think of a description for this one... Damn it, keep quiet! I'm trying to think!Weapons range from simple submachine guns such as the MP5A3 to meaner rifles like the G36C to a punch in the face like the Mossberg 590.Sidearms ? No problem! Glocks, 1911s, and P226s, anything is in store! Just need to trade in your gold stars!Oh, we got loads of equipments, Flashbang, Breaching Charges, Tasers, even a little handheld machine that allows you to picklock faster!So as you can see, this game is completely tacticool...WHAT? NOT ENOUGH!? Bruh, I'm done. I got nothing else. You can go watch them YouTube videos and find them all out on your own. I ain't gonna tell you everything man.Oh, but you want the know the truth !? YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.Anyways, I love this game. One of my favourite games, as you can see, spent over 100 hours on this thing.If I could rename my girlfriend, I would name her ""Window Smashers"".Thank you for reading my Review. It's probably too long, but heck. At least I got it out there, right ?			"

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is one of the most extreme tactical SWAT games I have ever played. It offers hugely evolving gameplay and a load of weapon combinations to suit your playstyle. You will be able to use armories from multiple countries (Germany, France, UK, US, etc.) and also have different forms of each weapon (Silences, or non-silenced) for you to be able to in stealthily or blow your way into the enemy lines. You will also have the option of creativity as each time you do a mission you will want a new strategy, and it allows you to have multiple ways of getting into a room, from pick-locking a door to blowing it down with C4 or shottgunning the lock. You will also enjoy the challenging gameplay of only having a limited amount of men and will likely be outnumbered, forcing you to strategize and plan instead of rushing them like it's a Third-person shooter.Also note this game is being created by a small, indie team. So you will not get updates every other day, but it seems so far they have been having extremely large updates every two weeks, which likely means they love there buyers so much they are over working themselves.If you have the money, and enjoy planning and then watching your men burst in and dominate the enemy or have one thing go wrong and watch your team get slaughtered, then buy the game. It's fairly cheap and really innovative to the market, it's also in early access so there is so much more to come and it's completely playable and almost bug free in its current state. "

												I couldn't expect something amazing due to tons of mediocre indie-games nowdays, but this one, GOD...9.5/10Pros:- music is just brilliant = 40% of whole atmosphere (like Payday 1/2)- very rich tactics- really fast and smooth client- simultaneously shutting down 4 enemies by 4 troopers spawns huge 0rgasm. Sadly, this is not a joke :(- tons of missions and ways to complete them. I mean, TONS- slick and easy UI- mods support- mission generator + built-in mission maker + possibility to share it- this is how every Warhammer40k tactical game should look like, just change the skin and you got mindbreaking legendary crusadeCons:- lack of narrative briefing for missions like story, characters and intrigue (remembering Gunpoint), just short descriptions- when multiple troopers paths are crossed it is becomes too hard to micro-command like look there, step here- RNG sometimes looks weird, like one try you one-shot everything and another one you're wasting whole magazine for one guy- sometimes your troopers AI just stuck stopping your unit before some doors- I know this is not the core, but I guess with some gorgeous graphics engine it would look just marvellous. Anyway, these guys did so amazing game, it's just very good VS best.Verdict:It was long time ago since I was so satisfied with some game. For tactics genre this title has everything, this is how small team stomps most of AAA brands.			"

												* 5 Trooper Classes plus Sniper (Mission Dependent)* 70+ Weapons and Gear Items* Six Campaigns (Perma-death)* 80 Independent Missions* Viewable Replays* Global and Individual Stat Tracking* Cross Platform Import/Export Saves* Mission Generator* Level Editor* Steam Workshop* 43 Achievements* 8 Different Trading Cards* No SympathyDoor Kickers harks back to a time when gamers were thought to be intelligent. A little bit of information is given to the player about gameplay mechanics and the rest is left up to them to figure out through trial and error. This, in part, is why there's no ""do it this way to win"" approach to informing the player. Inspired by the planning stages of Rainbow Six, with a SWAT aesthetic, and turned into a feature length game, it all makes sense. A player must learn to play the game much like they must learn to understand how to deal with the situation in which their troopers find themselves. Or be left to suffer the consequences. Although it's possible to make arrests and to subdue assailants with a taser, that's not where the emphasis lies. The opponents you're dealing with are all presumed to be heavily armed and willing to kill you on site based on the knowledge that they most likely already have. Once you understand that, the gear and equipment options available in-game will make a lot more sense. That is why this game is more comparable to Rainbow Six than Swat 3 or 4. It's not about getting a conviction but dishing out the punishment because the verdict has already been made.I highly recommend this game. But that recommendation entirely depends on the type of gamer you are. This game is for the thinker. Sometimes you'll make a plan that will take a few seconds and so will the mission. Other times, you'll spend a few hours only for the mission to fail. It's not the game's fault, nor is it yours. That's just a harsh reality and simply a matter of learning from such mistakes. If you want mindless satisfaction, are looking for a game that plays itself, or were born yesterday, this is not the game for you. This game is a challenge, your enjoyment will entirely depend on whether or not you'll accept it as such and rise to the occasion. So the question is: do you accept the challenge?			"

												Doorkickers is a 2D, Top Down tactical strategy game with real-time and pause. This title has been on my radar for a very long time and I decided to pick it up during summersale. Now I have finally played it and I have to say that it's great!If you enjoy games like Xcom you will most likely have fun with doorkickers, or if you have an interest in swat games and tactics planning. This game have so many levels and challenges you can complete. Also there's a story, although it felt just like the normal quick games I would say. You can also create your own maps and download others for unlimited fun! Save hostages, kill bad guys and capture wanted criminals. Its intense at times but it's always fun to play!Doorkickers comes with all the neat steam features like achievement, steam cloud, etc. Game runs well and you have a good options menu. You level up your soldiers in game and unlock new classes and weapons.This game is great and I would strongly recommend everyone to at least try it out at some point. This is one of the only good games that came out of early access!			"

												This game is top notch! If you loved the Rainbow Six series and SWAT 4, you'll probably love this even more. Fan of RTS and action games, you must give this one a shot. This is basically one of those games where it gets better and better as you get used to the mechanics and unlock new stuff.Door Kickers is a tactical RTS game where you take control of a SWAT team and save the day through hostage rescue missions, bomb defusal missions, VIP escorts and everything else a SWAT-based game should have. The game can be played either by planning everything at the start of a level and watch as the team executes your orders (Rainbow Six style) or by taking control of your units in real-time. You can also do both, since the action can be paused at any time (recommended for starters).PROS+ Tactical SWAT gameplay at its finest. Assign equipment to each unit, plan and execute any way you want; easy to pick up and play.+ Many guns to choose from and different classes each with their own advantages and disadvantages.+ Very high replayability: lots of individual and varied missions, campaigns, map editor, random mission generator and great mod support.+ Awesome soundtrack and clean graphics that match the atmosphere of the game.+ Still gets updated with additional free content and bug fixes.CONS- Slightly frustrating at times- Some Workshop mods may be incompatible because of the new updates.Personal rating: 9/10 "

												Pros+solid gameplay+passable sound effects+good level design, and distinguishable terrain. You won't get confused as to what's what. Very useful for this type of game+Ability to plan out the execution of an entire mission, and watch your men methodically carry it out in seconds.+Ai works well at following said plan  +Customization: Lots of gear to choose from and unlock.+Level designer/randomizer: Unlimited replayabilityCons- A little bit pricey for my taste. I prefer $10-15 at most for an indie game of this quality- Still a few bugs to iron out- Can get hard to plan moves for your last member on your team, as the order lines stack up Techical issues-Can't seem to plan my men to swap their weapons twice during the planning phase. I can tell my men at a certain point to pull out their secondaries, but I'm unable to tell them to swap back. I have to wait till they actually change weapons to order them swap back at a later time. Can be annoying when trying to unlock achievements for each level.-Unable to hide other units command lines during planning phase. When you have commands issued for a large amount of soldiers, it looks like pasta all over the place. Can make it very hard to issue orders to the last soldier on your squad. -Sometimes I want to order a certain swat member to throw a flash bang through a door, but a nearby teamate stacked on the door recieves the order instead. The game needs a toggle function for ordering stacked teamates to do something instead of the default choice. -When cancelling a command, it sometimes does not dissapear, making you have to backtrack your soldiers moves a good bit to fix it, or restart them completely.Rating: 8.5/10===========Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Sound effects: 7/10Ai: 9/10Replayability: 10/10 "

												it's pretty obvious that the best way to kill terrorists is by kicking doors down. they get real scared by that stuff. following on from that, door kickers is a game where you kick doors down and then save hostages/clear houses of terrorists. I am being unnecessarily facetious here, it's a really fun game but it's really difficult as well. if you like XCOM and stuff then you'll enjoy this game. also this game is better than real life because my mum and dad only let me open and close doors, not kick em or blow them up. life sucks huh.

Product received for free
												I got this game as a birthday present from a distant friend. He knew my passion for strategy and planning.It is hard to add to the many other positive reviews. On the plus side, this game is well-thought, simple, and yet it allows for various degrees of sophistication. In particular, I like the opportunity to try different gaming styles (planner, aggressive, solo, non-lethal, etc.). This adds to a high degree of replayability, with achievements that will satisfy all the min-maxers around the globe. Another praiseworthy feature is the possibilty to download further content, both official and user-generated.On the aesthetic side, scenarios are pleasing to the eye and graphics are detailed without overworking the engine (as it is expected in such 2D map games).I didn't really like the star system, becaue it rewards timekeepers over perfectionists. Moreover, it makes it very easy to access powerful gear very early in the game, but apparently that's also true for real life: some of the most effective guns in the world are not the most expensive, and have been around for ages. Random mission generator is a bit boring, though, and this game's strength are the campaign and official missions, each of them with their own peculiarity (storming the embassy, freeing a cruise ship, boarding a plane, etc.). In my version of the game I miss a ""shuffle"" button for randomly generated maps: this means I have to enter and exit the menu to generate new keys and new scenarios. Finally, although background audio effects are interesting at first, they become repetitive quite soon.Overall, my judgement is more than positive, because the pros clearly outweight the few cons of the game. My congratulations to all developers, artist, and producers for such a neat product. Also, a big thank you to Texisthelex for having sent me this gift.			"

								This game is ♥♥♥♥ing sick. The gameplay is smooth and the actions percise. This game is a great way to teach people to watch their sectors at all times and to stay alert. Using real world tactics in this game does actually benefit and it makes you look even more badass in the replays. Even in alpha I find this addictive and fun and the editor and generator is a great way to extend replayability. Keep up the good work devs.			"

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is a great game and has the makings of a great CQB training aid.  The survival of your officers is heavily based on your ability to control your tactical angles.  Real tactics, techniques, and procedures work (for the most part).  As an added bonus, you can create videos of your playthroughs, which you can then edit and use it to help train your team, whether it be a video game clan, paintball, airsoft, or even actual military and law enforcement.  By having a clear display of each officer's field of view, you can accurately portray sectors of fire and emphasize an understanding of the importance of angles.  Add to this that you can create your own levels with nothing more than some photo editing software, and you have the ability to create any training aid or game level you wish, complex or simple.Currently, this game is in Alpha.   Right now, the game has a feel of many Android or Apple games, with a bunch of sequentially harder scenarios that you attempt to earn three stars on.  Time is the primary factor for achieving the three stars, which is somewhat counter to how a SWAT team actually acts.  Slow and safe is often preferred to fast and loose.  Things have gotten a bit deeper as the game has progressed through its Alpha stage, with the addition of different classes, levels of armor, rank progression of your officers, and training unlocks.  Updates have come at a very steady pace, and have consistantly added new great features that make me happy I bought the game.This game can be as simple or as complex as you want to make it.  Do you want to intricately plan out your entire team's movement with go codes and then press play and see what happens?  Or do you want to work through the scenario as it plays out, pausing and unpausing to make changes on the fly or control an officer's field of fire directly?  Either way works, and it's up to you.This game is so much fun.  You can run through a quick scenario to get your fix, or you can try for the best score on a hard level for hours.  With new scenarios being added constantly by the community, and the ability to create random missions from any map, you have an endless amount of replay value.			"

YouTube™ Video: Door Kickers Review 

			Views: 1,101		

			We take a look at the tactical real time strategy game Door Kickers. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

Door Kickers is a very interesting top down tactical real time strategy game where you control a team of SWAT agents with the task of eliminating groups of terrorists who are held up in a variety of increasingly difficult and hostile scenarios. The game offers a large amount of depth and content with fully customizable SWAT team, weapons, gear, and classes. The game shines in the planning stage where you are put in control of laying out the exact movements and actions of each SWAT agent, choose whether to go in guns blazing and blast down the door, or take a more stealthy approach and use spy cams to monitor your enemy’s movements before entering. You can take as many or as few times as you wish to pause the game on the fly mid action and adjust your plans to adapt to the hectic battlefield that unfolds as your agents press forward into the enemies territory; however, by far the most satisfying and rewarding part of the game is when you preplan and successfully defeat all the enemies in single attempt without pausing to adjust. The game has a very satisfying level of difficulty that will definitely force you to retry missions multiple times until you learn from your mistakes, which at times may feel frustrating due to the varying random difficulty spikes that you will encounter, but this only adds more to the level of satisfaction you will feel when you successfully complete the mission. Upon completion of a mission you are scored by a 3 star system that varies based on your performance, the stars you earn are then used as the currency to upgrade your gear and purchase new weapons. The game features a ton of playable content, offering tons of levels to play in single player, campaign, and both a level and mission editor to create your own levels and share them via Steam Workshop Mods. The game offers an incredibly high amount of content and depth with a very high replay-ability value, the game is truly an indie gem that has done an excellent job at captivating the feel from the Rainbow Six series and bringing it to 2014. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/ "

												A hostage crisis in the suburbs. The troopers move up to the entrance cautiously, wary of potential threats in the vicinity.You stack up against the door. Your teammate moves to the front, his Kimber drawn. You have the advantage of marksmanship, training and skill and you both know it. But you are still up against many.You take a deep breath and blast off the door handle with your Mossberg. the door swings open and your teammate fires 3 well placed shots. A body hits the ground.""THE COPS ARE HERE"" rings down the hallway and you hear the mulitple doors opening and closing.Your heart pounds furiously.No time or chance to back down, and you charge into the lion's den, sending the first hostile you see down with a single blast of 00.Simply put, this game is like Rainbow Six from a real-time-strategy/top-down perspective, where you control SWAT troopers as they conduct raids against criminals and terrorists.Each game is highly lethal, and most demand a certain time limit to be met, most of which happens to be a minute or two. Every move you take requires very careful planning.Is there a blind spot unaccounted for?Is there someone covering me?Is someone's line of sight blocked by another, possibly endangering both?Your operators are well trained and will easily take down multiple hostiles at once, but they aren't God. A single fatal mistake in planning or an unprecendented move by a hostile will more often than not lead to their swift and violent demise, whether it's a burst of MAC-10 fire from the side or single 7.62mm round from a AK-47.In a game where every second counts you have to get used to controlling every operator at any point in time. Watching flanks, breaching rooms, using tactical manoeuvres to clear, all have to be done in a single fluid motion. On drug busting operations prepare to launch a 6 man offensive on an entire port, where you have to simultaneously control all your fireteams and keep them alive, and secure the evidence before the cartel gets a chance to destroy it.Your classes are clearly defined. The Pointman, who is extremely mobile and deadly in tight spaces but will easily get swamped by numbers. The Assault, who can both be a close quarter fire-hose with a submachine gun for laying accurate and well controlled bursts or a mid-range specialist with an assault rifle, dishing out accurate semi automatic fire that stops people in their tracks, but lose your close range mobility and versatility.The Breacher who can blast doors open and engage multiple enemies with buckshot but quickly get outgunned at mid-ranges and risk collateral damage from the pellet spread.The Stealth who are good mid range specialists who will put hostiles to sleep silently but will lose their edge in closer engagements.The Shield who can block most incoming shots but can only use a pistol and may not have the mobility in close spaces or the accuracy for long escort missions.Skill is required to make the best out of every trooper you train for every situation and make sure everyone comes out alive.You spend more time planning alone than executing, and you will get frustrated sometimes from the frequent restarting but every completed mission grants a never-ending sense of pride.PROS:1. Excellent AI. Troopers are not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will react to defend themselves and hostiles will actively flank and investigate sources of noise.2. Tight map design that pose a challenge to players3. Customisation is well-controlled and delivered with a clear focus on maximising the trooper's usability on the field over the simple mindless pimp-your-gun-to-be-special attachment chucking we see in many other games4. Price. I got this on sale for a measly 3 bucks and it's been worth every penny.5. Comprehensive controls and a decent How-to guide for quickly jumping in.6. Minimalistic UI that tells you what you need and what you need alone and great graphics.7. Immersive atmosphere that gets your heart pumping every time a raid is initiated and keeps you coming back for more.8. A decent bare-bones progression system that rewards you with better troop quality for future raids but doesn't go as far as to become a grindfest.9. As if the above aren't enough there is workshop content with plenty of diversity. Want a new scenario? Try a pirate ship raid. Want to satisfy your gun fetish? Get mods that increase the number of weapons available at your disposal.CONS:1. An unforgiving currency (star) system that renders you in a tight spot if you make a costly mistake in your investment, where you potentially lose the ability to progress yet are unable to earn more to buy the gear you need.

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is a Indie, Simulation, and Strategy game developed by the folks over at Killhouse Games. It was added to steam on September 3rd, 2013. The game features a mix of real time strategy with a tactical stop and go pause mode that allows you to analyze situations, and make your plans for each map. There is a small amount of customization in the current build of the game but that is simply due to the early access nature of the game. The gameplay is pretty great, however it can be rage inducing at times. The main idea is to kill the bad guys and have at least one of your own team mates left standing at the end. In some cases there are hostages to rescue which can put a timer on the level. All the levels can be completed in a small time window . Ultimately you want to play a level as fast as possible with little to no casualties. The game is a early access game and thus has many features missing. With that said the game is great as it is right now. Of course a few flaws that I’m not sure are bugs or overlooked design. For example there are times when I open a door and my character is looking directly at a person and will mow them and 3 other people down without being shot. Then there are times where the same guy will open the door and sing love songs to the enemies and thus getting domed (shot in the mother♥♥♥♥ing skull). It feels like r.n.g and less bug but who am I to say. This was the only real issue I had with the game. Especialy on the one level at the beach where I had one guy left, and there was one enemy left. My guy opens the door to the bathroom and both the ai and my character stand their in a stand off for about fifteen seconds before the ai shoots my guy in the face…..The levels can be played in many ways, the best is just to find a style that suits you. For most of my levels I set a path for my guys to run and it worked. I very rarely had to pause the game after my initial plan. However if you want you can breach doors. After breaching a room, you can pause the room to setup what to do next. The breaching, and or DOOR KICKING is the core of the game. You have several ways to breach. You can just kick a door in and hope your guys don’t get blasted before they can see through the door. You can also breach with a flashbang where they open a door and throw a flashbang in. Again however if your guy is standing directly infront of the door you risk getting shot and killed so it is best to do it from the side. Then there is the breaching charge where you setup a charge on the door and can detonate it. This stuns most of the people in the room giving you an advantage. You can also use a snake cam to see under the doors. The game has no multiplayer but the developers say it MIGHT come later. The game also has a mission editor , however I did not play around with that yet. It does mean the game will have many mods and games with mods are always better because of it! The game as single player is a lot of fun and I definitely suggest anyone who likes tactical strategy games to make this purchase. The game is worth every god damn dime. As far as early access games go this is one of the better ones on steam. I will of course do a re-review of the game upon full release of the game. You want a score don’t you? WELL F&CK YOU! … No seriously here is my score for the early access of Door Kickers. Door Kickers gets a Drastik Measure 8.2 (82)			"

												Started playing Nov 2015.Easy to pick-up and play, very difficult to master. I was not expecting so many missions and so many weapon choices, its very impressive. Its fun taking different approaches to missions and the good kind of trail & error towards finishing each level. Eventually you may become good enough to beat any level in just the planning stage, before it has played out in real time. Its a great accomplishment.Some missions require a bit of luck, and occasionally death/failure feels cheap. But you can always make your own missions if you get sick of the hundreds of dev made levels and campaigns.			"

												I'll admit, I haven't gotten very far, but the bit of it I did play was exceptionally good for what its supposed to be. The controls do seem to be a bit difficult to master, but at least for the simple mechanics, you do catch on quickly.The action is quite tactical, no nonsense. I definitely get the feeling that there is an incredible amount of depth in the game, and already I'm looking forward to playing again.The built in mod-ability and mission generation, combined with the fact that the game is built around its solid mechanics (rather than any sort of linear narrative) seems to ensure that the ""dollars spent"":""hours of fun"" ratio is quite favorable.

 < Disclaimer!! I got this game for free for reviewing purposes > A tactical strategy game that you can play in 2 modes, Real-Time or Planning Mode ( Kinda like transistor ) and kicking doors never been so funThe game has a very large set of levels and its possibly endless, Around 80+ levels on Single Missions, And Also a lot of levels On campaign mode, And a lot of community created maps (Via level editor) And Theres also a Random Mission Generator which is really cool!.you choose the map size the scenario and the difficulty, so yeah I meant it when I said Endless...But the fun does not last that long well it depends on your taste, gonna get to this in a moment.You can customize every Swat member of yours, changing their gear and what not, Changing from assaulter to breacher and stealth or point-man Pistols, or pistols+rifles or shotguns or swat shield...etc.Fun to use equipment's, such as a spy-cam to peak through a door and you move it left or right, or a breaching charge to plant on a door and blow it up to knockdown/kill enemies, And of course flash bangs, Stingers and more.On each level you get stars which you can use to unlock more Equipment's , Stronger/heavier shields or armors or weapons just an example.I really like the game control, You can assign your units to ( A(alpha) B(Beta) C(Charlie) D(Delta) ) And assign plans to each which they will execute after you press the assigned button on UI or keyboard, Really good to coordinate your unit movements ( Shields first, snipers last) and execute the perfect plan which takes some serious thinking.At some levels you also get a sniper that auto-locks on targets on your sight, You can press Tab to order him to switch to another target and S to take the shot.The enemy responds are pretty clever, they don't just mess around, you'd usually need to flashbang them or flank them or use any method to distract them to avoid allied losses.The game music is very good and gives you the mood to focus on your plans, or pumps you up to go break sh*t and kill everyone.Game levels are pretty great, Although there are a lot of levels you don't see them getting repeated.Game difficulty is pretty hard, And keeps getting harder as you go on.Single Mission Mode, Is a set of 80+ levels that you play each with its mission and different level layout, You could skip the first ones and jump to the last.Campaign mode, Has no story its just a set of levels that you keep on playing with limited swat units, when you finish a level with some causalities they don't come back in the next level so you have to be careful and usually restart when they die, Around 5 Campaigns each is about 4 to 9 Levels, with completely different layouts, It also has the caption ( More to come ) so thats good I guess, they want to add more.Leveling up your squad to the next level gets you access to the next Class ( Which I mentioned earlier the Stealth or Breacher .. etc ) Apparently there are (Doctrines) points that you get awarded by leveling up your squad level, And use them in a Skill-Tree to give you more abilities and accuracy and more.Of-course you level up by receiving the exp award at the end of every level.The game has a lot of achievements, At first they are easy to obtain but the later ones are pure hell this is fun for grinders.Level editor is easy to use, And power it with your imagination, Create a hostage rescue, Annihilation, DrugBust, Arrest, Robbery, Vip Secure, Stop the execution And of-course Defuse the bomb.2 mods that already exists that adds some levels and a few stuff ( Christmas mod, Template mod )  The Other SideSo now after all the good has been said let me tell you about the other side.Although the game is really good it has its own fair share of cons.Sometimes my units becomes dull and throws the bomb although I specifically stopped the action by pressing the delete icon, and sometimes they also become very slow to react when an enemy appear that i'v been waiting for, takes them time to take the shot and sometimes they'd kill my units before they even reacted to seeing them, I don't know if this is how the game wants it to be just saying.I really dislike it when a unit throws a Bomb it has to wait before making a move, I understand that's how it works in reality but most of the time the delay backfires because it reaches them after the effect of the Flash-bang wore off, and it goes there to die.Some levels are fairly hard and others are insanely unfair and frustrating, reach the point where you just keep on doing it again and again and again and going full-throttle until your units mans up and takes the shot accurately and miraculously you win.Reason why I said ( Apparently there are doctrine points ) Its because I saw it the first time I launched the game but forgotten about it, And the game has no hints or anything to show me or remind me to use it in main-menu, I was missing around my rank and accidentally saw it lol... Which brings me to the next point.Lack of tutorials, I don't mind this but if you are the type that wont go without them just a heads-up (There is a how to play guide)Units becomes stupid when they collide with each other, they just stop and do not perform their next action instead of turning around the unit or object.There is a bugged level in campaign which made it impossible to me to finish the 2nd one ( so I skipped to the next one ) In which a mission where I'm supposed to secure the VIP and bring him back to the safe zone, And usually killing all hostiles gets the job done and leaving no need to get the hostages but this one required it, So I go set next to him so he'd follow me but he never did, Played it around 9 times already and never got to finish it....was incredibly frustrating.LIKE I mentioned at the beginning of the review after a while the game may gets boring depends on your taste.As for me after around 7 hours I started getting really bored, Although the game has a lot of different levels, The feeling stays the same, Be careful and quick to finish the mission blah blah, Gets a bit boring in my own opinion, They should'v made a way to spice it up with more challenges and stuff, Again thats just me, There are people who played this for over 25+ hours and did not complain at all.If you don't want to read all that PROS : 1 - Tactical-type game that requires strategy and thinking, Difficult but fun.2 - A lot of levels to play, And a random mission generator, Campaigns and Community Maps.3 - A lot of Weapons, Utilities (Gadgets) And support gear to unlock.4 - Customizing every unit in every mission to make it best suitable for the current level.5 - A lot of achievements to grind on, Trading cards and Steam-Cloud.6 - Great game music and sound effects, gets that thinking mode of yours pumping.CONS : 1 - Sometimes it gets kinda frustrating on how some levels are ridiculously difficult compared to later ones.2 - A few clunkiness in character movements colliding with each other and slow reactions in some cases.3 - A few bugs I found on certain levels which made some impossible to finish and the rest just 10 times harder.Also something I really liked about the game.The terrorists are not portrayed as Arabs, They always make terrorists in video games to look and sound like Arabs *cough*Cs*Cough* and more games ... It frustrates me makes me feel discriminated against sometimes although i love those games, BUT it was really refreshing and nice to see a game that made a different approach.TL;DRA game for the tactical shooter fans, definitely worth its full price, Hard as HELL and takes some LONG♥♥♥♥♥time to complete, and even longer to 100%, And to get all the level ups and unlock everything, i'd say 30+ hours.Very fun game Although this review might not show it but I enjoyed it a lot 8/10			"

												This is strategy at its core! The tactical options are amazing while the controls are kept fairly simple as opposed to, say, Frozen Synapse. I think it cuts all the necessary clutter for this to be on of the best tactical games of recent times, and the power you feel while your masterplan unfolds is tremendous. Fan of any tactical games, Rainbow Sixes, SWATs or the like? Play this!			"

												Best tactics in 2014 for a reason. Recommended and gifted by a ""friend"" of mine (Nanamil) in return for all my collected Friendship tokens. It's a simple but challenging game from the topdown perspective in wich you take the role of a squad leader guiding a good amount of S.W.A.T's through an almost endless amount of levels (thanks to Steam's Workshop)- each one different in artstyle, size, and possible ways to accomplish the goal.""But whats the goal?"" you might ask now and I dont even feel ashamed saying that its cliche Counter -Terrorist missions such as bomb defusal, hostage rescuing, eliminating all hostiles etc... But in this game it feels more satisfying than in most games that tried to be tactical or stealth in the past few years (no matter if Topdown, Fps, Third-person ) and thats why I can highly recommend it to a wide range of gamers...those who love Real-Time-Strategy but also those who love stealth or action in general. Its some of the best games for a quick casual ""turn-your-head-off"" after work / school and kills all the boredom. And for me it's just even more motivation that most achievments are more of rewards for actually good playing rather than grinding and more grinding and more grinding... Since I believe this game could run on ANY PC out there you dont need to worry about your Rig...just enjoy it if you like ~5 bucks for many hours of fun seems like a good deal, eh? :P "

												Cops & Robbers is one of the all-time classic games of make-believe; the eternal battle between good and evil, played out in every playground for generations. And it doesn't stop there – we grow up, but the primal attraction of that conflict never leaves us, and we replace pointed fingers and 'pew pew' noises with films, books, and video games.Door Kickers is one of those video games. Developed by KillHouse Games, its top-down tactics and emphasis on planning invite comparisons to those games that have best captured the sense of modern day Cops & Robbers; the SWAT series, and Rainbow Six, before Vegas went and ruined everything. It's been in Early Access for quite a while, but has seen a great deal of community feedback and development as a result. Now that it's reached full release status, how does it hold up against its peers?Be under no illusions – this is no arcade-style run & gun. Door Kickers lets you plan an entire mission in advance and, once the action gets going, you have free use of the pause feature to adjust things on-the-fly. Don't think this makes things easy though – this is a brutally difficult game from the very start, and will not tolerate the impatient or imprecise. You may be in command of a highly-trained squad of police officers, but you're never more than one forgotten corner, or one misplaced order away from an abrupt, messy death, and a mission restart. This is a game that teaches the player with quick but violent lessons; assume there are enemies everywhere, move cautiously using cover, and always, always check those corners.Things aren't helped by the often questionable AI of your officers. I often found them spotting an enemy, but then ignoring them – sometimes turning their backs on them entirely, and necessitating my manual intervention to force them to engage. This isn't a novel problem; in Frozen Synapse, if you want a unit to forget about enemies and just hustle, you must specifically order that unit to ignore threats. Here, though, you must specify if you want an officer to wait until there are no living enemies. When gun-toting criminals can ruin your day in seconds, it just feels like the wrong way around.When it does go right, though, it's a fantastic experience; an orgy of meticulously-executed violence, taking place in mere seconds. I rarely make use of replay features in games, but here I found myself re-watching successful missions just to bask in the glory of the perfect plan.Rather than giving you a random bunch of men for each mission, Door Kickers gives you a permanent squad, with each officer earning their own experience points. Customisation is surprisingly comprehensive, allowing you to change the name, appearance, and loadout of each member of the team. Initially, the selection of equipment is limited, but you can unlock more by playing through missions and earning points. Many of the missions, especially later ones, are simply too difficult without equipment upgrades, so there's a strong incentive to perfect the early scenarios and gear up as much as possible. Successful missions also earn 'doctrine points,' which you can spend on skill upgrades which apply to everyone in your team – these cover things like accuracy improvements, and new tactics. Sadly, while doctrine points can be re-specced, there's no way to 'buy back' points spent on equipment. This is especially frustrating given that grinding missions does not earn you more points – there are a maximum of 3 points to be earned, total, in any scenario. If you buy some gear and then realise you need something else for a later mission, you're stuffed.Missions are split into three campaigns and a huge selection of standalone scenarios. In practice, the campaigns are little more than several missions strung together, offering no real plot, but with the added difficulty of dead officers staying dead for the duration of the campaign, so you'll want to play it safe with your best troopers.The missions themselves vary from basic room-to-room clearing, through hostage-rescue or bomb-defusal scenarios, to the excellent drug busts, in which you must collect evidence while enemies scramble to destroy it. There's also a competent random mission generator, and a robust level editor with Steam Workshop support, in case you exhaust the 100+ levels on offer, so replayability is a big draw.Once you get into a mission, the big draw of Door Kickers is the planning interface. A much-loved feature of classic tactical games, it allows you to plan – in theory – an entire mission in advance. Then it's just a matter of hitting play and watching your squad do the dirty work. In practice, once you're past the first two or three missions, it's almost impossible to do the whole thing in one go if you want to prevent the wholesale slaughter of your hapless officers. In particular, it's impossible to use the 'magic wand' (a camera on a stick) in an automated plan, since it requires manual control to scan a room – never mind the fact that you inexplicably can't use it to peek around corners.Between the enjoyable gameplay, appealing visuals, and the return of mission planning, it's difficult not to recommend Door Kickers to anyone with enough patience to tolerate the difficulty curve.

												In the search for the ideal top-down tactical shooter, I've tried Hotline Miami (too twitchy), Forzen Synapse (too random), Monaco (close, but too gimmicky), and recent XCOMs (on the abstract side). None of them quite scratch the itch created by Julian Gollop games. Until Door Kickers.The heart of the game is a series of buildings your SWAT team must clear of bad guys. Sometimes there's another objective such rescuing hostages or collecting evidence before the suspects can destroy it. These require various tactics and give the game flavor. But the core remains moving from one room to the next shooting people who are trying to shoot you.Every character possesses some level of agency. Enemies (AKA, tangos) respond to sounds and other cues in reasonable ways. For instance, they might turn to face the door your pointman is forcing. Alternatively, they might decide to shoot the hostages or destroy the evidence. Your operators might ignore orders in order to respond to immediate threats. In fact, you don't order them to fire at all; you tell them where to go and they just take care of business.As a result, you can set up a plan at the start of a level and let the game play itself. I know that sounds boring, but it really isn't. Plans involve dozens of little decisions, such as how to breach a door, where to toss a flashbang, when to turn to check a hallway and so on. You can charge though most levels with a lone shooter (there are achievements for it) or carefully coordinate a full team with go signals. If your plan works, the payoff is a minute or two of perfectly choreographed violence.Truthfully, however, perfect planning doesn't happen the first time around. More often I need to adjust because I failed check a blind spot or I blundered into shotgun crossfire. Plans can be redrawn on the fly or you can pause the action to give yourself time to think. Immediately after completion of a level, I find myself restarting it so that I can fine tune the plan.There is an overarching game of unlocking tactics, roles and armament. Faster times unlock up to three stars for buying new guns, body armor and equipment. Officers earn experience points which open up new roles (assaulter, breacher, stealth and shield) and tactics. Missions can technically be played in any order, but the effect of the leveling system is to gate off more difficult levels. Skipping missions or forgetting to upgrade increases the challenge quickly.On the other hand, once you have a stronger team, it's rewarding to go back to earlier levels and get an improved result. In addition, campaigns are unlocked once your squad levels up to a certain point. However, don't think of campaigns as stories since they are just missions strung together to force you to pay the consequences for deaths and injuries. I'd complain campaigns are too shallow if I weren't excited to play new maps.Not that there's any lack of maps. In addition to 84 single missions and 6 campaigns, there are user-created missions for download and a map generator. These mean you will never need to play the same mission over again, but they also highlight the skill of official level designers. Levels designed by other users are wildly inconstant in challenge and quality. The generated levels can be anywhere from boring to near impossible depending on which settings you use and how the random number generator rolls.In the final analysis, Door Kickers provides copious amounts of tactical decision making with simple controls and plenty of chrome.

One of the best real-time tactics games on Steam.Having finished all of the single missions and all of the campaigns, both in Normal and in Iron Man, I believe I'm in a position to write a few things about this game. I don't usually write Steam reviews, but Door Kickers is a special game that deserves recommendation. As someone who is very interested in tactical gaming, the top-down tactics offered by this game are very enjoyable.The game gives you control over a team of SWAT operators and tasks you with defeating the bad guys and completing missions such as rescuing hostages, arresting a suspect, securing evidence, preventing escape of the suspects or escorting a VIP. There are different ways to play the game, but the way I play it (and I guess the most obvious style of play) is real-time with pause. The way I usually do the missions is like this: I draw actions for my troopers, let them play out those actions, pause, assess the situation and then plan my next move. You can also play the game in 100% real-time or even prepare the entire mission in the planning phase if you want. It's a lot more difficult and challenging to do, but the option is there. There is no 'true' method of playing the game.It's a challenging game. The guns are deadly. That goes both ways. If you don't want any of your troopers to get killed in one or two shots, you better make sure that you watch your sectors and assume that there is danger around every corner. The game mercilessly punishes you for your mistakes, but the rules are fair and if you lose a trooper it's almost always due to your own mistake.Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be given to Door Kickers is the fact that a number of real-life tactics can be applied to it, and that these are often the most effective. The best way to clear a simple room is the way real operators often do it: stack your troopers near the door, open or breach it, throw a flashbang (tip: use them excessively), enter the room, establish points of domination along the nearest wall(s) and let your troopers shoot all of the bad guys in their own respective sector. Take a look at the top-down illustrations in this military field manual[www.globalsecurity.org]. Some of the tactics that are shown in that chapter actually work in Door Kickers. That is an impressive feat, and it highlights the developer's understanding of real-world CQC fights and tactics. Because of this, Door Kickers is arguably one of the more realistic small-scale tactics games there are.It's not without flaws. From time to time, your troopers will make a stupid mistake which may get one of them killed, such as when they accidentally throw a grenade against the wall instead of into the room. And they cannot perform certain basic tasks like leaning and crouching, though that might have been a design decision. But overall, the controls are very fleshed out and the game is very enjoyable to play as is. It allows a certain degree of freedom in how to approach each situation: your stealth approach doesn't work? Kit out your team with harder-hitting assault rifles. Can't prevent a hostage execution in time? Try a different route or be more aggressive. Having a lot of trouble eliminating an armoured tango? Invest in one of the guns that offer better armour penetration. Or just throw more flashbangs. More flashbangs are always good. Some of the equipment that works in certain situations will not work in other situations, and vice-versa. All of the equipment in the game has utility, although some are more useful than others.Pros: Real-world room clearing fundamentals work (at least some of them). Deadly guns; challenging. Different ways to play. Plenty of content: at the time of writing 84 official missions and 6 campaigns, Iron Man mode, a level editor, mod support and fan-made content. Very suitable for short gameplay sessions. Even if you can't finish a mission in time, at least you've learned a few things about that mission, arming you with knowledge for the next time you go in. Good replay value.Cons: Grenades can only be thrown in a horizontal line. You can't throw one over a wall or a vehicle. Lack of crouch makes it impossible to present a smaller target or move underneath a window without being spotted. Again, may be a design decision. Some of the weapon stats do not always give the player a clear understanding of the weapon's performance.Door Kickers 2 is currently in development, but the first game is still very much worth buying and playing. If you're looking for a good top-down tactics game, look no further.			"

												Do you really like tactical games? This is the game for you. Take control of a SWAT team and take them through various police scenarios such as hostage rescues, imminent hostage executions, drug raids, arrest warrants, and VIP escorts. There are many weapons that have their own individual stats as well as a variety of different equipment from different types of kevlar vests that protect more or less from different angles (front, rear, and sides), to different types of grenades (flashbangs, stun grenades). There's other ways of breaching such as using breaching charges, shotguns, bolt cutters, and much more. This game reminds me of the old Rainbow Six games and the SWAT games as well.			"

												One of the best games i've played in a long time, will be perfect for those nostalgic about the old SWAT games. While being highly addictive, its mechanics are extremely simple and easy to understand. Yet there lies a great challenge in executing them flawlessly, and succeding with your objectives without losing any of your men.Lots of content in it in form of single missions, campaigns, mod support and mission generator, so there's essentially an endless amounts of mission to go on. There's also some basic customization to get you a bit emotionally attached to your men (and women). However it seems that there are no female voices, so females will report in with male voices. No mp or coop yet, but I think they are planning to add that after phone versions release.Sidenote: If you use steam overlay a lot keep in mind that the shift key locks the path, so after you've been to the overlay press shift once to make the controls normal again.

Early Access Review
								REVERSE WARNING: This is actually the only Early Access game that I bought without regretting it later.Door Kickers is a solid top-down 2D tactical SWAT strategy / tactical / shooter title. You draw your troopers' paths with your mouse, place waypoints and commands and then watch the action unfold according to your plan. There is also the option to pause the action in real-time and switch orders on the fly. The game went through many iterations and improvements during early access, both frequent and meaningful in content and changes / fixes.The biggest draws of the game (apart from the obvious - existing in a great genre that is virtually abandoned) is the fact that it has Steam Workshop support and an integrated level editor allowing for infinite content. When the core gameplay mechanics are as polished and as fun, even simple user-made maps can add tons of replayability to a game that is already quite large in beta form.I bought this game in December 2013 and watched it blossom into the beautiful thing it is today, a couple of months before its final release. I recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who is interested in the genre.			"

												This game has been on my wishlist for two holiday sales. Since I usually don't buy any ""wargames"" or straight up shooters I was hesitant to buy it, but finally gave in, when it was 50% off, thinking what's there to loose with the steam refund system?To my astonishment, it's a ""simple"" strategy game and that's just up my alley. Plan your way in with your squad, level them up, get new equipment and defuse dangerous situations: rescue hostages, defuse bombs, kill hostiles, save the day.The game itselfs has a huge amount of levels out of the box and with a superb workshop integration can be expanded indefinitely by community made levels and items. It's also really, really easy to make your own maps as a level editor is already integrated int the game. If you don't want to make anything too fancy (new texture, objects, round rooms) you'll be extremely happy with the in-game options for designing new levels.It really is a steal for any price (if you're looking at this review and the game is also 50% off, don't hesitate and just get it!)Here's the checklist of what you can expect:PROs:+ huge amount of levels+ great replayability (play with different squad members, play with different equipment, play from different entry-zones...)+ adequate learning-curve (easy levels to get used to the mechanics)+ ability to play any level at any chosen time (no unlocking levels, everything is available right from the start, though not every level is a good idea to play right away)+ controls are great with and uncluttered and handy interface+ squad members can be renamed and given their own design+ great steam workshop integration+ integrated level editor+ price for what you get is absolutely adequate+ replay ability from almost any starting point within a levelCONs:- campaign mode needs better warning for what happens to killed squad members (once you've figured it out though, you'll remember forever)- not all stats on items are relevant when equippedOverall: 8/10			"

												Door Kickers is a top down, tactical, strategy, shooter, hybrid developed by Killhouse Games. The core gameplay of Door Kickers is controlling a squad of trained SWAT team members as you clear out various locations, ranging from drug dens to warehouse's. The player can pause the game and enter planing mode. In this mode the player and set where their team will move and face to cover every angle. In this mode the player can also prep their squad to breach doors, throw grenades and set various other orders. Once the player resumes time the team will do the actions in real-time, the squad can also be controlled in real-time. The story comes from the games campaigns. Each campaign has permadeath for the squad members, so if a squad member dies in the first mission, they will not be available for any other mission, unless the first mission is restarted. Multiple campaigns with different difficulties, lengths and missions add a fair amount of replay value to the game. Campaigns, however, are locked until the player reaches a high enough profile level. Door Kickers also comes with single missions, some being training missions but most being more challenging. A random mission generator is also available. The player can choose the size of the map and how difficult it is, adding even more replay value. Door Kickers has various classes to be unlocked, from shields to breacher's, all with their own tools, weapons, and customizable names. There are well over 100 weapons and tools for the various classes. Players can complete missions any way they see fit, charging in with assault rifles and shields or stealthy with suppressed submachine guns. Players have complete control of how they execute a mission. Door Kickers does a fair amount right: Has a large variety of guns and classesHas great replay value from various maps and game modesAddictive Fantastic sound designThe art style fits wellDoor Kickers does a few things wrong: The player must unlock the campaignThe guns can be expensive to unlockDoesn't keep the player interested over timeCan be to easy/hard based on skill levelSurprisingly hard to remain stealthyOverall Door kickers is a solid title. With a price tag of $21.99CND, it is a bit pricy for someone who doesn't commonly enjoy this genre of game. If Door Kickers goes on sale, pick it up and try it out, it's a great deal of fun and great for killing some time. Have a good one ~Doc			"

								Overall the game is solid. It has a lot of potential to be a great game in the long run. The dev's put a lot of attention into it, and there are frequent updates. It's one of the ""good"" early access game on steam.The only thing I would hope to see in the future is a better tutorial system for new players, and more detailed options within  the menus.9/10			"

												So, to begin, I really wanted to like this game from the offset. I love Frozen Synapse and the idea of tactical, top down, squad shooters. I dived in with high expectations from all the praise I saw. The result of this endeavor was to be disappointed more than I have been in a long time by a game. I will say now - the game is solid enough. However, I encountered certain aspects of the gameplay that just broke it for me. Primarily, the lack of any form of viable introduction or tutorial. I know it has some moving pictures and whatnot, but all that it covers is simple enough to figure out on your own. There is no explanation for how to time entries into a room with a flashbang properly, no explanation why equipping weapons to some of the troops just outright doesnt work. The secondary problems are... well... mentioned above. It is a massive hassle to control the squad. There are no elegant mechanics like in Frozen Synapse that allow for a time delay or no-aim movement. It also makes control difficult due to bulky command images that cross over and make clicking on them a chore. A lack of any explanation as to why upgrading your soldiers abilities doesnt seem to transfer into the tactical game also makes the game frustrating. In short, bar the issues above, the game is spot on. Animation, sound, idea, everything. It is just a crying shame that actually playing it felt like work rather than enjoyment. Sadly I didnt enjoy the game at all and wanted to just make sure that the reason is out there.			"

												It's a shame I didn't reviewed this game earlier, cause Door Kickers definitely should be recommended :)About year ago(30.Sep.2013) I got Door Kickers as Early Access game and then I wrote:""Even for Alpha/Early Access Door Kickers looks so promising and fun.What game lacks for now(from my point of view) - non-lethal weapons, handcuffing and negotiating, by ""negotiating"" I mean - trying to force suspects to surrender and if something goes wrong you're free to shoot.In SWAT-2 before entry you have to negotiate with suspects by ""throwing phone"" or calling to the building directly - this gave you time to plan your entry or even trade out hostages.After that you could go dynamic or stealth according to situation, but all time from start to the end you advancing - slow or fast.But the main feature was that all time you was trying to take all suspects alive, save hostages and try to avoid losing officers.If you will add this-like flavor(no need to copy, just give it flavor as you see it), damn I promise that I'll buy second copy @ Steam :D""After a year of development, Dev  Team added all these features, except ""negotiating"", - but that's ok for me. Without this feature Door Kickers plays like R6 and that's not bad at all.Besides, they have added lot of new features:New modes like ""Drug busting"", ""Hostage Rescue"" and etc.Tons of maps.Scenario Editor.Video Export.Three amazing campaigns.Lot of toys for your Good Guys Team.Sniper Assist Workshop intergrationAnd many, many more... :)Anyway, would definetly recommend Door Kickers for anyone who played and liked Rainbow 6(R6: Rogue Spear and R6: Raven Shield) and/or SWAT 2, 3 & 4.

												i was watching some youtube videos and there was this video with the title ""Door Kickers , Suits and Ski masks"" ( Bluedrake's channel ),i watched the video,i thought the game looked cool and ok but i wasn't sure if i should get the it or not...i bought the game during the last sale and it's fantastic,this is one of those games that you have to actually play to realize how good it is,you can read reviews,watch gameplay videos,etc,etc but you'll never get how good it is unless you play it!at first the game starts with really simple and easy missions but as you progress missions keep getting harder and longer and eventually our tactical shooter turns into a puzzle game :| it will get to the point where you have to actually make plans for your every single action,and with each mistake you're risking losing your troops or failing the mission....i'm only half way through the third campaign but the game has already gotten so intense that i actually pause the game,check behind every single door and i think for a few minute trying to make 1 single but successful plan (never works and i end up restarting the level after 10 minutes xD )we're looking at a top-down tactical shooter that despise it's simple mechanics is insanely challenging and fun to play,it's really addictive too,i couldn't stop playing after finishing the first few missions.one of the best indie games that has been released recently with awesome Developers behind it,they update their game frequently with new content and they definitely deserve more attention and support...

Early Access Review
								Executing a perfect hostage rescue with simultaneous door breaches and flashbangs and a synchronized sniper shot through the window feels good. It doesn't even require crazy APM skills!This is a very enjoyable squad tactics singleplayer game, real time with pause for orders. It's like Swat and early Rainbow Sixes combined with Frozen Synapse with a bit of Xcom-like squad development and permadeath. Missions are quick and intensive deathpuzzles with randomized parts and there's already a pretty well functioning random mission generator that's probably going to get even better. The top-down 2D style is neat looking while functional and the environments are nicely detailed.Currently there's about 70 normal (not randomly generated) missions so it's got lots of content. It's already felt like a complete product in alpha and beta so I find it impossible that it would become worse as the development approaches 1.0 and more features are put in. Really good for those 15-minute lunch break-style playing timeslots.			"

												""I love it when a plan comes together!""A mix of Rainbow Six, Swat and Frozen Synapse.I bought this on a hunch, and I was not disappointed.I did not think I would spend this many hours in a game with such simple mechanic.I discovered how challenging and complex it actually is.How satisfying it is when you watch your teams breach and clear rooms with stunning efficiency, and how mad you get when the bad guys put a bullet in one of your operators because you told him to watch the wrong corner.I told you it was more complex than I thought, right?On some of the bigger maps it can sometimes get confusing when your operators movement-lines you draw on the ground get too close to each other. This causes you to adjust the wrong operator sometimes and can be really annoying.I find myself wishing for a feature to temporary hide specific operators lines, so you can adjust that single operator that covers the wrong door in the tangled mess of lines going everywhere. In a future patch maybe!4/5			"

												Best tactical/strategical swat/special forces indie game ever made. I mean - 5-6 full campaigns with different locations, setting, atmosphere, challenges and scenarios - clear the place, rescue hostages, defuse bomb etc etc. 5 classes of operators to choose from, a lot of weapons and gadgets you can select for your most effective equipment for current mission, then you have single missions - over 80+, totally awesome! Pew pew silencers onAnd enemies are spawned by 3-4 scenarios on every map, they never stay the same way, so you have to always check every angle and corner carefully, cause one mistake and they gonna give you a flag on your coffin. And theres editor as bonus and random map generator. 11 out of 10 flashbangs, would kill hostage by accident again.			"

Everything works smoothly and as expected and there is more content than I could have imagined.  I'm not even done with all the single player missions (NOT INCLUDING THE CAMPAIGN), never mind having 3 stars on all of them.  If you're a fan of top down tactics, you can't go wrong with this game.  Pros:Workshop support for extra nostalgia addonsControlsArtContent QuantityContent QualityCons:I can't make a Shield Trooper and another trooper go at the same pace automatically, instead the guy behind winds up walking ahead of the shield so then he gets shot in the face a lot.

												A fun little top-down single-player room clearing game. You usually control a small team, eventually composed of various classes, with a number of tools. You can make elaborate plans and/or clear in real time. Lots of workshop maps. If it's too easy, you can set various challenges for yourself, like tasing and arresting wherever possible instead of shooting, or doing the campaigns with permadeath on for your team members. Seems to be updated periodically. You can pause whenever and leave where you left off, nice when just taking a quick break.TL;DR: It's groovy.			"

Solid tactical gameplay with a great feel to it.The gameplay is divided into two parts, the planning phase and execution phase. The planning allows you to set up waypoints and stops using radio commands. Once in the execution phase you can watch your plan unfold or at any moment take direct control of your men. Add to that troop customization, gadgets, classes and squad perks, and you've got an enjoyable experience at hand.To me the game comes across as polished and well made. I enjoy the graphical style and the sound and atmosphere is good. The big challenge lies in creating a plan that'll allow you to sit back and just watch the execution phase. Difficult, but very satisfying when it works.			"

												Pause. Plan. Execute.The concept is pretty simple to pick up, but difficult to master.  There is nothing more satisfying, however, than watching a plan that you've spent time carefully fine tuning and perfecting to flawlessly be carried out by a squad of 8 who proceed to drop bad guys like its the new fad, save hostages, and defuse bombs; all of which occurs in a matter of seconds.There are 3 campaigns, close to a hundred single missions, and an in-game map editor to create your own missions.  Lastly, my favorite, a scenario generator in which you chose the size of the map and the amount of resistance you're ready to throat punch and the game generates a mission for you.  All of this leads to a lot of replayability.Also included, is a progression and load out system that allows you to customize every member of your squad, from class and weapon selection to special equiptment, portrait, and names.It's easy to see this game as a quick tactical shooting session and only expect to play in short increments, but its even easier to get hooked and start trying new strategies and techniques to get that 3 star rating on a mission.At $20 I can see many people waiting for this to go on sale, but I can assure you that it is absolutely worth it's price.

												What a great game! There is literally no down side. The only thing that hurts it, is actually one of it's better points. That being that it is too open ended to be played any one way.The level of challenge is up to you. Can you pre plan an entire mission without losing any troopers? Will you try to make arrest or just shoot everyone? Will you go the stealth way, the hard way, the quick way? Any way you choose will require very carfull planning. It's a simple game containing near infinite complexity. The one corner you fail to check, is the one that gets some one killed. So what do you get for your money? Everything but multiplayer (which is still being considered). It's one of the most replayable games I've ever played. 100 stock single missions, 6 big campaigns with a hardcore mode that save permadeath of your officers. You can always do any of this more perfectly, or all preplanned, or step by step, and if you run out of fun in about a year or 2, there is a easy mission / map editor and if that wears thin, it's already modded and workshopped to epic magnitude. It's RPG, TDS, RTS all in one. It shows you how to play, but never tells you how to play. If I told you how the game is played and a what I think of each aspect it would take 10 pages. Just watch the vids and keep in mind what I said. Best 20$ game this year. I'm gonna keep an eye on Killhouse. They seem to love the craft. I feel the feels inside for them. Sniff.... "

												Rainbow Six without uPlay SWAT4 without having to steal it (seriously, how is that game not on Steam OR GoG??)----In truth, it is like neither of these games. Except perhaps in that you're playing a military-ish squad of dudes with a variety of weapons and tools available.You drag your cursor to tell your individual dudes where to go, not to directly move them, the idea is that you're setting a plan (or altering a plan as needed) and then your SWAT team members execute that plan, shooting at any evildoers along the way. And you can only see what your squad can see via line-of-sight, which means controlling the direction your dudes are facing is of equal importance; it works nothing like most shooters, most of the real gameplay is in the planning stage (in my opinion at least; you actually can play it by ear with some degree of success but you'll almost never get a perfect run doing it that way)Reminded me a lot of Hotline Miami (1), in that, you're gonna screw up a lot, you're gonna swear nigh incoherently A LOT, but somehow still manages to be really really fun, and when you pull off a perfect mission its like SCREW YOU I AM THE SUPERIOR MIND (after failing it to comedic effect 9000 times first). And the fact that restarting and trying again takes next to no time at all, which is good because if you had to watch even a short loading screen every time you restart a mission it'd get tedious real fast.Lots of content, and if it isn't enough for you somehow, full Workshop Support (new maps, skins, guns, FULL support). And a mission generator, which I'm pretty sure everyone uses to cheap some achievements but I've heard it can also generate actual fun missions of whatever difficulty you like (which can be refreshing after you run out of interesting racial slurs to let loose after you've done something marvelously stupid and screwed up an otherwise perfect run on a really hard mission)			"

												You command a SWAT Team in different scenarios, be it simply eliminating all the terrorists or missions that include hostages or bombs to defuse.The level variety is great, the different types of mission always make the game seem fresh and provide a challenge.One mission might be a rather simple (but still demanding) run-and-gun assault on a hideout with not much pressure, another one might give you a small 20second window to eliminate a terrorist threatening a hostage.The levels can be approached rather casual if you don't mind casualties, but they are still challenging.Most players will rather take a more tactical approach where you minimize the collateral damage and have a ""more elite"" execution of your plan.The tactical possibilities for each mission seem endless with the variety of weapons and classes.Every mission can be completed with 0 (failed) to 3 stars depending on your performance with additional challenges that add replay value such as ""Only use real time combat"" or ""Only use one plan to finish the mission"", as well as the classic ""Beat this time"".The AI is good and always makes you think twice about your next move, their position also varies from try to try.Conclusion: A really engaging, challenging game that always leaves you satisfied after a mission. Quite some customization (weapons), leveling (different classes, experience, small ""perks"") options and enough missions to keep you busy for a while.Last but not least a small video that showcases how a mission works out after a few hours into the game (created with the ingame replay-to-video function)

												This is definitely one of my favourite games of 2014. It may confuse people looking at the 2D grafics when I say this game is amazing in every aspect of it. But everything fits nicely: The grafics don't hide information and for me they manage to be detailed enough convey the narrative while giving my enough space for using my own imagination. The UI is simple and easy to use. The sound effects are subtle (which is important, as you are going to hear them way too often when trying to get a perfect rating on a map). And the equipment is surprisingly well balanced, and personally I prefer balance to realism (it is really hard to explain why two .223 rem rifles with 10"" barrels, even if one is a long-stroke piston system and one short-stroke, would have so different power levels, but in the game, this makes both interesting). All leads to a very good immersion.The difficulty level is somewhat self-adjusting, as most maps are easy to finish. But getting 3 stars, using only one plan, no interaction afterwards? That takes more than a lunch break.It is not perfect yet, there could be some interface improvements when it comes to several troopers breaching the same door (whose tools are used) and a bit more synchronizing for cooperative action. And minor flaws like having female troopers but only a male voice set. And the three campaigns could do with some story texts. But these are trivial things that one will find in AAA productions, too.From a software developer's perspective: Recently, I backed three games (on Kickstarter and elsewhere).  Two (Wasteland, Jagged Alliance: Flashback) were a huge disappointment. Doorkickers was the only game that managed to continuously improve, seemed to have tight feedback cycles and was thought through from the beginning, so huge features did not come in late and were error-prone. And they polished their product before release. This speaks of a great development process and makes ""In the killhouse"" a company I would love to work with (if I were a game dev).			"

												If you like games such as SWAT 4 and the Rainbow Six games of old, then you will most likely enjoy this.There are a few different modes of play. Single missions (there are a lot!) allow you to essentially practice. The first few limit you to using only 2 good fellows against a small number of enemies with a mix of objectives. The objectives I have encountered so far are include (and you may have multiples of these on a mission) killing all the enemies, saving hostages, retrieving evidence, arresting a high profile suspect and escorting a VIP. There is also a random mission generator where you get to pick how big the map is and how strong the resistance is. Also you can create your own maps or download new ones from the Steam Workshop.The campaign mode can be unlocked after levelling up your squad by completing single missions. In this mode, if your troopers get injured they will be out of action for the next mission to recover, if they die they are dead. Dead as a dodo. Luckily you can restart the mission (don't leave the mission though!). However, there is also a hardcore mode, which will prevent you from doing this.Completing missions gives your squad experience (divvied up between the used members depending on how well they performed). As your squad levels up, you unlock more classes and also skill points to spend on improving the overall squad's reactions times and accuracy and a few other benefits. It also scores you out of 3 stars depending on how well you got your squad to perform. To get maximum score you need to and keep all your squaddies alive and complete all the objectives within the time limit. Those stars you can then spend on unlocking new weapons and equipment.Speaking of which. any tactical shooter would not be complete without giving you the option to swap out your gear. Each man has a slot for a primary and secondary weapon, armour, 2 small equipments such as flashbangs, breaching charges or lockpicks and 1 large equipment such as a camera to poke under doors or a massive hammer to smash down locked doors. There is quite a nice variety of weapons and equipment but I have found that there are only a couple of weapons I use anyway. There is one caveat: different classes allow and/or limit the equipment each guy can have.There are currently 5 classes playable: Pointman, Assault, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. The Pointman, as far as I can tell, is meant for high speed and mobility encounters (as I found with the VIP missions – if you don't get to him fast enough they shoot him!). You can only use a pistol but if used correctly, or if you have some meatier backup, then this isn't a problem. The Assault class gives you the option to equip some rifles or SMGs and is pretty self explanatory. The Shield class drops the primary weapon in favour for a ballistic shield. The level of protection the shield gives depends on which one you use but don't leave him on his own, he can only use a pistol. The Breacher uses shotguns which allows you to quickly blow locked doors off their hinges and is obviously handy in close quarters. Just don't send this guy into a small room with hostages in! The final class is Stealth. Essentially you get some suppressed weapons, which (not surprisingly) reduces the amount of noise you make.So what is the gameplay like? Well at the beginning of the mission you get to pick who you want to bring along and then place them in the predefined starting locations. Then you can plan out your mission before hit the play button. Once started you can pause at any time and make adjustments where necessary. The UI is very easy to use and entering rooms is far easier than any of the FPS games. How many times have you been trying to prepare a flashbang, only to accidentally open the door and have an AK47 in your nose? That isn't going to happen here (unless you like surprises and to go in all guns blazing).The AI can be lethal and you will want to make sure you keep those doors and corners covered just in case someone decides to take you on. Surprising the AI is always the best option but once they know you're there they will usually be ready for you in the next room or sometimes kill a hostage or start destroying evidence so you will have to be fast. If they are ready for you, you won't want your guys stacking up in front of the door waiting for the flashbang to go off. Those few seconds can get your entire squad killed, get them in cover or stacked either side of it! Or if there are no hostages in there, just use and breaching charge and blow them all to hell.This is definitely worth picking up and if you see it on sale, you have no excuse. Great game.			"

Door Kickers focuses on managing your team to complete various complex missions, ranging from killing a set amount of hostiles, to rescuing hostages, to disarming bombs, to arresting a specific target.Door Kickers really shines with its Real-time strategy elements, which reminds me a lot of the classic real time strategy shooter, Jagged Alliance. It allows you to choose to pause the game at any time to manage your team, using really simple and intuitive controls. I was surprised at how easy everything worked once I understood how to play.I found Door Kickers to be really fun to play. It does take a bit of time getting used to the controls and managing your team, but once you get the controls down you can easily get addicted to playing the game and finding new ways to complete the missions. You can also edit and create your own levels using the built in game editor, adding hours of extra game content.THE GOOD- A refreshing gameplay experience- An interesting blend of puzzle and action- Huge variety of weapons and equipment- Addicting gameplay, you feel the need to beat every level in one plan and with one soldierTHE BAD- Weak toturial- Stealth class seems to make Assaulter unnecessary- Can be frustrating at timesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

								If you want a tactical, fun, infinitely replayable SWAT sim, you will adore this game. Especially with the monthly updates form the great dev team, this game is defiantely worth your money! For those who are interested in it, it is easily mod-able and has aboth a built in random level generator and an ability to make your own custom ones. I would definately give this game 10/10!			"

												First I should point out a misconception I had with this game that led to a negative review at first. This planning in this game is really not designed for you to make a perfect masterplan for each mission in one go. In my first hours of the game I was making long elaborate plans but elements of chance make this really unreliable. You can run a perfect plan one time and then run the exact plan again but maybe a shot will miss or an enemy spawns in the wrong place and that run is completely ruined, so you just restart over and over till it lines in your favor and that is not a fun way to play.Sure the game gives you the tools to make a masterplan like that but the inability to edit any of that plan without almost completely redoing it should be a sure sign that that is not the intended way to play.Once I dropped making plans and instead ran a little, paused, worked a bit more, etc I enjoyed this game much much more than at the start. One other thing is that the game really needs more non-lethal tactics, I recently took down a dificult 22 enemy level with only the tazers but ooooh many was that janky. When lots of enemies are tazed in a row the pathfinding makes it that you can only pick up one of them at a time, meaning I had to always have somebody on guard for when the other guys stood back up, and sometimes it didnt register that I was arresting them and then they got stuck in the throwing grenade animation for some reason?? Overall the game really doesnt seem to expect people to play this way which makes me wonder why they included the tazer at all.Other than that it's a lot of fun and thats about all there is to be said.

												Mods.Mods mods mods.(Don't mind the hours, I played this on another account)The most appealing thing for me from this game is the insane ease of modding. You can make a gun that fires at 10000 RPM, create a nuclear grenade, have a BULLET weapon fire two shots, or have armor that makes your troops invincible by just changing a line of code in a text file. I'm not exaggerating.Or maybe not. Maybe you feel like that all Carbines/ARs are completely stuck in Semi-Auto is silly for you and you want to make them fire in bursts or auto. Maybe you feel like a weapon is a bit underpriced or overpowered. Make some quick tweaks why not.You can also modify any official level in the game. Not only does that give many easy templates to work with and learn the editor without a tutorial, you can have a two dozen enemies in the first map just 'cause.You can also change parameters like how fast your troopers move, how fast they aim, their FOV, etc. I know some people like testing that kind of stuff in video games.Basically, you don't have to go to an obscure folder, download three different programs to extract the contents of a file, and then extract that files' contents (and realize you're pretty limited). Nope, just lovely, lovely text files. They also have developer notes to explain what each thing does.Some deverlopers say that their game has modding support. There's that and there's this. You don't get this much freedom in most modern games anymore.Just you know, don't use any of that to cheat. Cus' that's just being mean and not appreciate the effort the devs made into the levels.I hope this review does more than justify the price. (If it's not been already by other reviews)			"

												Door Kickers is a solid game and you might enjoy it (the crushing majority does, as it seems). But for me personally, it was a disappointment. I was really hyped about this game according to the trailers, there was no demo, and the game didn't live up to my expectations.I expected this to be more arcade-like, instead it's more of a planning/puzzle game. That wouldn't be a problem, but I don't like how it's implemented. There are basically two modes you can operate in: full-ahead planning or realtime mode.Full-ahead planning In full-ahead planning, you try to plan the whole operation (or most of it) in advance, and then just hit play and watch the action. It takes a long time, but if it works out, it is satisfactory. The problems are clunky controls and a lot of important stuff missing. Basic things like ""look around the whole room in 360° angle and shoot all enemies then go on"" are impossible. Instead you can look in one direction, then move a short distance, then look into different direction, then move a short distance, then look into other direction, ... until you cover the whole room. Even if your soldier encounters an enemy, he's happy to follow all the other orders including looking into a completely different direction, turning back to his enemy (what?!). So you need to use ""thumb up"" mark after every single move to make sure he actually kills the enemy before going away. That gets tiring quickly. A basic AI for your soldiers would be nice, but it's not there, you have to micromanage everything. So the soldier goes according to the plan even if there's a shootout 3 meters away from him. The soldier doesn't automatically take cover even though there's a cover spot half a meter away from him. People might argue this game is about micromanaging. Well, OK (I didn't expect that), but you can hardly do that in full-ahead planning, because enemy positions are random. And the developers give you no means to intelligently react to enemy encounters, neither in planning mode nor when executing the action (see the point below). Editing the plan in the middle is impossible. You have just spent 10 minutes carefully planning everything, and then you figure out that in the very second room you forgot to check the closet. You want to tweak the plan a bit. But guess what - you have to delete the whole plan after the second room, do the adjustments, and then re-create it again from scratch from that point forward. There's no way to edit the prepared plan in the middle. This is so glaring overlook then I can't explain it - for me, this was a showstopper for planning the action ahead. It also applies to real-time modifications to the plan (when you already started executing the actions) - no way to do that, it will destroy the rest of your plan. Say goodbye to intelligently reacting to unexpected events. Synchronizing actions from multiple soldiers is a major PITA. Something as basic as waiting for a flash bang to explode is not implemented. The soldier who threw the flash bang waits a bit (it seems), but the others do not. If you do not throw it through a door but around a corner, no one waits. So you need to do manual synchronization using ABCD codes. A lot of manual chore. If you have two soldiers, one with a shield, you get the obvious idea - one can go in front, shielding them, and the second behind him, shooting from the cover when he sees enemies. But no, there's no way to instruct them to go as a group.Realtime mode In realtime mode (well, almost real time, you usually plan just a few steps ahead and then unpause it), you need to micromanage everything, but at least everything works exactly as you intended - soldiers are properly synchronized, they don't rush into rooms before flashbangs explode, etc. However, if anything goes wrong and you need to restart the mission, it's an immense chore instructing them through all the rooms again, and again, and again. You can't save and reuse parts of previous plans. You can't toggle them to semi-AI mode and make them a bit smarter. So instead of spending a lot of time planning, you spend a lot of time redoing all your previous realtime instructions many times over. The realtime mode pains could be save by allowing the player to do ""snapshots"" - quicksaves and quickloads, but that's not there. Or perhaps offering to save and recall short-time plans for individual rooms, but that's not there either.So, in summary, I felt that I'm either frustrated by inadequate controls in full-ahead planning mode, or that I'm repeating the same short-time realtime plans over and over again, until I finally finished the level. I couldn't enjoy it.There are some technical issues as well, which annoyed me: Multimedia keys don't work, unless you switch to Steam overlay. Alt+tab doesn't work, unless you switch to Steam overlay. But then it glitches, and even though you are switched to other applications, Door Kickers are still displayed on top of them (so you can't see what you're doing). On top of that, you can't switch back to DK. That basically means you must try to kill the game blindly, or restart the computer, just because of using Alt+Tab (and of course you'll lose all unsaved progress). I'm using GNOME as a desktop environment, might be an issue specific to that.Aside from the technical issues, I like sound effects of this game, music is OK, but I don't like the graphics. First, the absolutely top down perspective doesn't look good, just a bit of isometric view would work much better. Second, the graphics are ugly and blurry, and the texture quality (or artwork quality, however you want to call that) is low. I have correct resolution set, but the whole game looks upscaled and far from crystal clear as I expected.			"

Posted: November 21, 2015
												Now before I go into my review I want to make one thing clear. I love this game. It is a very cool experience for those looking for a tactical strategy challenge of commanding a swat team breaching a building. However, there are just a few things that ruin the experience for me in some cases.First: The AIThe biggest problem that I have with the enemy AI is that they constantly open doors and just run out of them without and moments thought instead of posting up and keeping there guns trained on a door as they should be doing. Watching my guys mow down half of the enemy on one level just because they kept moving down a narrow hallway instead of fortifying themselves really broke my immersion.Second: Lack of Surrender OptionIf I was playing a military game, I wouldn't have a problem with my troops just gunning down unsuspecting enemies, and inspite of what people might think, SWAT team members are NOT allowed to open fire first unless they give proper warning and demand surrender from the enemy. The fact that this doesn't happen, and for a game that I assume is supposed to be simulating SWAT team breaches, really is disappointing when you compare it to something like SWAT 4 which this game seems to emulate from a strategic standpoint.Third: IrratationNow while some people may get the joy of going through a level for an hour trying to create the perfect plan, that isn't me. I'm the kind of guy who likes to do a level only a few times and not have to rely on trial and error mechanics to complete a level. And when I do complete one I don't feel sastisfaction at all.Fourth: ProgressionTo be fair, I'm not sure what progression system I would have chosen for this game, but I don't know if a star system like on mobiles games would have been the route I went. Really makes grinding extremely annoying. Plus I end up just not using most of the weapons and only go for the ones that are the best in the game.Fifth: Hostage Death = RestartThis is probably this most frustrating aspect of this game. I'm not sure what real life SWAT would consider a hostage being killed a failure, but being forced to restart the entire level just because one hostage out of like 12 gets killed is overly punishing. Especially if you consider that the SAS (I know its not SWAT but still) raid on the Iranian Embassy was considered a success even though a hostage was killed in the siege.Sixth: PriceFor a game that is $20, it just doesn't feel like it is worth $20 in the end. (I would recommend this game for $5 when it goes on sale but no more) DISAVOWED. $5 definitely pick this up, $10 sure, $15 eh pushing it but would still recommend, $20 no (at least for me). Some people might think this game is worth $20, which is perfectly fine if they believe so, but for me personally $15 would probably be a better base price tag.Overall, its a great concept and a good game, but it needs to lower its price and work on some of its flaws before I can change my review to positive.

Door Kickers - 8.5/10 Door Kickers is an addicting and challenging game, that hooked me from the first level. Much like Hotline Miami, the theme of a SWAT team making dangerous and daring rescue attempts is merely a cover up for Door Kickers' core puzzle like mechanics. The awesome feeling of pulling off a succsessful three star rescue attempt, after carefully planning down to the micro level each individual action of our members is second to none.The game presents you with several ways to access missions and earn currency (currency allows you to purchase different weapons and gear). Playing missions in each of the campaigns (there are currently 6 campaigns) Playing each of the over 100 standalone missions Downloading maps from the workshop (These do not get you currency) Making your own maps (These do not get you currency)The unlockable gear allows you to customise each opertive and in the later game it often makes sense to give each of your opperative a weapoin tailored to what they will have to do. Alongside this, there are also 5 classes, Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. They each have unique weapons and some shared weapons, as well as unique equipment.There is lots of good things to say about Door Kickers, but there are also a few issue at the moment. You are not able to reshape the path of an opperative without getting rid of all the rest of the path. The unlock system can be tedious at times and it can sometimes feel like a grind. Sometimes when you spend a long time creating a plan in order to get three stars, and then you have to quit the game or you feel like changing levels. There is no way to save your plan so you have to remake it when you come back.Overall door kickers is a great game that will easily last you 20 hours, and most likely even more. It is a particullarly good game to just pick up and play for short ammount of time, once you have unlocked a few of the weapons. BUY IT!			"

												It's nice, reminds me of  SWAT 4.It seems like a lot to take in, and certainly it takes a few mission runs before you become used to all the options available to you. But once you've gotten a few missions under your belt, ordering your squad elements and moving along with them becomes second nature. The structure of the campaign seems to mimic this standard learning curve, as the first few missions are rather simple and easy, but the difficulty ramps up considerably in the later missions, where you'll find complicated building architecture and numerous heavily armed suspects.

Summary: The game is awesome & full of tactical challenges.I've got this game in a bundle sale few months back, that's why it was untouched before. Recently I saw the announcement of the sequel so I though let's complete the first game. The game is really well made. Although it is top-down perspective but still graphical details are quite good. The game is challenging and it takes quite a precision planning to get 3 stars.Game play is very simple to learn but hard to master. You'll be presented with a map with few goons (default game comes with 6 campaigns and 75+ standalone maps), some time bomb or hostage or evidences (campaign only). You have to choose 2 or 4 or 8 soldiers and deploy in different location throughout the maps. Locations are pre-defined. Then you have to invade the map and kill the goons or capture the evidences or stop the bomb timer or rescue hostages. However, it requires precision timing and path / action assignment to coordinated attacks so that your soldiers don’t get injured (or killed). In hostage rescue situation, you’ll have to do it multiple times because you’ll die a lot or a goon has killed a hostage (strictly not allowed). This part is really challenging for softcore gamer like me.If I want to give point to this game, I’d give 8 out of 10. One of the best indie game in recent time. A must-have title.PS: This game has mod support; Steam workshop has lots of community created maps for more enjoyment. "

								A lot more fun than it should be. Part Rainbow 6 (the original) planning, part SWAT 2 RTS. It deserves a better description but that's pretty close as far as fun goes in my mind. Workshop support only increases the game's stock. Maps, sounds, skins and weapons are already abundant on the shop. Challenging in all the right ways. Plenty of stat tracking and rankings for those with a competitive edge. Can't remember the last down a top-down or a RTS game warranted the same attention from me, perfect game to pick up and put down at will.Don't let the hours fool you, I've been playing this in alpha form long before it was Greenlit and added to Steam. If you like throwing bangs, slicing pies, T-zoning, stacking and generally going HAM; do yourself a favor and pick it up.			"

												Fantastic game. Highly recommended. Harkens back to Rainbow Six (as you'll constantly read). Focusing on this game, however, it has solid gameplay mechanics. And is fair in it's execution. I did run in to one level that I couldn’t figure out but that was one level out of hundreds. And yes, this game has 100s of prebuilt scenarios. Also, it has a random mission generator. You get your money's worth and it's fun. There is not too much story -- actually, no story is fair to note but there is are 3 different ""campaigns"" that you can go through. Also the aforementioned 100s of missions and then the mission generator. So, again, a ton of content to be had. I don't have many complaints with the game. I suppose I wish it explained some the gear a bit better but for the most part you figure it out. To the best of my knowledge, a good portion of items are interchangeable. I could be wrong, who knows... Strongly recommended. Just buy it. Don't wait for a sale or anything silly. If you enjoy rainbow six (the planning phase, I should mention) and you like strat games, just buy it. It's an indie; support these guys and they can then bring out more awesome games.  The game is well optimized. It runs on my older laptops with ease as far as I can tell. No performance concerns to note.  "

												UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: I've just passed 100 hours in the game. Still pretty much a lot of fun. The developers have announced they are working on new updates expected before the end of the year to include an enhanced editor and more gameplay modes. So even if you aren't interested right now, put it on your wishlist and it might be on an upcoming Steam Sale.UPDATE: I'm posting a short update to this review. I've just passed eighty(80) hours in the game. The developers have released two updates, adding some new features and fixing some small bugs. The Steam Workshop community is very actively supporting the game (I have several mods there myself). Still highly recommended.ORIGINAL REVIEW:If you are at all interested in the subject you should definitely give it a look. The game is already well supported by the community and the Steam Workshop has some excellent mods, weapons and levels already. It's the old SWAT or Rainbow Six from a top down, 2D perspective that puts more emphasis on planning than quick reactions. Check out some of the Let's Play videos out there, or some mission video captures posted on my YouTube channel for more information.Now that it is in release, there are even more interesting features, the major ones being multistory buildings and drug busts where you have to race to seize the evidence before the bad guys dispose of it. Three campaigns have been added, which are a series of linked missions (also with some branched, optional missions) where you are limited to your existing roster. Without giving away any spoilers, there are a couple of really large maps set on a waterfront and a train station that combine long sight distances, dangerous approaches and unusual rooms and buildings. The game is pretty much bug free due to the long alpha period, with only a couple of minor items that have to be addressed. There is an excellent level editor that works pretty well, the only really awkward part being the current need to edit the background image (which is the floor or ground of the map) outside of the editor, should you want one that isn't the default grey warehouse floor. The developers have stated that they intend to add that background editing ability into the in-game editor. Also of note is the excellent Mission Generator. You select the size of the level and the amount of opposition and the game generates a random seed. Then you select either ""KillHouse"" (for a training map) or ""House"" (for a real world map) and the game generates a mission using one of the maps in the game. The mission could be just to eliminate hostiles, or escort a VIP, or run a drug bust, or rescue hostages. It's a real challenge because it's newly generated. Overall this is an excellent value for the price; three campaigns, 80 official missions (once you enable the two new missions via the Mods interface), a Mission Generator and tons of mods already in the Workshop. Highly Recommended.			"

https://libertariangaming.org/?p=1465 <better version of my review in the link behind!Doorkickers is an indie RTS/Puzzle game which involves you leading a SWAT team through missions. I've been following this game since late Alpha and have enjoyed it since it's early form. The gameplay is quite simple, but is hard to master. Basically you give your team check points to go to through the mission area. You tell them where to go, where to face, what to use and so on. It's somewhat similar to the mission planning of the old Rainbow Six games but now in live action, with a live pause available. The game features five classes that your officers can pick from. Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. The Pointman is the fastest through the door, but only wields a handgun. The Assaulter packs either an SMG or an assault rifle and is best at ranged gun fights. Breachers wield shotguns and can blow doorlocks off. Stealth wield silenced weapons and move quieter. Shield men wield large shields that stop bullets. In my opinion, most of the classes are useful, but I don't really use the shields as they are slow, and are doomed if they are flanked.There is about 80 single missions, 3 campaigns, a random mission generator and an simple editor so there is a lot of content on offer. The campaigns aren't very story driven, at all. There isn't a paragraph describing any story. I'm not saying it ruins the experience but it would have been nice to have that. Officers do take injuries during missions and can die, but this only really affects the campaign. The campaigns are quite short, but entertaining, and are worth replaying for experience points and stars (explained later). Although this game is mainly about planning, there is a bit of luck involved. I'd say it's 9/10 planning and 1/10 luck. Just know that♥♥♥♥♥♥poor planning leads to♥♥♥♥♥♥poor performance. One great thing about this game, is you can wing it, or plan the whole mission out (which gives a bonus in EXP).You unfortunately do have to unlock equipment during the game. Troopers level up during missions, and your entire squad levels up as well. Leveling troopers grants them better speed with shooting and using tools and accuracy. Leveling the squad grants doctrine points which grant all members improved abilities such as accuracy boosts, and one shot door breaching. It also gives access to more classes, as you only start with pointmen.Another thing worth noting is that you have to unlock weapons, by acquiring stars during missions. You get one for completing, one for having all troopers alive and one for beating it under time. It can be challenging getting all 3 stars on some missions but the rewards are worth it.One complaint I will make is that you have to erase all of your checkpoints ahead of a checkpoint if you want to make changes. This can make it more time consuming to change plans. I also find that sometimes I accidentally erase points which can be very frustrating.Another issue is the new story mechanic. Some missions have multiple levels but to be honest changing between them is quite awkward in my opinion and I feel the game would be better without them. My other complaint is that this game doesn't have a solid tutorial. Fortunately you can practice all you like on the single missions without an issue. The graphics of this game are quite simple, but I honestly think it's unfair to expect better from a 3 man indie team considering the scale of this game, and it's certainly better looking than a Unity engine game and to be honest the menu background looks great.Doorkickers has been my first adventure into PC indie gaming, and easily the best. A small, and passionate team who actually listen to the players, and use the advice to develop a competent and entertaining game that was realistically achievable. I'd give Doorkickers a 9/10.			"

												Door kickers is Awesome!Your OfficersYou can have a total of 10 officers. You will give each officer a class which you can change at any time before a mission starts. There are 5 classes total, 4 to unlock. You start with Pointman and unlock Assaulter, Shield, Breacher and finally Stealth. You then customize each officers class specific gear.Officer Ranking and Squad RankingEach officer has his or her own rank which increases as they complete missions successfully. Their skill level increases with rank. As your officers rank up so does your overall squad rank. DoctrineEach time your squad rank increases you gain a doctrine point. These points are spent on pistol skills, long gun skills and shotgun skills. These skills are passive and improve every officer regardless of their rank.DeathYour officers can die permanently and will be replaced with rookie officers if you choose to continue after a  successful mission. If you restart the mission you will still have that said officer for consecutive attempts.Missions and GearEach mission has a 3 star rating system. Each star awarded is currency to unlock gear. Gear is unlocked for the entire squad once you spend the stars. There are single missions, campaign missions and a mission generator for random missions. There is also the mission editor and steam workshop. You can plan a mission from beginning to end before you start. You can also pause the game anytime to plan as you go. If you are really brave you don't have to pause at all. It is very rewarding to watch your officers execute a perfect plan. You can even save replays and export videos in game. ConclusionIt takes 10 minutes to plan a mission and anywhere from 5 seconds to 2 minutes to execute the takedowns. This game could probably be used as a training tool if given to the right people. Door kickers is all about tacticle planning and strategy. Very fun game to play! Easily worth the full price but if you see it on sale don't hesitate to pick this one up. "

												Door Kickers was a huge surprise for me. A friend gifted me a copy and I have to say Door Kickers is like drugs, once it gets a hold of you you just don't want to stop playing. Door Kickers has you managing a SWAT team with upgradeable skills and equipment. During the missions there are a variety of objectives such as collecting evidence, defusing bombs, saving hostages, or just eliminating hostiles. You set up your team at the beginning of the mission and then plan out what they are going to do, once you press play the SWAT team runs into action performing all teh actions you set before hand. Now in Door Kickers you can watch your plan play out on screen, hoping for the best and restart if something goes awry, however if you are not worried about getting a ""perfect plan"" you can pause and modify your actions for your team at any time! There are a few different options when it comes to mission modes. You have the single missions, for quick play, you have the mission generator that lets you generate missions based on a few different parameters, and then you have the campaigns. There are a good handful of playable campaigns each with a variety of challenges and difficulties. If you couple that with the tons of different equipment and classes each SWAT member can have you are talking tons of gameplay and variation! If it did not sound like it could be any better Door Kickers also has mod and Steam workshop support! If any of the above sounds interesting I urge you to check out Door Kickers, or even the upcoming Door Kickers 2!			"

												I had seen videos of Doorkickers before receiving it in a bundle.  I have played games such as Frozen Synapse and Jagged Alliance 2, and found the tactical genre to be a bit of a mixed bag.  So when I saw videos of Doorkickers, I didn't think much of it.  SInce it came with a bundle of other games I liked, I gave Doorkickers a shot.And it was far more enjoyable than trailers and gameplay videos could get across.The joy of Doorckickers is primarily the tactical system.  From movement to breaching to cover and co-ordination, you have to think about them all, and the game lets you control it in a simple and easy to use interface.  The method of control is also flexible: you can plan every move in advance and let the scenario play out, or you can pause at any time to alter the gameplan when things go sideways.  Changes can be made in real-time as well.  The end result of all of this control and flexibility is a deep tactical planning stage followed by a typically short but explosive rush of action.Each mission stage is a layout of a building, structure, or outdoor location.  Warehouses, beach villas, parking garages, multi-story luxury apartments, and more... with Steam Workshop and a built-in editor, the variety in size, complexity, and tactical options are impressive.  You can play one off missions or dive into multi-mission campaigns where injury and death are long-term inhibiting factors.  A hardcore ironman mode is available to prevent repeated attempts at a mission to save key teammates from injury or death.Most missions have multiple tactical approaches based on which officers and gear you use.  Some missions are somewhat linear and can be approached methodically, while others usually turn into controlled chaos that you pray doesn't get you killed.  There is an element of RNG to shot accuracy, stopping power, and enemy numbers, but solid tactical choices can be made to deal with it.The squad you control is manned by officers you can customize in name, callsign, appearance, and gear.  Skill perks are squad training that all officers get the benefit of.  Roles include pointman, assaulter, breacher, stealth, and shield.  Each fills a vital part of the tactics, and they feel useful in their dominant environments.  When the mission changes, you can change up all gear and role assignments.Weapons range from the ubiquitous handgun, SMGs and carbines, shotguns, and non-lethals.  The variety of weaponry is sufficient, and a slew can be added with the Workshop.  Gear includes various armors, tactical grenades, cameras, and breaching devices.  It's fun to switch up loadouts, but there isn't too much here to overload the player with inventory management.There are bonuses in each mission to encourage different playstyles.  Lone wolf tasks you with clearing a mission with one officer, which casn be incredibly difficult.  One award is given for playing entirel in realtime with no pauses.  Lastly, an award can be earned for planning an entire breach and clear in advance, hitting play, and succeeding with no pauses or changes to the gameplan.  This last award is the most satisfying of all, and when 5-10 minutes of planning leads to a flawless execution of a 3-4 minute mission... the exhileration is real.  You can also save replays within the game, or export the replay to a video file to share and cherish always.Bottom line is that this game is a tactical dream that can be played for short bursts or full-auto for hours.  The variety and depth provide a solid amount of content.  Mods extend the life of the game and add all sorts of new weapons, gear, and interface alternatives.If your satisfaction is partly predicated on price, I would wager $10 to be wholly worthwhile.  That's 50% off the standard price, which might be steep for most.  Luckily, the game has been around a while and sales on this title are frequent.So gear up and get tactical!  It's time to sweep this hot spot like an efficient wave of justice.			"

												This is a great game, and it doesn't have a difficult learning curve to the play style.  First, you take over a SWAT team that consists of ten members with varying attributes in marksmanship, assault shooting(close quarters), and field skills(a skill that speeds up the ability to disarm bombs for instance).Since the game is in the top down mode, you are able to script out the directions you want your team members to move, provide covering fire, which doors to breach etc...  This is done before the match, and if you realize you made a mistake during the fight, you're able to pause, and re-adjust your routes, and covering fire; or you can make adjustments in real time.  As I said earlier, it's not a difficult learning curve, once you realize it's about applying covering fire for teams moving in open areas, or stacking alongside a room you're about to throw a flash bang in.  There is limitless possibilities you can create within the scenarios.The game offers 80 missions(and often, when updates happen, more missions appear).  You can also create your own quick missions with varying styles.  Which means you can go in just to kill the enemies, capture and arrest individuals without lethal harm, disarm bombs and rescue hostages.  The game offers 5 campaigns at the time of this review, and they each have an additional 5-6 missions of varying difficulty.  This is not to forget that Steam Workshop is enabled for this game, and you're honestly left with so many choices that just about everyone can find something they're comfortable with(ie: you can apply mods for military type actions, with military weapons , or extra police type actions for instance).The game progresses your characters by the number of missions that they accomplish, and the skills being applied are done for you.  It's up to you, and the mission to decide which of your team members gets placed in the action(for instance if you're disarming a bomb, you'll want someone with high field skills).  You'll also get experience to level up, which then you can unlock perks from a tree of skills to enhance skills with firearms(pistols, shotguns and rifles/carbines).  The game unlocks after certain levels as you can get different character sets, like breachers(shotguns), stealth(silenced weapons and movement), and using police shields to add extra defense to your team members.  Yet there is even more, you gain stars by completing missions(1 to 3 stars depending on what conditions are met), which the stars can be turned into buying upgraded weapons, body armor, accessories(tazer, breaching kit for example.  You basically have full control on what your team needs to complete the mission.This game doesn't have too many flaws(at least when I've played), and the developers are still really active in producing content for the game.  What I do find enjoyable about this game is that it feels satisfying every time I play.  I don't feel like I have to commit 2 to 3 hours a day to enjoy the game.  I can honestly play a single mission, or 30 minutes and I won't feel disappointed in what I've accomplished; and certainly there is enough it do in this game to have you lose track of time and play hours at a time if you wish.  I highly recommend this game if you enjoy a tactical game where you're able to do all the planning and adjusting real time.  You won't be disappointed.10/10			"

												Door Kickers is a top-down SWAT 3/4, so far it is very polished and very fun, open ended with the ability to do the mission as you please, either gung-ho and loud, or stealthy with suppresors. With more to come, including modding abilities and steam workshop uploading, this bad boy has not only awesome replayability at it's current Alpha state (Alpha 9), it is destined to have more bang for your buck at its basement bargain price. Pick it up today!OK, so let's update this review. This is one of those games that had early access, and I was very impressed with what they were working towards. Lose internet for six months, the Alpha kept me satisfied. Get back online, get the updates, and ERROR HOUSTON WE HAS PROBS. Damn game wouldn't start. So go to the forums, and shoot some basics to the devs, they have me drop them a real email with my problems.Within an hour, the co-founder of the dev comany was doing some troubleshooting (DAN, YOU ROCK!), got my pertinent info, and all problems solved. Needless to say, this game surpassed my initial expectations in Alpha. This game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥ yo. Get it, especially if you're a strategy fan, this is just the bees knees.			"

												In a world where there probably will not be a Swat 5, this is your substitute. Do not look at any others, as this currently IS it. And even for a top down shooter experience, this thing ain't a bad substitute either. You get that same sort of pull your hair out ""BUT THE ♥♥♥♥ER WAS RIGHT THERE"" experience that you do in Swat 4, and of course the much more fun sigh of relief when you actually DO experience everything perfectly.Plus, the shorter levels and plethora of mods make this an excellent reimagning on the genre, and alleviate some of the more rage quittingly high levels of difficulty that Swat 4 became equally famous for...

												After proudly playing this game for several hours I can say: This game is amazing. It has an immense amount of missions with several different scenario's where the same tactics don't work every single time, so don't worry about things getting repetative, the only way you can upgrade your squad is via completing missions and using the stars you gain to purchase weaponry, armor, tactical items, excetera, so that means you have a reason to do your best. Is this game frustrating? Absolutely, but what game isn't at times? Getting bored of what you see? Want something else? Want to burst into a crowded mall dressed like stormtroopers with miniguns? Want to kill your enemy's with the power of Dubstep? Or do you just think the games music is shoddy? Look no further! Mods take care of your extra wants and needs, all it takes is to click ""Subscribe"" to an item on the steam workshop item. This game can also run on a potato of a computer, so no need for a super setup.Overall, do I recommend this game? Absolutely.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start by saying that I'm just a casual gamer that's into a variety of games, and had never heard of these developers (or really any indie devs!) before this game. I don't benefit at all by giving this a positive review, except perhaps by helping to share this great game and thus contribute indirectly to the sales and community - possibly allowing the devs to make it even better!Door Kickers is a Fantastic Game!! -- One of the best I've ever played, and there's still lots more to come! Door Kickers offers an enjoyable, realistic and informative peek into the world of tactical response police and special forces that is very secretive and usually hard to find (portrayed even semi-accurately at least) in the entertainment world. In a simple, fun, and effective way it showcases realistic tactics, weaponry, gadgets, radio chatter and movements in a variety of hostage, bomb defusal, room clearing and even tubular assault scenarios. Door Kickers is particularly enjoyable if you're into Police or Military Tactical Response/SWAT or Special Forces, but even if you're not, it's still an amazing and rewarding tactical game that enables you to think, plan and execute different strategies in a variety of different scenarios. It's NOT an exceedingly difficult game by any means, but there is plenty of room for perfectionist work if you so desire. Although the trailers play at full speed, there is a tactical pause feature that lets you think, plan and execute your strategies as fast or slow as you want. Would recommend Door Kickers to everyone! Lots of very cool new stuff is promised in the near future, such as Snipers, Ballistic Shields, Tazers, and a Campaign (in addition to the dozens of single missions currently available). The updates have been released very regularly so far - the devs obviously care about the game and have already implemented alot of suggestions from the community!   In short, you should get it!  You won't regret buying this game!    11/10!			"

								When I first played Door Kickers it was a few missions in a shoothouse with a few guys available. Since then the team has added loads to a very easy to learn but tricky and satisfying to perfect game model. It brings back memories of the early Swat games and the tenseness of entering a room is great. The balance between direct controlling units and ordering team mates via go commands allows for some immensely satisfying moments when it all goes slickly. Some times it doesn't and everyone dies, tough luck it was your fault not the game, you learn and then do it all over again slightly better. All in all it is just nice to see a greenlit game that is well put together and well supported.			"

												Fans of Frozen Synapse, Breach and Clear, and other similar tactical games will love Doorkickers, and with good reason - it has a lot to offer, whether you're a meticulous perfectionist or you prefer to run your plans fast and loose. Since you can pause the game to revise your plan (or even alter it in real-time) at any point, it's entirely up to you how active you want to be in guiding your soldiers through each level. You can even try to run a mission with a single trooper. Outside of missions, you can spend the stars you've earned to unlock new equipment for your troopers, and experience will unlock small skill improvements. All the elements of the game come together fairly well - the differences in classes and weapons are small enough that players who aren't concerned with meticulously min-maxing their loadouts can ignore them, but still significant enough to allow for lots of tactical options. The simple controls mean you can create plans and revise plans very quickly and easily.Doorkickers does have a few issues, particularly with the control scheme. It's sometimes difficult to predict what a particular trooper will do in a particular situation, particularly if you're the kind of player who likes to plan the whole mission out ahead of time. For example, if you order a trooper to breach a room with a flashbang, and that door is already open when he arrives at it, he will head in without throwing one, sometimes leading to his death. Multi-story buildings don't allow you to create plans past the first story. Missions with lots of troopers will clutter up the screen with countless paths and orders.Perhaps most frustrating to me, as someone who is used to Frozen Synapse's determinism, is the element of randomness in every engagement. Sometimes the difference between a good plan resulting in success or total failure is up to random enemy unit placements and split-second chances, meaning that to get that perfect 3 star score, you sometimes just have to keep running the mission until the stars align and everything goes right.But I think it says something about how much fun Doorkickers is that despite these annoyances, I'm still heavily recommending it. I've had a lot of fun with it so far and it's great for a quick fix of tactical gameplay. As I'm writing this, it's on sale for 2.99 which is a fantastic deal.Oh the soundtrack is nice too.			"

												Door Kickers is a pause and plan RTS with a focus on high energy, high impact tactical gunfights.  You normally control a team of 2-8 SWAT personnel and are charged with eliminating tangoes, defusing bombs, rescuing hostages and all sorts of other goodness.  The planning is intuitive & easy to implement.  It can be done entirely through mouse commands or by using the keyboard to trigger go codes.  Gameplay is fast and lethal - your SWAT wear body armor, but that doesn't mean they won't go down if someone empties a MAC-10 at them or if they step out in front of a shotgun.  As a result, you're constantly planning how best to win the fight before your man is ever in view - distracting the enemies by popping a trooper into view and then flanking them, stunning them with flashbang grenades or whatever other fiendish tricks you manage to pull off.  Enemy A.I. varies from cautious (hunker down and wait) to aggressive (investigate gunfire/other loud sounds) and changes between playings.  Most of the more complex scenarios offer several possible enemy set ups, deemphasizing puzzle-based planning and providing a more organic experience (is that room to the left clear or can it be safely ignored?).  The enemies carry a full range of weapons and can even load up on heavy body armor - there are an unrealistically large number of tangos, but this yields a more satisfying experience and you'll find yourself going along with it.Moreover, I have been playing Door Kickers since the alpha and, with each new iteration, the game has continued to grow and evole.  The dedication of Killhouse Games to delivering the best product possible has been something to behold and I can say that from personal experience they are very receptive to feedback from the community.   They have worked hard to pack a lot of value into the package - at present there are over seventy single player maps, plus three campaigns, a random scenario generator and an editor to enable users to design their own maps.  The game itself offers a wide variety of experiences, from simple missions that can be knocked out in a few minutes (when you're just looking for a quick release during downtime) to large, complex hostage rescues which require both planning and precision to pull off.In short, this is one of the best computer game purchases I have made over the last couple years - if any of the above sounds appealing then I highly recommend picking the game up.

												Fantastic game. Worth every penny.If you have played any of the previous SWAT or Rainbow Six games, you can expect a similar strategic style, albeit in a top down isometric view. It's one of those easy to learn, hard to master type games, where you will constantly perfect strategies and re-run missions to achieve 3-star ratings. The game rewards your hard work with unlockables, specifically new guns and gadgets. There is also a level up system, similar to that of the XCOM series, where specific officers will improve their abilities as they are involved in missions. There is a mixture of both campaigns and time-trial based single missions and already an abundance of content.The game already has a vibrant modding scene, which is great because this game lends itself to the creation of new maps and guns. It already feels like there is far too much to do in it.The game is also extremely polished. There are a couple of small bugs here and there, but it's highly unlikely you will encounter anything game-breaking.Highly recommended!			"

												Door Kickers is an awesome real-time action strategy game where you take control of a swat team during numerous raids.There is a level generator which will (to your choice) give you either a map created by the game developers with a random mission and random placement of the bad guys, or a killhouse which is a completely random place, never before created for another user.Amazing game 10/10.

												WOW yea definatley a keeper after a less than a hour its well worth buying especially on sale. I get really sceptical about certain games especialy games like this but let me tell you its a good buy. ProsGreat graphics (for a top down)Great stratigic sense ie. planning your route what angles to look ect.Easy to learn as few pointers but not rediculious to where you want them to go away it has a tutorial and it literally is a             screen that tells you the motions and waht to press for what - again very easy to learnCons:  (not many)Cant start campaign until lvl 6 but it doesnt take long to get there but by then youll have ample time to get good at controlsNothing else I've found yet for cons Must buy!!! Very good game. Onsale or not totally worth it!			"

												When I play the first mission, it's very fresh, but after several mission, it's a bit tedious, for you need playing a lot to unlock the careers and skills, weapons, equipments.And I only have 2 troopers and handgun at first...Luckily enough flash grenade and they will never die...It's easy at first, so I just kill them. I realize the hostile will notice that the troopers here once you make some sound and they will make some actions, but the their position is terrible at first, so it doesn't bring any trouble to me. Until the 10th mission, I got trouble, big trouble...They attack me at my rear! I only got 2 troopers to against more than 5 guys and I got nothing to stop the sound with kicking, flashing or gun! So you really need some tactic, also skills and good weapon may needed.I also tried the Campaign, different from the Mission, you will lose your troopers if they dead. But don't worry, only works in the Campaign and you can reset it anytime you want( such as you got no chance to win).Still playing, so I'll keep updating this review.			"

Even in Alpha, it will show you no mercy.And it is amazing.This brings the true and terrifying elements of CQC/CQB in a method that makes sense and is a ton of fun, even in Alpha. Of course, if it's great in Alpha, that just means there's more greatness on the way.I highly recommend this game, both to those hardcore Mil-Simmers and the casual gamer, since it's fun all around.

								This is a great game for those of you that enjoyed games like the Swat series, Jagged Alliance, and ""Breach & Clear (On Android/iOS systems and or Tactical and strategy enthusist.  This game combines tactical with strategy allowing you to setup your SWAT team by choosing the weaponery, stacking your units on a door to either breach/bang/c2/kick/shoot the door, and sweep the room guns blazing or going stealth. Amazingly the game allows you to pause and coordinate your manuvers. For example if I want my men to look a certain direction when sweeping a room, it allows me to do it with ease. The gameplay is pretty straight foward and easy, it can be tough though, espicially if you don't coordinate wisely. In other words it's very easy to have a man down so be careful. Lastly, the A.I. is pretty good, sometimes they all end up coming to you which can be unrealistic but other times they can be super realistic. Espcially when you have a hostage sceneario. The hostage A.I. are pretty complex too, If you kill the other suspects for every shot the hostage taker hears, he takes a gamble on whether he will kill the hostage, wait, or investiage. If you're LE, Military, or just love being tactical, this is the game for you! "

												WARNING:Most of my complains here are after the 12 hour mark, but in future content may be added which fixes the issues I have.Doorkickers is a top down SWAT simulater where you control a small team and plan different raids. You have a planning stage for each map where you could take 30 minutes making sure you cover everthingthing, or you can go by the seat of your pants, since you can pause time and give orders in the raid itself. Doorkickers is mostly about planning each mission to perfection, and at the beginning it's great- the maps are small, you can generally plan the whole thing out and make no alterations to that plan and it's wonderfully tense as everyone dies in a few hits. However, after around 12 hours it all falls apart- maps are larger and there are more enemies, so you have to be flexible and this means no more planning for the entire mission, it's more room by room. Gang members get bullet proof vests, high powered weapons and explosives (WHAT?!) so they tend to be massively over powered, and this ruins the balancing that was perfect before.Really, aside from some control issues and not being able to plan for team members dying the beginning of the game was a good 9/10 but after it was watching it slowly die off. I will recommend it for the fun that could be had but it really was disappointing "

												This is one of the best tatical games I have played in a long time. While I am still figuring out the full logistics of the game, it has been so fun, that a review was in order. Getting started is easy as the tutorial gives you all of the necessary elements of the game and it takes a few tries before you become an adept. Even then, you are always learning and changing game plans or ideas as you progress through the game. Customization is at its best and a great perk this game has to offer are the ai's, which are placed randomly at the start of every level and seem to have great logic to them. I have not seen the ai's do stupid stuff such as stand around like dummies, in fact, I actually had one terrorist come out of the house to shoot my cop. This means that restarting each scenario will always be slightly different making past plans fruitless agianst new attempts putting this game as another one with a hundred plus hours on it.			"

								This is one of the most refeshing takes on tactical shooters I've played in the past few years. Everything in this game is simple to allow just about anyone to pick it up and play, yet still allows an immense sense of depth and tactics. I'm a huge miltary nerd when it comes to CQC tactics, needless to say I couldnt checkout fast enough when I figured out what this game actually was. It cures that tactical itch that hasen't been touched since the early Rainbow Six / Ghost recon days. Yeah it's THAT good. This game is an unforgiving monster, but at the same time is as sweet as candy when you know what your doing. Setting up your entire plan in one step, then watching all your men carry them out with precision... that's something that never fails to bring a smile to my face. I jumped on the bandwagon pretty early, and every alpha that gets released I find myself saying ""How did I live without this?""

								Door Kickers adds a great level of polish and accessibility to a hardcore tactical game. It plays quite similarly to Frozen Synapse, or the planning phase from old-school Rainbow 6, but your troopers are extremely easy to control and manage. You can either try to develop the perfect plan from the get-go, or pause the action and modify your plan on-the-fly as you react to enemy movement. Speaking of the enemy, the AI in this game is fantastic. The enemy AI will move around the map, patrol, react to sound and fighting, and surprise the hell out of you by flanking your men that you thought were perfectly surrounded in cover. Add to this a potent blend of customization, and wide range of tactical options at your disposal (you can play as a silent death squad, with all recon troops, or with a band of door-breaching shotgun-wielding fighters, or anything in between).

												Doorkickers is TOTALLY COMPELLING. You maneuver your team (often just two operatives in the early missions) through a space, using a waypoint order system - and you can pause at any time to issue new orders or completely change your plan. And every map has slightly randomized enemy placement, so you can't just learn the board and precisely plan for it; one run thru will go wonderfully, but on a second try for more points, both operatives will be killed when the enemy placement changes just a bit. So it becomes not about learning the maps, but learning good tactical discipline, regardless of the map. And enemies are smart; I've been snuck up on and ambushed. By going back through the early missions several times with untested, rookie operatives I was able to unlock the Assaulter class quite quickly - what has been described as a 'grind' looks a lot more like skill refinement, to me. When I got to a campaign mission and was completely owned - repeatedly - on the second map, I realized my command of my abilities was quite lacking, and went back to polish up. I've also been watching some enjoyably brief Let's Plays (by RedatMath) and seeing I haven't even used certain tools in my early arsenal, like the camera wand or breaching charges. So complaints of having to grind for simple tools don't resonate with me - the game feels like it's asking me to gain mastery with my starting toolset before widening it. Overall, I'm finding it a very enjoyable tactical hole to climb inside; there's always another way to handle a room, another challenge from a room with too many entrances, and another door that needs to be viciously kicked and stormed through. 10/10 would run in and get shot again.

												Honestly I love this game, I've own this game for about a couple days now, and I've already wasted 11 hours into it.I'm going to base this game on 3 categories: Price, A.I., Replayability1st the price 10/10. Well to be honest when I had first seen this game I thought it was a fairly simple game that would be worth, at max $5, but then I looked further into it, and for the amount of content this game offers $20 is more than a fair price. This game offers not only 6 seperate campaigns (With their own lengths and difficulties) 70+ missions (seperate from the campaigns) steam workshop availibility, but also your own map creator. Now honestly how many other games give you this much content for just $202nd the A.I 8/10. The A.I. could use some improvement I will admit, but people saying that the A.I. doesn't fortify in a room are wrong, the A.I. do fortify in rooms, for example on the single player mission Cartel Beach Party (Unfortunately the chief wasn't invited and was very displeased about it, so he had told a small handful of the best troopers to go in there and end the party.) the A.I. do fortify, how they fortify I will not tell, you'll have to find that out on your own. There a multitidue of other misisons the A.I. fortify on, but this mission is the best example (at least to my knowledge)3rd replayability 10/10. This game is all about replayability, there is tons of ways you could go about beating every mission, want to go full stealth ops on every mission? Go ahead! Want to just shotgun the sh!t out of everyone? Be my guest! Want to try and beat every mission with your most well seasoned trooper? Do as you please, no one is stopping you! Other than the multitude of ways you could go about beating every mission you can also challenge yourself by trying to beat your old highscores on every mission. (Or at least getting 3 stars on every mission)			"

												This is an amazing real-time strategy game. Not only does it have tons of content (5 classes, 70+ missions plus 5 campaigns with another 38 missions), it requires well-thought out plans to progress. This game makes you feel like a real SWAT commander, just like the old Rainbow Six and SWAT games. I also love how detailed the levels are. But the number 1 reason I love this game is the AI. Most enemies run to cover or hide, like real terrorists would, and as soon as they hear cops, they execute hostages (Which is why you need to be stealthy, just like the SWAT when they rescue people). Then there are operators who stealthily throw grenades through windows before you even see them (smart, huh?). The game may sound really difficult, and it is ( I had a to try a mission full of operators 600+ times! ). Luckily the game has a restart button you can press when somebody dies (unless you are playing iroman, like the hardcore.) My only complaints are some missions favour the AI, and there is one mission I cant get more than 1 star on because sometimes an enemy is outside the map. Overall, this was a great game that i enjoyed, and I look forward to any new games that Kill House may release. Graphics 7/10Gameplay 9.5/10Music 10/10Overall: 9/10 "

Overall, I'm finding it a very enjoyable tactical hole to climb inside; there's always another way to handle a room, another challenge from a room with too many entrances, and another door that needs to be viciously kicked and stormed through. 10/10 would run in and get shot again.

												Honestly I love this game, I've own this game for about a couple days now, and I've already wasted 11 hours into it.I'm going to base this game on 3 categories: Price, A.I., Replayability1st the price 10/10. Well to be honest when I had first seen this game I thought it was a fairly simple game that would be worth, at max $5, but then I looked further into it, and for the amount of content this game offers $20 is more than a fair price. This game offers not only 6 seperate campaigns (With their own lengths and difficulties) 70+ missions (seperate from the campaigns) steam workshop availibility, but also your own map creator. Now honestly how many other games give you this much content for just $202nd the A.I 8/10. The A.I. could use some improvement I will admit, but people saying that the A.I. doesn't fortify in a room are wrong, the A.I. do fortify in rooms, for example on the single player mission Cartel Beach Party (Unfortunately the chief wasn't invited and was very displeased about it, so he had told a small handful of the best troopers to go in there and end the party.) the A.I. do fortify, how they fortify I will not tell, you'll have to find that out on your own. There a multitidue of other misisons the A.I. fortify on, but this mission is the best example (at least to my knowledge)3rd replayability 10/10. This game is all about replayability, there is tons of ways you could go about beating every mission, want to go full stealth ops on every mission? Go ahead! Want to just shotgun the sh!t out of everyone? Be my guest! Want to try and beat every mission with your most well seasoned trooper? Do as you please, no one is stopping you! Other than the multitude of ways you could go about beating every mission you can also challenge yourself by trying to beat your old highscores on every mission. (Or at least getting 3 stars on every mission)			"

												Good game. Tactical RTS RPGish hybrid plenty of fun. The campaign however seems to suffer from bug in the second mission of the first campaign which lock you out of retrying if you hit continue instead of retry. Hope they will fix it soon. It's a very annoying bug and as far as i can tell the only fix right now is resetting your progress...			"

												One of the greatest, if not the best, tactical enforcement simulators I've used (that is available to the public).While not everything is 100% realistic, it is still real enough that it holds up well to real tactical situtations.Being that this is sold as a game, I wouldn't expect 100% realism anyway, as pure realism does not always equal any fun.WIth a large Steam Workshop community and some really high quality mods available, this game has everything you need to enjoy some serious tactical strategy.Also includes a well made level editor so you can create just about any scenerio you can think of.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Reviews: Door Kickers 

			Views: 691		

			Door Kickers is a top down tactical strategy game on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/248610/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

Door Kickers is a top down tactical, turn based SWAT-style game.  The game alsoallows for mods, and they provide the tools for player to generate new levels,adding to the already large amount of content the game contains and encouragingreplay-ability.  Each level includes stars to encourage proficient play, as wellas challenges for the missions, which also encourages players to replay levelsto try for better scores.The UI is basic click and drag, as you position your SWAT team members in eachmission to try to immobilize the enemy.  You cannot plan too far ahead, however,as the enemies randomize their patrol routes and pathing.  The gamealso utilizesthe restart function well, so that you can learn from mistakes and correct them.Weapons have a skill set, and individual players have skill sets as well, whichgives the players a chance to customize the game to their preference.  Thedifferent player abilities as well as the variety of weapons and their customi-zation are very well balanced.The abundance of variety in this game take away from any linear feel, as well asthe randomization of the enemies.  The game is very just, and at no time did Ifeel like my time was wasted.  This game does everything that it set out to verywell.  I enjoyed my time playing this game, and can easily recommend it.This is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a BloggerThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												9/10 As a cop myself this game is pretty damn kewl. It's a good way to excersice your mind after a long day. You really can control every thing the officers do. From where they look at exactly the right moment to when to reload and perfectly timing a breach into a building. High replayablility value as well. I've enjoyed going back to missions and trying different ways of completing them. Workshop content improves the game even more so adding even more customization. I like the fact that you have to upgrade the officers as well. The fact that they progress makes you start to choose favorites and invest yourself into the game further. 9/10			"

												Very solid game. Feel quite believable, everything is implemented with tradeoffs, all situation dependent so every mission really feels different.In terms of difficulty, they really manage to walk the thin line between easy but boring and hard but rewarding. I wouldn't quite call it unforgiving, I mean you don't ALWAYS pay for mistakes, but things can often go bad very easily if you don't pay attention.More importantly, I almost never felt like I should have been allowed to be able to do something but wasn't, never felt like it was unfair in any way nor does it feel like you're controlling idiots. Just to illustrate the point, there was no end to my frustration in Rainbow Six when I couldn't get my team to even throw a flashbang around corner, not comparing games themselves, just the feeling.

												I cannot recomment this game in good conscience.  It is a great concept, but its excecution is so flawed that it is often more frustrating than enjoyable!There are a number of bugs/flaws which makes for a frustrating experience.  For one, you cannot delete all the checkpionts, so you find yourself making mistakes and then having to undo your entire plan because a point that you definitely do not want, decides it wants to stay.On top of this, the men do not always listen to your commands.  I have a mission where I have to breach a number of doors and my men surprise me by deciding if and when to throw their flash bangs!  So I went to 80-90% success, only to have this kind of ridiculous mistake happen and have to start all over!Your men are in fact untrained dumbskies!  If, for example, they are told to breach a door, but that door gets opened by the enemy, your men get to that point and sit there like sitting ducks.  So you can have a perfect plan that goes down in flames because a door, which they think they need to breach is already open and they don't know what to do from there.The randomness is a bit too random, sometimes, baddies are just piled into a room, so a perfect plan goes bad because you simply cannot cover everyone.  In real life, thee men do not hang out in three corners of a room waiting for something to happen!There are a lot of missions and content, but they all seem to be the same.  It would have been much better if the missions were progressive, you learning new skills and dealing with intentional situations.  This feels like empty game play that is very redundant.These combined makes the game too frustrating to truly enjoy!			"

I also like the fact that my troops can be customized and level up assuming you can keep them alive...reminds me a bit of XCOM in that regard.  Overall, a great first impression and I'm looking forward to spending more time with this game.  It might be a bit much for some casual gamers as you will have to micromanage a bit, but it's easy to jump into given enough time.

												A very nice and strategic, top-down game where you control a squad of SWAT members. You can either plan your attack before hand and execute the perfect police-raid, or improvise and command your squad while in action. You can level your squad and unlock new weapons and equipment, like stun-grenades and tazers for non-lethal raids, or advanced combat rifles if you need to get a more hands on approach. Once you level up your squad you can attempt the Campaigns, where, if your members die, they actually die and you have to fare without them. Definetly worth the cheap price for a nice solo game experience.			"

								Door kickers is great. Its easy to understand but hard to master and the single screen levels are great for killing five mins here and there. The game is about guiding a Armed team of presumably cops through a level capping bad guys, saving hostages and defusing bombs. It’s like a top down version of rainbow six. The levels are varied as are the unit types and the game play is fast yet addictive. You’ll want to get you times as fast as possible while incurring no team deaths again very similar to rainbow six. I also respect the developers of this indie title, they’ve been working hard to continually update the game and the updates are always big deals that add a lot of new content or features. They are also very good at interacting with their consumers and those that bought the game early. It’s jus t anice touch of class that is sometimes lacking. The integration of Steam Workshop is also awesome. In all Doorkickers is awesome and I’ve spent a lot of time with it. I genuinely look forward to the next update as they always do something pretty cool. "

												Ah, now this is a great game, I was quite surprised as I am a fps fan and not much for the RTS Genre, but this just feels amazing, that feeling you get when you plan everything to the dot and everything works perfectly! I recommend this game to anyway who is interested in tactical strategy in real-time! 9/10 would kick door again!!			"

Early Access Review
								I have an addiction for this game. With its FTL style pause and play, real time gameplay it provides a challenge that keeps you engaged for hours. Obviously there are a few bugs and glitches but in all fairness it is in alpha. I cant wait to see the campaign mode implemented and, hopefully, a multiplayer mode.I would recommend this game as i have played a few hours of it and believe that i have already got my moneys worth.

												It is a fun tactical game. Sadly for me it got quite repetitive quite soon. As I got it from sale then I am very happy with this game, but I probably wouldn't buy it for the full price.I have a feeling like I have missed somekind of functionality in this game, but some missions (especialy the hostage rescue ones) are just not fun. In some missions I have a feeling it is more down to luck then my planning.I really loved the squad mechanics in this game* Squad members actually getting killed* How the skill and equipment system worksThings that annoyed me the most:1) Windows. Why on earth can't the guys duck under window so they would not be seen.2) No controll on who shoots who. In hostage rescue missions I attack the room from both sides and my guys don't care that there is hostage between you and the bad guy.3) Also the AI is stupid and way too predictable (no fleeing, no surrendering). I accidentally threw flashbang outside a room where hostages are being held. Instead of shooting the hostage some bad guys just ran out of the room so I could easily kill them.... why thank you, but not realistic behavor.Overall it is a nice game.			"

												This game is great.At the first glance,I thought this game got no intrests from me.Its graphics aren't amazing, its weapons systeams are limited even with Workshop weapons-It doesn't support any weapon modifications,which means if you wanna get a silenced weapon,you have to unlock a weapon with silencer instead of unlocking a silencer.But all these don't really matter.+Good Feeling dealing with bad guys.+You will feel satisified when your Flash Bangs blind thugs.+Tons of levels.+Die thousands of times.+Good ranking systeams.+Map generater and Map editors.+Workshop and Cloud.-Grapics aren't top-classed.-Musics are not impressive.-Get tired when play too long.

												Door Kickers is basically top down Rainbow Six. My only complaint about the game is that some times it boils down to rushing the same tactic over and over again until RNGesus smiles upon you and lets you win. That aside, the game is quite fun.			"

												Really nice squad level pause-enabled RTS with a SWAT theme. I've played both this and Breach and Clear and like both but Door Kickers gives you a little more control over precision operations. Think of a top-down Rainbow Six, with role-playing game elements too. Very addicting for those interested in this type of game, and with lots to do: plenty of single missions with achievements, several campaigns, a random scenario generator, and a map maker. There are already many user-made contributions to the community. The developer really seems to enjoy working on this game and there is what seems to be pretty good involvement on their site's bulletin board. This game is a steal on sale and bargain even at regular price.			"

												Impressevly good tactical strategy. Last time I was so exited by tactial game in 2005, it was SWAT4. Door Kickers is something middle of SWAT4 and Frozen Synapse. Before the mission you picking troopers and gear like it was in SWAT4, and mission gameplay is very similar to Frozen Synapse, but here you can set pause whenever you want.The game has a lot of content: 5 classes of troopers, lots of unlockable guns, 3 branches in perks tree, 5 campains, more then 80 single missions, level editor and level generator(!). If it's not enough for you, visit Steam Workshop, there are a lot of extra content created by community. As I can see the game is fully moddable - guns mods, realism mods and visual mods are available.Game control is very tabletishh, but as i can see there is no tablet version of this game. Another bad thing is that Door Kickers is single player game only, but as written in description of the game - ""(but MP might come later)"".4/5			"

												A fantastic squad-based shooter. I played both this and Breach and Clear in close proximity to one another and love the flexibility Door Kickers in how you play it - you can play it as nearly a RTS and give commands on the fly (though you can't give commands to bulk groups of folks) or you can draft a single plan for the entire mission for all of your troopers - complete with commands to synchronize actions - or anywhere in between (I tend to plot out the first room or two and then react dynamically to whatever is happening by pausing and drawing up new plans for the next few seconds).Cons - you do tend to see the same layouts over and over again - even with random missions, troopers aren't radically different from one another in their personalities.I also wish that there was some form of negotiation option to try to talk to folks while also inserting your SWAT team and performing recon or stealth takedowns - something approaching aspects of SWAT 2 with occasional non-violent resolutions. I do wish that more missions featured 4 man teams.Great tactical game and an absolute blast. Very much recommend this title.			"

												    Door Kickers. Tactical, top down simulation game in which you are in full control of a highly trained SWAT team. Oh yeah, it's brilliant.    The objectives are usually very straight-forward: eliminate all hostiles (or tangos, as they call them), save the captives and/or apprehend the suspects(s). However, every level offers a new location, with unpredictable enemy spawns and new tactics to be developed. Over time and the completion of missions four new classes will be unlocked: Pointman (the starter  class), Assualter (essentially a Pointman with an assualt rifle), Shield (carries a tactical shield which takes most damage), Breacher (shotgun wielding units for close quarters combat and making dramatic entrances) and Stealth (probably the most dynamic, effective classes, although more difficult to design practical tactics for). Stars earned in finishing levels quickly and with minimal casualties can be spent on new weapons and tools.     The main thing to know is the freedom that this game offers. There are so many ways to fulfil objectives that it is unlikely that in a group of 100 people (maybe even more), one person will use the same tactics and methods of completing the mission. You can choose what units you use, where to put them, where to move them from there, how to enter a building, when to enter a building, and many more.     There are, however, a few cons to this game. For instance, it is very common for the game to quit responding while launching for the first time in a while. After quiting and relaunching all is normally resolved, though it is worth mentioning. Also, unit control occasionally will act up, allowing me to only control one officer at once. A simple quit of the level will normally fix the issue though. I am fully aware of how unimportant these are, and in turn will note these are not significant enough to be a reason to not purchase the game.    All in all, Door Kickers is a marvelous example of how games of the genre should be, and deserves more attention. I would give it 9/10. Well done, Killhouse.			"

Rank: 7.5/10Recommendation(s): Be roughly familiar with firearms terminology.Major Theme: Well constructed, UGC friendly, top down tactics shooter.Bought at Price: $5.50 (Steam Sale)I quite enjoyed this game, but I certainly wouldn’t place it into the “must play” or “should play” for most people.

If you are not familiar with some of the firearms terminology used extensively throughout the game, you will find that things don’t make sense. One such example is level III vs. IIIA armor. There’s a wide selection of gear to pick from (a surprise in such games), and purely picking based on stats and names will lend you a bad time.That being said, 12 hours of gameplay certainly gets across the point of the game, and that’s where you should find yourself with a complete campaign, and all the weapons you want unlocked.

Unlocks in this game are very much like other games in this genre, where points/stars from mission ratings allow you to unlock gear and weapons. If you end up doing poorly, you will obviously receive fewer stars and thus less gear and weapons.Levels and campaigns are unique and interesting – but just as in Breach & Clear – the maps could do with more dynamic elements to them. Perhaps this will be explored in Door Kickers 2?

To tide players over until the release of the next game, Door Kickers extensively supports user generated content (UGC), where you can add more maps, UI changes, and core gameplay changes as well. The level editor could have used more polish, but certainly does get the job done.Just recently I have noticed stuttering in my game for a few seconds here and there. I haven’t been able to track down the source of this, but it’s manageable. Your experience will most likely be different in this regard.If you are in a tussle in choosing between Door Kickers and Breach & Clear, I would recommend Door Kickers. You can see my review on the other game, as well as note the large difference in playtime I have.			"

												This is a game that could have made soo much more fun for me but sadly they made 1 stupid story mission impossible for me to successfully make it thru without getting one of my soldiers killed. It is not only the point that I didnt made that particular mission, but this mission made me feel like any weapon you achieve and any soldier you upgrade - well that all this doesnt matter. There are heavy foes that sometimes (if they want to kill) your whole squad OR if you lucky get killed like stupid dolls - there is just such a big random luck factor that I dearly dislike: 1. enemys will behave and spawn differently each time you start a map 2. your guys sometimes kill 10 heavy guys in a row without getting shot and you dont even really aim that prezisely at them, and sometimes they get killed by one guy but having the same equipment worn as with the previous with which you had killed 10 foes in a row and at the same areas and stuff. 3. I played the whole non story mission stuff and unlocked good guns, armor but it rarely made an impact on that one particular mission. Plus, I leveld my soldiers too.I was at a point were I really began to love this game - but now I hate it thoroughly - now it seems to me that I've wasted a lot of time for nothing. I deleted it and I never want to play this game again.  "

												This' a great game that reminds me of Swat 4 I have played this game for many hours to only finish the skirmishes I still havent played the campaign, with many more skirmishes coming excluding all the community mods.Pros:-- Lots of replayability - Lots of weapons, equipment, unit potrate art and 5 unique classes- Strategic Cons:-- The SWAT team is slightly trigger happy they'd rather kill you than arrest you. (American Police?)- If I want to arrest someone I have to equip taser, shoot, manually (breaks gameflow and orignal plan execution) order them to arrest criminal then switch back to main weapon. The arresting mechanic would have been better if after a flashbang you can scream ""everyone down"" or shoot the leg or arm but no its only as I stated earlier.- After the sledgehammer and bolt cutters are deployed the swat member freezes for about 3 seconds instead of getting out of the way making them a target to enemy fire immediately dying. The developers could have had them automatically move out the way instead of just standing there getting killed simtanously preventing his teammates shooting back. Non of the cons are game breakers there are ways around them but if it wasnt for the cons this game would have been perfect.			"

A review for ""Door Kickers""What is ""Door Kickers""? As you probably already know - it is tactical real-time strategy that puts you in command of a SWAT squad. Of course, this game has some squad based mechanics that are similar to ones of games like XCOM (managing squad, class system, various equipment, leveling up, researching new skills, etc.). However, unlike XCOM, the gameplay here is real-time based which makes it much more engaging. The way orders to units are given can be a bit complicated, but soon you will realize that it's quite simple. Talking about controlling units, you can prepare a plan for them before starting the mission or you can give orders on the go; it's all up to you. The game has a lot of missions and most of them are quite challenging. There is also a random level generator and, if you are creative person, you can use the tool for creating custom levels. All in all, the game is really nice; the only downside is grafics quality - It's not that bad but it could be more deatailed. I would not recommend buying this game for it's full price, but be sure to grab it when it's on sale.My rating: 8/10P.S. By the way, this game also has a ""replay"" feature, that allows you, upon successful completion of the mission, to watch how your SWAT team swiftly secured the building and saved hostages and even save the replay as a videofile.

												I like what this game going for.  However, I have several problems with this game.Editing paths when making a plan  is a hassle.  I wish it was something I can overlook but since it's the main tool to use in the game,  I can't.  It's not efficient so you have to workaround the problems with UI. I really hope they clean this up with door kickers 2, if not then I'll be pretty disappointed with that game.  I don't think this game would have such positive reviews if everyone had to finish the missions without pausing since the there are several issues with UI.I like how the AI reacts to your actions such as busting down a door.  I'm not too fond of them being able to spawn in random/different locations.  The reason for this is because it can be tedious coming up with a solid plan as editing paths are a pain. If they imrpove the UI in door kickers 2 then I wouldn't mind random spawns for enemies.  You may find several problems with your plan if it involves flashbangs.   Switching between pause and real time sort of eliminates some of the problems that come up when making a plan.   It's cool in a way, I'm glad it's there, but then it's not really challenging.  $15 would be a more appropriate price tag in my opinion.  BUGS:An obnoxious buzzing sound that won't go away happens often when loading a new level.  Usually, it goes away when you restart so it's not a big issue.  But I saw iron man mode? that you can enable and I believe it mentioned something about not being allowed to restart missions.  I don't know if it causes a problem there.			"

												Door kickers is a game about kicking doors and shoot up the place...no really it's pretty much that. The game has you planning and executing plans from a top down view in which you can setup your teams of Swat officers and plan their route to breach, bang and clear the mission. Want to deal with a room full of enemies watching the doors? Simple you can set your 2 teams of officers to each door and have them kick the door in or blow the door open, then flash and start shooting everyone dead. It feels wonderful.==========The Good==========1. Gameplay - Having this feeling of being a swat team commander or a tactical planner is rather fun but also difficult as you must plan every step to ensure the mission goes to plan. You have to adapt to the situation because if you don't you can get your team killed or a hostage. Lucky the game gives you many options to do your job, you can customize your officers giving them from aggressive equipment such as riot shields, grenades, breaching charges and your weapons of choice from SMG to shotguns. However you also can go in more passive using stun grenades, tasers or even take everyone out quietly with silencers to make it as if you were never there.It goes the same with planning the mission, you can plan every step, every choice such as blowing up a door, using flash or grenade or just kick doors. You can also set it where you can play the mission yourself having full control over each unit in real time or you can set everything up with waypoints and execution orders (they allow you to set up when to breach or move out or hold a location) and simply watch your plan come to life. 2. Levels - I found the level designs rather fun and enjoyable. You have levels with multiple floors, some with windows in which sometimes you have a sniper element that can help take out targets for you. And on top of that you can use their ingame map editor to make your own crazy missions. There are also a lot of missions to play through and 3 stories to go through with the cool element of if you lose an officer...they stay dead...no replacement making it a bit more challenging.=======The 50/50=======1. Difficulty - There are times where missions can feel very difficult and needs the best plan or just luck to win. This can be annoying at times but overall it helps fuels the challenge of being a tactical planner. For example there are missions where you must save a hostage and disarm a bomb however if you plan the mission poorly you can end up having a hostage shot or the bomb going off before you reach it...making timing everything. So expect to re-work your plans over and over.======Overall======It's a fun police type tactical shooter for those wanting to either take control of each unit and do everything real time or be a planner and watch your plan go to work. There is again a lot of customization and maps to play to keep you busy and most of all a lot of enemies to deal with.   "

												85/100Solid SWAT game..(very similar to ""Breach & Clear"", but view from above like ""Frozen Synapse"")easy to spend 30+hours without even touching the Campaign ;)PRO:-Quite realistic Level-Design (decorations, surroundings, sounds, ..)-Different classes for each merc (can be changed fast before missions)-Favorite Template for each class can be saved -> faster adjustment of merc equipment-Completing missions earns you points (1-3 depending on your performance)-Extra Challenges for each mission get you additional EXP-lots of weapons to enable (for earned points)CON:-Skill development is maxed at lvl 21-Some missions are plain unfair-Some weapons+skills are not worth it (too weak)-A few missions+challenges are just possible after hours of reloadingI recommend it for anyone loving Stealth games, especially Breach´n Clear , Frozen Synapse and similar games.Birdview from above might not be as much enjoyable though ,if you´re used to 3D Stealth-action aka Splinter Cell /Metal Gear /..

												This game is totally worth it's price. You are in command of your own SWAT team which task is to: defuse bombs, kill terrorists or cartel members, rescue hostages and escort VIPs. While playing trough the different campaigns or single missions you earn points to spend on your equipment and your doctrine. It includes a map editor and an active mod community. "

												I have to say, for its worth, it's a pretty solid and sure game. Interesting take on the ""breach and secure"" scenarios presented with Law-enforcement/Police agencies. Complicated at first, however given time and some basic understanding, works out pretty well, and thus allows for more complex operations to be tried out!Really good, I quite like it, nice little tactical-top-down breach and clear game. First of it's kind to address this kind of genre, from what I can see.Thumbs up all round!			"

												Anyone who wants a well styled and easy to learn but hard to master game , Door Kickers should be next on your buy list. When the game is first played many feel the top down style would only hinder the experience if anything it only enhances it as it makes you feel you have complete control over the situation creating a awesome experience.Easy controls make the first few levels a walk in the park but full on hostage situations where the criminals are armed to teeth your going to need a plan from the start. Nothing is more satisfying than clearing a room full of gang members, defusing a bomb and then getting that 3 star rating.			"

								Door Kickers. What can I say?Door Kickers to me is a superb, real time, action-filled, strategic and sometimes infuriating Police game. Fancy taking charge of your own SWAT team that can kick down (almost any) door or blow it up? Want to shoot people and be overly happy when you complete a mission that took AGES but you finally mastered it? Of course you do and Door Kickers is it.To be serious though the interface is very intuitive if sometimes a bit fiddly  and the stop-time FTL style mechanic means you can keep on top of everything even in the middle of a firefight. The only major thing wrong with Door Kickers is that you MUST be prepared to be patient and repeat missions: on more than one occasion I have yelled and got generally angry with both myself and the enemies, so yeah, be patient, it is worth it in the end. Few other minor things but excusable for a Beta!9/10 Would kick again.			"

								Kicking down doors has never been so much fun. In fact, I don't remember the last time I had this much fun kicking down a door with my mighty boot of door bashiness.I have been longing to play a tactical game of this sort. I was dissapointed by the previous Jagged Alliance (the kickstarter one looks nice, but time will tell), slightly bored like Frozen Synapse (which I might add, is a pretty damn good game, but the presentation didn't work out for me).  Door Kickers made the cut for me. Of course, we had the amazing X-Com. But there's something about Door Kickers. Is it the speed at which your plan is executed? The thrill of raiding a villa full of bad guys and unlucky hostages and making it out without a single casualty on the good guy side? Door Kicker is simply amazing.Great presentation, sound and above all, gameplay. Amazing detailed top down views from your average training killhouse to villas and apartments. Great system for planning out your moves, and your swat guy armaments and tool are great, from trusty crowbar to m4s and boots of door bashing+1. Be it in real time or pausy-planning-unpausy-time, the gameplay feels rewarding. And it's always a pleasure taking down those horde of baddies :)Door Kicker win the cake for me, as a rewarding, well thought out, tactical game.			"

They have diiferent classes with different specialties which can vary the different ways you play the game. It have a workshop with lots of mods which  find to be good: knowing that I use the workshop alot in other games! It's a good game for what  I think is a good price in my opinion!			"

												Strategic and sometimes brutally difficult. There are some moments where the game is downright frustrating and forces a lot of trial and error upon you. Carefully planning a mission, seeing everything work out, making it to the final door and then losing the mission because a hostage gets shot a millisecond before you shoot the bad guy...and then having to start all over...not the best game design choice.Still, when the game mechanics work, it is a lot of fun.Also contains a load of content for a game at this price.

												Very good game. Easy to learn gameplay, combined with a multitude of tactical options. It is like a top down Rainbow Six operation. It is worth its money, especially if you are going for the challenges too. It is very satisying when a plan succeeds, having covered every possibility and without any member of the team out of action. The difficulty is progressive and it depends on the mission layout and the positioning of the opponents so that the game does not feel repetitive. If you like small unit close quarters tactics, this is the game.			"

Early Access Review
								I highly recommend this game, it's awesome! Even being in Early Access. Usually I'm pretty hesitant on buying Early Access titles, but I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I used to play alot of Frozen Synapse - its just my kind of game. The top down perspective allows me to practice the tactics I training I received in the Marines. And you'll hear that alot from some players: that they play the game exactly the way they would react and conduct these situation in reality. It's no surprise to me that they've gotten a contract to create a simulation title specifically for military and law enforcement, the expressed purpose to be for training and small unit tactics.Guys, if you're into individual tactics and clearing a building room by room, as well as the intensity involved in jusst not knowing what may be around the next corner for your men, this is the game for you. I purchased the stuff of legends package from their site, which allowed me to not only have a portrait of me in the game for the troopers, but also gave me feature voting rights in the forums. Trust me, the final game is gonna be awesome! It's worth every penny you'll be paying for it.			"

Door KickersI picked up Door Kickers during the summer sale, planning on spending some time in it while I was stuck using a laptop out of state. I was pleasantly surprised in many ways, and while this title does have a few setbacks it is a fairly fun indie title that I can't help but praise.GraphicsDoor Kickers is a top-down 2D tactics game, meaning I will critique it less for level of detail and more for art-style and consistency. The official content is appealing to look at, though a SWAT team wearing tan uniforms is an odd sight. Community-created content varies, but in general the game looks fairly decent. My primary complaint is that textures will become blurry as you zoom in. You'll also notice that the enemies you face will regularly use the same sprites, and that levels reuse quite a few assets between each-other.

AudioThis game features fairly decent audio design, but my main complaint is how repetitive the ambient sounds are. You'll start hearing the same voices on TVs and radios, and the same shouts emanating from mooks before they are helplessly gunned down by your troops. Eventually, you'll find yourself repeating the TV announcers in your head, staying a second ahead of their words. I will complement game for its soundtrack, though; it works well, is pleasant to listen to, and suits the style/setting of Door Kickers.PerformanceThis game performs very well on virtually any system, due to its 2D sprite-based nature. No issues there, as I would've hoped.GameplayDoor Kickers revolves around planning out an entry route for a SWAT team in various situations, where your primary goal is typically to eliminate all hostiles and possibly defuse a bomb in the process. It is fast-paced, unforgiving, and fun to play. However, there are a few faults with it. The unlock system prevents you from accessing very interesting content such as the Stealth class until after you've spent multiple hours in-game, and the planning system seems to be developed with touchscreens in mind, which makes the process of modifying orders that have already been created very difficult at best. Despite this, I still found that it was fun enough to last for quite a few hours, and I still haven't finished even a third of the game's content.

Community ContentDoor Kickers does well in this regard, featuring a built-in mod menu and map/mission editor. It doesn't allow for extensive feature modification, but new weapons, armor, maps, and enemies can be created with ease, and existing ones can be modified to your heart's content. I definitely approve of the game's position here.VerdictDoor Kickers is a very fun indie title to waste some time on, thanks to its light weight, fast-paced yet tactical gameplay which is sure to appeal to fans of Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon. However, I don't believe its production value is quite high enough to justify a purchase at full price. It's definitely fun, but it isn't quite $19.99 wholesale fun. I will be keeping my eye on the development of its sequel, 'Door Kickers 2 - Task Force North', however, as that title looks like it will have considerably higher production value and quality.I would recommend Door Kickers, but would suggest waiting for a sale.

												If you enjoy tactical games you'll love this game. You control a SWAT team and you can outfit your members with a variety of bullet resistant vests, flashbangs and stun grenades, assault rifles, shotguns, and handguns. Wonderful game, hours of contents packed in it, plus mods.			"

								A game with solid mechanics and well executed game experience.The game has just released its beta, but I've been around it since day two from alpha stage and I tell you - worth the price. You get used to it pretty fast and it takes just seconds to realise how everything works. Levels are fun and challenging and after you have kicked the doors in with three stars, you really wanna enjoy and look the smooth replay how well your special squad saves the day!Important thing to know - game has level editor and mods from players, so you are free to customize your experience.On scale 0-10:Fun: 8/10Sounds: 7/10Graphics: 8/10Go and buy the game. This is a must for people who love strategy.			"

								This is one of the best games ever. I'm not kidding. I have quite a few games; all Battlefields, CS:GO, Rust, DayZ, numerous race games, all Hitmans, but I prefer this game. Why?Well, I love this game, you can play it anytime, any duration that you like. Spend fifteen minutes on a plan, or just rush in and control all the troopers in real-time. I prefer a combination, planning a bit ahead and then work further in real-time.Cons:- I like the police versus criminals idea- I like the old-fashion top-down view- I like that you (new feature!) can throw grenades and flashbangs around corners- I like the ballistic shields and different weapons- I like the different roles (shotgun, rifle, pistol, etc.)What should improve:Nothing in general, it's a good game. Okay, the AI could use some more unpredictability.Summary: I love this game! :D			"

												I'm not one to write many reviews nor do I often play tactics based games like this.  The fact that I am writing a positive review for this game refelects how enjoyable I have found it.  I love the level challenges and find that the difficulty is set just right.  My biggest disappointment is that a very well thought out run can be won or lost by the random location of enemies and/or the enemies' marksmanship.  Sometimes you can blitz through a level with impressive results but re-run a level you only needed a minor tweak to, in order to improve your time, can result in you looping thorugh the exact same plan 30 times before it works again.There are so many areas to work with and a varied set of levels, plus the ability to make your own or import others, that it keeps you playing.  The RPG like development of team members also adds a good dimension to the gameplay, especially if you play through all the levels with a single squad memberOverall I'd give this game 8 out of 10, the effect of randomising the enemies being the main issue.  I don't expect it to be exactly the same every time but it needs to reduce the luck factor.			"

								Door Kickers is an Action/Strategy game which puts you in command of a S.W.A.T. team. you must use planning and tactics to complete the objective (such as rescuing hostages or defusing a bomb) and keep your squad alive.The game is played from a top-down perspective and nearly all of the missions revolve around storming a building. there is a variety of weapons and gadgets to aid you in completing the objective. ( such as spy camera's to look under doors, or flashbangs to temporarily blind enemies) With the introduction of BETA. you can now customise the appearance of the member of your squad. as well as change their names and callsigns.The game also includes a sort of skill tree which allows you to grant extra skills to your squad using points earned by completing levels. there is a variety of skills and more will be implemented as the game develops. (My favourite skill is the one that allows stealth members to hold fire until ordered to shoot)The game also includes different types of S.W.A.T. members. like shotgunners. assualters. stealth ETC. each mission is different and requires careful planning and certain classes will be more efffective than others.finally the game features steam workshop integration. making it possible to create and download user created maps, weapons, gadgets and more!In conclusion. this is a game that is definately worth buying. if you like strategy games. You will like this. The game is currently in BETA and will be updated to include more gear and a campaign mode. i definately recommend it.			"

 Door Kickers! It's a late night, I ned sleep, but instead I'm writing reviews.  Why? Anyway, I'll make it a moderate sized review I guess, TL;DR at the bottom. Instead of going over every detail like other reviews, I'll go over the little  nooks and crannies only , and not in any order, so let's get to it!  I have a lot more hours on Door Kickers than it seems, I've played the iPad version a lot and lots of offline hours. Progession This game is pretty nice on progression to be honest. You have one class (I'll go over the classes in a second} and as your squad ""levels"" up, you obtain new classes,  until you get all 5 of them. There are also  stars , which you get for completing certain challenges, such as playing the mission using a single plan, or playing without ever pausing in real-life. With stars, you can buy  new weapons, armor and pretty much everything else . Every time your squad levels up, you get  doctorine points . These can be used to teach our squad special tactics, making them more effective.  Replayablity This game has a  nice freaking sheet  ton of replayablity. The AI makes  different decisions  and spawn in different preset spots (so they  can and will  repeat). There are a ridiculous amount of ways to complete each mission, be it with continuous sync throughout, splitting up to speed it up, or just trying out the best weapons for every situation!  Let's not forget that there's a  ♥♥♥♥ing mission generator  that ♥♥♥♥♥ out missions for you to play that feel like a normal one! Also the steam workshop is utilized pretty well so you can find lots of maps made by people using the level editor. Music   Meh.  The music is alright, but then it just starts turning into some dubstep crap, but if you're fine with a 60 seconds of dubstep or just love it in general, then you'll like it. Gamemodes (WIP)These are the gamemodes you'll play  Clear Hostiles Hostage Rescue Stop Execution Bomb DefusalArrest WarrentDope RaidsRobbery In Progress Some of the above, on a ship or plane or something really cool like that. WIP YEs, I'm tired, I'd appreciate a like or two pretty please though! I'll work on it very soon! "

												I'm so glad this project finally finished and become much much better.I'm an old school gamer. I bought this game the first day it showed on steam as alpha. I played a lot of Rainbow Six 1&2 in the past, and this game brings me the same atmosphere and feeling.The developers are very friendly and fixed the bug I reported very quickly. They also surprise me as well. With the random generator, we can bring more fun and custom fan missions.Overall, it's a good game, especially for a gamer like me. Bring back the old memories.			"

												An excellent tactical top down simulation of SWAT raids.Pro's:- varied tactical options- Extensive planning options that are remiscent of the Rainbow Six prescenario phase.- RPG element allowing SWAT members to level + there is an overall specialization tree for your team.- A wide variety of weapons and equipment: firearms, explosives, gadgets and more.- a series of nice campaigns- a variety of portraits, options to rename and give callsigns.- diverse and fun scenarios- combat, hostage evacuation, retrieving evidence,... all passes the revue.- easy moddability and already a nice amount of quality content out there.Negatives:- Visuals could've been better.- More portraits would've been nice.- Some sort of good/decent co-op mode would've been fun and interesting.- An option to be the opposing player in specific and difficult scenarios would have been interesting.Global judgement:A must have for fans of tactical combat, extensive planning, tactical puzzles and 'SWAT'.

												In Door Kickers, you take control of a SWAT team in a variety of different hostile situations. It is a top down, 2D realtime strategy game that allows you to make critical decisions at a moment's notice or plan entire missions from the very beginning of an operation. After a few hours of playing the Single Missions, I fell in love with Door Kickers. The controls are simple and easy to understand, and watching your plans in action is always satisfying. The sheer amount of different scenarios, ranging from hostage situations to raiding criminal headquarters, makes each mission feel like a new tactical challenge for your SWAT team. With 6 campaigns, 70+ Official Single Missons, Level Generator, unlockable gear, and downloadable mods, Door Kickers has plenty of content to keep you busy.Although I enjoyed Door Kickers, there are a few minor flaws. The game offers you dozens of unlockable gear such as guns and equipment, but I found myself using what I was comfortable with and had no trouble throughout the game. My only incentive to unlock and test all the guns was for the achievement. Also, there were a few situations in the Single Missions and Campaign that feel unbalanced and in favor of the AI.Overall, Door Kickers was an addicting and enjoyable strategy game from start to finish.

												Great tactical game. Takes a bit to get used to the UI but it works well once learned, it's not a standard rip-off of the Starcraft of C&C interface and this is why people might have a bit of a learning curve before you can get into the gameplay. It only took my an hour to get almost everything memorized, not that bad. This game has random maps, pre-made single maps and campaigns. Going through the single maps alone would take a long long time. Campaigns can take a while especially if you have to restart some particularly overly hard missions. Once you play all those most games would be done and become boring, right? Luckily there is a random map generator. You can set size and enemy parameters, and since you don't know exactly what you are going to run in to it ends up being fun for long periods. Even if I have 5 minutes I can run one or two random killhouse maps. Or if I want to spend 3 hours playing a tactical game I can and it still doesn't get dull.Tactically there are various ways to overcome each scenario. You can lockpick a locked door or break it down, or you can use special tools to lockpick it faster or break it faster but these tools take up an inventory slot and are heavier. Or you could use a breacher with a shotgun, but that shotgun becomes the primary weapon and is only useful at short range. There is a give and take to each option and all are viable pending your playstyle and how you want to approach that whole level. And this is just locked doors. The constant variation in the maps and multiple ways to approach each type of situation keeps it varied. Some maps you cannot flank the armored guy and have to face him head on, if you do not have the right equipment you will likely suffer. Sometimes there are too many rooms to flashbang each one so you have to adapt to opening doors and clearing rooms in a different way sweeping around the corner from a wider angle. The game doesn't feel dull even after a long time playing. Gameplay is top-notch and the devs plan on adding to it with co-op and multiplayer eventually. This game has longevity, it hasn't gotten dull yet and I have plenty of hours in it already. It can be played in short spurts or long sessions without an issue. It's a tactical game that requires some thinking. Controls are more than functional and become natural to use with a little bit of time in the game to do exactly what you want down to smaller details like how you want to walk around a corner with a sweeping curve instead of walking straight in. There are various classes that all play differently and can change your play style immensely from one map to another depending on team loadout. You can respec your doctrine points aka skills and you can change classes freely any time you want. I have nothing but good things to say about this game so yes I recommend it. It has been on sale a few times but even full price this is a good one to pick up.			"

												This is an incredibly addictive strategy game whereby you command a team of SWAT officers in raids on various compounds.  This game boasts a fairly hefty list of single missions, and a number of multi-layered campaigns.  The briefings are simple, with no overblown storyline - just the basic facts of how many Tangos, and what your objectives are.  How you go about assaulting the compounds is essentially up to you.The player generally gets to command a team of 2-8 officers that, as you progress grow in skill.  The more you play, the more unlocks become available, allowing even more playing styles through different classes (Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth, and Shield).Insertion points are fixed, but there are generally some options as to where your team will start from, and who you include on the assault.The game provides an interesting playing experience with it being almost turn-based - but not.  The player has the ability to pause the game and command their officers in where to move, where to look, and basic actions.  This can be done in real time, but more success is had by trusting in your officers AI.  At any point, if you feel your orders aren't working, you can freeze time and change your commands, allowing you to command (somewhat) on the fly.I picked this game up on sale earlier today and have spent around 6 hours playing - so the value for money is high.This is a great game for short stints - allowing you to log in and make an attempt or two at a difficult target, without too much commitment out of your day.  Or, you can just spend hours grinding your way through the various levels.The game is very much like chess, where you need to think a few moves ahead.Basic knowledge of MOUT/urban warfare can help, but trial and error can eventually be as effective.  Just remember to check those corners!The AI Tangos are quality, with numerous classes to go up against.  Just don't be upset if a hostage taker decides to kill their comodoty before they turn the gun on you.The UI isn't perfect and I still fumble with issuing breaching commands on a 'go command', but remember the 7 P's and you'll do alright:  'Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents♥♥♥♥♥♥Poor Performance'.4/5			"

Early Access Review
								With a loud 'crump' the door turned from 50 year old hardwood, into matchsticks in the blink of an eye. In one fluid motion two armed men stormed through the breach, in a coordinated strike, with all the precision of years of training they checked the room for hostiles. ""CLEAR!"" the first officer shouted, echoed a moment later by his partner, following in behind them two more armed police moved into the room, leap frogging their comrades positions to take up covering overwatches.Stacking up either side of the next door, one officer leaned forwards, ready to open the door, the second officer priming a flashbang, pin pulled he looked to his colleague and nodded. Turning the handle and throwing the door open the first officer stood back, raising his sleek compact submachine gun, the second tossing the live grenade into the room, an ear splitting bang, and a blinding flash stunning the hostage taker inside, the officers moved in with lethal grace, one three round burst of fire and the aggressor was down, the second officer kneeling to cheek the hostage was unarmed.Door Kickers is a tense top down tactical simulation game, you control a squad of specialist counter-terrorism/hostage rescue officers. You unlock equipment (and soon traits) with stars awarded for completing the levels with no casualties and under the time limit. The interface is clean and easy to use, the controls slick and intuitive, it takes moments to learn but knowing how to control your team is only the start of it.Learning the best combinations of weapons and tactics will prove harder, the game is unforgiving, but in a good way, when you've made a mistake you'll know it, forget to check a corner? You'll pay for it when the 'empty room' turns out to be hiding a hostile with a Mac-10.The game has just recently entered into Beta stage, and it's well worth the money, bugs are few and far between and it runs well and looks great.

Early Access Review
								Do you remember Rainbow Six's famous planning phase? Did you enjoy that part of the game more than the actual mission? If you answered yes to these questions, Door Kickers is a worthwhile investment.The game's core features right now are quite good. There is a slight learning curve to get your guys moving the way you want. Sometimes you will feel like you are micromangaging movements especially if you want to execute proper room clearing techniques. And occasionally you get angry at the pathing system since there are numerous house plants and chairs which create impassable barriers. But it is still fun. There are definitely a good number of missions available of varying difficulty. Some you will breeze right through, others will be the bain of your existence until you get that perfect plan with 0 casualties working just right. Also the random mission generator is always good if you are looking for a quick challenge. As well as replaying missions trying to achieve the single-plan and hands-off achievements. The loadouts are varied and offer a decent sized arsenal. It is mostly reflective of what a police SWAT team would have available. One gameplay feature I like is how your team really practices good trigger discipline (single shots if possible). While the bad guys will often go full auto at the slightest of targets. One thing that is not completely apparent in the loadout section of the game is what effects do the equipment have on your team. You'll notice in cramped interiors, it takes the man with the M4 longer to train his rifle than the man weilding his pistol. But for those long corridor or outdoor shots, your Assaulter with his rifle is far more efficient than your rear guard weiding his shotgun. Sadly none of this is explicitly described in the loadout menu and will take some experimentation to figure out what the ideal loadout is based on your style of play and the mission. The graphics and sound are good for a game. It is definitely not a high fidelity sound and graphics visual masterpiece, but that really is not necessary. It is the gameplay which makes this game shine. There are various mods which revamp the sound experience if you are unhappy with the tone of the firearms. Overall, really fun game!			"

												Awesome game, simple graphics, 2D, and yet very fun. It's a tactical strategy game where you customize your own squad, names, callsigns, loadouts, and roles (like shield, stealth, assaulter, breacher and pointman) and assign them to missions, and there are a ton of missions, premade missions, campaigns, community-made missions, mission generator and mission editor as well. The replayability is enormous and you can just keep playing different missions for hours.Different objectives like hostages, bomb defusals, pure hostile killing, etc, The design of the plan system is very nice and well-made, you can plan out tactics and pause at any time of the game. You can make a whole plan from the start of the mission, or you can play a more real-time playstyle where your plan is improvised as the operation goes, or a combination of both.If you are interested in conducting anti-terrorist/crime operations(e.g. SWAT) and is not too picky with the graphics, you should definitely give this a try.  It's got the Rainbow Six/SWAT atmosphere but the gameplay style of XCOM converted to real-time.8/10			"

												Addictive little tactics game with some smooth action.  This game simulates a bust like on the Wire, or Hill Street Blues. Where the cops beat down the door and then run to catch the perps in the act, and stop them destroying the evidence, or killing hostages. I like how it builds up the anticipation of what lies behind a door, and then the thrill from the controlled burst of violence necessary to subdue whoever is in there. There are single missions and a campaign. The campaigns, so far, are really just loosely tied together single missions.  But, this is fine if you’re looking for action and tactics and not much story.The game has many mods and comes with a cool looking editor, for those who want to get lots of replay. I would love to see a sequel set in Rio de Janeiro or somewhere.  "

Turning the handle and throwing the door open the first officer stood back, raising his sleek compact submachine gun, the second tossing the live grenade into the room, an ear splitting bang, and a blinding flash stunning the hostage taker inside, the officers moved in with lethal grace, one three round burst of fire and the aggressor was down, the second officer kneeling to cheek the hostage was unarmed.Door Kickers is a tense top down tactical simulation game, you control a squad of specialist counter-terrorism/hostage rescue officers. You unlock equipment (and soon traits) with stars awarded for completing the levels with no casualties and under the time limit. The interface is clean and easy to use, the controls slick and intuitive, it takes moments to learn but knowing how to control your team is only the start of it.Learning the best combinations of weapons and tactics will prove harder, the game is unforgiving, but in a good way, when you've made a mistake you'll know it, forget to check a corner? You'll pay for it when the 'empty room' turns out to be hiding a hostile with a Mac-10.The game has just recently entered into Beta stage, and it's well worth the money, bugs are few and far between and it runs well and looks great.

Early Access Review
								Do you remember Rainbow Six's famous planning phase? Did you enjoy that part of the game more than the actual mission? If you answered yes to these questions, Door Kickers is a worthwhile investment.The game's core features right now are quite good. There is a slight learning curve to get your guys moving the way you want. Sometimes you will feel like you are micromangaging movements especially if you want to execute proper room clearing techniques. And occasionally you get angry at the pathing system since there are numerous house plants and chairs which create impassable barriers. But it is still fun. There are definitely a good number of missions available of varying difficulty. Some you will breeze right through, others will be the bain of your existence until you get that perfect plan with 0 casualties working just right. Also the random mission generator is always good if you are looking for a quick challenge. As well as replaying missions trying to achieve the single-plan and hands-off achievements. The loadouts are varied and offer a decent sized arsenal. It is mostly reflective of what a police SWAT team would have available. One gameplay feature I like is how your team really practices good trigger discipline (single shots if possible). While the bad guys will often go full auto at the slightest of targets. One thing that is not completely apparent in the loadout section of the game is what effects do the equipment have on your team. You'll notice in cramped interiors, it takes the man with the M4 longer to train his rifle than the man weilding his pistol. But for those long corridor or outdoor shots, your Assaulter with his rifle is far more efficient than your rear guard weiding his shotgun. Sadly none of this is explicitly described in the loadout menu and will take some experimentation to figure out what the ideal loadout is based on your style of play and the mission. The graphics and sound are good for a game. It is definitely not a high fidelity sound and graphics visual masterpiece, but that really is not necessary. It is the gameplay which makes this game shine. There are various mods which revamp the sound experience if you are unhappy with the tone of the firearms. Overall, really fun game!			"

												My enjoyment of this game followed an inverted bell curve - at first I was elated. The dip came somewhere between my 20th and 30th mission, where the difficulty started ramping up faster than I could cope with. I was quite frustrated for a while but kept trying to wade forward. And sure enough, once my knowledge of the game mechanics accumulated past a certain critical mass it was only upwards on that bell curve, toward permanent satisfaction. To limit the length of this review, I'd like to touch up only on things that I didn't like as I'm sure the positives are thoroughly described by others. there are no collisions between units. While this makes the game easier, I kinda expected having to manage this aspect of CQB - avoiding a jam when moving in cramped spaces. And here instead you can stack your whole squad on one space like some sort of Shiva with 20 arms, wielding 8 guns, 2 tasers and a shield. And it's a very valid tactic. as an aside to the above, there is also no friendly fire though I don't mind. there are multi-layered levels (ex. a house with an additional floor) but time moves forward only on the floor you are observing. This is an engine deficiency acknowledged by the devs and it's here to stay. Sort of embarassing. the interface used for drawing paths is pretty clunky. It's hard to use precisely, and even harder if you're trying to map out a complicated plan in a tight space because of all the markers. It took me like 3 hours and some googling to figure out how to strafe. The option to ""bend"" an existing path is either missing or I haven't found it.  there is a fair amount of bugs, particularly related to handcuffing. in the hardest, endgame levels you are kinda undergunned and seriously struggling to defeat the body armor of enemies. I appreciate that police arsenals are not the same as military, yet it feels wrong. there is a bit too much randomness in the outcome of firefights. Even the best plan will sometimes be defeated by RNG.But yeah, in the end I agree with the Overwhelmingly Positive rating. This game will satisfy almost any fan of tactical combat. It's extremely addictive and feels rewarding to improve in.			"

												I had the pleasure of looking at DoorKickers way back in Alpha and then again at the full release version. I'm glad it made it all the way through. It reminds me a lot of the tactical planner in pre-Raven Shield Rainbow Six games. You can carefully plan out your teams entry into an area swarming of enemies and maybe even hostages or adapt a plan on the fly. It can be pretty challenging too! The game has a fair amount of pre-made content for the price and also offers a stage builder to extend that further. KillHouse Games provided me with a review copy to produce a first impressions video. If you'd like to see the game in motion and hear some more thoughts consider checking out the video below.

												It's a great take on top down tactical close quarters combat.  It has the feel of the game ""Hotline Miami.""  The controls overall were why I stopped playing, they felt wonky and couldn't control the angle of your LOS (line of sight) very well, which rendered the tactical element of the game almost useless.  The concept is there, and it could be a lot of fun if you master the control scheme, however, I am just too old to try and get it down.  Fans of the Rainbow Six series (the old ones) will be familiar with this type of game, and likely enjoy it.  Also there is a Rainbow Six mod, which I played with that will add even more familiarity to this game.  I recommend it but with hestitation that he controls are very difficult to get in the groove.  Get this for sure if it is on sale, and you are a fan of tactical gameplay.			"

												Team Alpha, go! Bravo, engage!Pros:- Doorkickers has a very great tactical element to it, allowing you to utilize unit sight lines to spy corners before entering and taking out the baddies before shots are fired. Using multiple units for cover and movement through doorways, flashing, flanking is very fun and very satisfying when it all goes according to the plan in your mind. - The different classes to combine on missions is very interesting and with mobility meters could spell the difference between a good outcome on a mission or a very fatal end.- Utilization of ""Go-Codes"" is always exciting when you are able to time your plan sequences in a smooth, fluid execution.- There is a SKILL tree and Doctrine points to purchase weapons and gear (only once) for all of your units to use- Lots of maps and creatable content to share with Steam friends and community. Cons:- I have to admit, sometimes the units can be a bit finnicky, and it gets a bit frustrating; there are two tangos in a large room on the other side of a locked door you cannot flashbang through - breaching with a hammer, lockpick, or breaching charge takes too much time to set up, you send a man through and direct his sight line to sweep, but instead of firing on the first guy he sees on side A, sweeps and shoots man in corner B instead and leaves the first man he sees in the shadows. Alongside the factor of friendly fire sight lines, its frustrating when you have 2 of your own units stacked on top of each other, but one will not fire in his designated direction due to a teammate being directly on top of him.- I've found that enemy units are able to fire simultaneously and hit my units while they are in a line, while my units cannot fire through each other. Something I think will be patched in the future.- Another issue I'm having is pathing selections: there are times where lines will overlap in a hallway and you wnat to change the sight line of ONE of your units, but you can't select his pathing line because the OTHER guys' line is on top of his. I tried to lock one unit's path with SHIFT, but doesn't seem to work. Something that can be fixed.Conclusion:All in all, I REALLY do enjoy the game. For $20? Sure. I honestly feel the game's INCLUDED content could have been more, the campaigns are a bit short, but the replayability with different tactics is refreshing. The focus on community map content is a bit harrowing, as I'm not one to really have time to download and configure all of it to work. I also feel that each class should have their own type of special ability in relation with the skill trees, instead of just access to a certain type of primary weapon. Different stat fluctuations, maybe? I don't know. It's still a great game to kill time and terrorists with.			"

Did you beat it within mission par time? Did you lose any men?Tons of scenarios to keep you busy (100+), and even a couple campaign modes of increasing difficulty. (Not really any story, but there's links between each level)Lots of backdrops.

It is awesome, also, if you have a 2 in 1, it automatically changes to tablet mode (if you are using it like a tablet) and you can play it touching everything. I love this game, really. It is difficult and easy, it is challenging, it is tricky, you can play hours without knowing it and it is veeery enjoyable :) BUY  IT!!!!			"

												Highly tactical game that is essentially about finding the best way to get your officers to kill all the Druggies, Terrorists, Junkies, etcetera. The action can be fast and brutal, or slow and methodical, with the multiple classes, dozens upon dozens of missions, and all manner of weapons and potential ways to win in the fast-paced gameplay of Door Kickers.Open-ended tactical action with loads of potential gameplay, PLUS Steam Workshop and an active modding community. This didn't win 'Best Tactics 2014' for nothing (Rock Paper Shotgun), and I say it shows. Rainbow Six if it was top-down and you were a floating policeman god, some may say (There's also mods to make it Rainbow Six). There's much more, but this is just the tip of the iceberg, I say.If you like what you're reading, I say go take a look at some (more, if you already have) videos before deciding if you want to spend money on this (because it's smart, of course). Highly recommended for fans of tactical shooters and strategy games alike.Apologies for any major issues or minor errors, I should be asleep. But Door Kickers.			"

												 First ""tactical"" game I've seen in a while that actually deserves the name. One of maybe three games I've played ever, wherein you could actually use real-world tactics, and those tactics not only work, but they work in-game, for the same reasons they work in real life. Button-hooks, cross-overs, ""slicing the pie"", etc. etc. This could be used as a kind of ""sim-lite"" for real-world operators-in-training, who just want to see tactics in action, while exploring why they work. Beyond that, it's a fairly entertaining game, giving you all the gear choices, squad-building, and planning that you need for a game to actually be ""tactical"", a term that is either misused these days, or avoided for fear of losing the instant gratification and hand-holding market. With both one-off missions, several campaigns (with more to come, apparently), random mission generator, and Steam Workshop support, there's endless hours of play available. I do have some relatively minor complaints, though. For one, any tactical game that uses a weapon and gear unlock system breaks my immersion just a tad. Real world units don't have to unlock weapons and gear. They simply use what they feel best fits the task at hand. So I kind of wish they would have gone the classic Rainbow Six route, where everything is at your disposal from the get-go. Also, there are some rather unrealistic balancing issues. Targets wearing body armor are human bullet sponges. I've watched in amusement, as my full-armored operator unloaded round after round of 5.56 from an M4 into one of these vested ""tangos"" at point-blank range, only to watch the target giggle, scratch his nuts, wink at my wife, and blow my up-armored operator away with a few rounds from his sub-gun. I'm sorry, but no vest exists that will stop a full-powered rifle round without at least incurring incapacitating trauma on the wearer. But no mind, it's just a game after all. Just frustrating at times. I've also gotten the sense that the developers understood ""rate-of-fire"" to be more important/significant than stopping power, which is ridiculous. I'm not claiming to be one of them, but if you talk to anyone with any experience in a job where firearms use and training was in the job description, they'll tell you that 99.9% of the time, you're going to use that full-auto weapon in semi-auto mode, and you're trained that way for a reason. Accuracy and stopping power are what keep you alive, and rate-of-fire negates accuracy, and therefor also negates stopping power (because you're not hitting anything), as it increases. But again, not a big deal. It's just kind of awkward when you get the sense that your MP5 on full-auto, is somehow proving more effective than that M4 with well-placed shots.All in all, this is a great game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactics and planning! I've already put an obscene number of hours into this one, with many more to come!			"

												This game has a lot of annoying UI problems - most of which are minor, but they add up - but other than that it's pretty good.The game mechanics are solid, if a bit unrealistic in parts. For example, enemies can hit you with grenades when you're inside a house and they're outside, down the street. (The grenade appears to go over the exterior wall of a house and through the roof.) Cover isn't very consistent. Some cars give you cover; others don't. It has an iron-man mode, which I appreciate. The unit classes are a bit unbalanced in that some are much more useful than others, but it doesn't matter too much.The game has you executing civilians without warning and without giving them a chance to surrender, so you basically play a bad cop in a police state, but then we're all used to games being murder simulators anyway. The game calls the criminals ""terrorists"", which is about as accurate as calling them ""communists"". I'm slightly bothered by the promotion of terrorist hysteria and the dilution of the word ""terrorist"" into meaninglessness, but oh well.The map designs are pretty good, but it seems that you either need luck or prescience to beat some of them without casualties, which is a bit unfortunate. The game comes with an editor that lets you make your own scenarios and share them for other people to play.The game doesn't have a manual or a decent tutorial, but you can probably figure it out.The developer is very active in the forums and frequently responds to questions, which I greatly appreciate, but I'm not sure how good he is at fixing bugs. (I know of at least one problem that he said would be fixed ""in the next update"", but that was in August 2014 and it's still not fixed as of June 2015. Maybe he forgot or maybe he changed his mind. I don't know.)The existing campaigns and missions seem like they'll provide at least 20 hours of play, and there are supposed to be more campaigns coming. I don't know whether the developer will make good on that promise, but it's nice that the game is supposed to continue to grow in the future.Overall, the game has lots of little problems that detract from the enjoyment but even so it's still fun.

It's a terrific value, and the developers are very friendly/reasonable. Doorkickers is defintely worth getting if you have the slightest amount of interest.			"

												I absolutely f**king LOVE this game. If this game appeals to you in the slightest, then bloody buy it! One of my favourite PC exclusive games ever, I just cannot pull myself away. Although I want to as it is so f**king enjoyable but the campaign is ridiculously short so far. However, there is over 70 single missions which sort of make up for it. I just can't wait for there to be more campaign missions. The game mechanics can sometimes be a bit glitchy and frustrate me, which ends up in my favourite soldier getting slaughtered and thus having to restart the whole mission. But, other than the short campaign and confusing (at times) mechanics, I can't think of a single fault with this game.Just. F**king. Buy it!			"

												Awsome game worth the 5$ i paid. but i feel like it coudve been executed much beter 1. there are dozens of guns but once u unlock the best gun in the game wich in my opinion is the m4 carbine your basicly done unlocking guns same goes with the armor once u unlock the second armor choice (i belive its the second one although im not sure whats it called) your done with the armor and theres no point for the other 4 choices .2. what the hell is the pistol class for other then the first 4-5 missions. its basicaly usles along with the shiled trooper and shotguner.3.once u unlock the stealth class its just to op4.after u unlock the stealth class every other class becomes obsolete . hostage holders will execute their hostage when they here your gunshots but wont execute the hostage if they hear thier own guys fire at your stealth troopers5.very generic single player missions . as for the campaighn they are very repetative u take your troopers and you bust in and kill every one . some misions are needlesly hard and theres almost no way to come out of them with all troppers alive (i stoped caring for my troopers after a while just sacrificing them so i can get to the next mission)6.almost forgot there are like dozens of pistols to be unlokced but your troopers will never need them (exept for the fist few missions were u can onley use pistols) my guys literaly never use pistols and never even switch to them so theres no point in haveing so many.All in all idd give it a 7/10 really fun and addicting but gets old fast. definatly worth the 5 $ i paid for itSmashing doors and interupting nieborhood parties 10/10 IGN			"

												Do I recommend this game? Yes. Absolutely. Here's why:-Intuitive leveling system; As you level up, you get points to spend on your trooper's skills, like better ""draw speed"" indoors, or the ability to make anyone using a silenced weapon hold their fire if they aren't in direct danger. Pretty rad.-A kind of currency: You earn stars for completing levels, the better you do, the more stars you earn, and you spend those stars on weapons and equipment for your troopers.-Can be played real-time, or with the ""Pause"" option, for those who want to take a tiny bit more time to think about their plan.-PERMADEATH: This is something that a lot of games don't do anymore. If you are in a Campaign (and only in campaigns), and a trooper dies in a mission, you lose that trooper (and his individual level and skills) forever, and he's replaced with a green trooper.-A pretty fun soundtrack-A small, but adequate variety of missions: Elimination, Hostage Rescue, VIP Escort, Bomb Defusal, House Calls, Drug Busts, and Arrest Warrants. (Some missions may have multiple properties of each kind of mission, like a bomb defusal mission might have hostages and evidence to gather (drugs)).Now here's why I WOULDN'T recommend it to some:-For those with short attention spans (this guy..) this game can get pretty dull at times.-Very frustrating level of difficulty later on. Enemies have strong body armor and spam grenades, which has the capacity to instantly kill your troopers or kill civilians, resulting in a more difficult (or instantly failed) mission.-High learning curve: Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT expect to play as well as the player in the videos, even if you're a strategy game guru. This game punishes hasty mistakes to the max, and early newcomers will have a hard time adapting to the controls and gameplay.There are plenty of other reasons for me to recommend this game or not to others, but these are my main ones, and the reason I love/hate this game at any given time.

												If the trailer interests you in the game, then get it. It's as good as it looks.If you liked Frozen Synapse but wish it was a little more organic and less chess-like, this is your game.If you like re-playability through perfection, then 90% of the scenarios have medals that you can earn by beating it under one of three conditions. (You can do them all at the same time or in separate runs). 1) Lone Wolf - Complete the stage with one team member deployed. 2) Real Time - Do not manually pause the game from start to the end of the operation.3) One Plan - Create a tactical plan for your team, then succeed using that plan without any interference from you.Also a 3 star rating for each level. Did you beat it within mission par time? Did you lose any men?Tons of scenarios to keep you busy (100+), and even a couple campaign modes of increasing difficulty. (Not really any story, but there's links between each level)Lots of backdrops. Cruise ships, Grocery Stores, Bars, Police Stations, Autoshops, docks, subways, vacation homes... you name it.Possible Scenarios: Bomb, Hostage, Elimination, Execution (Hostage but with a timer), and Robbery.This game is amazing. Oh yeah and there's a mission editor and Steam Workshop support. WHAT. Get this game.			"

I played this game for quite a long time (mostly cracked (yeah-yeah, I know I know...)) now and after I saw that this game is so cheap at the moment, I instantly bought it. This game is unique. It's pretty intense and there isn't any better feeling if your plan works perfect. Really. Also, you need some time to get throught it. Of course you can do it like Rambo and just run throught the whole map, but if you want to play it right, like a real SWAT Team... oh boy that will be hard! Seriously, it's really hard thanks to the random spawns and co. If you want a game where you need to think about your actions, this game will fit you pretty well. If you want a game with some badass shooting, this game will fit you pretty well. If you just want to kick some doors... well, guess what? This game will fit you extremly well! Seriously, buy that game now, it's way too cheap for such an amazing game!			"

			The original Doorkickers gameplay video. I thought I would give this a shot as the new Doorkickers 2 game is coming out soon, so people may want to play the first one again, before the new one comes...

												I'm not sure if the game is worth the full price (unless you're a big swat/tactics fan) but at least at the steam sale price this game is an incredible bargain.Loads of levels, tons of weapons and extra gear, smooth gameplay and easy controls. It's pretty awesome and at least a little bit addictive.If there's one criticism I'd have, it's that it could really use more varied voices. I'd actually be happy if they released a payable DLC that added south american drug cartel voices, arab terrorists, yakuza or triad mobsters, tchechen terrorists etc. If they could also add more voices for the swat team it would be fantastic.

												I like itI had some issues getting it to run the second time, needed a restart.The gameplay is fun, the rooms are realstic which means they aren't designed for the purpose of being a typical ""level"", real rooms with al the good and bad that comes with it.It is said that there are a thousand wrong ways to clear a room, and only one good one. So, you'll be repeating the same routine quite often ... then the game throws you a curve ball. You'll find yourself surprised and forcd to adapt throughout the levels, great fun.Maybe closer to a puzzle than a shooter.			"

												A very underloocked game that it's so minimalist it's basically gameplay.If you miss tactical FPSs this is a good fix for your neglected addiction. You can play it very thoughtful or just going in into the action with the great risk of getting killed.It gets repetitive in the last part of the game but when you get there you will have gotten your investment back.

												 First ""tactical"" game I've seen in a while that actually deserves the name. One of maybe three games I've played ever, wherein you could actually use real-world tactics, and those tactics not only work, but they work in-game, for the same reasons they work in real life. Button-hooks, cross-overs, ""slicing the pie"", etc. etc. This could be used as a kind of ""sim-lite"" for real-world operators-in-training, who just want to see tactics in action, while exploring why they work. Beyond that, it's a fairly entertaining game, giving you all the gear choices, squad-building, and planning that you need for a game to actually be ""tactical"", a term that is either misused these days, or avoided for fear of losing the instant gratification and hand-holding market. With both one-off missions, several campaigns (with more to come, apparently), random mission generator, and Steam Workshop support, there's endless hours of play available. I do have some relatively minor complaints, though. For one, any tactical game that uses a weapon and gear unlock system breaks my immersion just a tad. Real world units don't have to unlock weapons and gear. They simply use what they feel best fits the task at hand. So I kind of wish they would have gone the classic Rainbow Six route, where everything is at your disposal from the get-go. Also, there are some rather unrealistic balancing issues. Targets wearing body armor are human bullet sponges. I've watched in amusement, as my full-armored operator unloaded round after round of 5.56 from an M4 into one of these vested ""tangos"" at point-blank range, only to watch the target giggle, scratch his nuts, wink at my wife, and blow my up-armored operator away with a few rounds from his sub-gun. I'm sorry, but no vest exists that will stop a full-powered rifle round without at least incurring incapacitating trauma on the wearer. But no mind, it's just a game after all. Just frustrating at times. I've also gotten the sense that the developers understood ""rate-of-fire"" to be more important/significant than stopping power, which is ridiculous. I'm not claiming to be one of them, but if you talk to anyone with any experience in a job where firearms use and training was in the job description, they'll tell you that 99.9% of the time, you're going to use that full-auto weapon in semi-auto mode, and you're trained that way for a reason. Accuracy and stopping power are what keep you alive, and rate-of-fire negates accuracy, and therefor also negates stopping power (because you're not hitting anything), as it increases. But again, not a big deal. It's just kind of awkward when you get the sense that your MP5 on full-auto, is somehow proving more effective than that M4 with well-placed shots.All in all, this is a great game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactics and planning! I've already put an obscene number of hours into this one, with many more to come!			"

												If the trailer interests you in the game, then get it. It's as good as it looks.If you liked Frozen Synapse but wish it was a little more organic and less chess-like, this is your game.If you like re-playability through perfection, then 90% of the scenarios have medals that you can earn by beating it under one of three conditions. (You can do them all at the same time or in separate runs). 1) Lone Wolf - Complete the stage with one team member deployed. 2) Real Time - Do not manually pause the game from start to the end of the operation.3) One Plan - Create a tactical plan for your team, then succeed using that plan without any interference from you.Also a 3 star rating for each level. Did you beat it within mission par time? Did you lose any men?Tons of scenarios to keep you busy (100+), and even a couple campaign modes of increasing difficulty. (Not really any story, but there's links between each level)Lots of backdrops. Cruise ships, Grocery Stores, Bars, Police Stations, Autoshops, docks, subways, vacation homes... you name it.Possible Scenarios: Bomb, Hostage, Elimination, Execution (Hostage but with a timer), and Robbery.This game is amazing. Oh yeah and there's a mission editor and Steam Workshop support. WHAT. Get this game.			"

												Highly tactical game that is essentially about finding the best way to get your officers to kill all the Druggies, Terrorists, Junkies, etcetera. The action can be fast and brutal, or slow and methodical, with the multiple classes, dozens upon dozens of missions, and all manner of weapons and potential ways to win in the fast-paced gameplay of Door Kickers.Open-ended tactical action with loads of potential gameplay, PLUS Steam Workshop and an active modding community. This didn't win 'Best Tactics 2014' for nothing (Rock Paper Shotgun), and I say it shows. Rainbow Six if it was top-down and you were a floating policeman god, some may say (There's also mods to make it Rainbow Six). There's much more, but this is just the tip of the iceberg, I say.If you like what you're reading, I say go take a look at some (more, if you already have) videos before deciding if you want to spend money on this (because it's smart, of course). Highly recommended for fans of tactical shooters and strategy games alike.Apologies for any major issues or minor errors, I should be asleep. But Door Kickers.			"

												This is probably one of the most satisfying strategy games of all time.I just finished a mission with one single plan, without pausing, and got 3 stars. I felt like a badass, and I am now going to watch the replay and gloat.It took me a bit to get my head around the controls, but now they work great.I've only just started playing, so I'm on easier single missions, but there is just so much gameplay here between the included missions, campaigns, and various mods.In addition, I'm usually only coordinating 2 agents. There are a much more difficult missions with many more agents to plan and coordinate with, so there is some seriously deep tactical gameplay here.This looks very similar to Breach & Clear, so if you thought, like me, that it was a copy or something, you were wrong. While it has a free pause, so it can feel turn based, you can also go real time. It allows for a range of playstyles depending on your tastes. In addition, the lack of grid based movement ends up being a huge plus.Buy it.			"

												Fantastic game, has a few bugs with task switching and crashing a handfull of times over twenty hours. Incredible amount of content.A lot of the nuance is hard to come by even with a lot of playtime, some steam guides proved invalubale. A lot less fiddly/granular than Frozen Synapse but this makes it more fun somehow. Would love to see an XCOM mod/version with more destructible objects.Can be very random, a plus for some, as makes some scenarios much harder to solve. Some campaign missions seem like junk but it might just be me thats junk at the game. (VIP escort through street and a massive cruise liner mission).			"

												Great game! Buy it if you like to play tactical games, control a SWAT team using different methods of neutralising the enemies. Each restart round is randomised so your plan needs to be really good. Checking corners, split second glance to the blind spots.. etc. Timing and luck I would say.One trooper, single plan non-stop challenge for all maps forces you to be quick in clearing rooms and challenge your timings and decisions. Honestly, buy it you won't regret it!			"

												Probably the closest we'll ever get to another SWAT game. You get a selection of weapons and equipment to complete missions, from stun guns to stinger grenades to M4s. Then you're asked to complete levels in times that would make the SAS sweat. Tasks can range from rescuing hostages to defusing bombs, to simply killng all enemies in the level. Intricate planning is a must - one mistake and that trooper you've been so proud of will be eating dirt in a second. You're not tougher than the enemies, so be smarter. It's a tough, rewarding, fun strategy game with oodles of content (single levels, campaigns, and a mission generator). Well worth full price, and on sale, it's a steal.			"

								This game is brilliant. For a game still in development, it is surprisingly good. One of my favourite top-down games ever. Easy enough to understand, but with a great deal of versatility in regards to how you wish to play out each mission. Do you go slowly from room to room, checking past each door with a spy camera, or just charge in with shotguns, grenades and breaching charges? This game can also be quite challenging, which means completion of a difficult mission actually feels like an achievment. I'm hoping as development goes forward the variety of weapons, tools, tactics and missions  will all increase, so you can play the game entirely your way.			"

You get single Mission: They are like squad training missions. You can use them to learn and improve your Squad. Unlock new weapons and skills. You have multiple Campaigns: Here you have to be careful it is possible that your squad members die during the campaign.There is also new contet, which is added to the game constantly from the developers. In Addtion, you have content from players on the Steam workshop. Overall, you can have a lot of fun with that game. I bought it on the Steam Christmas sale but form me is worth it´s 19, - € "

If you're into puzzle games, where you can pause the action to try and compose yourself, and think about your next move, than this is for you. I belive this is my favorite part. I'll use my units to clear each room, one at a time, pausing to figure out the next steps. Does it always go to plan? Hell no, but i have a LOT of fun failing. I've had my eye on this game for a few months, and I really wish I picked it up sooner.			"

												Doorkickers feels a little bit like Rainbow Six 3, without the FPS part.You manage a squad of 2+ (depending on the mission) officers who have to clear a building, secure evidence or rescue hostages.Before starting the actual mission, you are to forge a plan of how to tackle the situation.You can give orders to each officer individually so that in the end they work together to clear the building as quickly and safely as possible.You may also give each officer different weapons, or a completely different class.Need a shielder? No problem.Or rather a breacher? You got it.A stealther? Sure.If you are not satisfied with certain aspects of the game, the modding community is doing their job for sure.From different/new weapons or armours, to completely new classes and obviously loads of user made maps.The cartoonish graphics are definitely no throw off. You will be way too focused on your tactics trying to keep your officers alive than to check out the beautiful flower pots in the bathroom.Just don't go thinking ""Easy peasy"". You will have your squad killed easier than one would think. A proper planning phase is half a victory.Now grab your gear and get on the truck. We are Oscar Mike in 5. Barricaded suspects holding a hostage which you need to rescue!			"

												Door Kickers is a top-down strategy game that puts you in a command of SWAT team. You have your SWAT team on disposal and you need to kick many doors (hence the name) and kill many bad guys.You can plan your assault and/or move your SWAT members in real time, also you can pause the time to make precise instructions for troops.The biggest plus of this game is modding. This game is not out too long but there are many mods: total conversion, skin mods, weapon mods, levels which can be published to workshop from in-game so this adds to great, infinite replayability.So yeah, I recommend this gameTIP: don't give names to your squad members of your family and friends because they will get brutally murdered by a terrorist that you missed in that one corner where you didn't expect him "

								Door Kickers is basically the original SWAT/Rainbow Six from a top-down perspective.It has simplified the gameplay for a more casual approach.It supports mods and you can already download the Rainbow Six mod for a nostalgic trip down memory lane.Its simplicity does leave you craving for a proper Rainbow Six game, which we all know is not going to happen anytime soon.Hopefully a potential sequel to Door Kickers will have more complex ai and more depth.Buy if you are a fan of tactical games with more time spent planning ahead rather than the actual action.Avoid if you don't have patience.

												Okay, I've been sitting here glued to my screen for 3 hours straight and I'm approaching level 20 and just wanted to stop for a minute and tell you why I love this game and why I think that you just might love it too.First, if you loved the planning of Rainbow Six and the strategy of the old school SWAT games, stop reading my review and go buy this...it's the closest thing, I think, that we're going to get to a spiritual successor. This game has it all: strategy, great firefights (even though it's top down, the gun fights feel ferocious), a nice bit of customization, and a great developer that continually supports the game (there was another recent update adding more levels and bug fixes).Also, it's worth noting that this game is in BETA (I think) and is as stable as I've ever seen; zero crashes or bugs for me thus far. This game is easy to pick up and hard to master. But, before you know it, you'll be laying way points, tossing flashbangs, and blowing doors off their hinges like a pro. The first time you storm a building from two entrances, tossing flashbangs and double tapping baddies, all while a sniper lays down cover fire, you'll be grinning like an idiot. And when your team dies because your point man forgot to check his corners, you'll happily restart and do it all again.5/5			"

												It took a few hours for me to begin truly enjoying Door Kickers, and it was only after: A. I began to see it more as a puzzle game than a tactical shooter and B. stopped deploying 2-8 exact clones and diversified my squad.  This game has high replay value, a nicely paced learning curve, and creates genuine thrills when a plan comes together.  I have a few small complaints (mainly the inconsistency of the AI towards hostages), but for its price this was a steal for the hours I will continue to get out of it.			"

												This is probably one of the most satisfying strategy games of all time.I just finished a mission with one single plan, without pausing, and got 3 stars. I felt like a badass, and I am now going to watch the replay and gloat.It took me a bit to get my head around the controls, but now they work great.I've only just started playing, so I'm on easier single missions, but there is just so much gameplay here between the included missions, campaigns, and various mods.In addition, I'm usually only coordinating 2 agents. There are a much more difficult missions with many more agents to plan and coordinate with, so there is some seriously deep tactical gameplay here.This looks very similar to Breach & Clear, so if you thought, like me, that it was a copy or something, you were wrong. While it has a free pause, so it can feel turn based, you can also go real time. It allows for a range of playstyles depending on your tastes. In addition, the lack of grid based movement ends up being a huge plus.Buy it.			"

								This game is awesome, who doesn't want to break a door down and blow a terrorist head off?I've played the game for a couple hours so far, it fun and very interesting, however, remember that this is still an alpha, so not even a beta yet, so don't expect everything to be polished or the game to be at its full. The game can be pretty frustrating at times, for example I don't understand the use of stealth weapons, it doesn't change anything, enemies hear you and come to investigate. I hate this, i like playing stealthy by as soon as one shot from a stealth weapon  goes off, enemies come to see what the noise was then♥♥♥♥♥♥turns into cluster ♥♥♥♥ central. I do hope they actually fix this, if they did then this game would definitely be on my top 5 game list. There's this a lot missing from the game, for example not all of the upgrades are available, there's no campaign so you just go through different stages and shoot at people. One of the most frustrating missions are hostage rescue missions, at first they are nice and all but after a couple stages, they start executing hostages, so if you break a door or shoot at someone, you have 5 seconds to reach the hostages before they are executed,  which isn't easy in a big house/office... Also, it seems SWAT doesn't care much for hostages, if they see an enemy and there's a hostage in-between them, they just shoot at them and kill the hostage, which is especially annoying since if you kill a hostage, or a hostage dies, it's mission failed. Don't expect it to be a Call of Duty like game where one person takes on an entire building full of terrorists, you will almost always be out-numbered so you have to plan ahead of time, and be ready to adapt when things don't go your way.  I would recommend this game if you like games like XCOM but remember, this is still an alpha and there's a lot missing. "

I would recommend this game if you like games like XCOM but remember, this is still an alpha and there's a lot missing. "

												Okay, I've been sitting here glued to my screen for 3 hours straight and I'm approaching level 20 and just wanted to stop for a minute and tell you why I love this game and why I think that you just might love it too.First, if you loved the planning of Rainbow Six and the strategy of the old school SWAT games, stop reading my review and go buy this...it's the closest thing, I think, that we're going to get to a spiritual successor. This game has it all: strategy, great firefights (even though it's top down, the gun fights feel ferocious), a nice bit of customization, and a great developer that continually supports the game (there was another recent update adding more levels and bug fixes).Also, it's worth noting that this game is in BETA (I think) and is as stable as I've ever seen; zero crashes or bugs for me thus far. This game is easy to pick up and hard to master. But, before you know it, you'll be laying way points, tossing flashbangs, and blowing doors off their hinges like a pro. The first time you storm a building from two entrances, tossing flashbangs and double tapping baddies, all while a sniper lays down cover fire, you'll be grinning like an idiot. And when your team dies because your point man forgot to check his corners, you'll happily restart and do it all again.5/5			"

												It took a few hours for me to begin truly enjoying Door Kickers, and it was only after: A. I began to see it more as a puzzle game than a tactical shooter and B. stopped deploying 2-8 exact clones and diversified my squad.  This game has high replay value, a nicely paced learning curve, and creates genuine thrills when a plan comes together.  I have a few small complaints (mainly the inconsistency of the AI towards hostages), but for its price this was a steal for the hours I will continue to get out of it.			"

												It's good. I mean, I spent 15 hours playing it. But...After losing my top officers again and again because I hit ""back"" instead of pressing ""restart"" after a failed mission, I just can't be bothered anymore. Not to mention that the semi-randomized location of your enemies makes it a lot less useful to plan your missions out ahead of time- a particular plan might work on one run but fail in the exact same spot the next, and you just have to keep restarting in the hopes that your enemies will be in the right rooms. It's frustrating because it's such a challenging and rewarding game otherwise, but there's a few little things that make you feel like you're being punished for nothing, and in such a high-stakes, difficult game, those things can really break the experience			"

								Easily one of the most intense top down games I've ever played. The ability to have multiple entry strategies whether that be placing a charge on the door, shooting the lock, or tossing in a flashbang makes the outcomes of just a single room almost immeasurable. The AI is great as well. If you take a more stealthy approach, the enemies may not be watching the door waiting for you. But if you charge through the house blasting everyone with shotguns, expect them to be in cover waiting for your squad to barge in. Also, even though on the menu it says its in the ""Alpha"" phase you could mistake this for a finished game. I've spent almost 4 hours in it I think and haven't seen a single bug or experienced an issue. The best 15 dollars I've ever spent. I hope its finished soon. If you can drop 15 dollars, put it into this game. You won't be dissappointed.			"

												Door Kickers is just a great, refreshing take on the old tactical ""move your men around and shoot""-style of game. It is what you would hope for as the next installment of XCOM or Jagged Alliance 2. Gone are the tedious hour-hungry turn-based mechanics of yesteryear. Gone are the unnecessary numbers and virtual die rolls. Instead you get fast-paced, easy-to-play excitement from start to end. The end unfortunately comes too soon. More content would have been nice, and the third party downloads are unfortunately very lacking. I hope the sequel will provide much more. And - BTW - beware the almost uannounced permadeath in campaign mode! Realizing that your loyal Lieutenant has suddenly and irreversably disappeared from your roster is not what I call enjoyable fun!			"

There is many types of assault rifles, pistols, grenades, and equipment at your fingertips to complete a mission.

It has the feeling of games like XCOM or Jagged Alliance, but it's much faster paced. Each level can be replayed, and there are different challanges for each mission. Passing a mission can sometimes be easy, but perfecting a run can be brutal. It is very satisfying when your plan goes well, and your team takes down a dozen bad guys in 20 seconds.If you like strategy games or anything tactical, I highly recommend this.			"

												Almost immediately after I’m spotted, the bad guys kill the hostage. I take a brief moment to unleash a string of curses and rack my brain. There must be another route I can take, another plan that would give this scenario a happy ending. I tinker with the map and reset, and soon I hear a meaty splat as the hostage gets killed again.Door Kickers is a game about cops kicking down doors, and these doors are a lot of fun to kick down. It is also very hard, and I love it for that. Played from a top-down, pausable view, this is the game that happens when Rainbow Six’s planning stage grows up and finds a home on a modern engine. It is also one of the most finely detailed, cleverly executed puzzle games I’ve played in years.Fog of warEach mission in Door Kickers starts with a deployment phase. Within this phase, I see the target house as a set of blueprints, atop which I can change shooters’ equipment and starting positions. As missions become more complex, the deployment phase becomes where I make some of my most important decisions. Door Kickers is a great tactical game because it is a great question generator:Are there narrow hallways? Will all firefights be up close? Are there hostages? Do I have sharpshooter support? Is there furniture? Is there evidence to save? Do the bad guys have bigger guns than me? Every piece of information changes the ideal approach and forces adaptation.After the deployment screen, the mission begins with time paused. From the paused overview, I drag paths for officers to follow, change the direction they’re covering, and order them to breach a door. This simple array of options becomes a complicated choreography of death pretty fast. In later missions, my eight officers follow a dance routine with hundreds of steps, pauses, shooting angles, and go-codes. Giving these orders is straightforward and malleable, but the interface is missing some important functions. If I give two units overlapping paths (walking single-file next to a wall, for example), I don’t have any way of selecting one trail over another when I want to edit it. To work around this, I have my units walk behind and to the side of each other, but that’s frequently a poor decision, tactics-wise. With eight officers in a narrow hallways, it also gets downright silly.Some of the other limitations of this system are simply built into the game engine: there’s no crouching or leaning, so the game’s combat takes place entirely on a two-dimensional plane with straight lines. It rarely feels as flat as it is, but there are occasions where I would love to stack a crouched unit under a standing unit, and these are the times when the game’s simulation feels most like a puzzle game and least like a camera looking down on a real-life SWAT situation.

								Super little game. Fun enough at the moment that even if development stopped for some reason I'd not feel I'd wasted any money and they're adding plenty of other features/content as development goes on anyway.If you played the old Rainbow 6 then it has similarities to the planning phase of that but can play/pause as you go (and control the officers while they're running your plan for desperate tweaks etc); I'd be tempted to compare the positioning etc to Frozen Synapse too.  The idea is to achieve the goal of the level; at the moment one of, kill everyone, rescue the hostage/s, make the arrest or disarm the bomb.  There are other goals to get better ratings on each level which are to beat a certain time and to keep as many of your chaps up as possible.Advancement is both by individual cops gaining in ability and rank, and ""Squad Doctrine"" group training options.Gear is selectable both by a class (which can be changed per mission) and choices within that class- which specific guns, armour and gadgets your chap will carry into the mission.  Some of the choices at the moment are fairly irrelevant and down to small preferences, others will have a big effect on how you go through the mission.POST RELEASE additional comments:There are a selection of single missions; randomly generated single missions; mods from the workshop and campaigns.  The single missions are sort of training for the campaigns really, both yourself, and leveling your troops/unlocking gear.  The campaigns themselves are perma-death but with restarts though there is iron-man mode which doesn't allow restarting. All in all a pretty vast amount of prepared content and then there are all the mods and randomly generated content making for a pretty near infinite game...and you'll almost certainly want to do individual bits multiple times too.I've gone through the single missions multiple times now and there's still tactical improvements, nuances etc to learn.  They've updated adding more content and more is still to come.  If you like tactical stuff just do yourself a favour and buy this game.			"

								The mechanics in this game are just top notch, they are easy to grasp, can be combined easily, offer a very deep tactical experience, but above all else, they are fun. I had to play the same mission about 20 times before I made it through without losing a man, and I had fun the whole time. Any game where you can fail over and over again and still be having fun is a damn good game in my book.			"

								Super little game. Fun enough at the moment that even if development stopped for some reason I'd not feel I'd wasted any money and they're adding plenty of other features/content as development goes on anyway.If you played the old Rainbow 6 then it has similarities to the planning phase of that but can play/pause as you go (and control the officers while they're running your plan for desperate tweaks etc); I'd be tempted to compare the positioning etc to Frozen Synapse too.  The idea is to achieve the goal of the level; at the moment one of, kill everyone, rescue the hostage/s, make the arrest or disarm the bomb.  There are other goals to get better ratings on each level which are to beat a certain time and to keep as many of your chaps up as possible.Advancement is both by individual cops gaining in ability and rank, and ""Squad Doctrine"" group training options.Gear is selectable both by a class (which can be changed per mission) and choices within that class- which specific guns, armour and gadgets your chap will carry into the mission.  Some of the choices at the moment are fairly irrelevant and down to small preferences, others will have a big effect on how you go through the mission.POST RELEASE additional comments:There are a selection of single missions; randomly generated single missions; mods from the workshop and campaigns.  The single missions are sort of training for the campaigns really, both yourself, and leveling your troops/unlocking gear.  The campaigns themselves are perma-death but with restarts though there is iron-man mode which doesn't allow restarting. All in all a pretty vast amount of prepared content and then there are all the mods and randomly generated content making for a pretty near infinite game...and you'll almost certainly want to do individual bits multiple times too.I've gone through the single missions multiple times now and there's still tactical improvements, nuances etc to learn.  They've updated adding more content and more is still to come.  If you like tactical stuff just do yourself a favour and buy this game.			"

												Doorkickers is a awesome game!  You have to plan and execute Missions for a Police Squad. You can plan the whole execution before you start the mission or change the plan while the Mission is running. You have many options how you get the job done. You get single Mission: They are like squad training missions. You can use them to learn and improve your Squad. Unlock new weapons and skills. You have multiple Campaigns: Here you have to be careful it is possible that your squad members die during the campaign.There is also new contet, which is added to the game constantly from the developers. In Addtion, you have content from players on the Steam workshop. Overall, you can have a lot of fun with that game. I bought it on the Steam Christmas sale but form me is worth it´s 19, - € "

												This game is a completely hidden gem. The content is massive and it's completely unassuming. I have been fooled by the top down 2D'ness of the game. Yet behind that facade of what might seem like a ""cheap"" game, are 3 campaigns, *80* (yes, EIGHTY) single missions with a variety of modes like 'Terrorist Hunt', 'Hostage Rescue', and a random mission generator to boot. Not only that, player made custom missions can be downloaded through the workshop.A variety of equipment are available, and it's extremely realistic. The added fact that all rifles are fired on single shot merrits mentioning, as firing assault rifles on full auto are only in movies or untrained armies. This game in my opinion, is far better than SWAT 4 or even the original Rainbow Six series were.			"

												Door Kickers is one of my favorite games. It requires you to think about every little move, and placement constantly. There is limitless content, the missions, the workshop missions, the generator, the editor, you just can't run out of levels.On top of just being a good top down strat game, it does really well at progression. There is many types of assault rifles, pistols, grenades, and equipment at your fingertips to complete a mission. You must use your Officers to get their skills up, and condition them to get better at aiming, and reaction time.Overall, I rate this game 9/10.I highly reccomended it.			"

												Doorkickers in an awesome semi-realistic top-down pause/play Urban Ops tactical planning game (a lot of words, i know), focusing on police and counter-terrorism scenarios. It has exceptional value for your money, and the devs are decent enough to actually bring a good game out of early acces. That shouldn't have to be a plus, but it is.Your SWAT team is fully levlable with it's own skill tree, seperate from the leveling of each individual team member, and the unlocking of new gear for your team, which adds to the feeling of progression and depth of the game. There are a LOT of ways to complete most levels, and as you unlock new gear you can go back and solve a scenario in a new and better way, improving replayability. Your team members die permanently (and is replaced by a rookie police officer) if you don't restart a mission where someone died, which gives every tactical decission you make a distinct feeling of importance. For someone with basic experience with military urban ops tactics, gameplay feels intuitive and realistic in that real life techniques and equipment are successfull when applied apropriately within the game. It's rewarding that I can jump straight into the game, learn the controlls, and instantly see how a good plan works, and a bad plan don't, and know EXACTLY why.One of the few problems i have with the game (which is completely subjective, and perhaps even a part of the intended difficulty) is that as the maps become bigger and the enemies more numeorus it becomes VERY tedious to make a working plan beforehand, and you basically have to ""test"" your way through the level. Another problem I have is that it gets problematic to controll bigger teams when you want them to walk the same path but perform different actions and cover different sectors, because their waypoints and routes overlap and create an unmanagable cluster. There should be a better way to toggle between the units and finalize/hide certain units' actions (maybe there is, but i missed it?).Another thing I wish was improved is the intelligence and behviour of the AI enemies. Considering they are hardened terrorists and seasoned criminals they're pretty stupid. This is really a realism issue, and not a gameplay issue, as I do mostly enjoy the game and it's dificulty as it is.			"

												So ill start this review of with a small story.So about a year go I was trying to choose between whether to buy Door Kickers or Breach and Clear during a sale, to me they both looked really interesting and fun to play so it wasnt an easy choice, but eventually I decided to buy Breach and Clear. I downloaded it, hit play and started to play, I really enjoyed the gameplay that it gave me but it was to short and didnt have much variety in the equipment I could give my soldiers, so I was still curious about Door Kickers and really wanted to play it, so about a year later I purchased Door Kickers. I started Playing Door Kickers and I immediately new this game was far superior to Breach and Clear, It contained much more content and variety in gameplay, as you have a much wider range in how you will will breach a building and what equipment you will use doing so. If you Have Breach and Clear and you enjoy it, Door kickers is 100% for you, or if you are trying to decide between Breach and Clear and Door Kickers, I would personally choose Door Kickers, I am not saying Breach and Clear is  a bad game i just think Door kickers is much better.One thing before I get into what is good and bad about the game I just want to mention something about the price-PRICE- I got Door Kickers for like 3$ or something and it is DEFINITELY worth that amount but the game is usually 20$, and I think this is pushing it a little to much as there are many other games out there for this amount that contain much more content, but if Top Down, Tactical games are your thing This is worth the 20$ -Now to what is Good and Bad about Door Kickers--PROS-- Lots of Variety (In how you breach Buildings and map types etc)- Provides hours of fun tactical gameplay- Many Primary and Secondary weapons to choose from- Nice graphics for a Top Down game- Easy to Run (You dont need Optimus Prime to be able to run it)- Easy to learn controls (also very smooth)- Can play custom maps from workshop - Can offer a real challenge on some maps - Plenty of missions-CONS- - Doesnt really have a storyline- When multiple troops paths cross or are close together it can be hard to tell a troop which way to look etc- A little expensive, but if you like topdown tactical games or its on sale its worth itOverall I think this game is one of the best games you will find in its genre, best suited for people that enjoy tactical gameplay, and the biggest downfall is its price even though its basically worth the price  "

												Really fun game to play!Looks?Reminds me of GTA 2  but with better graphics.Controls?Your mouse is almost exclusively sufficient. Keyboard use only for Go codes (A, B, C, D), sniper fire and some CTRL (locked view) and SHIFT key to highlight only selected paths. There are minor problems with complicated plans when lots of paths overlaps (even using SHIFFT) but TBH you can always be more precisie or just fix it when action goes live. Diversity of missions?More than enough. Bombs disarming, hostage rescue, VIP escorting, arresting bad guys, dope raids and simple enemy elimination.Guns and equipment?Quite a selection, especially gun wise but almost everything must be unlocked. Still when you find the fitting gun for all of your classes the selection will be just between classes (at least that was my case). Good guys?Well there are only three main stats for each officer and they are progressing without your choice but you can feel the difference between good and bad shooter especially with bad aiming gun. Bad guys?Enought to make it interesting but could be quite more. AI is quite good and on default missions there is several spawn points for bad guys, so it makes it more interesting.Maps?Plenty of different and really challenging ones.Is it tactical?Hell yeah it is ... but when you master most of the missions and use of pause you can kill everyone with one guy ... mostly. I had a lot of sneaky situations and they are planned to ambush you if you are not carefull. Some rage but no rage quits and that pleasant feeling when you finally do this.Replayibilty?With random missions and maps generator? Big. With steam workshop and plenty of maps, missions, guns, unit looks etc.? Quite bigger. Is it worth it?Hell yeah! I bought it for half the nominal price and I am more then satisfied of fun per eurocent ratio :-D			"

												That went flawlessly until the last entry and I lost Jackson. Let's run that one again. ...Dangit. That time we lost Wolf, Reed and Smoke.  Run it again....Dangit. That time we lost Ghost, Murphy, Jackson, AND Wolf. C'mon guys.... Run it again. Let's tweak that flash bang and wait 'till Alpha to breach door number 3....Perfect run!I love that the enemy can be unpredictable and random, while also being predictable at times. Practice makes perfect, and I'm addicted!			"

												A simple to play strategic game with some light RPG elements. Very fun to play a few rounds before going to work but it's deep enough to allow you to play for hours, optimizing strategies. With the inclusion of Steam Workshop this is probably the most expansive SWAT game available.			"

												very easy to learn as the controls are quite simple, but quite an in depth game thats highly addictive.one thing i really love about this game is that it takes about 3 seconds to load to the main menu, after which everything instantly loads the second you click it. that means i can load up and be straight into it within a very quick amount of time.drawing a path for your team to follow is quite fluid, if your wobbly on the mouse your teams path will be too.insert commands easily onto that path, so they will CLEAR !  a room before moving on, strafe a certain direction, or wait for a go code.use the single missions to level up your team, unlock better weapons, shields, armor, tools etc by earning stars. once something is unlocked its free to assign to any other team member.once your team is good enough you can start doing campaigns.theres virtually hundreds of maps to choose from, and a steam workshop to add even more gear and maps.unlock new squad types like assaulter, breacher, shield and improve them by earning doctrine points to spend on perks for each class.weapon type and loadout will have a big effect on how your team maneuvers, its fire rate, accuracy, stopping power or clip size.assaulting an airplane to save some hostages? maybe the pistols will allow you to maneuver around easier and change targets quicker to fire off a few well placed rounds rather than trying to use a clumsy shotgun or spray machine gun fire about.use a camera under the door to spot targets, blow open the door, flashbang, give the go signal with a ""go code"" to assault rooms full of terrorists from different doorways, save the hostages, disarm bombs, and taze the guy you have a warrant for.i give it 80/100 dead terrorists			"

												GREAT game that was well worth the price (woo holiday sale!) Planning out your unit's movements and facings is surprisingly intuitive, and the go-code mechanic helps keep your guys coordinated. Your units feel competently trained but not godlike, and the enemies are challenging without being frustrating. Pretty much every time one of my units dies, it's immediately apparent it's because I forgot to plan for some variable/check that corner/messed up my pathing/some other personal error rather than my units not shooting straight.Each officer can be customized with different class, weapons, support options, armor, and a tool, and each choice feels meaningful. For example, if I want the officer to stay in the back of an open area and provide cover, I'll make him an assault and give him a carbine for range and stopping power and heavy armor since he won't have to move as much. If I want to run the same officer through a drug bust, I'll change him to a pointman (stealth once I've unlocked it), give him a silenced pistol and light armor so he can quickly and quietly run through the hideout and secure the evidence before it's destroyed.The game almost feels puzzle like, in that it encourages players to find the optimum route through each map to guarantee success no matter enemy placement (something the game tests by mixing up where the enemies are on each map) with a well though out plan, rather than simply winging it on the fly (although that is possible, especially if you want to make effective use of the spy cam). Notably, the player is rewarded on some maps for executing the perfect plan by planning everything once, then hitting go and doing nothing but watch the action. It maintains a good balance in difficulty as well. The game rarely feels too easy, but it also rarely feels frustrating or overwhelming in difficulty.Progression is surprisngly well thought out, starting players on a simple kill house with a handful of badguys and a pair of officers, cutting their teeth in before introducing door entry, different classes, hostage rescue, and arresting/escorting mechanics.I haven't messed with the ingame editor yet, but its very presence almost guarantees near infinite replayability. Currently, there is a wide selection of challenging single missions, and four campaigns (a string of 5 or 6 missions), with a 5th having a confirmed release date and more being promised.			"

												S.W.A.T. meets the original Rainbow Six planning interface with a plethora of missions, agents, weapons and achievements to keep the hungriest tactical fanatic engaged.  This game surprised me in how well it captures tactical close quarters combat in urban environments with such a simple yet effective presentation / UI.  The graphics are detailed and communicate a sense of realism without trying to be photorealistic.But where the game really shines is in the depth of strategy that is involved in developing a plan and executing it with flawless precision.  The only thing that gives that a run for its money is when things go horribly wrong and you still manage to salvage the mission through quick thinking, dumb blind luck and grit.  Rarely do you feel like you ""got away"" with something due to A.I. glitches which further elevates the feeling of success when you pull of a great plan.If you like strategy games do yourself a favour and give this one a go.

												In my years of gaming, I have seen many great products come and go. Great products like Rainbow Six and SWAT as they made their mark in the gaming world. You tend to look back on those games and ask yourself this question. Does anyone still remember those days? How they helped pave the way for tactical strategy in games?When Door Kickers came along, the answer couldn't have been more clear. ""♥♥♥♥ yeah we remember!"" What's good about the game:-The deep tactical planning, choose from a wide variety of weapons and equipment to plan your approach. (You can even change their names if you're into that sort of thing.) Use your troopers to their maxium potiental to get the job done and bring everyone home safe. Espically in Iron Man mode you will have to take your planning very seriously as every  trooper death only makes your job harder.  -Open-ended planning, missions can be completed in several different ways. It will be up to you to determine what is the best course of action. -Random enemy placement. In most if not all cases, the odds will be stacked against you. You will face off against several tangos (bad guys) armed to the teeth and not knowing for sure of how many  are there or their location adds tenson to the action. Just because you have a plan figured out, doesn't mean things can't go wrong. -The ability to do two different playstyles. The first being a pause, plan, action playstyle. Before your troopers get into the thick of it, you can pause the game and develop a course of action for them. Tell who to go where, where to look, where to strafe, etc. Then watch it unfold when you switch it to real time. The second being what I call wing-it mode. You can play the entire mission in real time and make things up as you go. So players that aren't into the whole stop and think style aren't forced to play that way. -Numerous amount of missions and counting. There are several missions to be completed in this game, all of which have a lot of replayablity to them. Single missions, campagns, custom player-made missions, randomly generated missions. It feels practically endless to what can be done to have missions.  Furthermore, as of the time of this review, the developers are still adding missions, content, and improvements to the game.-Mod support. Something about the game you want to change up? Things like new weapons, gear,etc? Odds are there is a mod that fits the bill and there are quite a few to choose from. -The bits of comedic relief. Though this game has an overall serious tone, there are bits of humor thrown in that is quite amusing to lighten the mood a little when needed. It's not obnoxious or intrusive ethier, it's well timed and unexpected.  I'm not to going to spoil them as I'll leave them to be discovered yourself. ;)I honestly can't think of anything serious to complain about with Door Kickers. It's an overall well made and addicting tactical strategy game that is worthy of your money and time.  Even at full price, you get a lot for twenty dollars.  "

*** I bought this game during the 2014 year-end Steam sale, and played when I got back to my uni before the finals week, most of the time off-line (>80% of my playtime) due to a massive flood disaster. So at the time this is written, I have played almost 100 hours offline, and only 13 hours with Steam online, which is why Steam only clocks me as have played only 13 hours.Oh and one more thing: I like writing, so my review is going to be REALLY long.Now with that out of the way, I'm going to get to reviewing Door Kickers (DK).What is Door Kickers?You know what Rainbow Six (R6) is? If you don't, scroll down to the bottom of my review where I tell you a bit about R6. If you do, well, that's what DK is, except for three differences: DK is a top-down tactical shooter / R6 is an FPS tactical shooter DK is very easy and light to just pick up and play, whenever, wherever. Coffee break, lunch hour, taking a sh*t (if there will ever be a tablet version, which is very much possible if the dev bothers), doing your whatever thing with your laptop at Starbucks, etc. DK has you control a SWAT team with a considerably wide range of Law Enforcement Organization (LEO)-level gear / R6 has you control a bunch of hardened and specialized team of tacticool genius-level operator dudes and chicks bearing a very-wide range of military-grade toysThat's it. The rest, everything you remember from your fondest R6 days - choosing, equipping and leveling up your squads (with different classes), breach gadgets, planning your maneuvers, your button-hooks, wedges/pies, rescuing hostages, defusing bombs, capturing HVTs, retrieving intel/evidence, or straight-up delivering 'Merica to the bad guys - it's all there, AND THEN SOME: ""Doctrine"" system - a set of RPG-like skill trees, each specializing in different weapons and engagement discipline. DK is constantly updated with new contents such as campaigns and maps by both the devs and the awesomely capable community. DK has loads of awesome mods in the workshop. ATM there are: an R6-themed sound overhaul, loads of new military-grade weapons and operator skins for those who want a change in atmosphere, and tons of custom maps designed by the community. DK lets you watch a replay of your mission, record it with a built-in recorder, and even choose a point from your replay, and re-do the mission from said point. LEVEL EDITOR - need I say more?So, with the basic features explained, what are the pros and cons?PROS: A mix of casual and hardcore: play how you want - easy-breezy, smash and shoot your way into the sh*t (which will most likely get your team or the hostage killed), OR take your time with recon (slow is smooth, smooth is fast), OR a mix of both (scout a bit, get in and improvise as necessary). Like R6, watching the result of your hardly-worked planning go down (especially when it goes right), like when your team is smoothly moving in, covering every angle, or when they smash in hard and fast and smack the bad guys who's having their thumbs up their behind, is simply indescribable. Config files are easy to manipulate, which lets you alter the in-game assets (weapons stats and attributes etc.) to your preference, also makes modding easier Replay feature Considerable replayability Awesome community-made contents Devs that DELIVARRRRSCONS: MIGHT get boring once you've aced all the maps and campaigns, and have run out of custom contents to play around with, but that's a given with any single-player games. Last I checked, the replay feature is still a little imperfect, where it sometimes ""desyncs"" and fail to play to the end. IMHO the breaching features can still be polished, in terms of set-pieces, such as a more snappy flash-entry or frag-entry. Not enough non-lethal options: so far there's only the taser-gun, but the workshop is quick to remedy this by offering a wide array of community-made non-lethal options (the super-painful-non-lethal-but-I-might-as-well-be-dead-if-I-get-shot-with-this bean bag rounds, rubber/silicone bullets, etc.)So, do you recommend it?Does the leader of a popular religion defecate in remote areas of the forest?11/10 as far am I'm concerned, and I'm not even kidding.What in the hell is R6?You see, most of you who are below 20 most probably haven't heard of the R6 series, apart from the Vegas installments which are NOT what R6 really is. R6 is a hardcore tactical shooter where you control a team of counter-terrorist squad during various tactically-demanding operations, be it recon, seek & destroy, search & rescue, and bomb defusal. The R6 initiative, a fictional covert counter-terrorist organization born from the mind of the great Tom Clancy (a great, great author, despite the heavy political bias in his novels), specializes in going where the regular LEO can't go or has been terribly outmatched, where a swift and precise tactical intervention is severely needed, and where the faintest of the slightest hint of NATO involvement will stir up some real sh*t, so even the most specialest and tacticoolest of operators can't go. Oh, wait, that last bit is Splinter Cell. Sorry.You see, at least as far as I understand from my various encounter with Hollywood pop-culture, there are a few levels of domestic LEO, which deals in different levels of criminal situations: Some drunk guy smacked his loud-mouthed wife about? You send out a dispatch so the local PD on his beat will go in and check it out. Convenience store in a stick-up? Local PD. A junkie with an illegal 9mm he got from Motherf*cker Jones is holding his neighbor for ransom because he can't afford his fix? You might wanna call the SWAT to back the local PD up, just in case it really gets out of hand. Local gang drinking party turned into a violent shootout because of a domestic disturbance warrant serve turned a little too serious? A homosexual man and his totally straight crew decides to rob a sleepy bank, but it turned into a messy hostage situation? Definitely call in the SWAT, AND the FBI HRT. A maniacal cartel kingpin from across the border decides that the Narc, ATF and/or Feds have been too nosy and destroyed too much of their business decides to send a hit squad and shoot up a local PD HQ? An extremist militant cell rounded up and locked in a huge bunch of civs in a big library and set-off a timed dirty bomb in it? The UN conference was smashed in and every world leader is held hostage with demands of the US to hand over all their nukes? THESE, you call in the R6. Except for the last part with the UN? Yeah that's definitely Ghost Recon turf. "

												The store page description said it clear: Real Time with Free Pause No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces Realistic but action packed Those points made me buy the game, and I was never disappointed. Door Kickers is best SWAT type tactical strategy you will ever play. The game offers many customization for your squad, many type of weapons and tools to choose from. There are tons of missions and campaigns, with ability to build your own mission and share it on steamwrokshop. The main things that made me really enjoy this game is the planning, the more you plan and make sure you use the right tools in right position the more of chance you will pass the mission, the beautiful thing that once you hit the unpause button you will see how your orchestrated plan going, and if it works as you plan and succeed, you will feel the satisfaction in such way that you will never feel it in any other similar game. The game use simple 2D graphics, but with many details to reload and recoil of each weapon.I totally recommend this game for any tactical games fans, it is great value of money. "

												Door Kickers is worth buying if you are looking for a long lasting tactical game where you can customize everything about it. There are 78 single missions to complete, three campaigns that hardcore players will enjoy, unlimited replayability with the level generator, and the level editor will entertain the creative types.A video showing everything that the game is about:

												It's awesome. ""Overwhelmingly positive"" not only says it all but is dead-on.It feels not new but completely novel at the same time. I thought it'd finally be a game where you can just click play and enjoy it in between busy times (which you can) but so far it's only addictive and I can't stop playing.Planing out your raids, trying to get every little detail right, every little corner of the room covered is just heaps of fun. And I'm not even at the level yet where I would try to get the challenges done or challenge myself. It feels like one of those games where you keep thinking ""yes, finally someone realized that graphics isn't all and gameplay is the important part of a game"". If there are any glitches or graphics aren't good (it feels like they are just amazing enough for this game) than I haven't realized any of that because I'm completely sucked into the window in the middle of the screen where all the action is happening.

I can also pause it and walk away from it without the worry of abonding my team in RTS like the wargame series. I love the stargetc depth and almost infinte replay value.			"

												What ""SWAT 2"" should have been, and what we all longed for it to be. A top-down/isometric strategic version of ""SWAT"", not the RPG/Action-based first game, but the squad-based TPS/FPS versions that followed. Unfortunately, ""SWAT 2"" was a critical and popular failure. Still, the promise of it kept many of us coming back to it, despite it's inherant design flaws, and managing SWAT vehicles was always fun.Fresh from the fields of ""Breach & Clear"", a top-down & isometric military CQB mobile port (clear and away better than most AAA titles) I'm pleasanlty surpsied this takes that concept, though admittedly without trying to, and brings it to the real time confines of SWAT CQB situations.Placed squarley between the simplistic, but involving ""Breach & Clear""and the sophistication and complexity of (some might say, overly difficult) ""Frozen Synapse"", ""Door Kickers"" is ""SWAT 2 - Re-Imagained"" (without the vehicles, of course).As ""Breach & Clear 2"" is going to ramp up the looks and gameplay for it's PC base, built upon it's on it's sales so far (taking it to preactically AAA standards), I have high, very high hopes that ""Door Kickers 2"" will finally be the ultimate ""SWAT"" tactical game we strategy nuts have always wanted.Unitl then. I have Tangos to take down, hsotages to rescue, and sitruations to control without being remonstrated by Samuel S. Jackson. Many, many challenges yet to face with my team of gungho ""Cold Zero"" sharpshooters.Honestly: 8.5/10, even though my time-in-game does not reflect just how enamoured I am with this gem.			"

												(To preface, this was originally written as a not-recommended and has changed back and forth many times. My thoughts are still exactly the same, but my tolerance of the problems has increased a little bit as time goes on. Take from that what you will.)If I could give this game a ""Neutral"" rather than a ""Recommended"", I would do that instead.This game has a lot of strong pros and a lot of strong cons. I'd recommend reading the details to determine if the game is for you rather than taking the recommend at face value!So the best way I can describe this game is if you take Frozen Synapse and SWAT (4, not 3) and combine them into a game with quick objectives and short but satisfying levels. You'll be tasked to take your organized team, breach and enter various locations, and complete various objectives such as neutralizing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retreiving evidence, and such.You can either choose to plan out your assault completely from the start and play it out, or you can organize it in chunks with a handy pause function. Pausing makes the game a bit easier but making a single plan can be very rewarding.The game has a mission generator (which is less of a generator since it basically grabs a random mission layout and randomizes the enemy and objective layout). There's a lot of content here for you to keep playing, granted you don't mind having a limited amount of variety in the way of objectives and how you handle them (which is not a bad thing since that's a lot how real scenarios play out - like the book).Real life tactics can come into handy play here minus a few key ideas such as leaning- though I'm not sure how it would work given its control scheme......Which is where the problems start to become evident.You see, the way you set a path for your SWAT members to follow is you click and drag them one. In order to place actions along the path, you create nodes on it by right clicking. This makes sense in theory but it has several hangups which severly ruin the flow. Rather than having to delete parts of your path manually to change them, you just pick a part earlier and draw from there which will erase everything that comes after that spot. Unfortunately, it's very easy to do this by accident and the game lacks any sort of undo functionality. This can result in you spending upwards to 5 - 10 minutes making an intricate path only to accidentally change the wrong team member's path or mis click, wasting your time having to redo it.The game also has a large auto-snap when highlighting notes, making precision very difficilt. If you have multiple teammates on a similar path with each of their nodes next to each other, the game turns into a frustrating pixel hunt trying to get the correct officer in the correct part of the path.The game also has some problematic design choices that clash with the subject matter. Namely that the game wants to you play very fast score wise (and some missions require you to be fast with as quick as a 10 second or less time limit for hostages) yet actively discourages fast playing with realistic health and mobility stats that change with weaponry and body armor. In order to get 3 stars for the mission, one of the requirements is to beat a certain time. This wouldn't be a problem but these times are very unforgiving, often forcing you to ignore your officer's safety in favor of working very quickly. Often you'll find that you won't have time use a spy camera or silently pick a lock as you'll compromise your score.Now, if score was only for personal gratification and leaderboards, I wouldn't have a problem with this design. However, you use the stars that you unlock in order to purchase other weapons, body armor, and tools. If you're earning less stars per mission, you're going to progress a bit slower.The progression itself isn't terribly slow, but it also feels like a system that's designed to limit the players' toolsets rather than give them options. It's restrictive and ultimately pointless as a lot of unlockables aren't worth it compared to the superior options. What you'll most likely do (and a lot of players also recommend this) is to find an easy generated mission and grind it until you have all the stars you need to unlock what you want. You won't be doing it for long, as unlocked items are unlocked for everybody (as opposed to per officer), I feel like this artificially extends playtime rather than actively engaging the player. This could have been done better. It's not a dealbreaker but it's also needlessly frustrating for the first one or two hours of play.This isn't to suggest that the game is bad, however. Like I already said, if I could give this game a Neutral rating, I would.While I didn't experiment much with it, the game has a really neat campaign mode where officers that are killed during missions are permenently dead. Since you also train your officers as part of the progression system, this can make for a really interesting dynamic where you need to take the risk of sending in your best trained officers to deal with a mission but have the possibility of losing them, or sending in worse officers at the risk of performing the mission not as well. It's not terribly fleshed out, but it's still interesting.The game can also be really satisfying when you're not fighting the mechanics or design choices. It's a really strong idea and it works well enough, but some of the execution falls a bit flat.If it sounds like these things wouldn't bother you much or you're willing to look past them, then by all means pick this game up- as there is a lot of fun to be had here. However, if you think these will bother you, then either wait until this game is on sale or wait for Door Kickers 2. Apparently some issues may be fixed there and I think it's worth keeping note of.Hopefully this helped! And yes, I know this review will have a very low number of votes because people downvote most negative reviews for whatever reason. So thanks for reading if you got this far!			"

												I consider this game a spiritual successor to the original Rainbow Six titles. You select your roster, change their loadouts for the mission, plan their points of entry and the paths they'll take during the mission, then you watch it all come to life. If you're quick enough, you can change your squad members' tactics on the fly in real-time, or you can just pause the action and make your adjustments from there. All in all, this game feels very good and it's easy to lose hours retrying one mission just to make it come out perfectly.Unlike Rainbow Six, you actually have to unlock all of the different weapons and specializations which gives the game a bit of an RPG feel, if not a bit frustrating for people who immediately want to use an assault rifle. There's multiple stock campaigns, and a good amount of user-created content as well. If you're looking for a true spiritual successor to OG R6, and are willing to settle for top-down graphics, this game is for you.			"

												PROS: Huge amount of doors you can kick. Also, you can kill many door owners who doesn't want their doors being kicked.CONS: There are doors that can't be kicked. Developers should focus in that issue as soon as possible.  Why every door owner is a NRA member? That's confusing for non american players and it's not explained by the game plot.SUMMARY:If you like kicking furniture to splinters and get into hard troubles with violent landlords, this game is highly recommended.Don't buy It if you have too much carpentry sensibility. Furniture explicitly suffers in this game.			"

												During a 50% off sale, the dev Vulpe told me this game was worth more than £7, and that it was the cheapest it was going to be. I quote him directly: ""The game will not be discounted lower than 50%"". I like to think of myself as a generous man, but his comment on the price not going any lower only brought out my love and desire to take on a challenge. The waiting game began. Months and months passed, and the summer sale had begun. I see Door Kickers with a 60% off tag, but my excitement is contained. Not even a grin or smirk is shown. I wasn't going to give in this easily. It's 3 minutes until the new daily and flash sales begin. I refresh the Steam store at 6PM on the dot. I browse the deals, and to my disappointment, Door Kickers has not been discounted further. A week passes and the 60% is still there.  Not a single daily or flash has contained this game. My mind is filled with Vulpe's manic laughter, I hallucinate him & Gabe knocking at my door. I have nightmares where they tear my wallet from my pants and spend all my money gifting Door Kickers to people I'm not even friends with. I want to take the plunge, but my instinct tells me it isn't over yet. I've been sitting at my computer for 4 days straight now. Just waiting for new sales, refreshing over and over. I haven't slept. I haven't eaten. It's 6AM. I refresh the store for the morning flash sale. There it is. Door Kickers, 75% off. I sit in silence at first. I feel relief, and I feel pain. A tear falls down my cheek, and I click add to cart. I pay £3.75 and the game is mine. I sit back in my chair as the game installs, and laugh like I've lost my mind. I did it, I thought to myself. I persevered and reaped the rewards.I'm 3 hours into the game, and I start crying. Vulpe, you were right; I can confirm this game is worth more than £7. Thank you for this emotional journey. Well played, Vulpe. Well played.			"

												Great ""simple"" tacticool title, albeit with some minor scuffs.The game mechanics are VERY easy to learn, yet surprisingly complex, so you can easily get into the game quickly, but will be working for a LONG time to master the game. And yes, this is one of those games where you will WANT to 3 star a level. So, while the levels themselves aren't super diverse(some are, but most aren't), you will want to keep re-attempting them for that perfect run(ala R6).The game definitely has some small issues still though, but ALL of these could be patched easily:* still hard to properly orient your guys throughout the process.

												This is a game about door kicking. You get to kick a lot of doors, under many different circumstances. You have a squad of door kickers who somehow get better at other things, but not so much at door kicking.Usually there are people on the other side of the doors you kicked. They don't like you and shoot at you. I can only presume they are upset because they would have liked to kick the doors themselves. You can buy better weapons and armor to deal with these unpleasant interruptions better so you can get back to door kicking.Some doors can't be kicked right away. You have to do things to them first. Basically, they're playing hard to get. But they want to get kicked, and you'll kick them eventually. You know they like it.			"

												Let's start saying I like this game. It's fun, there's different ways to get to every objective, lots of tactics involved.You need luck too, but that's just a minor thing, and it makes things even more realistic.Graphics are nicely done, sound could be better (so... my ""Angela"" has a male voice?) but it's good enough, maybe a few more character customization options would be nice.HOWEVER, there are two things that prevent me from recommending the game.BUGSI've just completed the ""Cartel Beach Party"" mission, it took me about an hour to get three stars in it. That's because the plan I was using (which is the one I think is best to accomplish this goal) relied pretty heavily in having two shields and two assaulters, with shields opening the doors to small rooms while assaulters had to flashbang and then kill the guys in the bigger areas, plus the final shootout in the living room. The problems here are four:1. Shields ALWAYS turn their back to a door while opening it, getting hit AT LEAST once each time.2. Shields sometime go through the doors before opening them, exposing themselves to enemy fire.3. Enemies can sometimes shoot through walls if they're close to a unit.4. Units sometimes get stuck in front of doors with their guns lowered, exposing themselves to enemy fire and not reacting.This is far more than what I can stand, considering these bugs compromised my mission to the point I had to restart it 20+ times to get lucky enough not to get hit.STARSThe Stars system is beyond frustrating. You get X stars based on how many stars you get in a mission, and they only count once (unless you get a higher rank, in that case the latest obtained stars are added). With items costing 10+ stars, and with stars being non-farmable, a poor equipment choice will doom your missions to failure.I got 3 stars on almost every mission up to the first rescue missions, and (probably) wasted my stars in not-so-good equipment. Now, I can still progress in the game, but I think my units would last longer with, say, a better armor.They really need to change the Stars to something new, or at least make them farmable.In the very end, it's a shame this game has these two problems. Other than that, it's a great game.			"

												Great fun, for a great price, especially on sale. Watch in rage or satisfaction as the plan to clear a mansion that you spent 30 minutes on either gets you killed in seconds or executes perfectly. Plenty of mod support too. I don't really have problems with the game (again, that price tag doesn't leave much room for nitpicks) but I wish there was more realism in weapon stats, more abilities when around doors, cover, enemies, hostages, etc, and prettier/more stylized graphics.

												Door kicker is just like the more tactical version of the old game named ""SWAT4""(go play it if you like this type of game)Door kicker is the game that allows you to use many different ways to ""kick doors"". Multiple roles and gears vary the style of your door kicking.I will rate this game 9 out of 10.The only 1 point that ""Door kicker"" misses is that campign is too damn hard. Just go try it, you will feel the pain.			"

												Wanted to log at least 10 hours into the game before I wrote anything about it.Now I have, so here it goes.This game. Is ♥♥♥♥ing. great.I'm the type of person who enjoys tactical games. From strategy games (Company of Heroes) to tactical shooters (Arma series, CS:GO, anything involving tactics) to turn based tactic games (Arma Tactics, other misc mobile-esque games of the such) This game fits the bill perfectly for a tactical experience. It's fast paced enough to keep tensions high, and the ability to pause and issue orders lets you think before you act. Unfortuantely, I was raised in the Post-SWAT games era, so I've not had a chance to play SWAT 4 (anyone want to sell me their copy? Kidding of course); but this game comes about as close to the experience as I think I'm going to get. I'm well on my way to 20 hours, and the way I approach video games is, if I can get a 1$/1Hour of entertainment ratio, it was money well spent, and that is certainly going to happen with this game.

												Great ""simple"" tacticool title, albeit with some minor scuffs.The game mechanics are VERY easy to learn, yet surprisingly complex, so you can easily get into the game quickly, but will be working for a LONG time to master the game. And yes, this is one of those games where you will WANT to 3 star a level. So, while the levels themselves aren't super diverse(some are, but most aren't), you will want to keep re-attempting them for that perfect run(ala R6).The game definitely has some small issues still though, but ALL of these could be patched easily:* still hard to properly orient your guys throughout the process. Yes, there are ""two"" modes of look direction(strafe + body facing), but the game doesn't seem to always follow what you have selected(sometimes you'll find your guys walking backwards into a room...)* still issues with ""overlapping"" unit movement and proper selection. ie: if unit A and unit B are traveling close together...it's VERY hard to select A and orient him; oftentimes the game will make it hard to select A or B, so I would recommend a way to ""dim"" or outright remove other unit pathing temporarily during the setup process to avoid this* randomness(a good thing and a bad thing): there are times when you'll just do the SIMPLEST layout(with no facing setup) and it will be flawless...other times you'll put lots of effort into a perfect run...only to see your ""elite"" soldier stand in a doorway and eat a magazine dump...* some of the weapon options/classes are kind of pointless.

												I love this game already, and I'm not even done.One day, I found this game. It looked interesting, so I put it on my wishlist, and bought it 50% off later.My money was not wasted, I'll tell ya that.I always have been a fan of tactics. I've played RTSs like Age of Empires and Dawn of War. However, nothing I have played comes close to this game. Y'see, this game means it when it says you make the tactics. The whole thing is controlled by you. The only limitations is how many doors you have to kick. In some missions, you can get multiple deployment zones and entry points and so on... you know what? I think i'll make an example.One mission takes place in a pleasant little cove beside the ocean. My job is to go in, kill the bad guys, and arrest some dude. The game let me position my team where I wanted. Some came in the front, some in the sides, heck, I was even able to deploy one guy coming in off of the beach. Any door there was into the house, I could take it. That's one of the thing I like; there's not one way of entry. If one way works, try again another way in. Another thing to mention was just the level design in that they were kinda realistic missions. A bank robbery, a drug raid on a house in the middle of nowhere, a hostage situation in an embassy... these were all missions I did. The situation and level design made it feel like this was something that could actually happen. The next big thing was the character customization of your team. It wasn't just expendable idiot numbers 1-10. It was different people. As well as their loadouts, you could change their picture and names. I soon had a team named after me and some of my friends. Also, they had randomly generated stats. Each person had things they were good at. This person is a great shot, this one can defuse a bomb quick, this one reacts quick... Once again, they weren't just a group of idiots with guns, they were actually different and unique. Then after that, there's 5 different classes you can take, all with special weapons. Stealth (my favorite, as they don't alert every bad guy this side of the equator you're here) take silenced weapons, Assaulters use rifles and SMGs, Shields, well, carry shields, Breachers are shotgunners, and finally, pointmen are cowboys. They all have very different play styles, so this adds in another factor of you asking yourself, ""Hmm... what guns should I shoot people with today?""Now, there are some downsides to this game. First of all, if you don't like tactics, waiting, and thinking, this isn't your game my friend. I know of another game that might be more your pace. It's called Call of Duty. Look it up. Second, this game can sometimes be just INFURIATING. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so when I do missions, I wanna get all the points, which includes no casualties. That can be very difficult. The odds are often against you. You might have forgot one dude, one corner, one tiny bit of area, and sometimes, that can lead to a mission restart.  Some missions are nigh impossible to do. And then there's everyone's favorite, HOSTAGE SITUATIONS. If one of those guys so much as hears you, they'll shoot a hostage. One hostage dies, and you have to stay completely over. One single innocent down, and it's back to the drawing board. So, this game can be just extremely hard, but I will say this; it feels so rewarding to finally see that ""Mission Complete"" screen at the end. This is a game that will make you work, but when you get your reward, it is amazing, because you know you earned it. All in all, I love this game. I haven't played for very long, but I have a lot more to do, including 4 campaigns. That's right, this game has campaigns. I didn't cover everything, but I covered what I think is most important. Now shouldya buy this game, or go waste you money on things like beer, hookers, and collage? Well, I dunno at the full $20, but if there is another sale when it drops to $10, I'd definitely recommend picking it up. It's a fun game and there's a lot of replayability in it. so, kick doors, down tangos, and rage over hostages being executioned because Larry in the back tripped over a twig.  And that concludes that. Now go home and read a book or summtin'.  "

												This is an enjoyable yet highly frustrating game mired by conflicting design decisions and implementation as well as a suspect UI and control scheme that has clearly not been created for PC.7.0/10 as of 29/4/2015 (14 hours of gameplay)On the positive side, it's a lot of fun at the basic level and replaying single levels over and over again is very rewarding using different tactics and weapons. Attempting to complete levels using a single trooper or one complete plan is even more engaging and rewarding. The game fails when you start unlocking further upgrades/weapons/setups and attempt some of the more complicated levels. This is where you need some intricate planning and split-second decisions and reactions count. And this is where the poor UI fails and where the design flaws start to actually matter.Some of the really annoying issues include:-inability to sync moves beyond the A B C D go-codes. Frozen Synapse does a WAY better job at that.-you can't change a trooper's angle of view and swap weapons/reload in the same move. One action will cancel the other so either you have to unpause, execute the 1st action, pause, and queue up the 2nd one, or you have to create a redundant move point in order to queue up your 2nd action. You should be able to queue up 2 such basic actions simultaneously.-you can't edit or move any waypoints in the middle of a chain. Everything after the point of edit is deleted and on those long complicated levels this is SUCH a waste of time!-in some levels, the game forces your troopers into very small quarters and trying to select them and order them around becomes a nightmare. There's no SELECT ALL feature so trying to get your troopers onto the 2nd floor is very annoying. Also the way the game selects which troopers are moved between floors seems pure random. I've failed so many missions because I kept switching between floors trying to get everyone in one place and end up being flanked and killed during the time I've wasted.-I've no idea how this game expects you to play it in real-time mode with such bugs and weird control scheme. Some keyboard hotkeys would be nice.I'm still recommending it because I've got my fair share of fun for the price I've paid; I got the game on sale for 50%. Until this game becomes more PC friendly, I wouldn't recommend getting it at full price. The ability to mod and create/share your own content is awesome but I really need tight gameplay and proper user-feedback to enjoy this game the way the developers intended me to.			"

												I love this game already, and I'm not even done.One day, I found this game. It looked interesting, so I put it on my wishlist, and bought it 50% off later.My money was not wasted, I'll tell ya that.I always have been a fan of tactics. I've played RTSs like Age of Empires and Dawn of War. However, nothing I have played comes close to this game. Y'see, this game means it when it says you make the tactics. The whole thing is controlled by you. The only limitations is how many doors you have to kick. In some missions, you can get multiple deployment zones and entry points and so on... you know what? I think i'll make an example.One mission takes place in a pleasant little cove beside the ocean. My job is to go in, kill the bad guys, and arrest some dude. The game let me position my team where I wanted. Some came in the front, some in the sides, heck, I was even able to deploy one guy coming in off of the beach. Any door there was into the house, I could take it. That's one of the thing I like; there's not one way of entry. If one way works, try again another way in. Another thing to mention was just the level design in that they were kinda realistic missions. A bank robbery, a drug raid on a house in the middle of nowhere, a hostage situation in an embassy... these were all missions I did. The situation and level design made it feel like this was something that could actually happen. The next big thing was the character customization of your team. It wasn't just expendable idiot numbers 1-10. It was different people. As well as their loadouts, you could change their picture and names. I soon had a team named after me and some of my friends. Also, they had randomly generated stats. Each person had things they were good at. This person is a great shot, this one can defuse a bomb quick, this one reacts quick... Once again, they weren't just a group of idiots with guns, they were actually different and unique. Then after that, there's 5 different classes you can take, all with special weapons. Stealth (my favorite, as they don't alert every bad guy this side of the equator you're here) take silenced weapons, Assaulters use rifles and SMGs, Shields, well, carry shields, Breachers are shotgunners, and finally, pointmen are cowboys. They all have very different play styles, so this adds in another factor of you asking yourself, ""Hmm... what guns should I shoot people with today?""Now, there are some downsides to this game. First of all, if you don't like tactics, waiting, and thinking, this isn't your game my friend. I know of another game that might be more your pace. It's called Call of Duty. Look it up. Second, this game can sometimes be just INFURIATING. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so when I do missions, I wanna get all the points, which includes no casualties. That can be very difficult. The odds are often against you. You might have forgot one dude, one corner, one tiny bit of area, and sometimes, that can lead to a mission restart.  Some missions are nigh impossible to do. And then there's everyone's favorite, HOSTAGE SITUATIONS. If one of those guys so much as hears you, they'll shoot a hostage. One hostage dies, and you have to stay completely over. One single innocent down, and it's back to the drawing board. So, this game can be just extremely hard, but I will say this; it feels so rewarding to finally see that ""Mission Complete"" screen at the end. This is a game that will make you work, but when you get your reward, it is amazing, because you know you earned it. All in all, I love this game. I haven't played for very long, but I have a lot more to do, including 4 campaigns. That's right, this game has campaigns. I didn't cover everything, but I covered what I think is most important. Now shouldya buy this game, or go waste you money on things like beer, hookers, and collage? Well, I dunno at the full $20, but if there is another sale when it drops to $10, I'd definitely recommend picking it up. It's a fun game and there's a lot of replayability in it. so, kick doors, down tangos, and rage over hostages being executioned because Larry in the back tripped over a twig.  And that concludes that. Now go home and read a book or summtin'.  "

												You will break many doors in this game, that is why companies cut down rainforests so that they can provide more wood for the new doors to be built on the place where you broke them and you know what? The whole planet dies because there will be no rainforests and it is just because you cannot take your time to open the door properly but instead you kick the door. "

												A quick summary of a mission plan in this game.-Tactic works properly checking every corner and eliminating everyone in each room without setting foot inside.Killed a hostage-Second try you try to engage at distanceSomebody's in the room behind you-You have one guy watch the room while the other shootsEntry fails when your flashbang bounces off an enemy-You remake your entire team for assault and recon so recon check every room, extract hostages and lay down explosives for the assaults as well as collecting evidence, the assaults go in, set off the explosives, rescue any missed hostages and complete any remaining objectives. Plan for use works perfectly.Assault killed when a charge backfires and a terrorist comes out of the lavoratory. Recon die later to heavy fire.-You send one guy in, randomly with a shotgunMission complete in 20 seconds.			"

												Do you like a tactical shooter? That requires you to think, plan, and rapidly respond to situations? If not, then you might as well leave. If you try to run and gun your entire squad will die in no less than 5-10 seconds (I wish I was joking), This game is brutal, but it is so rewarding when you win without losing  a single squad member, and it's a helluva lotta fun getting there. Bottom line is that this game is incredible, but it depends on what type of game you like. If you're the Call of Duty, run and gun player this game isn't for you. If you're the Arma II, tactical shooter who likes stratgey, this game is a must buy. it's so much fun and best of all, it's constantly being updated! Honestly, get this game!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is absolutely fantastic. It is really engaging, features character customization and REALLY makes you think about your next move. It is very fluid and the controls are well made and simple to use, featuring real time strategy.Despite it being Early Access, this game feels very clean and finished. You have to clear rooms and save hostages, take out all the enemies and defuse bombs.The one and ONLY gripe I have is just the way the room clearing works. The game ends when you have killed all terrorists, even if you haven't cleared the other rooms. Personally, this slightly ruins the immersion for me and it would be great if the developers could fix this.Brilliant game and well worth the price. 9/10 :)			"

												Bought this game quite recently, but already I love it. It's a great overhead 2D game where you control a SWAT team and have to command them tactically through hostile situations. Here's a quick overview:PROS(+++) Mission Variety -- There are many types of missions: there are ""clear all hostiles"" missions, hostage rescues, domb defusal, arrests, friendly escorts, and even a mode where you must collect evidence before criminals destory it. The game has plenty of ""official missions"", which are pre-rendered maps with variations of these missions; you can play these many times to improve your results and earn medals. It also has campaigns, which make the injuries and deaths on your squad have permanence and require you to safely lead your men through each mission. Most importantly, however, is the random mission generator, which picks maps at random and assigns varying scenarios and missions, or genreates maps for you to clear; this is especially fun when you set the genration options to random and aren't sure what you'll get in terms of enemy strength. Finally, there is a map editor and the ability to download other people's maps, and with the devs themselves adding new missions and campaigns as the game goes on, the challenges won't likely run out anytime soon.(++) Squad Scaling -- Throwing a little RPG into the mix, the game provides you with experience -- both for each trooper and the squad as a whole -- after each mission. These can be used to unlock skills for the whole squad, and each trooper will increase their own stats as you use them. You also unlock more weapons and equipment as you earn stars for completing missions quickly and without losing men, and its fun to level and gear up as you beat more and more missions, making armored or armed enemeies easier to handle.(++) Enjoyable gameplay -- The enemy varieties and randomness in each mission gives each scenario a freshness, and requires you to keep thinking through encounters instead of just doing the same thing over and over (although the restart button is there when you need it). It's a great experience if you've ever wanted to command a SWAT team and hear them shout ""Clear! Clear!"" as they systematically put bullets into hostiles.CONS(-) Controls/Interface -- Once you get used to them, the path-drawing/command-giving controls are fairly intuitive and work 90% of the time. However, as I've found with a few top-down tactics games, you don't always get the full level of control you'd want when working with your men. In certain cases, such as when two trooper's paths overlap or giving orders that stack commands on door opening, you'll misclick and put your shotgunner in front of your riot shielder or send a man through a door backwards. There are a few things the interface could do to alleviate this (such as perhaps showing unit paths one at a time, or giving a little more control over what order door opening actions are performed in) but overall it is a minor problem that usually causes little trouble once you know what to watch for.(-) Squad Scaling -- I know this was under PROS as well, but I found that my squad was fully trained and upgraded with the gear I wanted after only a few hours of gameplay. The rest of the upgrades, then, just felt like I was unlocking gear for the sake of using up my XP or stars, and now, though I still enjoy the missions, I've run out of things to unlock. Perhaps adding more unlockables or more squad skill trees would help keep advancement fresh as the game is played longer, though the focus of this game is on individual tactical missions and not squad progression.OVERALLIf you ever dreamed of virtually barking tactical decisions over radio to a SWAT team engaging hostiles, get this game. Hours of fun for sure. "

												Wanted to log at least 10 hours into the game before I wrote anything about it.Now I have, so here it goes.This game. Is ♥♥♥♥ing. great.I'm the type of person who enjoys tactical games. From strategy games (Company of Heroes) to tactical shooters (Arma series, CS:GO, anything involving tactics) to turn based tactic games (Arma Tactics, other misc mobile-esque games of the such) This game fits the bill perfectly for a tactical experience. It's fast paced enough to keep tensions high, and the ability to pause and issue orders lets you think before you act. Unfortuantely, I was raised in the Post-SWAT games era, so I've not had a chance to play SWAT 4 (anyone want to sell me their copy? Kidding of course); but this game comes about as close to the experience as I think I'm going to get. I'm well on my way to 20 hours, and the way I approach video games is, if I can get a 1$/1Hour of entertainment ratio, it was money well spent, and that is certainly going to happen with this game.

												Let's start saying I like this game. It's fun, there's different ways to get to every objective, lots of tactics involved.You need luck too, but that's just a minor thing, and it makes things even more realistic.Graphics are nicely done, sound could be better (so... my ""Angela"" has a male voice?) but it's good enough, maybe a few more character customization options would be nice.HOWEVER, there are two things that prevent me from recommending the game.BUGSI've just completed the ""Cartel Beach Party"" mission, it took me about an hour to get three stars in it. That's because the plan I was using (which is the one I think is best to accomplish this goal) relied pretty heavily in having two shields and two assaulters, with shields opening the doors to small rooms while assaulters had to flashbang and then kill the guys in the bigger areas, plus the final shootout in the living room. The problems here are four:1. Shields ALWAYS turn their back to a door while opening it, getting hit AT LEAST once each time.2. Shields sometime go through the doors before opening them, exposing themselves to enemy fire.3. Enemies can sometimes shoot through walls if they're close to a unit.4. Units sometimes get stuck in front of doors with their guns lowered, exposing themselves to enemy fire and not reacting.This is far more than what I can stand, considering these bugs compromised my mission to the point I had to restart it 20+ times to get lucky enough not to get hit.STARSThe Stars system is beyond frustrating. You get X stars based on how many stars you get in a mission, and they only count once (unless you get a higher rank, in that case the latest obtained stars are added). With items costing 10+ stars, and with stars being non-farmable, a poor equipment choice will doom your missions to failure.I got 3 stars on almost every mission up to the first rescue missions, and (probably) wasted my stars in not-so-good equipment. Now, I can still progress in the game, but I think my units would last longer with, say, a better armor.They really need to change the Stars to something new, or at least make them farmable.In the very end, it's a shame this game has these two problems. Other than that, it's a great game.			"

								Wow!!! This Game has so much potential in it and currently its in BETA stage. Because it's 2D, Players can edit there own maps with the map editor inside. There is a LOT of new maps coming out each updates. Also, this game has Steam Workshop, which means players can play with mods. Awesome game. Recommend to buy!1000/10			"

 NOTE: This review was last updated on 19 Dec, 2014 @ 4:49pm. Things I talked about may now be irrelevant. I will update this review in the near future as I have stopped progressively playing Doorkickers.As much as want to enjoy Door Kickers, as I am a big fan of Tactic RTS's , this one has given me the most frustation yet, and not in a good, challenging way either. Although my hours spent on this game at the time of this review is few, the movement mechanics have already hindered a positive impression from me. Often times, the fault in my plans is not in my ability, but in the broken mechanics of the game. When things work out and bugs such as shooting at the wall because the target is to my characters adjacent isn't a problem, the game is fun. Watching my team swiftly move in and clearing the area under a designated time feel rewarding and I can see what the dev's envision. But, having a constant struggle with things like redoing my carefully laid out plan because adding a step would somehow erase the previous ones, or, being unable to peak around the corner of a doorway because the action menu of breaching methods block my cursor from selecting my move node, breaks the experience for me. Among all my concerns however, the two big annoyances are when my team disregards the assigned command call (ex. Alpha, Bravo), and moves in on their own, and, when the units move before clearing a newly breached room. The work around for for the first issue is to redo my whole plan which, as mentioned before, is a chore that takes away from the fun. Although my review has mostly been negative, this is not a bad game at all. In fact, I would recommend you to give it as try as this review is soley based on my own critique. You may overlook these minor flaws and thoroughly enjoy this game. But for me, these minor issues were little details that became a major hassle as I played on.			"

												Good game, but there is one MAJOR flaw that's annoying me to make me give it a negative review: Sometime when you quit a misson during campaign, for example when you double press ESC, then instead of quiting the game, you're actually starting the campaign from the beginning(not in iron man mod). Something is very wrong with the game interference. This issur ruined my hours of gameplay and mood for playing it again.			"

												The game is quite fun, and there are some elements I'm excited about that are hard to find in other games. However, there are some serious flaws that made me not want to recommend this game.The biggest reason is the nonsense ""progression system"", squad leveling and classes. It simply doesn't make that you only start with pistols, but later, once you have ""progressed"", you can replay the missions with more and usually *better* equipment! It just makes the game easier and more boring faster. The classes determine what equipment can be used, and it's pretty arbitrary. For example,the point man class can only use pistols. That is, no SMGs(!) It seems the reason is because the pointman has to be fast. But come on, not even a small SMG? And the speed brings me to another point:Your 'troopers' walk at different speeds depending on their class and loadout. This makes sense, but it causes trouble; if you want to keep some formation while moving you will often find some of your troopers either running ahead of the others or lagging behind. According to the loading screen tips your troopers can shoot over each other's heads when in tight formation, but there's no way to know if you've achieved that. The speed difference / lack of proper formation also messes up timing.Synchronizing actions is a real hassle. You get four (4) 'go codes' which can be used for synchronizing actions. This is not enough! For example, if you want to stack up at a corner, throw a flashbang around it and then have your stack move out you will have to use two go codes: One for stacking up before your pointman throws the flashbang, and another to keep the rest of your stack moving out before the flashbang has been deployed.The planning editor is quite horrible. It's easy to make mistakes, and making changes is difficult or even impossible forcing you to delete potentially large parts of your plan.Lastly, I *really* hate when your troopers say ""no tangos"". It's too easy to misinterpret as ""tangos""!! It's quite minor, but it's been driving me crazy.			"

At that point I was sceptical of it and I wasn't sure if it's really going to make it out of alpha and to the full product. Now it's on steam and it's even better than I expected with the addition of custom loudouts, full mod support, randomly generated missions etc.It's great and well worth the price. Only thing that it lacks is a borderless fullscreen.			"

One thing I can same about Killhouse is that they work thier butts off to deliver on promises and content and are contstanly engaging the players and impleementing ideas. I know the price tag may seem a little higher than what you would be willing to spend on a title like this.

												Let me start this off by saying I only gave a thumbs up judging strictly as a game, at it's current price I would give a thumbs down.I wish the had a middle option when recommending. It is good enough to not get a thumbs down, but it is not quiet what I expected. It's pretty fun and I will put more time into it when i'm bored, but so far in just an hour and half i'm ready to get back on frozen synapse instead. I find the controls very awkward in comparison to frozen synapse and breach & clear. It's definitely a more casual game compared to those others. The squad customization is very nice and there is a lot of maps / scenarios to choose from. This is a game that I would say is worth it all depending on the price. If I were to have paid 20$ then I would be extremely dissapointed, ended up only spending 4$ b/c I bought cards for super cheap to convert to gems. I don't think this game is really worth more than 10-12$ in comparison to other games in the genre, but those other games are more hardcore type and this has a more arcade / laid back feel.One of the most frustrating things is that when you set multiple waypoints there is no key to delete the last WP and you can't hightlite it then hit delete key. The only way to delete every single WP is to click on then then right click and select delete. Maybe not a big issue for some of you, but go play frozen synapse and then try to not have that feature. There are no straight lines in this game when making your WP, you simply drag the mouse the entire length then go back and adjust how you want to aim a long the path. This of course ends up with somewhat wavy lines across the path which again is not a big thing unless you are use to better games which use straight lines that auto adjust more WPs when you hit a wall. To me it's a little annoying to have to hit A, B, C or D in order to pause a unit at said spot, but i'm also use to frozen synapse giving you a timer so you can have a unit go, turn, kneel, wait 2 seconds, stand up, turn around, go forward, wait .4 seconds, turn right, turn left, run forward, run past avoiding enemy and then target them from around cover all in one simple command.This does have an option a lot of people will like which is being able to play it without really pausing it at all just drag the units quickly adjust them and switch units very fast. I personally don't like that, I prefer more tactical pausing with extreme level of detail, but it is a good feature allowing you to play multiple ways. I'm sure as I casually spend some bored time with this game that I will eventually get these controls down very well and enjoy it a bit more, but for right now it just feels clunky and awkward. It gets a bit tricky to see whos path is whos when you have more than 2 people. This game could be great for you, it all just depends on what exactly your looking for. If you are really into the very detailed, highly precise tactical turn based games then you might be dissapointed. I would spend 5$ more and buy frozen synapse if you have neither of the 2 games.

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is a really good game which I recommend to all of my friends, but also to all the internert strangers. At first it is daunting to get all the basics down, but once you have those and know how to work your team, it is an absolute beaut of a game. It always feels great when I manage to clear out a level full of hostiles quickly and quietly, managing to save all the hostages from execution. It is a simple game to use, but it is also challenging at the same time, as it is no easy achievement to gain all three stars on all the levels. If you don't get it until now - BUY THIS GAME! :)			"

												Excellent game plagued by a single awful problem: in the campaigns (not the single missions), if you lose a trooper and don't restart the mission, he's permanently dead. This is exacerbated by the game sometimes not recognizing your request to restart a mission... so you decided to try out a bold strategy on a campaign mission? Too bad, your best troopers are now gone forever. I've actually uninstalled until they fix this as it's just wantonly stupid. Still recommended, but don't touch the campaigns unless you're okay with a whole new roster of rookies.			"

												This is an absolutely fantastic rts with loads of content. The mechanics are simple to learn and the movement is pretty smooth. There are tons of missions and you can browse the steam workshop  for even more levels. It also comes with an easy to use level editor that is fun to play around with. One complaint I have is the campaign's lack of story. It does seem like its just a bunch of random levels, rather than a story weaving them together. Otherwise, its a fantastic and entertaining game that is worth a try.			"

												I've played less than an hour of this game and I'm already extremely impressed with it. I saw that it was on sale during the Summer Sale and that it was cheap, so I bought it on an impusle. I can already say it was a steal. The game seems very realistic, and it is unforgiving in a good way. It forces you to plan every detail meticulously, and if one thing goes wrong, everything can go wrong. An incredible strategy game, would buy it again for full price.			"

												Let me start this off by saying I only gave a thumbs up judging strictly as a game, at it's current price I would give a thumbs down.I wish the had a middle option when recommending. It is good enough to not get a thumbs down, but it is not quiet what I expected. It's pretty fun and I will put more time into it when i'm bored, but so far in just an hour and half i'm ready to get back on frozen synapse instead. I find the controls very awkward in comparison to frozen synapse and breach & clear. It's definitely a more casual game compared to those others. The squad customization is very nice and there is a lot of maps / scenarios to choose from. This is a game that I would say is worth it all depending on the price. If I were to have paid 20$ then I would be extremely dissapointed, ended up only spending 4$ b/c I bought cards for super cheap to convert to gems. I don't think this game is really worth more than 10-12$ in comparison to other games in the genre, but those other games are more hardcore type and this has a more arcade / laid back feel.One of the most frustrating things is that when you set multiple waypoints there is no key to delete the last WP and you can't hightlite it then hit delete key. The only way to delete every single WP is to click on then then right click and select delete. Maybe not a big issue for some of you, but go play frozen synapse and then try to not have that feature. There are no straight lines in this game when making your WP, you simply drag the mouse the entire length then go back and adjust how you want to aim a long the path. This of course ends up with somewhat wavy lines across the path which again is not a big thing unless you are use to better games which use straight lines that auto adjust more WPs when you hit a wall. To me it's a little annoying to have to hit A, B, C or D in order to pause a unit at said spot, but i'm also use to frozen synapse giving you a timer so you can have a unit go, turn, kneel, wait 2 seconds, stand up, turn around, go forward, wait .4 seconds, turn right, turn left, run forward, run past avoiding enemy and then target them from around cover all in one simple command.This does have an option a lot of people will like which is being able to play it without really pausing it at all just drag the units quickly adjust them and switch units very fast. I personally don't like that, I prefer more tactical pausing with extreme level of detail, but it is a good feature allowing you to play multiple ways. I'm sure as I casually spend some bored time with this game that I will eventually get these controls down very well and enjoy it a bit more, but for right now it just feels clunky and awkward. It gets a bit tricky to see whos path is whos when you have more than 2 people. This game could be great for you, it all just depends on what exactly your looking for. If you are really into the very detailed, highly precise tactical turn based games then you might be dissapointed. I would spend 5$ more and buy frozen synapse if you have neither of the 2 games.

												In most respects this is a fun, thoughtfully executed game but it is rendered almost unplayable because of the lack of an ""undo"" option. This lack, combined with the fact that it is very easy to accidentally delete the convoluted plans required to avoid pausing during levels, makes the planning phase of the game all too often an exercise in frustration. Until some kind of undo functionality is added into the game, I would not recommend it unless you want to play the levels in small chunks, pausing to issue orders every few seconds (thus removing most of the interest and challenge).

Early Access Review
								A very promising early access game. You control a swat team from a top down perspective, and command them. It plays like an rts but with a pause mechanic, so you can pause the game whenever you want, and take a look at your situation and issue commands. The game really feels complete already, it feels polished and is full of content. If you run out of vanilla content, it has steam workshop as well. Definitely worth the small asking price of $15. If you like forming a complex plan, and then watching it all play out, this is the game for you.			"

												In most respects this is a fun, thoughtfully executed game but it is rendered almost unplayable because of the lack of an ""undo"" option. This lack, combined with the fact that it is very easy to accidentally delete the convoluted plans required to avoid pausing during levels, makes the planning phase of the game all too often an exercise in frustration. Until some kind of undo functionality is added into the game, I would not recommend it unless you want to play the levels in small chunks, pausing to issue orders every few seconds (thus removing most of the interest and challenge).

												This is honestly one of the most satisfying games I've played, and I honestly feel bad for not having more hours on it in comparison to my thousands on other games. (My problem is that I don't play single player games too extensively at all really...) THIS GAME, is amazing if you like tactical and rewarding engagements that YOU decide who wins not by reflexes, not by superior weaponry most of the time either but by playing, rather out-playing your contestants and manuevering to victory. Yes, this is a ""Police"" game but that's really only in the sense that you save hostages and stuff so most of it is really comparable to military operations in urban terrain which is some of the MOST demanding, tactically speaking, kind of operations. ANGLES are either your friend or your enemy depending on how you work them, teamwork among your units is imperative, and rewarding is it ever when you do a whole mission without losing a teammember or not getting shot due to methodical and tactical commanding on your part it's amazing!! This game is almost comparable to Counter Strike in the tactical sense of needing to use your equipment to gain an advantage over the naturally-advantageous defenders and then capitalize on gains you make into their whatever it may be at the given mission. In other words, this is the only game I've BOTHERED writing a review for so far so you KNOW it's seriously amazing given that right??!!			"

												I bought this thinking it would be similar to Frozen Synapse, but more recent version and a different flavour - police instead of highly abstract. It is similar but not as fun and much more frustrating.The main limitations I found which ruined the game for me were:1) It's very easy to accidentally mis-click and delete your entire plan - with no undo button... To Bad(TM)2) No way to add waypoints in the middle of paths - other than to redo everything3) No way to undo 'look this way' command other than lots of nodes (which isn't really a problem, except...)4) Nodes cannot be moved.I didn't play much because I kept accidentally deleting my plans. But, I did like the door breach methods and the RPG elements (buying weapons, levelling up guys). Never got round to the Campaign, because it's locked behind a level wall - can't play until level 6.I really wanted to like the game, but the utter frustration!!!			"

												The game gets repetitive really quickly. It felt like I was just shoving my team members straight into a meat grinder the entire time and I found it nearly impossible to complete any of the campaigns. There are some serious balancing issues, the game seems to feel and react as if the player is supposed to be a master tactician; every mission feels like you need to play through it until you're sick of it, and then some. I memorized several of the single mission maps just in order to beat them and properly plan everything out. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone that's not a fan of extreme foreplanning and painstaking grinds.			"

												It could be a great wtih a real planning system and AI.The planning is too arcade and confusionary for a real complex strategy; if it were like the first ""Rainbow Six"" series, it would be a 10/10. It's so lame that even the old ""Commandos"" is ten time better than this crappy thing.Also, more important, AI is very dumb. For example, entry men shoots straight to the tangos even with a hostage in between, killing him and making the mission fail stupidly. Or the same mission will end in a success or a fail depending on the mood of your troops: sometimes they see the enemy and shoot at it, other times they are blind and wait silently to be killed.Different weapons have controversial effects: the entry men kills better with a mp5 than a M4, even at long range. The stopping power and the balistics is not even taken in consideration.Enemies are in number of 20, you're in mission in 4, while in real entries attacking troops would be at least the same.I can never imagine how the community can write mostly positive reviews, seriously, you have real issues with tactical games: you accept all the crap that comes to the market only because is happy coloured and runs on iPad.Paid € 2,58 with a coupon, don't spend more on this♥♥♥♥♥♥Uninstalled after 5 hours of game.

												Decent game, but definitely not very tactically deep, and certainly not very fun gameplay-wise. The gameplay itself boils down to mastering a room clearing technique, and once you figure this out, the game becomes very simple. Not much variety in the inventory, and frankly, once you unlock the Assault class, you have everything you need to beat the game outright. The RPG elements that are introduced are very shallow and don't really differentiate your squad members. The various roles in the squad are pretty superfluous, and at later stages, Assault is the only really valuable role you can take. Cover system is very mediocre, with your troops more or less being a gun that you point with your mouse. No dynamic AI, no functional cover shooting. What you have is a game that consists of everything that made the old Rainbow Six games good, but without the same polish that made them fun. Fun diversion for a few hours, but not an 8/10 game.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but is horrible, there is no good tutorial to learn the basic mechanics, there are no commands for your troops to advance without shooting, and waipoint to move your troops get stuck all the time with walls or objects. Don't buy it, it's really not worth it, you are going to play four missions and get frustrated by the control system. Besides, the ""campaign"" has no story, its just some missions pulled together. Fuu, waste of money.			"

												This is a good'un.Well designed, pacey, and with good artwork.Features an extensive set of unlocks, as well as soldier advancement.It's a puzzle game at heart, but don't let that put you off. This game is challenging and addictive.3 campaigns and tons of single mission make this game well worth the 20 bucks.			"

												Notice how most of the top reviews have under ten hours play time? Yeah. The game wears thin very quickly. Also, the enemies have random spawning on every map. This may sound fine at first, but it's annoying because someimes you do have the perfect plan but RNG desides to screw you. And many times your squad doesn't fire back at enemies and they just stand there to get shot at. It's a very shallow game despite what the tag lines say.			"

												Despite being a pretty simple game, Door Kickers is extremely well implemented. The gameplay is smooth, challenging and quite exciting once you get going.The system it uses for upgrades is initially a bit frustrating, requiring a bit of grinding to get enough stars to buy decent equipment but once you get past the first hour of gameplay you'll have most of the end-game items you'd want.For once, the single-mission content is larger than the structured story-line missions to the point where I still haven't managed to finish them all yet. The challenges are a bit on the simplistic side though, I'd like to see a wider variety of bonus challenges (like finishing a map using a specific type of trooper, or without firing a shot) but it's hard to complain with something like 100 levels to master.Definitely worth a purchase, and certainly not unfinished content.

												This game is amazing. It's simple, fun, and easy to understand. Sometimes it gets hard but you can always start over. It's easy as in it throws you in there with no tutorial. LOL GOOD LUCK. It's fun to figure it out. The music is nice, the graphics are amazingly well done, and the animation is on point. Lots of tools for people who are really into strategy and also for people like me, lots of tools you can ignore and get the job done, just a bit less efficiently. (Try losing half your team, oops.) There is a lot of content, many missions and maps to play. Overall this game is well worth the 20 bucks. 8/10 P.S. Avast doesn't want anyone to have fun. There is an issue with this game and compatibility with Avast. I contacted their support and got a brief response. ""Hi, It seems AVAST recently started deleting .dll files from our game (even though they're from the known open-source ffmpeg project).You need to pause AVAST, check the game's Steam cache (which will re-download those .dlls) and start the game.If you try running the game with AVAST turned on, it will delete them again, so you need to keep it paused. Unfortunately we don't have a proper solution yet, since it's out of our control, but we're working on it."" Damn you Avast and your anti-Doorkickers campaign. I'll get ALL the viruses just to play this game.			"

												The lack of a meaningful tutorial and the obnoxious main menu background don't inspire tackling the enormous learning curve. As someone who is not a fan of this genre, having picked up this game in a bundle, there was nothing that made me want to trudge through the rest of it. Yeah, the unlocks system is cool, but the controls just feel so derpy. What type of universe is this game set in where people have what, a fifty degree field of view? Pass.			"

												Click and drag your swat operators trough intense operations. This is one game wich i got addicted to really fast. The controls are very simple (left and right click on a mouse) but the strategie beneath is immense. Prepare your missions with waypoints ''a la rainbow six'' and watch it unfold or play live and act in the moment or just do both. So many ways of playing, infinite levels, steam workshop, seriously best game i ever bought.			"

Jump back in and kick that door. Very satisfying when you kick doors perfectly.  Could do with more officer customisation and visuals. Get some sound mods, extra maps and go kick those doors.			"

Early Access Review
								Absolutely the best top down strategy game out there, the animations are super smooth and the equipment and weapons to use is so expansive its unbelievable. You can literally play this differently every time thanks to the mission generator so i'll be putting a lot more hours into this game. Definitely Indie game of the year 10/10.			"

												For those of you who enjoyed the planning phase in the original Rainbow 6 games. This is a full game made out of that with a few extra features.For those of you who didn't, its a realtime tactial strategy game, played from a top down perspective where you deal with different situations by commanding your team to breach and clear rooms. kill tangos, and attempt to complete a variety of diffenet objectives and challenges.As you level up you unlock more abilities that improve your team as well as new weapons and equipment. Its very good and I highly recommend it. You can even install a mod that tha changes the sounds effects and music to that of the orginal Rainbow 6 Rogue spear. Sold! "

												I wish there was a way to give a game something in between a thumbs up and a thumbs down. Unfortunately, if I have to choose one, I have to give this game a thumbs down.It's not a bad game. It's just that I've played it before. But the last time I played it it was called Frozen Synapse. And that's the main issue. This game brings nothing at all new or improved to the table. If you've played X-Com or Frozen Synapse or any number of similar games, then you've already played this game.The concept itself is unfortuantely pretty thin. I mean, there's only so many ways you can blow away bad guys in different apartments. It gets repetetive fast, especially if you've already played similar games.			"

												Great real-time-with-pause tactical game. You have a squad of swat operatives and take missions with them to kill baddies, rescue hostages, defuse the bomb. Each mission starts with planning mode, where you can choose weapons and gear for your guys and plan movement and actions for completing objectives. Then you hit big red button and watch. You can pause and change plan any time, and even can play in real time, but this is latter is less effective. After mission you earn stars based on performance which you can use to buy upgrades like new weapons and gear.Highly recommended if you like squad-based tactical games.			"

												This game screams out to fans of Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, and Metal Gear Solid. The planning options in this game are expansive, and offer players an outstanding amount of ways to complete a mission. There is no ""best way"" to finish a mission on this game. Assault classes have the armor to withstand bullets head-on, while stealth units are quick enough to clear rooms of enemies without alerting the rest of the area. This game offers so much in the area of replayability, by allowing users to pick different ways to breach, kill, or arrest.I couldn't recommend this game more if I wanted to, it's just an awesome game that definitely needs a buy if you're a fan of any kind of tactical, stealth simulator.

												You have to pick locked doors before kicking them open, i.e. breaking them to pieces. Oh, and get lost with that crappy dubstep soundtrack.Moreover, have fun elaborating plans for a perfect rating - with RNG.I like the logic of the rating system.""Oh, the mission took you 30 seconds instead of 20? Bad luck, two stars for you.""Next try:""Sir, expendable trooper #2 got badly injured! I don't know if he can ever wield a gun again!""""That doesn't matter, you did it in 19 seconds this time! Perfect, three stars for you!""As much as I like challenges, they somehow have to fit into a game. These ones just break the immersion.Furthermore, the game doesn't really explain anything. The tutorial consists of eight video clips and it only covers the gameplay basics which are basically ""Spacebar to pause, left click to walk and right click for actions.""What about important stuff such as troop management, the ranking system, classes and doctrines? Nah, the complicated stuff you have to figure out yourself.The controls are extremely weird. Without strafing you don't have any chance at all, but sometimes your troopers suddenly stop strafing or they keep strafing when you don't want them to.I guess with a bit of training you get used to them and the game becomes more fun.However, this game threw so much♥♥♥♥♥♥at me in the first hour that I'm not motivated to play any further. I'm just gonna stick to the old Rainbow Six games.			"

												The general gameplay is nice. If you liked the old Rainbow Six games, where you could plan the mission and then lean back and watch the computer execute it, you're gonna like this game too. Its an easy time killer.However I expierience a lot of bugs, eg: sometimes the plan does not get saved when you fail a mission so hours of planning are gone. Sometimes go codes dont apply anymore. Worst case you have to plan a players path from scratch. Sometimes it is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to select the right player to give him commands. Those kinda things really do mess with the gaming expierence. Also when you want player a and b to push at the same time, but you want just player a to throw a flashbang, player b wont wait for the flashbang, but runs in immediately once the go code was given. thats plenty stupid...Although the game per se is nice for the money, I dont recommend it, until those problems get fixed. Or maybe wait for Door Kickers No. 2			"

												It's a really good tactics game. Pros - Tons of levels.- Tons of armour.- Tons of weapons.- Tons of utilities and support gear.- Voiced characters.- Alternate appearances for characters.- Workshop support.- Level creator.- XP which leads to upgrades.- Allows mission replays so you can see where you went wrong if you died. Cons- Female officers will speak like men. - Can be very difficult during some missions.- Caps aren't available when customizing callsigns OR names.- Steep price tag if it isn't on offer.- REALLY, REALLY fiddly to give your officers directions. 4/5 times you try to flash bang a door, then go through, the UI will just reset and make you redo your plan again. - Some missions are damn near impossible to complete. Fire gun. Oops they heard, hostage is dead. :^) Fire taser. Oops they heard, hostage is dead. :^) Try and stealth it, shoot the bloke who's closest to the ONLY hostage. Oops you failed it.			"

												I bought the game on summer sale for a very low price.  Despite this, I'm just under 2 hours and am submitting for refund.At first I thought was a decent pass of time.  But when I got down to actually doing the gold star objectives, I found it incredibly frustrating for a few reasons:-Very often i'll move from point to point with enemies in plain sight and not fire at them-Very often I'll be firing at an enemy but for some reason will disengage and move on to next point regardless of the fact that the not killed enemy is still firing at me-Cannot set rotation points at key spots (like, doors/breaching), which makes the ""Live Play"" or ""Finish in a single set of waypoints"" objectives near impossible without just random dumb luck of the positioning of the enemies upon entering a roomThe randomness of behavior of the enemies is actually a fun point and makes the replays decent, but when your own character seems to be doing things completely counter-intuitive to your purpose (kill enemies in plain sight), it's frustrating and even for the price ($3) I find I've gotten bored of the game quickly in 2 attemps to sit and play it now and I'd rather this money go toward another game.

												This game should be awessome. It's both about action and tactics. Unfortunately it's totally overrun with gamebreaking bugs that makes it almost impossible to play. The biggest irony is that it's called ""doorkickers"" since the doorkicking mechanism contains one of the most severe issues in the entire game: You cannot place yourself in the doorway. By dooing that the dooropening UI hides the UI that allows you to turn in a direction, throw grenades or shoot until there is no threat. Also, backing to the menu does not pause the game, so if there is a tiny flaw in your plan, you want to restart the mission, your entire plan might get eraised. Another thing that drives me crazy is that it impossible to do small changes to your plan. Adjusting it early removes everything after that. So all in all. This game have potential to be extremely good, unfortunately the developers decided to not employ a single tester. It really shows.  "

												Although I was really looking forward to playing this title, I was very disappointed about the gameplay. The tactical side is unplayable in my opinion. XCOM and Breach & Clear are far better titles in that respect. The turn-based tactival gameplay in those games is just superior. In this game it feels clunky, un-fair and completely random. You cannot choose which way your soldiers look, you cannot get them to look around corners and stay in cover that way, the planning is awfull and that just turned me off.I do like the soldier-interface and the levelling aspect of your team's capabilities and weapons, but that just doesn't make up for the clunkiness of the rest of the game.I might just be spoiled by the above mentioned games, which might make this review a bit biased, but as there are alot of positive reviews for this title, I am not very concerned about the impact this review will make.

												Has a lot of potential, but doesn't really deliver. It's a good game, but the leveling system restricting so much strangles the game and holds it short of being a great. Deployments limited to 2 people in the beginning and continue to impliment deployment restrictions in a force:resistance ratio is very restricting and is a real drag as it doesn't focus on strategy as much as bunch up and walk through together as opposed to getting stratigic assault from multiple angles requiring more consideration of strategic locationing. I'm not saying it's a bad game, I am merely stating that I wouldn't recommend it - though it is funny watching people get mad about my review.On the upside, this would be a great game for a modder.I had hoped that people would be smart enough to work it out, but clearly not, so I have edited my review.

												This game looks good, and for the first couple of hours of gameplay I enjoyed it quite a lot.Utlimately it turns out to be a poorly designed and frustrating game. First issue for me, no difficulty levels. We don't all have the same abilities playing this type of game, difficulty levels are a must for me.I just got stuck on the first evidence mission, where, as far as I can determine, it is impossible to get in the front door without alerting the goon sitting next to it. So I played a couple of individual missions to get enough stars to buy a lock pick device. Zero improvement, doesn't work at all.			"

												This game is fun, but what it desperately, DESPERATELY needs is the capability to let the player 'tab out' of the game without a complete crash.

												This game is pretty cool but is seriously held back by it's mobile-like design. It feels like a handheld game that the designers ran away with. Classes and weapons are endlessly customizable but the actual planning play has a design mechanic that makes complexity very difficult to achieve. It feels like a good step but so many half-baked features that reek of ios design. It's just not rewarding toplay for me			"

												Amazing game, well worthy of all the praise it gets.The developers are constantly updating, tweaking and adding to the game, and I hear that there is even a multiplayer/co-op mode coming, either for free in a patch, or maybe as paid DLC. Either way, I will take it. These guys deserve every penny.One of the only truly great games to go through early access AND it actually made it to a full release AND it is still supported by the devs now.Very easy to just start playing, it's one of those games that is pretty easy to learn, but difficult to master, especially as the maps go on and get bigger and the enemy get smarter and much much tougher.Workshop support is nice, and there are some truly stunning mods out there, such as the highly rated sound mod that adds almost 100% realistic weapon sounds to every gun in the game, or the many many weapon packs out there that add great weapons from P-90 SMG's to the aliens pulse rifle (ridiculously overpowered, but still good fun).The progression system works nicely, the skill tree is good (although a little small), adding some nice ""abilities"" to your troopers, such as knowing how to use cover better, better aim with pistols or whatever, using double-tap to make sure enemy are put down quickly. All work nicely to bring your officers in line with the rising difficulty as you get to the tougher maps later on.I seriously can't recommend this game enough. Whether you want to plan as you go, pausing every few seconds, or you want to just go it in real time, dragging the path for your troopers and watching them follow as you go, or you (like me) want to plan everything from the beginning, hit the go button and watch your troopers die quickly :) The game allows any one of these methods, or a mix of all at once, planning a mission from start, then pausing and starting a new plan in the middle (because things start to go sideways), and then just keeping it going in real time, moving your troopers around the map to pick off any stragglers and/or moving any hostages to safety that you couldn't see whilst you were originally planning the assault.The game is great, does exactly what it says on the tin, and does it pretty much perfectly in every way.Worth every penny, and the devs definitely deserve their cash, 100%			"

												The game seemingly has lots of potential... but I can't quite place my finger on why I don't like it. The progression system is interesting I guess, but the actual gameplay is clunky. For as complex/time restricted as some of the stages are, the game really needs to have better AI. I get that it is a strategy game, but your AI end up doing boneheaded things or reacting in dumb ways to new threats. And line of sight down some hallways and at some angles will destroy your team without them having the opportunity to fire back.			"

Right now Doorkickers simply looks promising, and is a few steps away from being amazing.1. No enemy AI. I know the enemies will spawn in different places, helping levels' replayability, but enemy AI would help this out even more.2. Simpler controls. They are already pretty simple for such a deep game, but it would help if there were a better tutorial, to help us know what the ""go codes"" mean, and how to use them etc...3. More content.

												A solid, fun little game, that suffers from a lack of polish and explanation. Gameplay mechanics are good, and the controls are very simple. They can be picked up very quickly without any kind of tutorial. This is fortunate, since the game does little to explain itself other than a few hints on the controls in the opening missions, and a ""How To"" that says the same information. Unfortunately, any further explanations of game mechanics, controls, or progression are completely missing. For what is a relatively simple game, this shouldn't have been an issue. However, after having to constantly minimize the game to try and search for answers to simple gameplay mechanics, it become frustrating for something that should otherwise be a quick game to play.Although this game doesn't do anything revolutionary, it is solid. If it had more polish, I would most likely recommend it, but there are too many small problems to justify what should be an easy-to-play game.Thanks for reading.			"

												This is not a fun game I played for an hour and a half and it felt like the same thing over and over again and it didn't really throw in very much diversity and even the different objectives felt the same, KILL THE BAD GUYS, and thats it. There is no satisfaction in completing the levels and leveling up to a level where you actually have decent weapons takes forever. Once again I've played for an hour and a half and I'm barley a high enough to unlock the first real class, the assulter and it frankley sucks. So please don't make the same mistake I made in buying this atrocious game.			"

I just hope the dev will add more gear,more costumization,AI for team and the terrorist,and more dynamic spawn for terrorist when you replay a level.			"

								I'll make this quick: First of all, as you can see in my final rating, this game is great and shows high potential!I'm saying this because, as of now, the different weapons, equipment or gear in general doesn't seem to make such a big difference on the outcome of a mission. Quite frankly, I didn't even notice that you can customize your squad (except for whom to deploy in a mission) until about the middle of the game! I'd wish to see more impact on the missions based on my setup, etc.Other than that: Bravo ;)			"

								As a huge fan of the SWAT games I've had my eye on this for some time. After checking out some of the early access reviews I decided to dip my toes in and see what this game had to offer so far - so far, I'm not disappointed. There's a great amount of satisification to watching your carefully planned moves play out and learning from the ones that end in disaster. At this stage, the different classes of character don't seem to come into play but I look forward to sending a stealth team in and perhaps even non-lethal options at a later stage.			"

												This game is awesome. It has it's flaws though, mostly when you lose a fully armored trooper to a mac-10 for sure. The response time on some of the troops could be better for sure though. Otherwise i enjoy this game its fun to see, once you've completed a level, where the enemies were and try to do it with less troopers or with different kinds of troopers. It keeps it original. Also a lot of the levels the game provides are not ""set"" per say, they have random spawn locations and spawn amounts on some of them where the enemy may be around the corner on one run and another there's two or they're not there at all. Also the gun mods on the community make playing extra random generated levels that much better, as it challenges you to unlock those guns first, then try them out in a new map and see their performance.10/10 great buy			"

								Graphics is good, no bugs that I can see. The only gripe I have is that there is no tutorials beyond the basic 3 slides in the game. I know the devt mentioned that there is no point doing a tutorial at this stage, but it does make the game rather steep to learn.But there is nothing more satisfying than to see your planned mission go off smoothly once you figured out the basics.I do wish that the characters would not moving into the room before the flashbang go off though...And the stopping the hostage execution scenarios are hair-pulling exercises.Better than Frozen Synapse in that the graphics are more engaging, and keeps me interested during the mission, and the pause-anytime-to-plan feature is fantastic.Looking forward to more improvements by the devts!

								This is buy far the BEST tactical simulators I have played since 1998 with the release of the first rainbow six. Every aspect of the game is, fluid and smoth. Delivering a marvelous feeling of being right there on the ground when the first door charge goes off, all this despite it being a 2D top down view.When I play it in genarall goes like this.1. Get the lay of the land, (Evaluate points of entry, danger zones, decide distrubation of the squad)2. How to go about it, (Plan paths of moment, cover zones, assert pace requierd to meet the time limits)3. Taking a closer look, (Get eyes inside of target building or area, reasses previous planing on the new info)4. Kicking down the door, (Executing previous planing)Step 1-3 takes between 1-5 minutes unless im picky and decides to plan it all down to the tinyest detail,Step 4 goes in about 10 seconds up to a minute. 5. Improvising in 9/10 times the planing can't cover every base so I generaly have to cut in half way or in the first 3 seconds of the execution and re plan from there whit what I have to work with.It is wonderfull to get a perfect run whitout hicups in the plan but its just as thrilling to be able to salvage a ""crashed and burned"" plan to still be able to execute the rest.There is a lot of games out there that is worth playing only once, Door kickers is NOT among those titles.You can play it over and over and OVER again, succeding and learning failing and learning. Every time it is a brand new game. If you are a fan of tacsim like me you will get hooked.Score 10/10			"

												Sure, a good defense is a good offense, but Coach, are we the Xs or are we the Os?This is the finest pause-and-plan-as-you-go real-time strategy playpen since Fallout Tactics--equal parts Rainbow Six, Hotline Miami, and Faster Than Light. You can obsessively map out elaborate crackdowns in drug dens and beachside cartel parties at mission start and watch them crackle, bang, and fail hilariously like some kind of funky Sea Monkey tank full of hypermurder in the name of justice or plain old police-state brutality. Its meticulous design and indelible difficulty make for a satisfying and addictive top-down puzzle-shooter, even if a few suriving strategy-imploding bugs add an element of chaos that render it better resembling that pachinko ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

												This is one of the best turn based strategy planning games I have played in a long while. While Frozen Synapse is excellent, and Breach and Clear is brilliant, they're not as much fun (FS), or quite as polished (B&C) as this.This is so much fun. I haven't been able to put it down for a while, and that's saying something, as I just bought The Witcher 3.There is no story, but for what this game is, the strategy element is so clever, and fun. It just keeps getting better and better, with more and more options; and a fantastic skill tree that makes a real difference to the gameplay.For me, this is a 9/10.			"

This game forces you to try new strategys in order to become better and faster to complete even tougher street battles and CQB kill houses. P.S: I even made the legendary two soldiers.

												TL;DR6.5/10Don’t go out of your way to recommend it, but if you find the chance, then go for itI first saw this game while searching through the deep dark slums of the farthest-back pages of Steam, and was not immediately encouraged to get Door Kickers. It just looked like a bare-bones, top-down shooter with some mediocre ‘tactical’ elements tossed in. I let it be for a while and then came back to it a couple of months later, then decided “what the heck, I’ll buy it”. I had a total blast for the first week, just playing my way through various missions and unlocking various weapons and armor, but after that, I found myself getting really bored. That is, until I discovered the workshop, and let me tell you; that is what makes this game so great.Gameplay wise, Door Kickers really stands out. None of your soldiers are too overpowered (unless you download god armor from the workshop), so you need to use every last drop of tactical knowledge to keep them alive. Nothing is more frustrating then spending twenty minutes working out a plan and then having all of your troops mowed down by some guy with a machine gun hiding behind a bulletproof couch the instance they kick down the first door. To actually complete a mission you need to buckle down and focus, or you are going to end up with only one guy, cowering in the corner, waiting for someone to come and yell a stereotypical phrase at them then blow your final guy’s head off.All in all, Door Kickers won’t blow you away, but if you like tactical games, then you’ll have some fun with it. If you don’t like those games, then this is probably not the game for you. The graphics aren’t great, but the workshop makes up for that by having new stuff constantly made every day for you to try out. So give it a try if you feel like it, but if you don’t like this type of game, then don’t waste your money on it.6.5/10Don’t go out of your way to recommend it to a friend, but if you find the chance, then go for itBuy it full price if you have the money on hand, but otherwise buy it on sale.~Mfilms2000You can find more of our reviews on our curator page here:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/technosharkreviews "

Every door is a problem to be solved - kick it in? place guys on both sides and open it? breach it? toss flashbangs through? try to go in quiet with silencers? jump in with quick reacting pistol wielders? cautiously have the guy with the shield lead the way? jump in with assault rifles and try to overwhelm with sheer force? Switch out the guns to maximize fire rate or accuracy or stopping power? How many people to assign to the door? Do you leave yourself open to being flanked if you stack people on a door? This game is exactly what I want out of tactical strategy.			"

												You wanna be a hero? Be a hero for a couple seconds and die! You wanna be tactical? Flashbang and then die. You wanna teamwork? Flashbang, have the shields go first, then send in the assault team, unless is CQC, then send in the breachers, maybe a few more flashbangs, bum rush to the hostages if they're about to be killed with the shields in front of you, as the assault/breachers cover your back, and this time have the breachers shoot down the door, as the assault team (or person if you have a 4 guy squad with 2 shields, a assaulter and a breacher) to take down the enemy. Next (again with the shields in front) find a hallway, and put the shields in front of you, having them slowly advance as you check from door to door. Then, if you don't wanna play the full mission, find a hostage and run for your life! (with the shields behind you). You wanna be a traitor? Well...This is how I would best describe this game. As IGN would put it: ""Tactical games at its best.""As I would put it, ""WHO CARES! FLASHBANG THE CRAP OUTTA THE GUYS AND BUMRUSH THEM! Wait... those are the guys reading my review...?""			"

Ace Patrol did manage to pull that off, but RTS is always more fun in my opinion.  The brutal realism, and not to mention the various blood settings are very well done.

												I can't over state how awesome this game is!For anyone that's ever had an interest in smooth SWAT or Special Forces operations, this game will delight you.The range of customization is awesome, and even though the planning itself could be improved, you can easily compensate for it.The thrill of pulling off a well planned mission is incredible, and certainly trumps any expectations I might have had.This game is worth it's asking price, but it's a steal when it's on sale. GET IT.Ps.(Multiplayer IS coming!)			"

												An awesome CQB game that's worth getting considering it's price. But before judging this game if your into CQB types, remember to see all aspects of the game and learn all controls. This game is unique compared to other games it's competing against. Doorkickers offers many features that seem more modern and up to date in gaming.Love this game. It doesn't end with repetitive missions and is really neat for using your CQB protocols and tactics.			"

												Hmm... what should I say?Most of what i want to say are already covered in other ppl's reviews, so do I really need to do another review for this game?well yes and no.""no"" because most of what i want to say have already been covered.""yes"" because i feel like this game deserves more attention.If you're a fan of tactics, this game is a must-have in my opinion.It is very tactical and feature-rich, and a well-planned assault is simply a beauty to watch.combine that with mod support, and built-in mission editor, mission generator, and map sharing, you can have endless hours of tactical fun with this game.

												Door kicker is an awesome and addict game. I higly recommend it to everyone. The game is well balanced, easy to play, and very nicely done.There are things however that could be improved. The characters may ""improve"" in the game but it actually has not much impact. The same applies to weapons, there are lots of weapons which have almost the same statistics, so they don't make much difference. It would be nice to be able to add more customization to weapons, like lamp, laser dot, etc.  So, overall, a great-great game, and i hope there will be a Door Kickers 2 with more improvements.			"

												Excellent, excellent game- the kind of game where you have been playing it and look at the clock and see ""Oh, it's bedtime... I will just play one more scenario""- and then three hours later you are like ""OMG I gotta work tomorrow!""The music fits perfectly and is awesome (I could just let it play in the background all day), scenarios are quick and replayable.  I have only just begun the content and I feel like I can't get enough of it!  The graphics style and point of view is refreshing.If you don't like a lot of blood I guess that might be a negative point, but I highly recommend this game if you like planning and strategy type games with customization options for your squad members, skill trees, equipment changes... none of these look too overblown but there is just a light enough touch of them to keep it interesting.Waited for this to be on sale but in retrospect, would have paid full price.

												Overall: DecentLikes:- A lot of content- Has procedurally-generated levels- Supports player-created contentDislikes:- Planning out your strategy takes quite a bit of time, even for relatively simple levels.  It's fun but it is also tiresome.- Controlling your characters in real time feels laggy because they move slower than your mouse, and inputs get queued.- I wish you could undo changes to your plan, and save your plans for later use.  I also wish you could edit a section of your route without erasing the subsequent path.- In campaign mode, once you leave a mission, your current state (health, deaths) is saved and you can't retry it from the original state you were in when you first played that mission.  Not a huge deal though.			"

Product received for free
												Broke my game with mods, sent a very detailed email to Support, they resent me the files to fix the game while also helping me pinpoint the possible mod(s) that broke my game, fixed (and learnt how to fix the problem after an accidental peek of the .xml files). Back to kicking doors and dropping baddies. I do want to point out that some of the bad guys in body armor can take a lot more bullets than you would expect even with high powered rifle rounds that you'd normally expect to go through whatever the bad guys can afford (apparently they can afford AR500 Level 4 armor) so if you're playing without mods, do expect some heavy resistence and lots of baddies with level 4 AR500 if you're using the mission generator and you have enemy resistence setting set to heavy (w/e that one setting is called). Lots of fun, loving the game, great Support, can't wait for DK2 to come out in the near future.Edit: Tasers are fun to use.Edit #2: I can't stop tasering people. I need help.			"

Well this game is for you.  A RTWP overhead tactical shooter where you can control each member of the team individualy, . This isn't a mindless power trip shooter, you have to use tactics an planning if you want to come out alive. While most AAA industries are pumping out CoD clones, it's great to find a slower, smarter game.			"

Thank you devs for not only making an awesome modern isometric SWAT game, but for making it RIGHT. *Tons of quick missions, create your own, or just randomize (BEST feature)*Plenty of weapons to use and earn the right way- by playing.*3 campaigns that seem to offer some really cool situations.*Very precise movement and great UI to represent Field of vision and aim direction.I could go on... but I don't have to, if you like SWAT or tactical greatness in general you should just pick up this ♥♥♥♥ing game.

It reminds me a bit of the good old swat 2 but then on steroids. i can spend a good half hour planning in advance and then just watch the actual 10 seconds of gameplay that is required of the mission. Also the fact that everything keeps changing up is also an added bonus for me. no way to tell if the plan that worked last time will work again. Since the AI actually moves around in a different way everytime and the oponents seem to move as well. I can highly recomend this game. I have enjoyed every second of it so far :)			"

												This game is fresh to me. I haven't played anything quite like it. You can't do campaign mode right away, you have to play a few single missions and level up first. This is basically to get you warmed up for the campaign missions because campaign there is perma death. Your task force officers rank up too, and your level points get you better gear. Basically a mission operates in 3 phases1. Deploy mode. Select your officers and deploy them onto the mission site in a selected area. 2. Planning mode. This is where you trace out the movement and actions of each officer. There are a variaty of options on how to do this depending on rank and equipment. 3. Execution mode. This is when the mission starts and your men begin to perform your plan, you can go back to planning mode at anytime and redo the planor if you're feeling brave you can do the planning and execution simultaniously. At the end of your mission you are graded by speed, deaths, and overall performance. 3 star ranking gets you more XP which can be used for more lethal officers and tactics. Planning mode gets complcated quick, you can customize it to do so many things like switch weapons, look in certain directions, don't move again until enemies cleared, and there are even wait for order Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, or Delta so a certain officer will wait until you click the order and then continue as plan. This game is quick paced, and a great time killer. I think I will enjoy it for a long time, classic replay value. Overall I give it 8 out of 10 ♥♥♥♥ Pandas			"

Excellent attention to detail, lots of guns and gear to unlock for your squad. Steam Workshop support.For trhe money I paid in the sale, its a must buy for anyone who enjoyed early Rainbow 6 games (the ones where you planned the routes for different squads) or the SWAT games. It plays very similar to Frozen Synapse and Survivor Squad, but feels much deeper and more tactical.Exellent game!			"

												Nostalgic for the days of tactical shooters? Do you remember all the time you spent in the planning stage of rainbow six? Meticulously developing a plan to whipe out all terrorists? Well this game is for you.  A RTWP overhead tactical shooter where you can control each member of the team individualy, . This isn't a mindless power trip shooter, you have to use tactics an planning if you want to come out alive. While most AAA industries are pumping out CoD clones, it's great to find a slower, smarter game.			"

												This game really makes you think before you send your teams in. Best blend of tactics and strategy I've ever played in a game. Every mission is different and really makes you put thought into it. So many weapons, armors, and secondaries. You can breach a door with a shotgun and send a squad in with assault rifles with a sniper set outside a window to cover them going in. My favorite part of the game is how you can divvy up your movements into sequences. For instance, once you plan your teams' routes, you can divide their movements to into sections. So. you can have one team sneak in and clear an area silently and cut off an escape route and begin phase ""A"" where another team will blow their door open for a loud entrance and move in. You can then set phases B thru D for movement after things are clear, certain enemies have been eliminated, etc. It's probably the most satisfying when you're preplanned movements finish a mission without pausing it to readjust.I would suggest maybe a headswivel option for when one of your routes end. This would enable one or more units to watch all around them so they don't get snuck up on.I would also suggest a little more user-friendly map creation.Other than that, this is a must-buy game for those interested in a truly amazing tactical/strategic SWAT game.

												A true tactical game, where tactical means planning and not camping. Making sure that each member of the team knows what they are doing before hand, and executing the plan pefectly is a great feeling.With a good multiplayer, it would redefine the entire tactical genre (hopefully planning returns to other tactical-genred games).

												Unique and interesting take on the tactical shooting genre. When starting out it can be a bit frustrating learning all the controls and best ways to utilise each squad member, but after a few levels you'll start to get the hang of it. The turning point for me was taking my time, playing slower and testing out different tactics using flashbangs and the other door breaching methods.Once you get the hang of things and play a bit you'll end up unlocking more guns and classes, making you an even more lethal tactical force to be reckoned with.

												Doorkickers. The name says it all. If you like strategy (or just going on to workshop and finding the most ridiculous thing for your SWAT team to use) then this is the game for you. You kick down the door, shoot people, and that's pretty much it. You can either play it as you go or plan it out right from the start. The game is really optomized to let you time things perfectly, and things that are a little iffy you can easily fix with a couple of workshop mods. It's 50% off when I'm writing this and I think even at its full $20 price its worth a look at.			"

												Love the concept of this game. It reminds me a lot of the first Rainbow 6 game back in the late 90's but from a top down view. I played the heck out of that game back in the day. There is some great nostalgic feelings for me when I boot this one up. It's great to see the continued project like development as part of early access.

												Perfect bite-sized strategy with all the 'one shot gravitas' and faux bravado a good round of Rogue Spear would muster. Part puzzle part strategy with some pseudo RPG elements. Tons of stock levels, a random mission generator, and a strong mission editor mean lots of replay value even if you never touch the effortlessly integrated Steam Workshop for mods or community levels.It was an impulse buy based on looks and concept, and surprised me in a good way.

												I played this game and enjoyed it.If you liked the old SWAT tactical shooter, here's something you will enjoy. The good thing about this is that there's actual planning invovled - ypou don't just send your men in guns blazing, cause that way most or all of them will go back in bodybags. Here you have to plan ahead and every room you clear matters. One unexpected event will often demand of you to re-think your strategy. This is NOT a game wher eyou plan, then hit ""execute"" and forget about the whole thing. Far from what it may seem from screenshots or short videos, this is a thinking man's game.Another good part of it is that there's more replayability than meets the eye. The same scenario will vary from one playthrough to the next. You may encounter different number of foes, in diffrent places, with different behaviour, armament and patrol patterns than you seen in your last playthrough of a given scenario. There are a lot of scenarios on tp of it all.There is also an RPG-style mechanic - your SWAT agents will rise in skill after participating in missions, you will also get access to more armor types, weapon and doctrines as you complete more missions. Doctrines act much as passive bonuses in mmorpgs. This works pretty well, although it is primarily a tactical game and the rpg elements are not as deep as in complex mmos.Only two downsides I can think of are two elements from the SWAT games taht I miss here - there's no tear gas and there's little in the way of opponent morale - 99% of foes will fight to the death and not surrender.

												What can I say? I was in love with the first Rainbow Six games, where we had tactics mixed with FPS. And I was disappointed when the brand followed the FPS-only road. Luckily, today, we have Door Kickers.Even tough it hasn't got the FPS part, DoorKickers allow you to plan a police operation and play along. But beware! The price of this game is worthy only if you are not a whiner. It is extremely hard to get all stars in many missions. There are only few that can be considered easy. It is a great challenge.In game bugs? At first I was annoyed that sometime, one of my police officers threw a grenade or flashbang at their feet (hitting the wall instead of throwing it past the wall) but later I started considering that everyone is human. Everyone makes mistakes, police officers too. And this makes everything more challenging.			"

												Very nice and rich tactical squad game ! You will take control of a SWAT team and have save hostages, difuse bombs or kill ennemies in close quarter environment. The gameplay is very rich and efficient. You will have a lot of fun at playing it. This is more than a die and rety simply,This game will ask you to recognize tactics and planning of the assault. You can assign different teamroles to the unit like assault, breacher, shield... and choose your gear (rifles, guns, equipments) The longevity is big with plenty of different missions with ennemies locations changing each time. This is a very good bought I've done and for the prce you can not regret it. In this style I do not know better game ! Ce jeu est une super pioche. Le contrôle d'une escouade SWAT dans les environnements urbains vous demandera, voire exigera, de la planification et du bon sens dans l'assaut. Les scénarii et missions sont très nombreux et le gameplay très intéressant bien que simple. Vraiment je ne regrette pas cet achat. Super dans le genre tactique/stratégie !			"

												Every now and then, a game comes along and fills a gap in the market that I didn't really know needed to be filled - Door Kickers is one such game. Inspired in no small part by the planning phases of late 1990s Tom Clancy games, Door Kickers is a thought provoking adrenaline rush of anti-terrorism action-puzzles. There's two ways you can play Door Kickers. You can either take advantage of the ability to pause & issue commands in real time, edging your way through a level one command at a time, carefully assessing your options before pushing onwards... Then there's the right way - You plan everything from the get go. One continuous stream of commands that'll see your trooper(s) go from room to room, checking their corners and, hopefully, never leaving themselves open to an ambush. The sense of accomplishment from laying down a perfect plan that requires no tweaking after the mission starts is pretty special, and adds so much challenge to the game that you'll be entertained for hours and hours.Levels vary wildly from simple elimination jobs, to bomb defusal, hostage rescue, and evidence gathering. No two levels are the same, and thanks to the numerous ways to approach each, there's potentially no limit to replayability. Replayability is also helped by a multi-tier challenge system & a pretty strong community modding scene. The in-game custom level generator makes designing & sharing levels with others really simple, and it's fun to see how challenging a level can actually be when designed by someone other than a sensible developer.Character variety is a-plenty as the game has a generous amount of specialized classes & customization, along with veterancy rewards and dedicated fighting styles. Completing campaign levels in the best possible way will require a well rounded squad of multiple talents, but be warned - Death is permanent in campaign modes, and it's possible to lose a talented officer in just one poor move.It's not all great, though. Music & voice acting is less than mediocre, while the graphics are pretty much just fit for purpose. There could also be very slight improvements to mission planning, but the developers have proven their intent to better the game, and it's by no means bad right now - It just could be a little better, that's all.Overall, Door Kickers is a resounding recommendation. A collection of standalone tactical puzzles, campaigns & UGC, all wrapped in an attractive enough package with amazing character customization & challenges galore. If you're in any way  intrigued, then jump in without hesitation.			"

												A real-time with pause game that requires you to plan carefully before engaging the bad guys. The squad as a whole could level up, earning you 'doctrines' to spend on the provided tech tree. Each squad member could also level up to improve their stats. You gain 'stars' after each successful mission, which you can spend on unlocking new weapons/armors/items that you can assign to any squad member. You could play the built-in missions, generate random ones, or create your own with the editor.So, yes, the game is worth every penny.			"

												TL;DR6.5/10Don’t go out of your way to recommend it, but if you find the chance, then go for itI first saw this game while searching through the deep dark slums of the farthest-back pages of Steam, and was not immediately encouraged to get Door Kickers. It just looked like a bare-bones, top-down shooter with some mediocre ‘tactical’ elements tossed in. I let it be for a while and then came back to it a couple of months later, then decided “what the heck, I’ll buy it”. I had a total blast for the first week, just playing my way through various missions and unlocking various weapons and armor, but after that, I found myself getting really bored. That is, until I discovered the workshop, and let me tell you; that is what makes this game so great.Gameplay wise, Door Kickers really stands out. None of your soldiers are too overpowered (unless you download god armor from the workshop), so you need to use every last drop of tactical knowledge to keep them alive. Nothing is more frustrating then spending twenty minutes working out a plan and then having all of your troops mowed down by some guy with a machine gun hiding behind a bulletproof couch the instance they kick down the first door. To actually complete a mission you need to buckle down and focus, or you are going to end up with only one guy, cowering in the corner, waiting for someone to come and yell a stereotypical phrase at them then blow your final guy’s head off.All in all, Door Kickers won’t blow you away, but if you like tactical games, then you’ll have some fun with it. If you don’t like those games, then this is probably not the game for you. The graphics aren’t great, but the workshop makes up for that by having new stuff constantly made every day for you to try out. So give it a try if you feel like it, but if you don’t like this type of game, then don’t waste your money on it.6.5/10Don’t go out of your way to recommend it to a friend, but if you find the chance, then go for itBuy it full price if you have the money on hand, but otherwise buy it on sale.~Mfilms2000You can find more of our reviews on our curator page here:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/technosharkreviews "

Every door is a problem to be solved - kick it in? place guys on both sides and open it? breach it? toss flashbangs through? try to go in quiet with silencers? jump in with quick reacting pistol wielders? cautiously have the guy with the shield lead the way? jump in with assault rifles and try to overwhelm with sheer force? Switch out the guns to maximize fire rate or accuracy or stopping power? How many people to assign to the door? Do you leave yourself open to being flanked if you stack people on a door?

												Surprising amount of depth for a 2D top-down title. Didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did but they pretty much did everything right and exceeded all expectations looking at this from previews and gameplay. Entering  each zone is tense and requires a lot of planning and decisions to be made in squad placement, individual loadouts, and directions of approach. Unlocking weapons, skills, and soldier perma-death make for a great progression system. Tacking on the community made maps and mods increases the replayability value on top of the game. Incredibly well-balanced in weapons, armor, and classes with the enemies. It's like Hotline Miami with more tacticality and depth. Would recommend to anyone with a slight passing interest in the game.			"

												An interesting tactical game I bought in the steam sale. It can be a little fiddly but its nice to play if you like tactical games. You can play it live or plan your moves which adds some variety of gameplay along with the customisation of your crew so you can change up your playstyle. If you like top down tactical games I'm sure you would enjoy this, if you're unsure its worth a try in the sale.			"

								A brilliant game with easy to learn and use controls. Extremley tactical and makes you feel like a total badass. The gameplay is extremley smooth for a game of this style. The graphics are well-chosen and styled for the game despite not being entirely beautiful (It would ruin the game if they were).Really just a 10/10 in every way. I can't wait to see what critics say.			"

								Graphics is good, no bugs that I can see. The only gripe I have is that there is no tutorials beyond the basic 3 slides in the game. I know the devt mentioned that there is no point doing a tutorial at this stage, but it does make the game rather steep to learn.But there is nothing more satisfying than to see your planned mission go off smoothly once you figured out the basics.I do wish that the characters would not moving into the room before the flashbang go off though...And the stopping the hostage execution scenarios are hair-pulling exercises.Better than Frozen Synapse in that the graphics are more engaging, and keeps me interested during the mission, and the pause-anytime-to-plan feature is fantastic.Looking forward to more improvements by the devts!

								Door Kickers is only in an Alpha state right now (version 7 to be exact as I write this), but the game is wonderful. It is one part top-down shooter and 9 parts Rainbow Six with regards to tactics. While the premise is simple, the various maps and the potential for community interaction and future custom maps is astounding. The game is ridiculously addicting and can only get better from here. Do not hesitate to hit the ""buy"" button on this one. Do it, you know you want to.			"

												I love this game. It had me at ""Tango Down!"".It has yet to crash on me. Entertains for hours. I have completed the first two campaigns, and working on the third, along with going for all the stars and achievements on the first several screens of maps. I dislike how spy cameras work in planning a breech as you can't have them do it, then switch to another method of breech, or sweep the room then kick the door, which results in pausing, dinking with the plan. I also can't seam to figure out how to add movement waypoints in the middle of an existing way point.  Stealth guys are a little quirky, they need to have the ability to shoot regardless or stay silent, not just a button mash while executing a plan. I like how the dev's kept it real, no crazy sci fi or uber expensive tech gear. That might be a cool expansion a future cop or such. I could also see this being a fun military sim, clearing a city block or such. Overall this game provides plenty of fun for the cost.			"

												I'm having a lot of fun with Doorkickers; it is a good strategy game with moderate potential to strategize. My only real complaint is that the game lacks variety in how you can choose to clear a level. This is mainly because the classes and skills you unlock don't offer enough substance, or open up many new methods of playing. For these reasons, the game can start to feel repetitive. I think a lot more imagination could have been applied to the game's design in that department, even while staying in the realm of realism.

												This game really makes you think before you send your teams in. Best blend of tactics and strategy I've ever played in a game. Every mission is different and really makes you put thought into it. So many weapons, armors, and secondaries. You can breach a door with a shotgun and send a squad in with assault rifles with a sniper set outside a window to cover them going in. My favorite part of the game is how you can divvy up your movements into sequences. For instance, once you plan your teams' routes, you can divide their movements to into sections. So. you can have one team sneak in and clear an area silently and cut off an escape route and begin phase ""A"" where another team will blow their door open for a loud entrance and move in. You can then set phases B thru D for movement after things are clear, certain enemies have been eliminated, etc. It's probably the most satisfying when you're preplanned movements finish a mission without pausing it to readjust.I would suggest maybe a headswivel option for when one of your routes end. This would enable one or more units to watch all around them so they don't get snuck up on.I would also suggest a little more user-friendly map creation.Other than that, this is a must-buy game for those interested in a truly amazing tactical/strategic SWAT game.

												Unique and interesting take on the tactical shooting genre. When starting out it can be a bit frustrating learning all the controls and best ways to utilise each squad member, but after a few levels you'll start to get the hang of it. The turning point for me was taking my time, playing slower and testing out different tactics using flashbangs and the other door breaching methods.Once you get the hang of things and play a bit you'll end up unlocking more guns and classes, making you an even more lethal tactical force to be reckoned with.

												Doorkickers. The name says it all. If you like strategy (or just going on to workshop and finding the most ridiculous thing for your SWAT team to use) then this is the game for you. You kick down the door, shoot people, and that's pretty much it. You can either play it as you go or plan it out right from the start. The game is really optomized to let you time things perfectly, and things that are a little iffy you can easily fix with a couple of workshop mods. It's 50% off when I'm writing this and I think even at its full $20 price its worth a look at.			"

Combined with levelling up, customising andcontrolling your troopers, the pause/unpause, GO codes and dynamic breaching methods and manouvers this is definently a game worth investing in. Recent updates include lots more challenging maps and campaigns that will keep you hooked for ages. There isn't the same way to complete a mission twice, every time you start a mission, the enemy, hostages and possibly even the bomb change positions, allowing for hours of ever changing fun. Definently a game worth buying, worth every cent. 10/10. Hats off to Killhouse Games.			"

												Personally one of the best games in a while. Grinding a perfect game out of this took 44 hours, playing just about every day. And immediately after that, I'm already missing it. It did not start to feel boring or repetitive at any point.There are multiple ways to play this according to your mood. You can carefully (and sometimes a bit tediously) plan out the entire mission, and then relax while watching it success or fail, after which you can adjust it for a rerun. If you don't feel like planning, you can go ad-hoc blasting away in real time, merely pausing in some tight spots.There are some annoyances in the planning, but nothing deal breaking. Addictive game that is fun, quick and easy to start and play a couple of maps - and then a couple more.In the achievements point of view, I liked the fact that achieving everything takes a lot of work, but is eventually accomplishable by anyone.

												I definitely recommend this game to any XCOM / Frozen Synapse / Rainbox Six type of gamers. Full of tactical depth, planning and pure action. It works in real time, but you can pause and give orders any time a'la Baldur's Gate etc. This is not an easy game, but whenever you die you can 99% of the time blame only yourself for recklessness.Overall one of the best games I've played in recent years :)The game also has exceptional replay value. So, so many ways to complete each mission (and already there are a LOT of them).			"

								As a huge fan of the SWAT games I've had my eye on this for some time. After checking out some of the early access reviews I decided to dip my toes in and see what this game had to offer so far - so far, I'm not disappointed. There's a great amount of satisification to watching your carefully planned moves play out and learning from the ones that end in disaster. At this stage, the different classes of character don't seem to come into play but I look forward to sending a stealth team in and perhaps even non-lethal options at a later stage.			"

												Awesome game.  Tons of levels with a couple different objectives.  I just got it but starting to get a feel for all of the different strategies to use when clearing rooms.  It gives you lots of options for planning out each entry by each one of your SWAT members.  Makes you think about rounding a corner if there could be a guy on the other side that you haven't seen yet.  Can't wait to get into the workshop content after I get my guys levelled up more and clear the campaign.  Dev is really involved if you check out the forums, great support.			"

												For fans of tactical games such as SWAT, Door Kickers is a great find. You command a team of SWAT team members as they raid locations in order to rescue hostages, go in for a drug bust, or otherwise eliminate the bad guys. This is a rare type of game where the tiniest mistake can really cost you, especially in campaign mode. If the default content is not enough (honestly, it should be - there is a lot included here), modding is supported and more levels and weapons may be downloaded from the workshop.			"

								This is buy far the BEST tactical simulators I have played since 1998 with the release of the first rainbow six. Every aspect of the game is, fluid and smoth. Delivering a marvelous feeling of being right there on the ground when the first door charge goes off, all this despite it being a 2D top down view.When I play it in genarall goes like this.1. Get the lay of the land, (Evaluate points of entry, danger zones, decide distrubation of the squad)2. How to go about it, (Plan paths of moment, cover zones, assert pace requierd to meet the time limits)3. Taking a closer look, (Get eyes inside of target building or area, reasses previous planing on the new info)4. Kicking down the door, (Executing previous planing)Step 1-3 takes between 1-5 minutes unless im picky and decides to plan it all down to the tinyest detail,Step 4 goes in about 10 seconds up to a minute. 5. Improvising in 9/10 times the planing can't cover every base so I generaly have to cut in half way or in the first 3 seconds of the execution and re plan from there whit what I have to work with.It is wonderfull to get a perfect run whitout hicups in the plan but its just as thrilling to be able to salvage a ""crashed and burned"" plan to still be able to execute the rest.There is a lot of games out there that is worth playing only once, Door kickers is NOT among those titles.You can play it over and over and OVER again, succeding and learning failing and learning. Every time it is a brand new game. If you are a fan of tacsim like me you will get hooked.Score 10/10			"

												Fantastic game. I've always loved the idea of a tactical topdown shooter that's more about planning then spraying bullets, but I've never really liked any of the stealthy games on the market so I can't really compare it to anything I've ever seen and maybe it is very different from anything out there. The only thing that comes to mind is Survivor Squad, but that's about zombies and survival and very unfinished.So all I can say is, they got it right! It's quite easy to control the men, but sometimes quite difficult to find the right tactic to clear a building. At least for somebody that's new to the genre.There's also a little luck involved. Of course you gotta find a tactic that improves your odds, but the some gameplay footage you see in the trailer is a good example of an approach that could get you killed with a little bad luck. Only the bad guys can get a Mac10 which are overpowered.I've played a lot of the Alpha Demo, but this is obviously much better.The controls are still a liiiittle bit odd though. You have to draw the path that your men are going to walk, but a lot of the spaces you go through are very tight and lines will cross. Then when you finish a line it's sometimes hard to tell which one belongs to whom and you finish the wrong line thereby deleting (part of) the path you had just created for the other man. You can give different men different colors, but that doesn't make it easier to select the right one if the game doesn't know which one you're clicking.But it has only been done for a little while and nowadays that means you have to wait an extra 6 months before you can tell if this is the finished product or not.(Don't get me wrong, this game seems pretty much done except for a little tweak here and there. And most of those 'little things' are bugs that I have but most others don't seem to have. So it's nothing like the other unfinished garbage Greenlight brought to Steam.)			"

From a top down view, you click and drag your SWAT Team members, drawing a path for them to follow, in which they'll shoot anyone they see, though later on you can tell them to hold their fire. You can have them breach doors through a variety of ways, such as lock picks, kicking, big hammer, small hammer, and bolt cutters for padlocked gates.There's a large selection of guns, ranging from pistols, Shotgun, SMG's, and Rifle. I especially like the P90 POW when raiding houses, and the M4 for more open maps, since the M4's Accuracy and Stopping Power is maxed out, or very close to it. The tradeoff is that they have ]very low maneuverability.I guess Is shouldn't start reviews when I'm dead tired. I'll contine this sometime tomorrow.			"

												Love the concept of this game. It reminds me a lot of the first Rainbow 6 game back in the late 90's but from a top down view. I played the heck out of that game back in the day. There is some great nostalgic feelings for me when I boot this one up. It's great to see the continued project like development as part of early access. If you liked the old Rainbow 6 or Ghost Recon games but always wanted to see your dudes from above in a strategic environment, this is the one for you.			"

												Door kickers currently has five different campaigns of various lengths and difficulties. It also has 80!!! stand alone missions to practice with your squads. The game has a lot of awesome content. The interface is user friendly and doesn't take long to learn. While the game is paused you can give orders to your officers and design a route for them to follow.  You can play the game in real time too if you like to live dangerous. The squad members are kept on a roster and they sort of grow on you. I love this game.			"

												I have been gaming since 1982, yes, I am that old when they sold games in baggies.I would say after nearly 100k on games purchased there is none that engage me like this game.  I love the old SWAT games, and in a way wish they brought back the 'personal' fear of breaching the door, but this is clearly the best of the bunch.  The modern interface makes this a jofy to play,  And the AI seems capable enough, but of course you can always ramp it up by having more hostiles.The ability to have 100's(?) of created levels to play makes this super.Only negative, I wish they had 'true' multiple floors, however the stairs, and the sniper make up for that.I was a first responder in these kinds of situations, and yes, this is a good abstraction, except in real life nobody knows who is in charge, what the target is, and how to deal with it.Probably best game on Steam for me.

												Door Kickers is, simply put, quite a bit of fun. Anyone who enjoys a good game of tactics and strategy should at least give it a chance.While I will say the maps are well done and the different options provided are expansive, there are a few things I am having trouble working around. Despite the mildly awkward controls giving me issues (Specifically when trying to respond to threats in real time) and the very ""ballsy"" AI, the game is exceptionally well done. I would most definitely recommend the game to any strategists out there. As long as you take some time to learn the controls, it's quite a blast.			"

												More ""Rainbow Six"" than Vegas and Vegas 2...and I'm pretty sure Siege as well. Doorkickers is a real-time/turn-based tactical strategy game where you can do all of the planning you loved in R6 1-3. Great mechanics, good interface, good graphics, plenty of loadout options..everything is pretty much top-notch perfection. The game DOES have its own identity, but for now, it's as close to a good R6 installment as you're going to get. The only improvements I can think of are adding a great multiplayer mode, and being able to control operatives directly, but, this isn't Rainbow Six, this is Doorkickers. Buy it, play it, love it. 10/10			"

												Perfect bite-sized strategy with all the 'one shot gravitas' and faux bravado a good round of Rogue Spear would muster. Part puzzle part strategy with some pseudo RPG elements. Tons of stock levels, a random mission generator, and a strong mission editor mean lots of replay value even if you never touch the effortlessly integrated Steam Workshop for mods or community levels.It was an impulse buy based on looks and concept, and surprised me in a good way. If it looks even remotely appealing to you, get it!			"

												I played this game and enjoyed it.If you liked the old SWAT tactical shooter, here's something you will enjoy. The good thing about this is that there's actual planning invovled - ypou don't just send your men in guns blazing, cause that way most or all of them will go back in bodybags. Here you have to plan ahead and every room you clear matters. One unexpected event will often demand of you to re-think your strategy. This is NOT a game wher eyou plan, then hit ""execute"" and forget about the whole thing. Far from what it may seem from screenshots or short videos, this is a thinking man's game.Another good part of it is that there's more replayability than meets the eye. The same scenario will vary from one playthrough to the next. You may encounter different number of foes, in diffrent places, with different behaviour, armament and patrol patterns than you seen in your last playthrough of a given scenario. There are a lot of scenarios on tp of it all.There is also an RPG-style mechanic - your SWAT agents will rise in skill after participating in missions, you will also get access to more armor types, weapon and doctrines as you complete more missions. Doctrines act much as passive bonuses in mmorpgs. This works pretty well, although it is primarily a tactical game and the rpg elements are not as deep as in complex mmos.Only two downsides I can think of are two elements from the SWAT games taht I miss here - there's no tear gas and there's little in the way of opponent morale - 99% of foes will fight to the death and not surrender.

												An awesome game. A 2D Rainbow Six is a nice way of describing it, but it's less FPS and a bit more tactical.It can be somewhat challenging to get used to the controls, since its gameplay is very unique.There's also lots of content available, not to mention the mission generator or editor. Out of the box, the game provides more content than you would expect. Totally worth buying.One last thing, the Linux version works great and is very smooth.			"

												For someone that wants to play a quick game, that takes a bit of skill.This game isn't necesarily grindy unless you want to play it to completion. The pricetag is a bit much for something that does grow tiresome fairly quickly. Games like this might be better suited to a mobile platform like a tablet, albeit at a lower price (say $3-5). That doesn't, however, make this a bad game, just a little lacking. I'll recommend this game for people that like games like FTL and maybe X-Com. Buy this on sale.			"

												This is an excellent game if you were ever a fan of the old ""Swat"" series of video games. Theres around 80 levels right now, plus campaigns and custom missions in the community workshop, so theres a ton of content. The game has been updated and had some major additions in the few months that I have owned it, leading me to believe its got some great people working on it. Only downside is the missions can get frustrating if your having troubles but quitting for a bit and trying again works. Overall a great game with tons of content, great controls and a good community. I've got over 20 hours of playtime and I could easily see that double or trippling.			"

												Game not finished yet, but i can tell it's good. A little obscure at the beginning (well, it's easy but very badly explained), then you can begin to make true assault plans.Very similar to rainbow six briefing phases, only mixed in the game through real time/active pause. Very enjoyable. Some minor problems with planning (editing/removing waypoints, synchronising some stuff like ""do that when flashbang has exploded"" is impossible, you have to manually put go codes.), maybe it's not bugs and just me misusing it, but then again it might mean it's not very intuitive.All in all a great game, highly recommandable if you like rainbow six or swat for the tactical side, and not the action side.

												One of the best Tactical games I have ever played hands down.  Similar to Frozen Synapse that came out a few years ago but in all ways superior to it.  The ease of giving units direction and the ability to pause or command your units in real time make this game so fun.  It's also challenging, there are times to beat for each mission and you have to pass levels with one gameplan you create to have your units move in fluidly and dispatch all targets.  It is really fun to set up part of the plan, hit play, see how it pans out and then edit it accordingly and add on the next steps.I can'trecommend this game enough to people who like tactical games.

												This is awesome. There's almost like three games in one here, the first type where you just control the game as normal and try to win the mission, the second type where you do it with one guy, and the third type where you do it as a ""one plan only"" style. Each type is interesting enough to stand out from the other, and it also has an interesting campaign mode series. There are a few minor control quirks but once you get used to the system you can do pretty powerful plans. There's pretty much no storyline to speak of though, which is something that could be worked on.			"

												Great game recommend you try it out if you are a fan of any of the tags.Pros:Great game (vague i know...) somewhat simple controls (this is where it transitions from all commands to some commands with you taking control  of watching your 6 in a reverse facing advance).Match time can varry...expect missions to take anywhere from  5 seconds to 1 min. (depends) with 5 mins. to 20 mins being spent in the planing (as they say..♥♥♥♥♥♥poor planing makes for♥♥♥♥♥♥poor performance).I like the A.I. it uses, dont know much in this depatment but gotta say its on par for making each of the 100's of matches that much more difficult than the last...Cons:At this point for me in the game there are few complaints... uhhh shotgun is OP, the m4 needs rework, add options for ammunition type the interface initally gets takes some getting used to add M4 SBR variant (short barreled rifle)add depth maybe by adding manufacter category, score sponsorships with the companies...I do not mind meters, but do it justice visually, everything seems so cramped, and make furniture a little less bothersome.WIll Update more later if I can			"

												If you play CS:GO/CS/CSS this is a good stratagizing game. As being a CT (Counter Terrerist) when I play, I tend to think about where to go, and how to counter a guy with a sniper vs a shotgun. So this is a good connect for stratagy. If you don't play any CS game. Then this is still a good stratagy game, and can be put into real world games. (as in Paintball, Airsoft, LazerTag) Though as ""Stars"" are your currancy, and you can get up to 3 a level, It is a bit difficult. Then the campain missions, heads up, DO NOT let a single person in your squad get killed EVER! You will regret it! Have fun :3			"

								Based on the 21 June 14 Beta:I watched a Nerdcubed Alpha Detective on Youtube for this and it looked fun. Only had a small discount in the Summer Sale, but got it anyway. So glad I did.Massively addictive game and has that ""one more go"" feel. Just playing through the single missions trying to 3 star them all. Has that X-com trait of being protective of your leveled up guys. Only criticism so far is that the guns seem too similar. There are 7 or 8 hand guns and the best one is easy to unlock so its pointless to even bother with the ones in between. The better Assault rifles have a better leveling up/unlocking range.  Don't normally bother with game editors, but going to try on this - seems easy to use from the little play I had.  "

												This game is great and challenging. The game is really realistic and has the planning stage and then the action phase. You are trained for basic breeching and it is up to you to find new strategies and tactics to win. There is hostage missions, bomb missions, assult missions and many other types. This game is not like other shooters because it isn't really competitive. It instead focuses more on self improvement to get 3 stars on every mission or to get the mission done in the perfect amount of time. The only changes I would recomend would be to make level customizing easier, to slightly nerf assult, and to give sheild more of a buff.			"

												Fantastic game. I've always loved the idea of a tactical topdown shooter that's more about planning then spraying bullets, but I've never really liked any of the stealthy games on the market so I can't really compare it to anything I've ever seen and maybe it is very different from anything out there. The only thing that comes to mind is Survivor Squad, but that's about zombies and survival and very unfinished.So all I can say is, they got it right! It's quite easy to control the men, but sometimes quite difficult to find the right tactic to clear a building. At least for somebody that's new to the genre.There's also a little luck involved. Of course you gotta find a tactic that improves your odds, but the some gameplay footage you see in the trailer is a good example of an approach that could get you killed with a little bad luck. Only the bad guys can get a Mac10 which are overpowered.I've played a lot of the Alpha Demo, but this is obviously much better.The controls are still a liiiittle bit odd though. You have to draw the path that your men are going to walk, but a lot of the spaces you go through are very tight and lines will cross. Then when you finish a line it's sometimes hard to tell which one belongs to whom and you finish the wrong line thereby deleting (part of) the path you had just created for the other man. You can give different men different colors, but that doesn't make it easier to select the right one if the game doesn't know which one you're clicking.But it has only been done for a little while and nowadays that means you have to wait an extra 6 months before you can tell if this is the finished product or not.(Don't get me wrong, this game seems pretty much done except for a little tweak here and there. And most of those 'little things' are bugs that I have but most others don't seem to have. So it's nothing like the other unfinished garbage Greenlight brought to Steam.)			"

It doesn't teach you a lot about the mechanics (what triggers a hostage to be killed, how long it takes, etc.) but you can figure that out after a bit if you're paying attention. There are a few silly aspects of it (a sniper can kill a hostage if they're n the line of sight - a police sniper... can shoot a hostage... on purpose...). It's pretty fun, just a bit frustrating.

Or don't plan, just go in & spray and pray (and fail). Enemies are generated procedurally.Guns, shields, armour, tools, classes, names, portraits, callsigns, all can be customised.+ Drugs, bank robbery, hostage situations are included.			"

												             Having played what feels like hundreds of hours, though my steam account only says 14... I feel like the planning in this game is so meticulous that it feels like its an all nighter of running simulation after simulation, until you get the actual operation right. This is not a bad thing either after doing it time and time again doing it you get invested in the mission.             The campaigns that are listed in the game make things even more intense with permadeath for each one of your squad causing the next mission to be harder than the next.           For those who are looking for an actual semi realistic tactics game for SWAT OP Simulations, this game is perfect for you!Overall rating 9/10			"

												Door kicker is an awesome and addict game. I higly recommend it to everyone. The game is well balanced, easy to play, and very nicely done.There are things however that could be improved. The characters may ""improve"" in the game but it actually has not much impact. The same applies to weapons, there are lots of weapons which have almost the same statistics, so they don't make much difference. It would be nice to be able to add more customization to weapons, like lamp, laser dot, etc.  So, overall, a great-great game, and i hope there will be a Door Kickers 2 with more improvements.			"

Combined with levelling up, customising andcontrolling your troopers, the pause/unpause, GO codes and dynamic breaching methods and manouvers this is definently a game worth investing in. Recent updates include lots more challenging maps and campaigns that will keep you hooked for ages. There isn't the same way to complete a mission twice, every time you start a mission, the enemy, hostages and possibly even the bomb change positions, allowing for hours of ever changing fun. Definently a game worth buying, worth every cent. 10/10. Hats off to Killhouse Games.			"

												I love this game. It had me at ""Tango Down!"".It has yet to crash on me. Entertains for hours. I have completed the first two campaigns, and working on the third, along with going for all the stars and achievements on the first several screens of maps. I dislike how spy cameras work in planning a breech as you can't have them do it, then switch to another method of breech, or sweep the room then kick the door, which results in pausing, dinking with the plan. I also can't seam to figure out how to add movement waypoints in the middle of an existing way point.  Stealth guys are a little quirky, they need to have the ability to shoot regardless or stay silent, not just a button mash while executing a plan. I like how the dev's kept it real, no crazy sci fi or uber expensive tech gear. That might be a cool expansion a future cop or such. I could also see this being a fun military sim, clearing a city block or such. Overall this game provides plenty of fun for the cost.			"

												Lots of fun and pretty great set up. Mods really allow for an increase in content like weapons and gear that one might find missing. I will say that mapping can be rather time consuming and that there are some missed opportunities for refinement between the PC and tablet versions where you really feel like you're playing a tablet game on a PC. Its exciting and tons of fun and the developers and community are really supportive and you will soon find yourself spending hours trying to get things just right! 9/10			"

												I have to admit, I didn't expect much from the top down shooter but man was I wrong.  Once you learn the basics of technique it really is addicting to master the seemingly unlimited map scenarios.  For anyone who enjoys the rainbow six series (especially the older and more detailed planning versions) you will enjoy this game.  The controls are straight forward, plan a route and find the best way to clear the various rooms.  I found myself restarting the challenges over until I attained 3 stars a piece.  I am 5 hours into the single mission maps and have noet yet began any of the campaigns.  only downside to the game from what I have read, is that when a character dies, the player is gone forever.  That is unless you do some scum saving.			"

												So, you're probably sitting here thinking, ""Why don't I just get Breach and Clear?"". Here are a few reasons why this game is AWESOME! I got Door Kickers in the autumn sales for £2 (I'm a sucker for a bargain) already I have put 4.1 hours into the game just by playing before and after school before dinner. This game is amazing!The sheer brilliance of the customisation means you can have all kinds of you own ""classes"" on top of the pre-made ones! For example, I created a line up of solely pointmen with silenced pistols and took out the targets with stealth and cunning rather than brute force. It was cool to think I could do all of these new cool tactics!Now, I'm not one to go through a game and get three stars on every level. I just get bored. But for Door Kickers? The fact that you need stars to customise your squad means I want to 100% the game!Also, another great thing is that the most expensive gun/armour/shield isn't nessecarily the best gun/armour/shield! It's all about how you play the game! You can also upgrade the weapon skills of your squad with pistols, long guns and shotguns! This adds a whole other dynamic to the game as you can upgrade your perks or equipment strategically depending on one other!And of course you can name each member squad! You can be as creative as you like! You could call your ""crack-shot-with-a-pistol-guy"" anything from ""Dead-eye"" to ""Sh**head"" This enables you to be slightly attached to your men and be upset if they are killed in the line of fire. And yes, if your men are killed during a campaign, they will not be replaced by new men until you have won/lost the whole campaign! This makes you think about your choices more carefully during an assault on a building.I would highly recommend this game to ANYONE no matter what games they like/play! I recommend picking it up, especially in a sale! Worth the £14.99 its sold for! "

Using a tablet or touchscreen would add value to the controls, but they are quite fluid with a mouse nevetheless.The leveling and equipment systems allow for some gameplay variety, while achievements contribute with replayability.

												This is an amazing and well done game.  I have a few cons however. The game does not have any multiplayer, an awesome idea for a game like this. Such as two teams agianst each other or two or more member clearing the house.  There is also no kind of introduction or tutorial.  And finally, you have to be level six to play campaign, this will take you about half an hour or more, so it isn't much of a bid deal, but still a bit irratible.  Overall, great game, really fun and I would recommend it, but it isn't really worth $20, so wait for a sale.			"

												Door Kickers is an absolutley fantastic top-down tactical shooter, the game is designed to really make you think about the classes you choose and the way you go about things, for example, it's entirely possible for me to have four guys bust through the front door and have them be killed to the last man in 2 seconds flat, on the other hand I can send one guy with some good armor and well placed flashbangs quietly through the back or a window and get a fair way through the stage without even getting hit. There's also a great deal of customization for each character's weapons, armor, and utilities. This allows for a level of mission specific customization that further enhances the experience. The only thing I'd say I didn't like is that at times if caught reloading or lockpicking the interrupt is too long, the character doesn't move at all which usually results in an insta-kill.			"

								This is buy far the BEST tactical simulators I have played since 1998 with the release of the first rainbow six. Every aspect of the game is, fluid and smoth. Delivering a marvelous feeling of being right there on the ground when the first door charge goes off, all this despite it being a 2D top down view.When I play it in genarall goes like this.1. Get the lay of the land, (Evaluate points of entry, danger zones, decide distrubation of the squad)2. How to go about it, (Plan paths of moment, cover zones, assert pace requierd to meet the time limits)3. Taking a closer look, (Get eyes inside of target building or area, reasses previous planing on the new info)4. Kicking down the door, (Executing previous planing)Step 1-3 takes between 1-5 minutes unless im picky and decides to plan it all down to the tinyest detail,Step 4 goes in about 10 seconds up to a minute. 5. Improvising in 9/10 times the planing can't cover every base so I generaly have to cut in half way or in the first 3 seconds of the execution and re plan from there whit what I have to work with.It is wonderfull to get a perfect run whitout hicups in the plan but its just as thrilling to be able to salvage a ""crashed and burned"" plan to still be able to execute the rest.There is a lot of games out there that is worth playing only once, Door kickers is NOT among those titles.You can play it over and over and OVER again, succeding and learning failing and learning. Every time it is a brand new game. If you are a fan of tacsim like me you will get hooked.Score 10/10			"

								As a huge fan of the SWAT games I've had my eye on this for some time. After checking out some of the early access reviews I decided to dip my toes in and see what this game had to offer so far - so far, I'm not disappointed. There's a great amount of satisification to watching your carefully planned moves play out and learning from the ones that end in disaster. At this stage, the different classes of character don't seem to come into play but I look forward to sending a stealth team in and perhaps even non-lethal options at a later stage.			"

You command a team of SWAT team members as they raid locations in order to rescue hostages, go in for a drug bust, or otherwise eliminate the bad guys. This is a rare type of game where the tiniest mistake can really cost you, especially in campaign mode.

												Door Kickers is an absolutley fantastic top-down tactical shooter, the game is designed to really make you think about the classes you choose and the way you go about things, for example, it's entirely possible for me to have four guys bust through the front door and have them be killed to the last man in 2 seconds flat, on the other hand I can send one guy with some good armor and well placed flashbangs quietly through the back or a window and get a fair way through the stage without even getting hit. There's also a great deal of customization for each character's weapons, armor, and utilities. This allows for a level of mission specific customization that further enhances the experience. The only thing I'd say I didn't like is that at times if caught reloading or lockpicking the interrupt is too long, the character doesn't move at all which usually results in an insta-kill.			"

Fast paced, exciting and it's actually very good fun! Nothing worse than losing a good trooper to some cartel drug-smuggler with a good hiding spot.10/10 would check corners again.			"

I have always enjoyed RTS games such as Empire Earth, Command and Conquer etc so this appeared to be an interesting take on it.From playing it for about 10-15 hours now I can rightly say it is fresh new look on the RTS idea.It is simple in concept and to actually play, however the levels provided offer many different tactical issues for you to overcome. It is a game that will actively make you think  as well as try new plans, so far I have gone trhough a good section of the Single Mission section and played some randomly generated maps. I haven't even started the campaigns yet.Definately well worth a look!			"

												Rewardingly and frustratingly difficult. I found myself striving to get five stars on absolutely every mission, going every angle, weapon, and piece of gear to get the perfect combination. Careful planning is generously encouraged since every time I didn't carefully plan ( and a lot of times when I did ) the game would brutally punish and have my whole squad wiped out by one guy in one corner I didn't think I'd need to sweep on entry. With 33 hrs in as of writing this, I still haven't gotten through all the campaign levels, which are unique in approach and scale compared to the shorter missions menu. I tried fiddling with the level builder, and its kind of a pain. Could be more intuitive.If you're a perfectionist, be wary. Also, a less tactics dependant game called breach and clear is pretty good if you end up liking this game.			"

												To start this off i dont write many reviews so I hope its ok and ill keep it short and sweet.OMFG Door Kickers is so amazing I just had to review it. So I like strategy games and have only played a few really decent ones (my opinion) Xcom, JA2 and this weird old school flash game called Field Commando or something, Field commando was a 'crappy lil game' that looked like it took 2 seconds to make but the idea of controlling (Very restricted) a military squad was awesome. Door Kickers is what i dreamt Field  Commando would have been if they worked harder. IT IS AMAZING.Pros - Great soundtrack, Keeps up the tension/atmosphere.        - Massive range of difficulty.        - Different types of missions (not just take out the enemy but arresting people and rescuing hostages)        - Graphics are better then Field Commando (you're not a circle haha)        - (To me) Highly replayable, yes I might not sit here for hours playing it but I will deffinatley play it  again and again  when im bored or have time to kill.        - Reasonably priced (although i got 75% off in steam sales paid like 5 bucks US)         - Unlock weapons and armour.        - You can have a squad of like 8 men all taking out different targets at the same time. Feels good to wipe out like 20  enemies in like 2 seconds.Cons - Not many         - Graphics could still be better.         - It will frustrate the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.         - Times dissappears when you have 'just one more crack at the mission'         - Few glitches and my guys died a few times getting shot from someone who they couldnt shoot(i was hiding and they could see and arm, enemies could shoot me but my guy just took it and died.BoldyB - Give it a go. Better value for money then WarZ.....oh wait Infestation surviv......oh you lost interest :(			"

												Is the game good? YesIs the game what you think it is when you see the videos? Not really.Let me explain: When you see the videos you see somekind of fast paced strategy game, but it's not really like that. You need to plan ahead and then unpause, and yeah, it's a bit more tricky to actually make them do what you want them to do, so sometimes you unpause and they don't really do what you want.I guess it takes time to get used to it, personally, it wasn't my cup of tea, but for people who have a bit more patience with the simple yet weird UI, and you like strategy and planning and watching the magic happen, this game is for you.I will still recommend it for people who know what they are getting.

												I used to play and love SWAT 2 back in the days and was rather amazed when I stumbled upon Door Kickers.Having figured out that despite the concept and the game mechanics, those two games are hardly comparable, I thought I'd be disappointed but actually, the opposite was the case. I really dig the RPG element of being able to level your squad and gain various traits.It's easy to get the hang of the game, but that doesn't mean there's no challenge involved. Only thing I'm missing a bit is that I can't play on the terrorist side - but that would be rather difficult to implement anyways.All in all, neat game I absolutely enjoy.			"

												I saw this game being played on Youtube by FXGamer Official, it caught my fancy. I have always enjoyed RTS games such as Empire Earth, Command and Conquer etc so this appeared to be an interesting take on it.From playing it for about 10-15 hours now I can rightly say it is fresh new look on the RTS idea.It is simple in concept and to actually play, however the levels provided offer many different tactical issues for you to overcome. It is a game that will actively make you think  as well as try new plans, so far I have gone trhough a good section of the Single Mission section and played some randomly generated maps. I haven't even started the campaigns yet.Definately well worth a look!			"

												I feel that this is a very good game. I like the game concept and pacing of the missions. The missions are interesting but short enough. The game mechanics are not difficult to learn, but level design and the equipment customization ability allows one to try multiple approaches to complete a mission. With good planning of equipment and paths, the team can complete the actual mission in very short time. There are some things that can be improved. For example, the UI makes it difficult to pick individual team members when they stand very closely together. Path creation UI can also be improved, e.g. to allow easy modification of an early segment without having to redo the rest of the path. The variety of weapons also don't seem to matter so much -- for example, many of rifle choices for assaulter class don't seem to offer distinct advantage compared to e.g. P90 or SAR-18 option. Lastly, it's better if some action options are added, e.g. ability for a team member to look around and clear the room before moving. At the moment, there's only option to look at one direction, confirm that it's clear, move slightly, look at another direction, confirm that it's clear, and so on. Another ability that will come in handy is the ability to synchronize team member to only move after a flashbang (without using go codes), the ability to specify alternate action (e.g. when the door that is supposed to be breached is already opened by someone else), and ability to combine actions on one item during planning (e.g. unlock the door, then throw a flashbang through it).Having said that, those issues are minor, and I still highly recommend this game.

												1  Reason i like doorkickers is how its so simple but it makes the game very effective and fun. Its very fun and enjoyble, with lots of fun packed and hard levels but it dont just t end there as there is its own in game generator and even map editor. The only problem i find that will effective a few people is that some of the mission's need allot of planning but if you don't like planning well then this game is gonna be bad for you. but going back into the good side again is that i like how its very strategic because you dotn just send your men into  room with hostiles in there but you have to like throw a grenade or flashbang which i think makes it good cuz then its a challenge. anyway overall i rate this game a 8.5/10 very enjoyable but you need to like planning and stuff			"

												For fans of tactical games such as SWAT, Door Kickers is a great find. You command a team of SWAT team members as they raid locations in order to rescue hostages, go in for a drug bust, or otherwise eliminate the bad guys. This is a rare type of game where the tiniest mistake can really cost you, especially in campaign mode. If the default content is not enough (honestly, it should be - there is a lot included here), modding is supported and more levels and weapons may be downloaded from the workshop.			"

												Being a die-hard fan of the Rainbow 6 series and SWAT 4, this game does a great job at scratching that tactical itch.  Door Kickers is fantastic in it's ability to blend simple controls with complex gameplay with countless levels in both the game and Steam Workshop to give this game insane replayability. And with a level editor/creator, your map selection is practically limitless.   The game really shines in how it forces the player to be extremely considerate of the layout of the entire level. Preparation of engagement as well as the gear outfitted to your squad can mean the difference between a mission going off without a hitch and complete disaster. You'll find yourself spending 30 minutes to an hour on a single level just to perform the mission perfectly.Don't let the 20 dollar price tag for a 2D game fool you, this game is well worth it. If it shows up on sale, more power to you. 9/10- So much more than what you'd expect from a simple 2D top-down shooter.			"

												Decent game but has many shortcommings. Wait for sale and get it dirt cheap.Level design spans from good to clowncars of baddies - even in home invasion mission there are 1-3 people in every single room of 3 story apartment and you get 4 troppers to clear that! upgrade progression makes no sense in this type of game and is very limiting - it is a big hump at the start of the game, ranking missions based on complete time makes no sense in this type of game (and you need lotsa stars to unlock Stealth class, takes forever!), givig you worthless recruits makes no sense. Too many weapons which do not differ much if at all cluttering the list.The troops will show too much initiative and shoot the first guy they see even if you order them to hook around the doorway and check the far corner, but at the same time they need to be instructed to sidestep around every corner.RNG aspects: your troops will occasionally fail to fire first when a tango shows up even if they are aimed exactly at the corner and static. No ammount of foresight can prevent this on occasions.Did I mention star system? Cannot 3 star all missions as you go along, most of them need equipment and classes you will unlock later, so you might need 1 star many to them go back and try to redo them.I spent hours few years bacl playing Rouge Spear in spectator mode and I expected this to be better.

												A solid turn-based stealth (almost but not quite) action game that reminds me a lot of Monaco in artistic style. Unlike Monaco, however, this game is primarily single-player focused and has a great deal of progression. The game offers over 80 single missions (that you can 3-star if you're a completionist) and also has 3 ""campaigns"" that unlock after you reach a certain point of in-game progression. In Door-Kickers you can either complete the entire mission in one complex command/turn or go through the mission in real time. While the controls were a bit clunky for real-time play, I found a great balance in the middle of those two play styles, and the option to just brute through a mission can often be useful.The gameplay loop is simple but satifying, but is not explained as thoroughly as I would have liked. The mechanics themselves are similar to frozen synapse but without the pure turn-based nature. CONCLUSION: A nice blend of Monaco and Frozen Synapse. A must-buy on a deep discount; an alright pick-up on full-price. "

												This game knows what it is and what it aims to be and accomplishes that very well.  I got this in a bundle that was very cheap, and it blew me away.  At it's full retail price, you'd probably want to look into some gameplay videos first to make sure it's something that you'd enjoy.  The big factor being that it focuses much more on strategy and team prep than rich 3d graphics and hero-esque characters.It can be brutal, but encourages creative thinking and being smart about your choices.  Losing a squad mate has weight here, and helps to push you to be careful with your actions, which adds a big immersive element.  Squad progression is done nicely, which makes the game's overall progression feel more balanced, and adds depth to an already fun set of mechanics.If this is on sale or in a bundle, it's an absolute no brainer, if only to test your strategic mettle.  If you enjoy strategy above all else in your games, even if you aren't a fan of military themes/shooters, this is still a great value.			"

												Great game. I really love it. Even in Alpha the game was great, nearly without bugs and now in Beta it is better and better. Thanks to workshop it is much more fun, new maps, weapons and changes are available and developers are still working and they are doing great job. You control group of soldiers (depends on a map how many of them are in action) and you are forced to find the right tactics to solve different situations. Save hostages, Kill all hostiles, Stop execution (this is probably the most hardest mode) and bomb defusal - including few of the combined.Game is sometimes a big challenge and sometimes very easy - but still fun (although sometimes frustrating if you can not kill the hostile before he kills a hostage).

												Its awesome to spend 5 to 10 minutes planning on a single plan in a 600sqft appartment, before seeing it unfold in a matter of seconds, and then starting all over again because one of your trooper was hurt or the hostage was killed. Now imagine the level of planning needed for a 10000sqft firestation with 15 hostages in 3 to 4 different locations.Aiming for perfection will give you a game with a great lifespan.The only flaw IMO is the purcahse sytem, it takes a long time to be able to buy equipment, after a while you just go grinding.

												Ignore the time Steam says I have played. I have played about 14 hours of the game overall, most of it done offline while I was traveling.Similar to: Hotline Miami, Rainbow Six 3, SWAT 4Pros-Simple controls that anyone can pick up.-Can be played with one hand.-Game mechanics may be simple, but allow for extremely complex strategies to be played out.-Versetile level editor.-Lots of content in the game, hundreds of standalone missions ranging in difficulty, as well as a handful of campaigns lasting 1 to 2 hours each.-Randomized mission generator.-Scenario Variety-Perfect game to play on a laptop if you have a mouse.-Officer and Squad progression. (new skills, weapons, and classes to unlock)-Pause and play allows you to assess the situation on an action by action basis, giving the player time to think and plan.-Good soundtrack.-Playing with your own music/podcast in the background takes nothing away from the game. Cons-Enviroments can get repetitive. (The level design is varried, I'm talking about the way they look)-Controls don't work well when trying to play in real time.-Some of the bigger levels can get tedious, especially if you are stuck looking for the last enemy, hostage, bomb, etc.-How fast your guys react to getting shot at is random at times.-Steath is underdeveloped.ConclusionThis is the most fun I have had in an RTS ever. This is coming from someone who doesn't really like RTS games. I decided to give this game a shot, mainly because I am a fan of squad based Tactical FPS's (Swat 4 and Arma 3 being my favorites) and this game shared the same concepts. Overall, the game is accessible, but still has the complexity to please seasoned RTS verterans.Recommended to: Players who are looking for an accessible game that has a challenging tactical experience that does not rely on clunky UI or twitch shooting.9 out of 10			"

At certain points some classes are useless-Weapon balance is bad. Suppressed weapons are much better and due to armor mechanics any weapon that shoots a lot of bullet is much better than weapons that are powerful and accurate.-Your squad feels like a chess piece instead of characters due to limited dialogues			"

												Door Kickers is reminiscent of the tactical SWAT games appropriately named ... SWAT.  Its great to provide that quick tactical fix without drowning the gamer in too much detail.Door kickers bring a considerable graphics update, a story mode, and enough variety in the individual scenarios to keep you from getting bored.  The upgrade system is intuitive and easy to work with.The game experiences some difficulty due in part due to some silly AI from both friendly and enemy NPCs but nothing that can't be overcome with micromanagement (shudder...) but that aside the level of control provided is thorough.  It may appear daunting at first but the tutorial provided at the beginning does a great job of explaining the game mechanics. I don't play this game often but thoroughly enjoy the short bursts when I do.  I got this game during the a steam sale for less than $5 at which price the game is a steal.			"

												This game knows what it is and what it aims to be and accomplishes that very well.  I got this in a bundle that was very cheap, and it blew me away.  At it's full retail price, you'd probably want to look into some gameplay videos first to make sure it's something that you'd enjoy.  The big factor being that it focuses much more on strategy and team prep than rich 3d graphics and hero-esque characters.It can be brutal, but encourages creative thinking and being smart about your choices.  Losing a squad mate has weight here, and helps to push you to be careful with your actions, which adds a big immersive element.  Squad progression is done nicely, which makes the game's overall progression feel more balanced, and adds depth to an already fun set of mechanics.If this is on sale or in a bundle, it's an absolute no brainer, if only to test your strategic mettle.  If you enjoy strategy above all else in your games, even if you aren't a fan of military themes/shooters, this is still a great value.			"

												Mixed feelings about it so far. I put 3 of my men to face one door. The criminal comes out of the door and guns down two of my men with a machine gun before he gets taken down. I almost uninstalled the game then and there. AI seem to have problems, like instead of throwing a flash grenade into the doorway they will throw it at the wall in front of them bouncing back in their face.The replayability is good with random mission generation and a map maker..I like how when you are in a campaign, if your men get injured they stay injured for a while but if you get out of the campaign and go a random mission, it passes the time so that when you go back into campaign, your men are healed up. The action is fluid and the gaining of experience is not restricted to one specific game type. Also it is still the only thing today that reminds me of the good old Rainbow Six and GRAW. In fact there is a mod that just makes it straight Rainbow Six.			"

												One of my favorite strategy games out there. I can't believe I haven't given it a review yet. The controls are easy enough to use, but to master utilizing them to your advantage is a challenge. The guns and classes are varied and the gameplay is addicting. PLAY THE GAME!protip: If you can, look up real life CQB SWAT tactics and Doorkickers gameplay for guidance. The only gripe I have with this game is that they never give you any real tutorial.			"

												This is the Police tactics game the worlds needed and I've always wanted.So lets make this quick. - Their isn't any difficulty settings, only your mind is the limiter to each and every mission. - The campaigns really make perfection a crucial detail because death is permanent.  - Each mission has semi random spawn points so that you'll get a surprise each time - Random mission generator allows unlimited training that will always keep you coming back to play - Many weapons to choose from allowing you to mimic real world SWAT teams or pick your favourites - Steam workshop availibility for easy access to new and fun mods			"

												Good old Rainbow Six is back. Only this time without the FPS part.The game is very simple to get into and controls are easy. Music and sounds get you pumped up as you spend your time planning your mission. Positives: Action packed tactic and puzzle missions, unlocks to be had, team progression, kit selections, moddable on top of all the content and missions which the game already has. Negatives: Needs more background sounds, I'm tired of hearing Bush speak. Missions and campaigns have a too big difference in awards. Would be nice with hotkeys for ALL commands (switching to secondary, planting breach, flashbang). Thanks to Lirik from Twitch for showing this game.			"

												I definitely recommend this game to any XCOM / Frozen Synapse / Rainbox Six type of gamers. Full of tactical depth, planning and pure action. It works in real time, but you can pause and give orders any time a'la Baldur's Gate etc. This is not an easy game, but whenever you die you can 99% of the time blame only yourself for recklessness.Overall one of the best games I've played in recent years :)The game also has exceptional replay value. So, so many ways to complete each mission (and already there are a LOT of them).			"

												I'm having a lot of fun with Doorkickers; it is a good strategy game with moderate potential to strategize. My only real complaint is that the game lacks variety in how you can choose to clear a level. This is mainly because the classes and skills you unlock don't offer enough substance, or open up many new methods of playing. For these reasons, the game can start to feel repetitive. I think a lot more imagination could have been applied to the game's design in that department, even while staying in the realm of realism. Still, it is a very good game and a great way to stimulate the old noggin.8/10			"

												Great game to get (especially on a summer sale) with great mechanics, customization options, and strategies to keep you on edge.You can also make your own maps or just randomly generate one with a seed or options given to you (Size:Medium, enemy power:high, ect.)There is a LOT of content. Maps, Guns, Armor, Classes, and more than one Campaign.And this game works well with the Workshop. You can get mods and custom maps other people made (Ex. Stormtrooper Mod, Metal Gear Soundtrack, and cs_office map).**The ONLY problem with the game is that if you play it for a couple of hours it feels repetative, but that doesnt mean you dont come back to play it again and again*** "

												This game really makes you think before you send your teams in. Best blend of tactics and strategy I've ever played in a game. Every mission is different and really makes you put thought into it. So many weapons, armors, and secondaries. You can breach a door with a shotgun and send a squad in with assault rifles with a sniper set outside a window to cover them going in. My favorite part of the game is how you can divvy up your movements into sequences. For instance, once you plan your teams' routes, you can divide their movements to into sections. So. you can have one team sneak in and clear an area silently and cut off an escape route and begin phase ""A"" where another team will blow their door open for a loud entrance and move in. You can then set phases B thru D for movement after things are clear, certain enemies have been eliminated, etc. It's probably the most satisfying when you're preplanned movements finish a mission without pausing it to readjust.I would suggest maybe a headswivel option for when one of your routes end. This would enable one or more units to watch all around them so they don't get snuck up on.I would also suggest a little more user-friendly map creation.Other than that, this is a must-buy game for those interested in a truly amazing tactical/strategic SWAT game.

												A true tactical game, where tactical means planning and not camping.

												Unique and interesting take on the tactical shooting genre. When starting out it can be a bit frustrating learning all the controls and best ways to utilise each squad member, but after a few levels you'll start to get the hang of it. The turning point for me was taking my time, playing slower and testing out different tactics using flashbangs and the other door breaching methods.Once you get the hang of things and play a bit you'll end up unlocking more guns and classes, making you an even more lethal tactical force to be reckoned with.

												Doorkickers. The name says it all. If you like strategy (or just going on to workshop and finding the most ridiculous thing for your SWAT team to use) then this is the game for you. You kick down the door, shoot people, and that's pretty much it. You can either play it as you go or plan it out right from the start. The game is really optomized to let you time things perfectly, and things that are a little iffy you can easily fix with a couple of workshop mods. It's 50% off when I'm writing this and I think even at its full $20 price its worth a look at.			"

												I used to play and love SWAT 2 back in the days and was rather amazed when I stumbled upon Door Kickers.Having figured out that despite the concept and the game mechanics, those two games are hardly comparable, I thought I'd be disappointed but actually, the opposite was the case. I really dig the RPG element of being able to level your squad and gain various traits.It's easy to get the hang of the game, but that doesn't mean there's no challenge involved. Only thing I'm missing a bit is that I can't play on the terrorist side - but that would be rather difficult to implement anyways.All in all, neat game I absolutely enjoy.			"

												I saw this game being played on Youtube by FXGamer Official, it caught my fancy. I have always enjoyed RTS games such as Empire Earth, Command and Conquer etc so this appeared to be an interesting take on it.From playing it for about 10-15 hours now I can rightly say it is fresh new look on the RTS idea.It is simple in concept and to actually play, however the levels provided offer many different tactical issues for you to overcome. It is a game that will actively make you think  as well as try new plans, so far I have gone trhough a good section of the Single Mission section and played some randomly generated maps. I haven't even started the campaigns yet.Definately well worth a look!			"

												Broke my game with mods, sent a very detailed email to Support, they resent me the files to fix the game while also helping me pinpoint the possible mod(s) that broke my game, fixed (and learnt how to fix the problem after an accidental peek of the .xml files). Back to kicking doors and dropping baddies. I do want to point out that some of the bad guys in body armor can take a lot more bullets than you would expect even with high powered rifle rounds that you'd normally expect to go through whatever the bad guys can afford (apparently they can afford AR500 Level 4 armor) so if you're playing without mods, do expect some heavy resistence and lots of baddies with level 4 AR500 if you're using the mission generator and you have enemy resistence setting set to heavy (w/e that one setting is called). Lots of fun, loving the game, great Support, can't wait for DK2 to come out in the near future.Edit: Tasers are fun to use.Edit #2: I can't stop tasering people. I need help.			"

												Overall: DecentLikes:- A lot of content- Has procedurally-generated levels- Supports player-created contentDislikes:- Planning out your strategy takes quite a bit of time, even for relatively simple levels.  It's fun but it is also tiresome.- Controlling your characters in real time feels laggy because they move slower than your mouse, and inputs get queued.- I wish you could undo changes to your plan, and save your plans for later use.  I also wish you could edit a section of your route without erasing the subsequent path.- In campaign mode, once you leave a mission, your current state (health, deaths) is saved and you can't retry it from the original state you were in when you first played that mission.  Not a huge deal though.			"

Also there is an amazing tacticle field of play and multible missions and options adding to the replayness of this game, along with charecter leveling and permideath. Its awesome. I would pick it up if it is on sale no doubt! But, to pay full price you should really enjoy tactice top down games like Xcom.			"

												This is an excellent game if you were ever a fan of the old ""Swat"" series of video games. Theres around 80 levels right now, plus campaigns and custom missions in the community workshop, so theres a ton of content. The game has been updated and had some major additions in the few months that I have owned it, leading me to believe its got some great people working on it. Only downside is the missions can get frustrating if your having troubles but quitting for a bit and trying again works. Overall a great game with tons of content, great controls and a good community. I've got over 20 hours of playtime and I could easily see that double or trippling.			"

												Game not finished yet, but i can tell it's good. A little obscure at the beginning (well, it's easy but very badly explained), then you can begin to make true assault plans.Very similar to rainbow six briefing phases, only mixed in the game through real time/active pause. Very enjoyable. Some minor problems with planning (editing/removing waypoints, synchronising some stuff like ""do that when flashbang has exploded"" is impossible, you have to manually put go codes.), maybe it's not bugs and just me misusing it, but then again it might mean it's not very intuitive.All in all a great game, highly recommandable if you like rainbow six or swat for the tactical side, and not the action side.

												Door Kickers what i haft to say about is... its tactical you haft to learn tactics and lay out a plan cause with no plan men could die and you will lose them for the whole campaign you need to know what your gonna do you cant go in guns blazeing you haft to take it slow and steady and if you don't like that then don't buy this game but if you like tactics and know how real S.W.A.T can do there work  then buy it.

Delivers a good 5-20 hours of entertainment before you don't want to play it anymore. I have long uninstalled it, but not because it was bad. It's just because the replayability is close to 0. Play the campaigns, do the single missions, and then you're done, because you know how to beat everything. Overall Score: 7.5/10			"

												Great game. I really love it. Even in Alpha the game was great, nearly without bugs and now in Beta it is better and better. Thanks to workshop it is much more fun, new maps, weapons and changes are available and developers are still working and they are doing great job. You control group of soldiers (depends on a map how many of them are in action) and you are forced to find the right tactics to solve different situations. Save hostages, Kill all hostiles, Stop execution (this is probably the most hardest mode) and bomb defusal - including few of the combined.Game is sometimes a big challenge and sometimes very easy - but still fun (although sometimes frustrating if you can not kill the hostile before he kills a hostage).

												Its awesome to spend 5 to 10 minutes planning on a single plan in a 600sqft appartment, before seeing it unfold in a matter of seconds, and then starting all over again because one of your trooper was hurt or the hostage was killed. Now imagine the level of planning needed for a 10000sqft firestation with 15 hostages in 3 to 4 different locations.Aiming for perfection will give you a game with a great lifespan.The only flaw IMO is the purcahse sytem, it takes a long time to be able to buy equipment, after a while you just go grinding.

												I feel that this is a very good game. I like the game concept and pacing of the missions. The missions are interesting but short enough. The game mechanics are not difficult to learn, but level design and the equipment customization ability allows one to try multiple approaches to complete a mission. With good planning of equipment and paths, the team can complete the actual mission in very short time. There are some things that can be improved. For example, the UI makes it difficult to pick individual team members when they stand very closely together. Path creation UI can also be improved, e.g. to allow easy modification of an early segment without having to redo the rest of the path. The variety of weapons also don't seem to matter so much -- for example, many of rifle choices for assaulter class don't seem to offer distinct advantage compared to e.g. P90 or SAR-18 option. Lastly, it's better if some action options are added, e.g. ability for a team member to look around and clear the room before moving. At the moment, there's only option to look at one direction, confirm that it's clear, move slightly, look at another direction, confirm that it's clear, and so on. Another ability that will come in handy is the ability to synchronize team member to only move after a flashbang (without using go codes), the ability to specify alternate action (e.g. when the door that is supposed to be breached is already opened by someone else), and ability to combine actions on one item during planning (e.g. unlock the door, then throw a flashbang through it).Having said that, those issues are minor, and I still highly recommend this game.

												Be a  tactival SWAT team and choose how you want to engage the enemy and save the hostage / defuse the bomb. May be difficult at the beginning but after a few try and learn this game really fun and challenging to get perfect score. Even though we need to spend time to configure and recalculate the startegy, watching the SWAT team moving and engage the enemy according to the plan and went smoothly really addicting.			"

												Very enjoyable, softcore-tactical, quick to play timesink. I got it on sale but it is easily worth 10 quid.I liked Frozen Synapse, making detailed plans for goons to follow and succeeding in beating enemies down via superior tactics. Unfortunately, Frozen Synapse is pretty hardcore and I enjoy being able to kick back and watch my men act. Feels like Door Kickers jumps right in, neither being too complicated, nor being too simplistic.There are issues with the game that feel a bit annoying, such as flashbangs not going where they're supposed to go (which I know very well from SWAT4), path editing not being meant for complex planning and some minor UI stuff. However, the game feels polished, solid and well-designed.Gameplay is generally bang boom bang, so don't expect too much in terms of policework. You're gunning down dozens of armed guys and usually within a narrow timeframe.If the trailer had you excited, buy this thing. It's well worth it.			"

												Challenging and frustrating tactical and action game with aspects of RPG and equiping your squad with various weapons. The classes are to make line between the styles and the approach how you are going to deal with enemies. Or you want to be quick or armed to teeth, but last unlocked class Stealth says the game is easiest with these guys who are quiet and fast. Being shield is good with support fire, being assaulter is good for quick killing, breacher is important for opening locked doors and there is nothing good with first class unless you want to play light with pistol.I unlocked all skills before approaching campaign which was supposed to be easy so I just ordered my men to go through the map and in second level they started to die. My levelling up was wasted by deaths, and only one of the experienced crew survived the easy and short campaign so yeah, this game is not easy.			"

												I liked the concept/idea of this game, but haven't played many games of this type/genre.  While you are given a decent amount of control over the characters actions, the simplistic command input lets the gameplay down a bit.Maybe i haven't played long enough to get used to the controls but mis-clicking an earlier part of a path only to wipeout the rest of it seems to be unnecessarily infuriating and should seemily be easily fixed with an undo or autosave (at least when in the start planning phase).  Different coloured paths for each unit and the ability to pin or lock paths to make selection easier on congested halls would also make for smoother and more precise controls.By having a control layout that's compatible with ipad seem to leave me with almost an entire keyboard of useless keys that could be assigned things like undo or pin (or even provide buttons arround the interface screen to toggle).Overall it's not a bad game, the graphics and voices etc. are good and if you map out a few commands at time then play/pause/map/play/pause repeat it works well, but the command entry method hinders my ability to easily effeciently create and execute the ultimate breach plans start to finish.

												Haven't played much, but it's just such a satisfying game. When you plan a level just right...oh boy that feels nice (not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic, but that may change when i've done some of the workshop levels). Alternatively, when you screw up, I find I don't get annoyed, I know how to improve, and I do so. It is fun going back to previous levels with better weaponry an units. Looks good. Runs good. Possibly a little on the expensive side, but there are workshop levels so I imagine the amount of replayability makes up for that. It has the perfect learning curve, in my opinion. Giving you just the right amount of information then letting you fail/succeed. The game in itself is not overtly hard, but it becomes more challenging the better you want to do, for example, if I get 2 stars, that will not be good enough, and I WILL replay it until I get 3 stars (plus the single plan other bonus achievments)			"

												Door Kickers is a top down strategy game where you plan out routes for you swat units to take and clear out the baddies.  There's customization, classess, the every slight presence of RPG elements, and robust and rewarding gameplay.But this is a game I am torn on.  On one hand, it is very well made strategic and tactical experience with LOADS of content to keep you busy if you love it. However, even with its varying levels of difficulty and what should be endless costomization options to suit each level, the gameplay gets stale very fast.  Often times, I found myself asking why there were so many levels because they all blend together into this ubiqitous expereince so quickly.  To be clear, I absolutely love the gameplay and all of the ideas that are brought to the table, but it is needlessly big.  It's like going to see a movie that has a lot of good stuff but it goes on an hour too long.  Now in videogames, that shouldn't be a problem, you just don't play the extra stuff, but here's the rub:  you are paying for it.The $20 price tag is my only issue with the game.  Other than that, it's perfect for a quick play every now and then and delivers all that it should.  If you like strategy games and it's on sale for say, $10 I highly recommend it, but there isn't enough here to justify the 20 dollar tag.			"

												What an amazing Tactical Shooter.Basically, you plan the route of your team like a professional SWAT team and then hope that your plan won't get your officers killed. You can also do it on the run instead of planning but you would be missing the point of the game.My only complain about the game is when you have bigger maps / bigger teams it gets chaotic to re-arrange a plan after you found an issue with it because of the overlapping paths which are hard to select the one you want to re-adjust.Still, one of my favourite games.11/10 - Enemy Down!

												Easily one of my favorite games I've played all year. It's highly addictive strategy on a small and more personal scale than many macro level games out there. It's a thinking man's (or woman's) game, and is more akin to a game of quick chess than it is to many other tactics games out there. Highly recommended.			"

												Door Kickers!If you ever wanted to pretend to be a super-strategic commander of your very own SWAT squad... well here you go. This is a draw-your-way kind of weird Rainbow 6 Seige.This game is a strategy puzzle game in the form of a SWAT takedown squad. Sometimes you have to kill everything in the room, sometimes save hostages, sometimes sieze drugs or even disarm a bomb.You have a set-up phase where you need to choose which operators (Pointman, Stealth, Shield, Assault and Breaher) you are going to use. Then you draw out your plan. Ivan goes to the door with Dave, throw in a flashbang and kill everyone in the room.Other maps get really challenging really quickly. Ivan and Dave post up in the back entrance while Steve and Cory set a charge on the front door. When you give the Alpha Signal (you can set up to 4 signals for coordinated use), Steve sets off the door charge while Ivan blasts open the back door with a shotgun. Cory sweeps the room while Steve goes down a hall and elimitates hostiles. Dave clears out the bathroom and bedroom while Ivan flashes and kills everyone in the living room because he has the most armor. Mission complete.The game can be a bit annoying at time. Every mission is random, and every play of that mission is random. So you might have the best and brightest plan but some terrorist from the last run of the plan is in another spot and now there are 4 people in a room that used to have 2. Now three operators are dead and one manages to get through. You play the SAME PLAN again and you get through without a scratch. Nevertheless it is the only thing I do not like about it.7/10 puzzle game			"

												Super awesome fun that brings back the days of the old 2D SWAT games. Nice interface, well executed game.The biggest gripe, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, is that it's designed to be a real-time game. You should frequently pause and replan your next few steps. But you might be tempted to try to plan out the entire level from the very start, but alas the game doesn't let you. There are mechanics that require intervetion that will stop your grand plan, so you need to learn to play real-time.The real-time thing is actually fun if you get used to it, but maybe needs a limited amount of saves or something? I hate repetition too much..			"
