												So here I am - heading back home on a bus from school, early 1989. The only real thing on my mind? Firing up the Commodore 64 and rejoining the bunch of Desert Rangers that have just escaped from their first encounter with the Scorpitron. Clips of various calibres were burnt through, LAW rockets fired, two mortally injured - but the team survived. Just.How had this game got to captivate me so much? To this day, Wasteland ranks as my No.1 game of all time. Not a maybe, not a floating possibility amongst five other great games - but the clear front runner and sole contender. One that I doubt will ever be usurped in the immediate and all-consuming effect that wandering into the radioactive barrens of the American mid-West had on me.Wasteland is a top-down RPG that follows the 'good guys' of Desert Rangers - attempting to put right the wrongs and work out what strange events are happening in post-nuclear desert around Las Vegas. Fully customisable characters are still fun today, but in late 1988, this was unheard of. Brawlers, pistoleros, ranged specialists to hi-tech geeks were all here - including murderous cyborgs, dodgy gamblers, bar owners and lethal, radioactive vermin. Wasteland introduced the options of restraint, or over-kill - depending on your mood and temperament. Do you carefully take a single shot at your target? Or burst fire of a trio of bullets? Or to hell with accuracy and lead count and simply rip through a magazine? Your ammo, your choice.A newcomer to Wasteland in 2014 will be woefully unimpressed. What's all the fuss about? It looks archaic has virtually no sound and the main storyline can be completed in a very short time span. But a quarter of a century ago, this game shattered the adventure genre apart and set a whole new level of benchmark. The highly influenced offspring of the Fallout games show plenty of direct lineage back to the original game. But none enthrall in quite the same way that Wasteland did.Even Steam refers to Wasteland 1 as 'The Original Classic'. For those lucky enough to have been around on its first release - that phrase sums it up perfectly.10 out of 10.			"

												NOTE: The nolstagia factor doesn't apply to me since I wasn't around during the 80's, nor did I own any kind of PC until the mid 2000's.tl;dr it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, what are you waiting for!?If you're like me and haven't been around for these types of RPGs (I was born 1998), then there's going to be a difficult learning curve ahead, but it's a game well worth learning.This game caters to my every need when it comes to that post-apocalyptic itch. Wasteland surprisingly has a good atmosphere and sometimes I can actually imagine the rangers fighting off hoardes of robots or leather jerks; I can really immerse myself in this game despite how ""dated"" it may be. You have a wide variety of skills and attributes to use at your disposal for any situation you may find yourself in, and this being an Interplay game, there are some weird spots you'll find yourself in. The variety / diversity helps make the world and your characters feel more immersive and more in-control. An example is at the bar in Quartz. You can hop onto a stage and get into a battle sequence, only to be forced to preform for the audience afterwards. So you have your charisma attribute and some skills like knife throw to entertain the audience before they let you back down, but if your skills are too low or if you're just unlucky, you're going to find yourself being pelted with tomatos and beer bottles.  I love the quirkiness of the game, it reminds me of the Fallout universe which is inspired by this game and also made by Interplay. The wastes are a strange place, with settlements ran by strange people, such as Faran Brygo. (obviously referencing Brian Fargo) You'll even find yourself dealing with the occult in this game, something having to do with an item called the ""bloodstaff"". I won't spoil anything though.Did I mention you can get Wasteland Herpes from a 3-legged hooker? The combat in this game is nothing special. It's simple and entertaining enough, but sometimes you find yourself running into encounter after encounter and it's so annoying. Also, if you don't memorize the keyboard shortcuts or put the macro creator to good use (ctrl+function), you're going to find yourself dealing with an annoying, clunky layout. Besides the minor annoyance, it won't be hard to learn. There's not really much to say about this game, it's a classic and rightfully so. I'm not a huge RPG guy but this is an RPG I find myself coming back to every now and again because of how much fun it is. It has an easy to follow story, atmopsheric enviornments, great music, great characters and dialogue, and that wasteland quirkiness we all know and love. I definitely recommend this game to anybody looking to play a great retro RPG, or anyone who's interested in the origin of Wasteland / Fallout.Also, if you haven't picked it up already, be glad it's $5.99 and not the $14.99 I spent when it was first released on steam... well, I'd say the $14.99 was well worth it.

												Classic CRPG, but I'm gonna warn anyone going in: we're talking a game from an era where you lost people permanently if they died, you need to know what to type into the text parser to get plot information at times, and there WILL be events that leave you going ""Wait, but I thought I just did that right, why did I have to shoot a boy and his dog"" (NO NOT THAT BOY AND HIS DOG IN A WASTELAND) because you didn't read a situation the same way as a developer dreamed it 30 years ago.That said? If you know what you're getting yourself into, Wasteland still holds the hell up and is full of its own crazy charm. I'D recommend turning off the new graphics, just because the vectorization filter it puts on everything drives me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but if you dig it, don't let me stop you. You've gotta remember: this is the game that the Fallouts were paying homage to when they were new. That should tell you all kinds of things about the world in question.Make sure someone learns Toaster Repair.			"

												The classic that started it all. This game brought rpg's from the dungeons to bombed-out cities and deserts. This was one of the first games to have memory and be able to save your progress, so when you made a change in the game world by killing someone or doing a mission it stayed that way! If you've never played this game I'll tell you about it. You're going to need imagination, like a lot of it. Because of limitations of Commador 64 this game relies on descriptive writing to give you a picture of whats happening in and out of combat. You'll need to when fighting with your party to find the right rhythm of attaking, dodging, and relaoding. Just like the first fallouts and most old rpg's, don't get to mad if a rat takes you down early on.Over all if you want to play this make sure you know what you're getting, this is 26 years old. Its basicly a table top rpg program. You'll need to imagine the acton if thats what you desire.p.s. Don't run right to Vegas			"

												While other rpgs of the era had you running around dungeons slaying rats and fighting generic evil wizards or abusing the limited memory of the game as you ransacked villages of innocent people only to leave and kill them all again, Wasteland was setting a new trend of making your choices count and forcing you to live with them. No clerics to raise your dead back to life, no instant magical healing and no one to hold your hand and tell you where to go. Wasteland had no qualms about letting you try to go where you please and if you could survive then by all means break the sequence and go exploring.The storyline may seem simple compared to gems that came a decade later, but it still stands up far better than most other rpgs of its era and indeed a good deal of the ones we've seen today. It was hard, it was unforgiving, it expected you to think and take your own notes and it was great, this is what rpgs were in the late 80s and it's defintely not for everyone especially if you've been raised on modern games the whole time you've been playing. But, if you're patient, if you can look beyond 16 color Enhanced Graphics Adapter art, if you can handle having to read things and keep track of information on your own, then maybe, just maybe you're cut out to be a Desert Ranger.

												Wasteland is a very old game, it comes from the days when having a mouse was a luxury, and having a 1 mb harddrive made you the coolest kid on the block. It has very little in terms of graphics, apart from the portraits there are no animations in the game. Don't get me wrong, it was par for the course at the time. But compared to it's spiritual successor Fallout and basically any modern game. Playing it today will make it apparent how dated the game is.While dated is a very strong word to throw at this game, if you've played a tabletop RPG in your lifetime and have an afternoon to kill Wasteland is a fairly engaging game. It portrays a post apocalyptic wasteland fairly well, and it has a lot of personality. Just bare in mind that it's not going to wow you, and you will have to print out a reference card and potentially the entire manual to properly understand the controls and storyline.			"

												I'm not sure if a game like this can still be appreciated in these modern days of fancy 3D graphics and short attention spans... but it damn well should be. For whatever my opinion may be worth, I hereby go on record to state that this is one of the greatest RPGs ever made. Of course, that bold statement does come with a couple of caveats: first, my thoughts may very well be colored by nostalgia to a fair degree; and second, I haven't actually played this game in over 20 years, so it's entirely possible I am just forgetting all the bad parts. At any rate, if you are into RPGs, classic games, or at all interested in revisiting the early days of PC gaming, this is one of the very few games that should be near the top of anyone's ""must-play someday"" list. While I can't guarantee playing this game will captivate and inspire you the same way it did for people back in the day, I am at least fairly confident that the game itself is probably fundamentally solid, even if the underlying technology and graphics don't hold up. So definitely give this a look if you're open to embracing ""the classics"", or if you're just an old man like me pining for the good old days.			"

I REMEMBER THIS FONDLYI used to love playing  this on my old Apple 2e. Me and my friends would huddle around the computer and play coop before it even existed. Each of us created unique characters inside of Ranger Station slamming on the SPACEBAR forever to roll up the best stats and get the best points. We essentially would play cooperatively on 1 computer where we would take turns actually using the computer. The player would type and move around, while the other people simply watched the game and spoke aloud what they wanted their characters to do. ""Attack, Burst, Leather Thug to the left"". ""Disband, move up."" This last statement our close combat character would literally say 100 times each session. It  was all part of the fun, and while it sounds  painful, it was actually a blast. We'd make our party consisting of a ""gun guy"", a ""brawler"", a ""doc"", and a ""nerd"".The gun guy we'd load up with gun skills like SMG and Assault Rifle (M1989A1 NATOs baby!) and AT Weapon, this guy was clutch for making sure he shot and actually hit stuff in the game, where even if you have a really good DEX stat you might not hit what you shoot unless you take the skill too.   The brawler would get pugilism and melee weapon skills (basically a tank in close quarter combat) and of course he'd get dibs on the Manglers and Clubs and stuff. Of course he never really relied only on melee and could take out some punks at a distance with a .45 or whatever. The doc is well, a medic with loads of Medic skill and a ridiculous INT stat, and the nerd was a well-rounded character that had a maximum INT but took skills that were not medic; forgery, metallurgy, lockpick, etc.  IT IS NOT EASYI can't tell you how many hours of my life I spent huddled in front of the glow of my color composite monitor swapping disks playing Wasteland. It is a brutally difficult game by todays standards with permadeth period. No options for ressurection unless you save your game ahead of time, when you die you're dead. Perhaps part of what made this game so compelling to me and my friends was that we actually had to focus, use our brains for team work, and have a strategy instead of just mindless button mashing like we were doing on our NESes with Rush'n'Attack, Rygar, and Ikari Warriors (among others). We would die often and we would regroup and rethink of our strategy. We would pick better skills learn more about the attributes and when they played a role and for what and this whole time we were actually having a boatload of fun. I can remember TPD (total party death) once we reached Las Vegas ♥♥♥♥♥♥I remember this happening in Quartz too, the game is freaking hard and the deck is definitely not stacked in your favor) as we got shredded to pieces by a cyborg with energy weapons (up until then we didn't even know energy weapons existed). It took hours to rebuild, start over, and level up to be strong enough to get back to Las Vegas and actually take those bots down.  AND WE CHEATEDWe used to build 4 characters in Ranger Station, only 1 of which would we actually try to make decent. This character was the ""courier"" he would be escorting the cannon fodder other 3 characters straight to Quartz, where they would sell EVERY piece of gear they owned, then he'd Pool the money and walk them back to Range Station, and we'd delete them. Do this 100 - 300 times, and you can amass an enormous cache of weapons, armor, money, etc. Then when  you have your loot and gear all sorted, you build 3 other characters and you give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about them too. After those 3, we would give the couriers♥♥♥♥♥♥to another remaning character either kill the courier to create a better character, or sometimes we'd just keep him. We used macros to automate most of this. In essence, this is cheating against the spirit of the game, but it was ♥♥♥♥ing  hard and we were young and thought we were clever. I can tell you even then it wasn't always easy after. Yes we might have SMG's and NATO Assault rifles with boatloads of clips and TNT and Kevlar armor, but we still got our asses handed to us in Vegas.  WE NEVER BEAT ITWe got ver close to beating the game, but we could never find the Sleeper Base to make it to space.  IT IS OLD THOUGH...I know, right? It' s pretty old, and it doesn't age super well. If you didn't grow up playing this game you might hate it. If you can get past the old-ness of the game, the graphics even with this re-release are not great, the SA antialiasing helps, but I kinda like the crunchy pixels better. The music and the voice overs are pretty awesome in this version; we had a paragraph book we'd use to read from (which doubled as a form of copy protection).   If you like oldschool RPGs that are top-down (like Ultima, or 2400AD) and you are ready to commit to actually trying to win (if that's your thing) and don't mind getting your♥♥♥♥♥whipped until you learn some tricks and techniques, this game will reward you.  There is a lot of game in ths small package, and there is a lot of personality and character that this game had that no other game did. EA innovated on many fronts with Wasteland, and not just in the computer but the paragraphs really added a ton of story and immersion to the game that other RPGs of the time lacked sorely. It was like living in the best ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" (don't get be started about how awesome those books were in my childhood) computer game ever made.   THIS WAS WHAT STARTED THE FALLOUT(s)If you're a fan of Fallout at all, you will probably like this game. It takes time and dedication, but this is the precursor to all the others. For that reason alone you should check it out, but the game has tons of merit as well, and the re-release really does try to polish an old title to a more modern standard. I think it does a pretty good job, but I had some issues getting the mouse to work. The keyboard is the way to go and it works no problem.  GIVE IT A SHOT I RECOMMEND ITYou needed an imagination in the old days, and you still need it today, but the voice overs really do help make this game a lot better than it was. The music is OK too. Is it going to blow your mind? Probably not. Is it going to keep you coming back, maybe. Is it going to make you work for the reward of the story? Without a doubt.  Wasteland is one of my favorite games and I highly recommend it.			"

Go to steamapps\common\Wasteland\Extras and read the PDFs - at least the wasteland-hintbook.pdfI beat this 20 years ago. Even with that this is an amazing amount of content that took 4-5 years to create. It'll be a 60 hour game.There's a crapload of amazing value here, but only if you can manage the old-style UI.

												Wasteland is a product of its own time - low-res graphics, clumsy user interface, and a habit of not exactly telling you how to accomplish things like, say, giving the Visa card to Head Crusher (the game wants you to use one member of your party and put the Visa card on the seat you were previously sitting in opposite of Head Crusher, rather than, say, walking up to him and giving it to him directly). This was fine back in the day. This is because that game was released in the era of computing known as The Bad Old Days, where you had to manually configure your PCI/ISA cards to avoid IRQ conflicts, where you had to make DOS Bootdisks to free up enough memory just to get the damn video game running, where you could write a little graphical menu in DOS where you could park the heads of your incredibly expensive 10 MB hard drive. You know, just in case the FBI comes around to ask you why you've been pirating so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ software to the rest of your Warez buddies on the BBS networks. Computer users had to put up with a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥just to get games like Wasteland running, and so games like these were walks in the park compared to knowing the exact DOS commands to Telnet into the Matrix or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that.This version of the game runs entirely in a custom emulation environment. It includes a custom soundtrack written by a fan which is pretty cool. The game also allows you to read the paragraphs inside the game (complete with voice overs) when it asks you to read paragraph 38 or another random arbitrary number. The storytelling is pretty good. Other than that, it's pretty much just like the old PC version, which is as accessible to new players as noise music is to regular people. It will definitely make the old, bearded crowd sigh and reminisce about The Bad Old Days.I recommend you give this about five hours, read a summary and the paragraph book, and then wait for Wasteland 2 to finish up.

												“A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”Even by today’s standards Wasteland remains a very good turn-based RPG with a balanced mix of combat and quest related problem-solving. It has a non-linear design, customizable character statistics and skills and multiple puzzle solutions. Especially the last point gives you the chance to advance with a variety of tactics. You can open closed door with the lockpicking ability, or you use the climb skill, or force it open with a crowbar or blow it up with a rocket launcher. Your group starts with four people and can be extended to seven members by recruiting certain civilians and creatures. And you should do it as fast as possible, because this game has a high and sometimes unforgiving difficulty level.Most people will be discouraged by the outdated graphics and initially rough gameplay. But if you are willing to give this game a chance, you will experience a classic role-playing game with all its charms and challenges.Fun fact: Wasteland’s general concept and setting became the basis for Interplay’s RPG series Fallout.--My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere-	Combat & Controls-	Details -	Tactical gameplay-	Characters-	StoryBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: A-RankCombat & Controls: B-RankDetails: A-RankTactical gameplay: S-Rank(Dummy!

												Nostalgic game.  Great job trying to modernize elements without changing gameplay.  Unfortunately the game is brutally hard, and gameplay is a little dated.  Most folks that will enjoy this game will have played it originally on C64/Dos when it was originally released in 1987.  For folks who are playing it because they are interested in the predesessor to Wasteland 2 or the inspiration for Fallout might be disappointed.To improve your enjoyment of the game, don't expect super high graphics or controls on a 30 year old game.  Be sure to 'Read' the paragraph's from the game, that is where all the story is embedded.  The paragraph's also have the passwords and hints for what to do.  For the most part folks should hit the areas in this order to keep from being overwhelmed:- Highpool- AG Station- Mine- Quartz- Needles- Vegas- Darwin Base- Citadel - Savage Villiage  "

												If you're playing this for nostalgia or whatever you're gonna like it no matter what I write in this box. For the rest of you, read on.This game has aged very poorly, but not like most games. The (non-remastered) graphics, sound, and interface all held up fairly well, though they definitely feel old-school. There's a certain charm that comes with that. No, the problem lies with the mechanics.There are a lot things in this game that game developers have since learned are Bad Ideas and we just don't do anymore. Things like rolling character stats, dead stats, no descriptions of skills except in a separate manual that the steam version doesn't come with, obscure combat rules, no item/weapon descriptions or stats, manually using skills like 'perception' - and this is all just what I encountered in the first ten minutes.It might not be fair to judge a 1988 game by 2016 standards, but I can't do it any other way. I'm not interested in being an impartial judge of what is or was contemporaneously a good game. I'm interested in telling you whether or not a game is worth buying and playing. Wasteland 1 is not fun to play and I do not recommend it.			"

												A million years ago I was playing this classic on my 8086 before Steam, before the Internet, before 16 color graphics cards, before Fallout. I would spend hours and hours playing this game, it's the first game that I know of where you build an android, clone yourself and all around blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up or talk your way through. If you don't have a tolerance for older graphics that make your eyes feel like someone is pouring hot lava on them or you can't stand antiquated interfaces then I would say you should play this game any way. It'll toughen you up.			"

												A classic that led to the creation of Fallout.  While primitive by younger audience standards, this was the first game to offer you free reign in an RPG, allowing you to make mistakes and having those mistakes alter the game and the characters within it.  This game still sits above my desk, the original box and manuals (dog-eared and badly torn from use) as a testament to it's well-deserved place as one of the best games ever made.			"

												A seminal game for me back in the day.  I was a whippersnapper, had all my hair and a disk drive for my C64.  To be honest I was pretty crap at the game, I never did finish it, but it did not matter; I loved it.  I imagined every trigger pull, every smoking shell case falling to the dirty floor (though imagining a fight with armoured fluffy bunnies took some doing some times).  The game has aged but it is still fit for purpose.  And no longer must I endure the dread of one of the C64 disks crapping out on me.Highly recommended. "

												Once upon a time, long before Nintendo and Sony, when the ""PC Master race"" was still in it's larval stage, there was The Bard's Tale. There were no 3D graphics cards, or surround sound features. There was just a glorified text adventure with a few pixels of color to give you an idea where you were, what you were doing, and what that giant robotic scorpion that just destroyed your entire group 'sort of' looked like.Computer games were more tabletop than arcade - the best parts of them took place entirely in your own imagination. When Wasteland appeared, it was from another world. No wizards and swords and dragons. There were guns, goth chicks who spit on the ground, and horribly demented bad guys named after Donald Duck's nephews. The game only gave you 10 words to describe each and every one of them, but in the world of the imagination, they were tough, gritty, and completely bad♥♥♥♥♥Technology and the capacity of the human mind to always make things better than they once were has left this classic behind - to the degree that it is now sustained purely by nostalgia than actual contribution. To speak of Wasteland to today's League of Legend's addicts is to listen to the haunting tails of the first appearance of the motorcar, whose alarmly breakneck speed of 10 MPH was fueled by the doomed souls of hell hosted sinners.So I do recommend this game - but only if you approach it as an automated, self-mastered table top RPG. You will be given brief snippets of data, and your imagination will be expected to fill in the gaps. Essentially, this game is only as amazing as you are willing to make it.			"

												Well... Wasteland 1. For a game that came out in 1988, this sure has some things going for it. For one, it's the godfather of the Fallout games... but don't let that fool you. First of all, this came out 9 years before Fallout 1, and it shows. Graphics quality is low, of course, and combat is the type of turn based Pokemon had in the first generation, but instead of showing you and your enemy, it just shows a profile of what you enemy supposedly looks like, just to show you something other than text. Second of all, the differences in Fallout and Wasteland are very obvious, story-wise. I'm not going to go into details here, but the apocalypse in Wasteland happened in the late 90's. The 1990's that is. So yeah, that's just some perspective. Overall... most parts of this game have not aged... well. They haven't aged badly, per se, but they have aged. Graphics quality is low, as you should expect from a game in the late 80's. The combat is, as I said above... iffy. The story, however, is great. The writing is also great. But then, comedy and satire always age relatively well.For me, having not played this when I was younger like most people who will buy this game (people born in the 80's, or earlier I mean), and only having messed around with it in DOSbox (not a very... shall we say, fun situation), I think it's done well enough over the years for me to say that this is still a good game. The addition of the paragraphs and voice over also make this game so much easier to experience than in DOSbox, seeing how most people don't actually have copies of the original Paragraph booklet anymore.But yeah. I'm going to say this game is still fun, almost 30 years later, and reccomend it to everyone who wants a taste of what Fallout was before it was Fallout and/or want to experience an old game with some new updates.

												Wasteland IS a classic. Unfortunately, the version available on Steam is the wrong one. I can't say for sure since I never played the IBM version, but I believe that is the version being bundled with Wasteland 2. Take it from me, the IBM versions of games that were published in the '80's were the WORST available. (Games then were published in 3 PC formats-- IBM, Apple, and Commodore. The IBM PC had the worst graphics, and thus the inferior games.) I played WASTELAND for probably hundreds of hours on the Commodore, and I loved it. But I can't stand the version available here.			"

C=64 version was better.. but harder to port to x86, so they are excused. The good: works on my machine without installing any extra stuff!!!!!The Bad: there's a soundtrack now?! the opening animation isn't there.. a couple other things that are also just nitpicks.  "

												::UPDATE: I have found out that you must use your keyboard when assembling Max the android, in the Vegas sewers. Hopefully this saves one person from grief... This is a fantastic game and should be played by everyone that has dedicated gaming to their PC, it is an experiance and made me buy an actual boxed copy of Wasteland. Bugs and all, it is so awesome. My tip for those who are new is to play with a guide, just to make sure you dont run into any game breaking bugs! Thanks for reading!::Wasteland! I have amazing memories playing this with my dad back when I was just a child; creating our characters with our names and different skills and tools, to help us survive the Mojave and Arizona deserts. It is so great to be able to experiance it again as an adult, and actually be able to appreciate what it has done for today's day and age of gaming for western RPG's. It helped spawn an amazing post-apocalyptic genre for everyone to enjoy, one of the first (I'm pretty sure) to come out with a persistant world that changes with you and your choices (and this is all in 1988!) While I have my nostalgia fix on the review, I will be honest with it also.This. Game. Is. ♥♥♥♥ing. Buggy.I had a game breaking bug. It really sucked to. It was underneath the sewers in Vegas. To advance the story and get a key item and location to be revealed on a map, you have to build a robot. The tables you build it on, for whatever reason, decides to not respond to my characters  actions when trying to put items on it. Twenty hours into my adventure and I'm stuck, against my own ♥♥♥♥ing will, because of a dumbass un-built robot. Underneath Vegas, in the ♥♥♥♥ing sewers. ♥♥♥♥ that. And ♥♥♥♥ this awesome game. There are others bugs in it as well, like the engine it is built on being extremely easy to exploit enemies on. The ""Super Loot Bag"" trick that I refuse to use. But besides this, I can't personally say there is anything else wrong with it. People will obviously state that the graphics haven't ""aged"" well, and to that I would say that they are an idiot because this was made in 1988. Don't play a game, that is dated to begin with, and try and compare it to something newly released or released in that particular's game next decade. Play this game. Bugs and all. It is a peice of gaming history. But ♥♥♥♥ you Max, the un-built robot. I'm glad those cyborgs tore your ♥♥♥♥ing body apart and used your spare parts on themselves. I wasted 20 damn hours :(			"

												Probably the best PC RPG ever made. We completely owe the existance of every Fallout game and any dystopian RPG made after it. The game is a masterpiece and truly mindblowing to think that a game of this scale and depth was made in 1988, when computer could just about manage your basic text editor and 64 colour graphics. It might look and play absolutely terribly by todays standards, not letting you see your battles or encounters ther than a few onscreen messages and looking completely like a game of it's era, with very hefty pixels and almost laughable character design, but, the game is one of it's kind, offering something that was unheard of in 1988, an RPG, that was set on earth, with humans, in a dystopian futuristic wasteland of a 21st century gone bad. This game was basically the precurssor to the first 2 Fallout games, and it shows, in terms of overall design and gameplay, they're nearly identical, albeit, a bit more pixelated. It's really the kinda game you damn well need to look for the PDF of the manual that comes with the game, find the nearest printer, and print off into a small book and find the nearest walkthrough, or else you're going to be in for a bad time. It's almost impossible to understand just what the hell is going on. Wasteland is also probably the hardest game on Steam (yes, the entirety of Steam, I've never come across a game so frustratingly difficult, almost insulting at times as it's possible to get killed amost as soon as you enter a new area), but aside from that, Wasteland is a great game and is by far the best game of the 1980's. It really is one of the few games (the others being XCOM/UFO and in FPS terms, DOOM) that took games into places never thought possible, replacing tired, arcade mechanics with rich, deep storylines and immersive gameplay. It's the kind of game that you have to be in a 1988 mindset to even play, as I'm sure the majority of people will buy it on a Steam sale and play it for 30 minutes before abandoning it, but that would be doing it an injustice. Pick up this game, it's a masterpiece, albiet, a 1988 masterpiece.			"

												Old.  Old and terribly difficult.  Old, terribly difficult and yet beautiful in its own way.It was interesting going back and playing through this game to see just how much more difficult games used to be.  I loved it when it was state of the art, but I never did finish it.  I think I got into the sleeper base in the Apple IIc days, and assumed my inability to complete it then was due some bug (naturally).I played through the game in full this time around and enjoyed the story beginning to end.  Also, I'm pretty sure my prior inability to complete it had more to do with only skimming the flavor text than with any sort of bug.It's most definiately not for everyone.  It isn't even for the average person who enjoys playing old, chunky UI games from their childhood.  It just *might* by for such a person who also happens to be playing it as a follow-up or aside to Wasteland 2, however.			"

												The classic game Marathon is to Halo what Wasteland is to Fallout, or Commander Keen to Doom. Ok, maybe not so much on the last one, but Wasteland is THE game that spawned Fallout, i.e. both created by Mr Brian Fargo. Wasteland is a must-have for any gamer who enjoys Fallout or retro classics in general. BTW, the music in this version is a later add-on, and is the same music used for Fallout 1  and 2, and includes some western-themed music that has a guitar track that goes like this: ""perrrr..........per-doo-per-per-perreeerrerrrerrrerrr"" Fair warning, this guitar sound in this game (and in fallout) will get in your head late at night or any time you have an Old West Showdown, which for me is about monthly.Now port this to android and then I will REALLY poop my pants with glee.

												So, you may ask, how can you write a recommendation for a game you have 0.1 hours experience with?  Well, I'll tell you, because in the days before Steam where gamer stats were tracked to the tiniest data point, I played Wasteland more hours than I kept track of.  Yes, back in the days of yore with the Apple 2e and the Commodore 64.This is an old school game.  Save scumming was difficult, the graphics were servicable at best but the story was as immerisive and in depth as could be imagined.  For example, Michael Stackpole cut his creative teeth on this game.  Let that sink in for a second.   Michael F#|<ing Stackpole, the guy who went on to write novels and such?  Yea him, he was involved in the ground floor of post apocalyptic fiction.  This game spawned more genres and tropes than most of us have been lucky enough to experience much less influence.  If you can look past the almost complete lack of ""graphics"" and focus instead on the story and mechanics behind it you'll discover something amazing.  Your mind may even explode like a blood sausage.  But trust me, that's a good thing.			"

You could also consult wasteland.wikia.com for additional help. A particularly useful section is the weapons section, which covers weapon damage and other details that aren't available in game.http://wasteland.wikia.com/wiki/Wasteland_weaponsOnce you understand the control scheme and what options you have the game is solid, and still holds up today.The game is difficult and doesn't hold your hand.

I decided to keep the preset characters as it was 2 in the AM and I felt it unnecessary to make my own.So, start it up. I'm on the world map. I click ONCE on my Laptop's touchpad, but the game mistook it for being clicked 1,000 times. So, it took me 1,000 paces... Straight into a Radiation Field and I die.It's been less than 5 seconds.10/10 Will play this obsolete game and beat it when I figure this game out.			"

This game still retains its charm...sure the graphics aren't the best (what do you expect, it's from 1988), but the gameplay is just as amazing as I remember it.  Pick this game up...it is WELL worth the money spent.  It makes me incredibly anxious for Wasteland 2 (of which I'll be an NPC in).			"

												This game set the archetype for games where the player wandered off in the wrong direction, stumbled upon a random wandering nasty thing, and was instantly atomized when the thing looked at them cross-eyed.It is brutal and unforgiving compared to most games where a single player character moves off in an epic quest - and never encounters anything that poses too much of a problem.Tips:#1) Always move with the heavy stuff equipped. Your melee and fisty specialists can waste a round switching to fists if it turns out that you encountered Bambi instead of Vanadium Vultures.#2) Always hide and rest up, even if you are *only* at 90% health - yes, it makes a difference.#3) Try to wander around and find simple things to do before going into a known encounter.I'm giving thumbs up because there are a few fun things to do, like the PROTON AXE! But mostly because I played the game long enough to be hypnotized by it. I can't tell you how many times I reloaded saves because I died in the DOS original.			"

												So the original wasteland, was an amazing game in its day.  A true pioneer in the world of rpg.  This along with Bards tale really stand out to me from the 80's world of coputer gaming.Nostlaga aside.  If you are someone who cares about gameplay or graphics this is not the game for you.   It's from 1988 with newer music added.   Gaming has come a long way and the only real reason to play this today is to escape back to a time in your earlier days.  I loved this game and glad it's in my library but if it was a new game to me and something I didn't know from my way past I'd be highly disappointed.  Recommendation:  Buy only if and when it goes on sale or buy for simply nostalga reasons			"

												Tried it but stopped after 15 minutes. :D I get that for rpg-game veterans this is awesome nostalgia trip and all. Well I did play games back when C64 was the hype. Even before that when pong was the best thing there was. Done some text games as well and did enjoy them back when they were the best thing there was. Today games this old just don't appeal to me anymore. If I wanna use only my imagination for visuals I read a book. Fallout 1 barely gets over that bar of old games I bare to play.Do I recommend or not? Well if you never played games like these you should give it a go. Just to see how far games have evolved. Specially if you're of the younger gamer generation for whom really old gaming is Playstation 2 or even PS1. Definitely try it. This game is brilliant piece of gaming history after all. :)If you are like me who was a kid back when this game was new and played games then. Well..sure why not. I wouldn't buy it if you didn't get this with WL2 though. Rather spend your scraps on some cheap dlc or some other game -or not. :)			"

												Wasteland, by todays standards, is brutally hard, has a terrible interface, and graphics that are minimal at best. If you can get past that, you will find one of the most acclaimed computer RPGs of all time. Fallout was for me a pale immitation of this darkly humorous masterpiece. Of course, I've used the Scorpitron from the game for my avatar since joining Steam, so my bias is pretty clear. But such was the impact of this game for me.			"

												It's an oldie but, a goodie. It takes some learning and, getting used to. It hasn't aged well. Also, if you like the older fallouts I recomend Wasteland. It's also by the same devs as Fo1, Fo2, and Fo tactics.			"

												Wasteland, by todays standards, is brutally hard, has a terrible interface, and graphics that are minimal at best. If you can get past that, you will find one of the most acclaimed computer RPGs of all time. Fallout was for me a pale immitation of this darkly humorous masterpiece. Of course, I've used the Scorpitron from the game for my avatar since joining Steam, so my bias is pretty clear. But such was the impact of this game for me.			"

												For someone who loves the new Fallout 3, this game surpasses it in every way except the graphics. The game gets even crazier, events are wierder and more out there, the atmosphere of ""war never changes"" is multiplied X 3! I hate 80s pc rpg's, but I love this one. At first it may seem difficult, but as you learn to play, you learn to get emersed even more the Fallout 3 or NV ever did!			"

												I'll update this review when I get further in the game (which looks like a difficult task), but so far I can say this:The interface is _not bad_. It's archaic, but if you leave the settings at the defaults, and then remember to press they key that corresponds to the first letter in the line you want to select, it's fine!It's _fine_. It's _brutal_ and you need to use your imagination.I suppose if you don't have good touch-typing skills, it might be hard, because the mouse is picky as to where you can click.			"

												This is the game that the Fallout games got their inspiration from.  It is very similar in gameplay to Fallout 1 and 2.  The graphics are obviously dated but you won't care.  Create a party of four desert rangers and go into the wasteland.  You advance skills by either use or buying points after promtion. There is plenty of dark humor.  There is one thing I feel I must warn you about and that is the limited inventory space.  If you drop something it is gone forever.  Learn from my mistakes and never drop a key card or something that you don't know the use for.  You will eventually need it.If you liked Fallout you will like this.  I have it in my top 10 games that I actually finished list.  For those who don't know me if I finish a game it is my highest form of praise.			"

												wasteland is one of my favorite RPGS way better than any fallout game instead of controlling one person you have a group and instead of the ridiculous futuristic 1950s setting wasteland is a normal modern setting way more realistic than fallout character creaction is great you can make your party members male or female you can make them american chinese mexican indian etc you can name them plus there are many different stats and skills the customization is endless the exploration is great the wasteland is free to explore with many different settlements and locations and different paths to take on quests the replay value is endless the graphics are dated and the game is mostly text the game was made in the 80s but the gameplay is great and is better than most current AAA games overall wasteland is a gaming masterpeice that every RPG gamer should play also wasteland 2 is the sequal to this game and i highly reccomend wasteland 2 as well 5 stars			"

												Dated af. I got it for free with Wasteland 2, and as a fan of Fallout 2 I could still enjoy gameplay, combat, locations, and all the stuff the game had to offer. The RPG system was cool, and the character creation gives a cool style that almost has this game revolve around ironman rather than spamming load-save. Locations weren't polished, but had effort and style that was really nice. All of that was great, and I can't insult anything the game was *intended* to be. Now, the game-breaker here is the bug problem this game has. The most notable one, one I dealt with >:(, is that the game autosaves when you buy stuff, and if you don't save afterward you can't trade with the merchant anymore. Now, this isn't a problem early-game, but when you get to Quartz and Needles your entire gamesave is screwed because you can't trade and get really important items. Along with this, you have buggy scripted events that happen that also screw up a lot of things, perks and skills not working, and so many other things that just make it unplayable. Kind of frustrating having to repeat the game because of poorly made mechanics and bugs, and it happens a *lot*. If you can find a guide to fix all that, be my guest and get it, but otherwise don't get it.			"

												Every comment is either: thumbs up nostalgia etc, or , today it sucks cant play it thumbs down and so on.(TL;DR: I like the game itself but wouldnt recommend it to other people.)The problem is more that the game is more experimental than balanced. This doesnt mean that it is bad, but ends in many clueless approaches into the game and frustrational situations. I kinda like the game itself, many aspects of it, but wouldnt recommend it to other people.The hud is very awful, the 4 given characters are very awfully skilled and there is no mission briefing or something like that so you start infront of the HQ. Anyways you should just create your own party, but the problem is that you wether not know how to use many of the skills, or when you can use them(and how useful they are) Example: there is an abillity called combat shooting, that, you probably think lets you get better with all weapons in general at battles? Well no, that one has no porpuse at all. Really annoying is that many abillitys just got like 1-2 uses in the whole game.Some things i like are stuff like, either breaking doors with strength, or lockpicking it with the skill. The character creating is damn annoying because you have to roll all your stats in one go, problem is that if you want to do an brute like person, that has much strength and life. But they random all of the stats at the same time, so it could take much time to get in both stats much points. The price itself for a port like this is well, okay.. The game works on my pc(windows 7) without any problems.Minimizing the game then coming back doesnt really work for me. There are many people complaining about bugs with the client or newer systems, but i didnt encounter any of them yet( i have windows 7). Also the music added is fantastic, and gives you an awesome atmosphere. It is an experementing game, quite unique and fun to look into, but playing trough is a little torture , either you trail and error and waste tons of hours(not much fun) or looking into the wiki to know what skill actually do etc(also after some time not very fun). After many approaches iunderstood most of the basic features and then i could actually do something proper, even tough i couldnt make it(wasnt patient enough) without a walktrough or atleast help at some areas. If you can oversee that and like to have an open world that lets you do what you want, but still have somewhat a story, the game is yours. Otherwise its a waste of money.(sorry for the pun). For me it was a fun game, and also good to see how wasteland 2 changed, since it scrapped many of the experementing parts(like having skills like mining, simming or climbing etc), but replaced them with very good and mostly balanced elements.With the (gamebreaking) bugs and unbalanced gameplay i would give it a 5/10 since the story, freedom and atmosphere(with the added sountrack) made the game really unqiue.

												No, I can't recommend it. I'm sure it's a good old classic game, which deserves love and respect for its accomplishments, genre creation and the inspiration it gave to other more known games. I couldn't play this game when it first came out, because I was a toddler and by the time I was old enough, the game was already outdated and I had Fallout. I tried to play it now, but it's very difficult to play an old game without the nostalgia glasses on.

I'd recommend this for nalstagic people, people who collect all the games in a series, and incredibly bored people with nothing else to do. I say this cause looking at reveiws. If you played it in the day, you still love it. However if you're new to it, well you seem to not like it, and clearly I didn't play in the day.			"

												You know, I'd never heard of the Wasteland series until I found it here on Steam. Looking into its background on Wikipedia and old game reviews got me really excited to play this classic rpg. HOLY CRAP. What a rude awakening it was for me to take all my modern game expectations and apply them to a game that was made in the early years of gaming! The game menus are archaic and unintuitive. There is absolutely no direction given, there's no cutscenes, no animation, none of the modern conveniences in other turn based games (equipment comparison tools, popup help menus, etc). The art is horrendus by today's standards, making the overland map all but useless as you try to determine the difference between a brown block and a green block. I tried to push through it, keep an open mind and try to relive the glory that so many other older gamers seemed to have enjoyed while playing this title... but I am just too privileged to live in a time where video games have become a thousand fold more user friendly and a million times more beautiful! I am just not disciplined, nor inclined enough to continue trudging through this apparently famous title. This is no doubt a direct result of being born of the Cursed Millennial Generation. My shame must rightly last forever...			"

Wasteland is a classic post-nuclear adventure game originally released in 1988.Pros: ToastersCons: Graphics, Sound, Controls, GameplayToasters!  If that means anything to you at all, then you have no need for this review.  For everyone else...Wasteland is a classic that provided the foundation for not only the Fallout series, but for more open-ended, realistic gameplay.  However, the graphics are terrible: a block man on a map, pictures of robots, useless UI flair.  The sound is terrible: a small bit of music, nothing for everything else.  Controls are terrible: tons of menus, a few hotkeys, not enough macros. The gameplay is terrible: literally useless skills, little reason not to kill everyone, 30 matches takes as much space as 30 assault rifles.Wasteland is a great game for anyone with the nostalgia or appreciation.  However, the latter is lacking among most, so the game cannot be recommended.9/10			"

While Fargo deserves credit for sparking a sub-genre he also deserves a slap for not being able to eliminate all the very bad design-flaws in Wasteland, in the sequel.			"

												I'm sure at one time this was a game. now this is a joke. seriously, some things are best left in the past.Wasteland is propped up to be the 1st to the post apoc genre and said to have been the precursor and inspiration to fallout. Sure, I can see that, but fallout is a type of game that takes a genre and defines it. This game just happened to be first. Sometimes being first to the genre doesn't mean you're the best... In 2014, however this game is literally a joke. It can't be played easily, crashes a lot, and the story is about as bad as you can imagine, but hey it was the 80s, and the 80s sucked. This is no exception. You get the same rehashed descriptions on most things, strange technicolor graphics, confusing UI, no AI, this game should have been designated KIA and never revived. Do not buy this game, do not waste your money as it comes in Wasteland 2 for free... and that's even a raw deal because WL2 is buggy with a strange UI and a lot of text. It's basically a novel on strings. Now let the wasteland fanboys down vote this so they can sleep at night, despite even them knowing this game sucks.			"

The skill system was the first of its kind I had encountered, one that grants experience for using skills, including passive checks you never know are happening, allowing the skill to earn exp and level on its own as well as giving you a small bonus for leveling up.  If you like post apoc settings, give this game a try.			"

												This game is the forefather of so many Roleplaying games.  Without this game, there is no Fallout, no System Shock, no Bard's Tale, no and by that measure no Elder Scrolls, or Fallout 4, or Bioshock, and the list really does go on.  There were so many things that were attempted by this game before the technology was available.  The storytelling is incredible, the humor is first rate, and you will get frustrated by the game as it isn't easy.  I spend more time than I can count on the game as a kid, and replayed it recently and it still has kept its edge even now.  Worth every penny to go back in time and enjoy this all time classic!			"

												Still a classic; still one of the best isometric RPGs ever made. Great story, great characters and locations, all mixed with some dark post-nuke humor.If you haven't played it, you owe it to yourself to do so!			"

												I'm sure this was good for its time, but it was so difficult to get into in this day and age. Had to skip and go straight to Wasteland 2. Even though I am giving this a thumbs down, that's not to say there wouldn't be someone who may enjoy it. I think the story may be helpful in understanding some of Wasteland 2, but not necessarily required.(for the record, I was attempting to review Wasteland 2 instead, but it was not giving me the ability to write a review, but rather just recommending games for me.)

												Truely a gem! You'll need to get used to an interface which is 30 years old (piece of cake, if you ask me), and you should know where RPGs came from. If this sounds uncomfortable, avoid this game! If not, give it a try.			"

												In my first review, I realize I was a bit too hard on this game for what little time I actually put into the game. But... After putting some more time into the game and getting to know the gameplay mechanics... I realized something... This game really didn't deserve the bashing I gave it earlier.Combat is fun, although... I swear, the bunny enemies you encounter early on in the game HAVE to be a reference to be a reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. If so... well-played, InXile. I can definitely see how this game was the precursor to Fallout with its style and everything.Plus... Being able to divide loot amongst your party was a really cool idea. The first set of loot I got in the first town, I gave my party leader the Leather Jacket and the pistol her group found and the cash. Overall, my personal rating in this revisiting is an 8.5 out of 10.			"

												(wonder why it takes forever for reviews to appear)First and foremost. This is a Classic, I even enjoyed it once I got past the ""everyone dies far too often stage"".  Would I recommend it for any other purpose than ""you should have played it""? No, it's an utter nightmare to play and that issue stands even more now than back in 1988. So Recommend Yes/No gets a 51% thumbs up ;)If you still think you should suffer through it, I'll explain my comment. With proper guidance you can enjoy it (and without you will probably play it 2-3 times longer than required).I played through every RPG I could gethold of back in the CMB64/early PC days and finished almost all. I would like to say all the Ultimas, Bard's tales, AD&D etc were completed but Wasteland... it was the first RPG I even gave up on.  Followed by Ultima IX because it was a buggy action adenture with millimeter movement and Ultima Underworlds because for some reason they bored me to death.So what was wrong with Wasteland? Spoilers warning, although very minimal!Insanely difficult without extra help. No internet and a 300baud modem wasn't worth enough. So I died from radiation, heat exhaustion, not enough safe places to rest, certainly never had enough Medics (or managed to walk to Doctors in time), always run out of ammo and finally tossed the entire♥♥♥♥♥♥game when I met the Scorpitron (the Vegas nightmare if I remembered the name wrong :) ).This time I almost tossed it out after beating bunnies forever right at the beginning. But I figured I will do it with a walkthrough and minimize time spent suffering. And I'm glad I did, the story is great and once you get to doctor stages and finally some decent armour it's almost fun.But I STILL suffered. After 33h of play to complete it I will list some of the noticeable annoyances. Veterans will laugh at some and hopefully not nod at the last one.Oh, and I'm a packrat. So I almost hauled every knife to a shop (ok, not in THIS game). That explains why it took so long. Oh, and my characters never die, EVER. Except in this game, good riddance.The horrors:1) Save and save often (and take backups of your saves). I didn't actually have to revertto saves all that often (except with the Scorpitron and on more place I cannot remember)  After hitting a mine twice in two moves in Vegas and losing Ace and not realizing it before saving the next time I considered going back a few hours in saves but naaaah. 2) Not enough ammo, ever. Yes, I actually run out of 7.62 clips around Vegas so I had to chainsaw a while. My own fault, packrat and not wanting to switch weapons styles according to ammo.3) Half working macros. Well, without macros I would never EVER have played through this nightmare. Unfortunatley they had some cutting off limit so with 7 characters the last character had to evade to get proper A1S etc combos for the first 6. Only 1 single character left at that point :(4) You can apparently drop crucial items and the game become impossible to complete. There were a few items I could never find again even though I always sold stuff to be sure. The Darwin upper shop closed forever at some point though so maybe my stuff was there. 5) At the end I needed two plasma couplers and there was only one in Cochise. The walkthrough said there should be one more on robots outside but never found one. I actually had to GRIND my characters up two levels to get 3 skill points into IQ and get Toaster repair. If I would have ended up with unplayable at that stage I would have tossed the damn thing or tried to hack items. Seriously, sheeeesh.6) And the biggie. Finishing off the game at 1 am (yes, it was good enough for a 2-3 last late run)... and I apparently made it unfinisable and had to revert to a save 2h earlier (famous words: ""not much left, just do it""). Why? When doing the last cylinder the game popped up some message and I hit space (being tired and all). After which I was locked away in a small room and that was it. I pretty much always played with a full party as I just wanted to finish the damn thing off. So the final solution was a really NASTY one. In 1988 without help and no disk scumming saves I think I would have forced the disk down Fargo's throath at that point.Ok, there you have it, suffer if you want but I really recommend a walkthrough because the game is so aged suffering just because of the good story simply isn't worth it. And one mistake 10h before the finish might leavy you hanging if you happen to drop something crucial by mistake.Veterans hopefully had a blast reading this. Ithink you all really recommend this because you want everyone else to suffer as you did...? :D			"
