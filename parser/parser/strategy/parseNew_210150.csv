												This game is simply terrible in every way possible. I first bought this game about a year ago and got bored after 5 miutes. The choices you make mean nothing and its more like watching a set of events planned out before you even load the game. I thought id give this another crack with updates being made and now the game crashes every time i try to play it.0/10 complete waste of money.			"

												This game was practically free and I still feel like I was robbed. The screenshots are not even remotely relevent to the game play. the last F1 management game I bought was back in the mid 1990s and I would say it was vastly superior to this in every way so avoid it at all costs.			"

												I got it when it was on sale by 90%. The game is a piece of cake. I won my first race by tuning the handling and acceleration with a 3 star team in addition to buying all the top notch supplies.The game can be a challenge if you handicap yourself, but otherwise, not really. It only gets easier and easier as you get sponsors, and as long as you win races, you can replace your parts very easily. Some parts get worn out to 50% after one race, but they cost less than 25-50k while winning a race gets you 1m. If you have two drivers, that can go up to 1.9m, and there are lots of free agents at the start to hire mad cheap. My salaries were 50k even though it said a 20k salary would guarantee a contract signing. It's very easy to hire personnel as well. You just have to make sure you're balanced.For $2, it's worth it. For $20? Nuh uh.			"

												Grade A+++ EPICFAIL.Brilliant idea so poorly executed, full of glitches and absolute cone of silence from devs for patches. In it current state it's totally unplayable.This game would be abandonware if someone was able to fix it.Last patch was in May 2012....Edit note : 8th March, 2014   - After some discussion on the RM2014 ( the recent released successor to PP2012 ), there has now been a patch update attempting to bring the game out of the totally broken stage it was left in. I will update this review further after iv'e checked the patch out.Update : 30th March, 2014    - Still very broken, now crashes randomly so often I am unable to even test the game mechanics without wanting to burn my PC. Developer does not care and still sells this steaming pile of donkey excriment along with it's successor Racing Manager 2014 without fixing the game. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!, you have been warned, this game is really bad and totally unplayable, even if you engage in self mutilation, DO NOT BUY THIS.			"

												Do not bother with this utter tripe, I'd suggest getting United GP on iOS or MotorSport Manager on android (Links below) These have the same functionality, better packaged, written and streamlined and are not a complete waste of time, money or effort.If I could get a refund I would, sadly I purchased this prior to steam issuing refunds so it'll be stuck in my library as a reminder of poor life choices & the fact a demo should be offered for all PC games, with the option topay for the full game if you wish to continue playing.The fact that you know have to create an account in order to play a 4 year old game is amazing!THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF TIME DO NOT GO NEAR IT!United GPiOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unitedgp-ultimate-racing-manager/id757789290?mt=8MotorSport ManageriOS: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/motorsport-manager/id776865453?mt=8Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.game.motorsportmanager&hl=en_GB "

There is no real-time driving here.

The gameplay is far from exciting as well, given the game switches between first person and the track view for every track item, which makes it difficult to order pits properly and timely.

												I honestly think this is the worst video game I have ever played; certainly the worst game I've paid for. You're just dumped in 1st January, with no tutorial nor instructions on what to do prior to the first race.I'm not even going to bother wasting any more of my time telling you why you shouldn't buy it - I've already lost 16.4 hours of my life this is pile of garbage. It's like the game developers have never played a video game before. It's hard to put into words just how poor this game is. It sort of needs to be experienced just so you can see what the worst video game in the world is like - but that would mean investing time and/or money to do so.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!			"
