												The other negative reviews really aren't exaggerating. This is a mobile title at best. Got it as part of a bundle so it was essentially free but still.... no.I regret even installing it.			"

												The ships are kinda cool.Movement was very sparce though, like you were playing in a slow void of gel.  Very clunky.Not bad for a space game tho.			"

												The game was adapted from tablet to PC. The graphics, controls and interface are ok, but I wouldn't recommend the game itself: all you have to do is drag an endless number of lines and loops to guide the rovers. And the ""soundtrack"" (if one could name it as such) is repetitive, even annoying.So, unless you miss playing on your tablet, find something else.			"

												First, the facts. The game is an airport traffic control simulation adapted to a sci-fi theme where rovers and other land vehicles approach your ship and you have to give them paths to board. There are a few twists I haven't seen in this genre: upgradable power-ups, enemy vehicles and meteors you must shoot, meteors drop gems you can collect to get cash for power-ups.Second, impressions. Although the concept is interesting, the quality is below acceptable. The 3D terrain looks good but the rovers can't follow their paths precisely so collecting the gems becomes a nightmare sometimes. Also, there is a glitch when objects intersect with the surface and only the tip of a gem or part of a rover (or nothing) is visible. The flashing effects, explosions and the repetitive music makes it a rather frustrating experience, not a good casual neither an interesting action game.			"

												So this game is fun it has a simplicity to it that many peaple who dont want to have to deal with a keyboard in their lap so they can pet their kitty you click on falling rocks that will drop resources that you pick up with your drones. It does not deserve all they negative comments' yes there are many clones to this game style but isnt that the case with almost every game. The game menu and game are gorgous and flow clean that is more than i can say for some of even the largest titles . I give this game a personal 2 thumbs up I would be proud if i made an awesome game like this.			"

												This game needs a lot more work into it. The ship designs are nice but everything else is just bad. More importantly the game needs to be polished more. This is your typical ported airport traffic control simulation . Nothing is new.			"

												An obvious tablet port, they didn't even bother to draw a custom cursor. Yet, despite having 34% positive, I can only bash it for the price and bad UI. The rest is just what you might expect from a game like that. I'd give it average |~| if Steam had this option.			"

												Allright, let me be honest. It is not desaterous by any means. It works but misses the polish. The model of the ship and everything else is poorly made, explosions look bad and anything else is just working, nothing more and really boring. Don't ever buy it, because it isn't even wort a few pennys. Must not have, thank god I got it for free.			"

												Three ships, ten planets, thousands of people in danger and millions of meteors between them and you. Rescue as many as possible in a race across the whole solar system and make off with as much salvage as you can in this fun & frantic little home-made sci-fi action-strategy game!Features-Bringing the line-drawing genre forward, The Agent Saga Rover Rescue adds 3D levels with gravity, power-ups, speed enhancers, commander upgrades and so much more!-There’s actually a bit of a story! It all ties together into rest of The Agent Saga.-For those that like their Space, the entire menu system is an integrated audio-visual tour of the solar system, integrated fully into the game, with artwork based on real NASA images.
