												I played this game when I was younger, and enjoyed it to the point that by the time I burnt the CD out - it was around the year 5000AD and me [Germany], America, Egypt, India were all that was left - Super states having had numerous nuclear wars. Europe had turned into a desert thanks to the global warming, America had conquered the entire Western Hemisphere, Egypt - all of Africa. Our militaries had become so large, so advanced, and the nuclear wars so constant that we eventually found ourselves in a deadlock - slowly starving, rotting away with the time. Our capitals had long been wiped away - eventually, wars were no longer profitable, the resources had run out. I played that game until the CD had finally quit on me, determined to see the end of the world. Compared to today, it may not be as flashy anymore - but Civilization III is the best of the series, Civilization IV comes at a close second, but things were removed and added in the later installments that made one feel like they had lost  a bit of the original game. I've since rebought it, and I'm already at 1,797.6 hours.			"

												Having played Civilization 2-5, as well as the games made by the original team of Civilization : Call to Power 1&2,I would say ANY Civilization game so far is a buyer and a keeper, if you are into turn based strategy games.The only reason Civilization 1 is missing from my collection is the rareness of finding someone having and willing to sell his/her copy, I woud jump at the change;)every Civ Game adds a little and removes a little, the one that you like most is personal flavour.To me this one certainly ranks higher than the later Civ 4 and 5.This game was and is the height of ""classic"" Civilization games.For you people ariving at this from Civ 2 : you only will miss the old advisors (civ 5 and they still not have returned them sadly enough)For you people ariving at this from Civ 4 and 5 : no religion, but instead you will love the stacks of doom, army units, and other things that were removed in later game.This game is also somewhat older and a lot lighter on system requirements than later civ games, making it great to play on any device you want to. Also for a mere 4.99 (and it's often on sale for 2.49, and more rare for 1.25) you have an asolute bargain!			"

												I played this when I was like... really young I had no Idea what I was doing. I loved it.I played this in school for social studies. I had the upper hand having played this before. I dominated everyone. I loved it.I got it on steam. I played it for a day straight. I loved it still.This game will last forever, however my love for this game is a mixture of honest nostalgia and fanstastic gameplay that does not ruin fond memories. Get Civ 5, or 6 or whatever it's at, and leave me to play my civ 3.Story: 7/10 (Very linear but thats ok. Historic.)Gameplay: 9/10 (Repetitive sometimes.)Presentation: 6/10 (Old, and not really great.)Soundtrack: X/10 (Hmm?)Replayability: 10/10 (Keeps me coming back.)			"

												This game. This bloody game. This game has.. it.. it means so very much to me. I still have the original deluxe box set from 2001. This game has taught me about history, military command, creativity, humbleness, frustration and so much more. I cannot begin to imagine the true hours I have off of steam. Over a thousand, surely by now. This game brought me and my new stepfather together almost 15 years ago. This game shaped my brain and how I see the world and history. I have made and submitted maps to the Civfanatics forums, contributed to full overhaul mods, and spent countless hours making faithful recreations of real geography in the glorious editor. All the Civilization games that came after pale in comparison. This game was probably more of a parent and guide than my parents. Taught me about cooperation and systematic destruction of the god forsaken Aztecs. A true 10/10, if you have the time to sit down for a 16 hour slugfest on Sid difficulty. From the music to the graphics to the civilopedia to all the content out there made lovingly by loving fans, this game has captivated me like no other in my entire life. The online community might be a little lacking these days, but the AI, in my opinion, does just fine. I cannot express enough how thoroughly I have and still do enjoy this game. From humble beginnings, this game has risen to stand the test of time. I will play it until the very day that I die. Hats off, gents. A masterpiece reigns.			"

												One of the best games of all time for Strategy genre fans. The interface is not as streamlined as Civ 5, nor is the game play as intuitive as Civ 4, but it is the best of the Civ series to operate on an old computer. Bear in mind that the AI is not as sophisticated as most would like - the computer controlled opponents will gang up on you for no reason. However, this game is well worth the low price of $5. A physical copy at Wal-Mart will still set you back $10.			"

												I played this game way back in 2001. The problem I faced was at that time, I had an ancient Pentium II 300Mhz PC. So you can imagine how I felt as the game was nearly unplayable for me.Coming into the present time of 2014, I was glad that Steam offered Civilization III for sale. I quickly bought it and played on my modern top of the line laptop. It sure brought back the memories. This game can be considered a classic in the turn based strategy (TBS) genre. TBS fans would most definitely love this game despite the dated graphics. I must also like to add that the Steam version of the game works perfectly fine in Windows 8.1. A TBS haven to say the least!			"

												While it may not be able to compete graphically with newer Civilization games, it still keeps it's charm after all these years.Because it is a Voxel/Sprite based game, making models is simple enough(and I say that due to me seeing a good 8-10 models pumped out a month compared to Civ IV and CIv V's model sections on Civ Fanatics)the scenario editor is where all the fun is though, want to make a scenario based on a Colonial Marine Invasion of Xenomorph Prime? DO IT!, want to have Skynet and the Resistance fight a war ALL OVER THE GLOBE?! do it! ever wondered how the UNSC would fare against the Imperium of Man or the Galactic Empire? you can do it!there is so much can be done with the scenario editor, and if that's not enough for you, some wonderful programmers at CivFanatics have made an expanded Civ scenario editor.new note:""I'm going to conquer Russia before I go to bed!"" 3 hours later:""two more turns and I'll have conquered Rome and China!"" 1 hour later:""my clock says 3AM... oh well, time to finish my conquest of the world, MONTEZUMA YOU WILL BURN!""

Way more convenient, fully patched, works flawlessly.  If you are still messing around with your old version on CDs do yourself a favor and just grab the Steam version.

												Civ III is an apogee of the former ""Civilization"" games focus. Why play it now, when Civ V is tuned, fixed, updated so many times - and even price looks fine for almost every pocket? Well, it's all for that focus I'm talking about.First three of Civilization games were taking the player back at the dawn of the known history - and to help to notice the flow of time, there was some borderlines across that mighty river of the so-called ""4th dimension"". Starting with the Civ IV this process of moving through timeline were ""smoothed"", to the point where player gliding from the start to the end of the game without any noticable delay. I'm not saying that's bad - I like Civ V myself - but sometimes you don't want simple transfer from A to B, from the stone to electric age - you want to see cornerstones of each specific era. And with that - Civ III is giving you the better experience.All that I said in the previous passage, is arguable, of course. But here is another trait of Civ III which was intentionally cutted off (in favor of balance, of course): the size of armies and all warfare business.With all complexity of the game mechanics in the Civ V, armed conquests there looking as they performed by 10-20 people at best. In Civ III, we have totally another scale. So, when I want to win a game of Civilization by assault strategy, I start Civ III.The third volume of Civilization is dated, but still deep, still challenging, still holding the billion of possibilities to build your Nation. Make Your Way. So I'll mark the game as 9/10 - not ideal, but so much enjoyable.			"

												The third installment in the Civilization series which is getting pretty old these days, with it's successor Civilization IV and V.  This is another one of those titles that you might have grown up with as a kid and have had nostalgic value to you. This is at least the case for me. I remember that the game took a chocking 700 MB of space on my hard disk and it was generally tanking my late 90's computer. I have sunk a huge amount of hours into this game and for me this is the best game in the series.Civilization is probably the most dominating Turn-based strategy game in the gaming industry. The Total Wars games for example are RTS/TBS hybrids, while CIV is completely TBS. True Civilization enthusiasts probably rank Civ3 pretty low, compared to Civ2, Civ4 and Civ5 which were very well received for their times. For me however, Civilization 3 is the favorite among the ones I've played (Civ3, Civ4 and Civ5). Again - because of it's nostalgic value.All Civ games start out the same way unless you play a scenario or campaign. You start off with a settler and a warrior of some sorts. The settler can build a city, and as you find a suitable location for your capital - let your Civilization begin! Beware though, once you have started a game you won't be able to leave for at least 4 hours. This game is honestly best played during the night and is mostly a single-player experience.There is a Campaign/Scenario mode, where you play historical events or just silly settings. As well as a multiplayer mode, but I have never enjoyed these ones at all. Nothing beats that random map mode, select the terrain, the climate, map size and your opponents/allies. Let the history get rewritten as you choose the path of the righteous, or the path of the tyrant. Through exploding expansion, racing technology, crushing warfare and cunning diplomacy you must stand victor as the one and only dominating superpower.I only recommend picking this up if you have a personal connection to it, or if you are entirely out of gameplay from modern titles.Note: You might want to check out Civilization V (Review) as it's a modern take to the genre and series.

												A good game to waste countless hours of strategical planning and destroying other civilizations. If you get bored of the vanilla textures you can go and search googles for different ones. This by far got me right into the Civilization series and others. If you want to play multiplayer good luck finding a host. You can host your own but no one will play so the best is just host a hotseat or a lan party. I give this game a 10/10.			"

												I'm new to Civilization games, and pretty new to turn based strategy games in general. However, I still enjoyed this game a lot. I'm awful, I lose pretty much every time, and I still have fun. This game has you building a civilization from scratch, trying to expand city by city to become the best civilization possible. At the start, you are given TONS of options. Picking what civilization you want to be to determine your starting perks, climate, weather, the age of the world, difficulty, barbarian options, AI agreesiveness, the ratio of water to land, and a whole bunch of customizable options for the rules and game limits. It's a lot to take in. And once you start, you can work towards whatever kind of civilization you want, from city structures to your units to your research... there's just a lot of options. But, what makes this game so cool is that there are not only a lot of options for starting and working your way through the game, there are also multiple ways to win the game as well. So you can replay lots of times trying to win in all the different ways available. If you are being severely outmatched in one area by another civilization, perhaps you can salvage your game by switching to another goal for victory. It's really very clever.However, there ARE some issues with this game. It can be a lot to take in at first, especially since the tutorial mode is defaulted to off. I learned everything by winging it but not everyone will have the patience or luck for it. It'll take a while just to get used to what everything does and understanding how to navigate the game. Also, games tend to take hours to complete, which can also be rough if you don't have much time to play. It'll take A LOT of time to get acquainted with the game and to play in general so it's a HUGE time suck. I just wanted to get that point clearly across. Also... it's really hard... or I just suck... or both. Also... the online has been shut down, making this single player only. There ARE some complicated and iffy ways of working around it to play online, but they aren't worth the risk or hassle. The online is supposedly coming to Steamworks in the future, but until it comes, online is not a viable options, which is the whole reason I got it in the first place and that's diappointing, but it's my own fault for not looking into it more I guess.Despite the issues, this game is VERY cheap. Five bucks for hours and hours of gameplay, including the two expansions to the game. Easily worth it, especially if you're looking to get into the Civilization series or TBS game in general. Just be aware of the time it will take to enjoy the game.			"

												Building on the classic Civilization II, Civ III introduces several new game mechanics including expanding City borders & also for the first time animated units. The player starts off in the year 4000 BC with a small group of settlers and some basic knowledge of road building, irrigation & farming. After choosing the site of their first City the player then has to explore and expand their empire to other locations. The ideal placement of a City would be close to natural resources & luxuries, this will help increase trade, production & happiness of the citizens. Connecting City's via roads also increases trade and the sharing of resources / luxuries across your empire. During the early game roaming Barbarians may cause problems along your borders and any unprotected units or land will be either captured or pillaged. As you progress through the centuries you will eventually meet other Civilizations. Some of these will be friendly and willing to trade, others more hostile and may attack you completely unprovoked. You have the opportunity to influence the opinions of other empires by your actions towards them, giving them gifts or trading technology is usually a way to get on their good side. Later in the game you can also forge an alliance with certain empires in the form of a mutual protection pact. This is especially useful during times of War to help seal victory over your enemies. The game ends in one of six ways, the most traditional being conquest (destroying all opponents). The Space race victory occurs when any Civilization completes and launches a Space Ship to Alpha Centauri. Other victory types are Cultural, Diplomatic & Domination. If the game ends and no one is victorious by any of these, the game uses a ""histograph"" to determine the winner by points.This is one of my all time favourite games, though Civ IV has more depth by adding religion, unit promotions and other special abilities. I still prefer this version to any other.There are no in game options for changing to widescreen resolutions but if you do the following: goto your Steam/SteamApps/Common/Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete/Conquests folder then find the file called conquests.ini. Right click to edit the file then goto the bottom and add the line Keepres=1 this will force the game to your monitors resolution.			"

												My friend introduced me to this game a long time ago, and I can't thank him enough! although I only have 2 hours on the steam version I happily spent hundreds ( at least) on the disc version he loaned me ( back when you could do that).    But anyway the reason your reading this is to learn weather or not this game is worth 5 bucks to buy. To answer that you must ask  yourself some questions.1) do you like running your own country and mercilessly clicking other countries to death?2) do you like exploring randomly generated worlds and clicking other countries to death?3) do you like sending hundreds of units at enemys to make them fight to the death with other countries units by clicking?4) do you enjoy classical music while clicking other countires to death?5) do you care that there are 3 newer versions of the game?If you answered yes to 1-4 and no to 5 BUY THE GAMEIf you answered yes to 5 don't buy the game you nostalgia haterIf you answered no to 5 and yes to 3 of the first 4 questions then BUY THE GAMEIf you answered no to 5 and yes to 2 of the first 4 questions you may want to consider waiting untill the game goes on saleIf you answered no to 5 and yes to 1 of the first 4 questions you may be looking at the wrong genre of games If you answered yest to 5 and no to the first 4 questions you ARE looking at the wrong genre of games           - TheCanadianGamers Bman youtube.com/gamersofcanadaeh "

												Personal Experience: This is the first Civilization game I've ever played and before I knew it I was getting angry sitting at school thinking about how the Mayans were advancing on Moscow. I finally get home and load it up to push the attack to get flaked and then have Moscow taken. 10/10 Would buy for loads of fun.			"

												This is the game that started my love of the Civilization series, and strategy games in general.   I have fond memories sitting down and spending hours playing this game, even though I didn't fully understand it's mechanics at the time.  As I grew older, this was my favorite game for a number of years.  This game holds it's own in just about every key aspect, even compared to the newer installments of the Civilization series.  Online multiplayer? You bet!  Unique mechanics and smart AI for it's age? Yup! Good graphics for a game made in 2001? Heck yes!  The replay value of this game makes even Civ 5 blush.  I've been playing this game since 2006, and I still never get bored of it.  Every scenario pans out differently, and no two games are ever quite the same.  Even to this day, I prefer this over Civ 5.  Maybe it's the nostalgia talking, but this is definitely my favorite Civ game of the lot.			"

												I have played this game since it came out brand new back in the day (my hours don't reflect the amount of time I've put into it) and I still believe that it's one of the best games ever made.  Out of everything I've played, I come back to this game over and over again and am constantly amazed at the replayability it brings.  It's always different and interesting to see how the enemy will attack you and what it takes to defend yourself/territory.  Taking over the world is my favorite, but may take days.  If you blow it then just start a whole different one.  It's easy to understand and learn but very complicated to master.  It's right up there with Chess and Axis and Allies in my book of classics. I've found nothing else quite as great........			"

												For my money this is still the best Civilization game in the franchise (I have played every one extensively, with the exception of Civ V brave new world). After this entry the focus became less on society building simulation and more on micromanging increasingly Byzantine (pun intended) resources and minmaxing to hit various win conditions. Civ III is the last one you can really just chill and play however you like without regards to whether you win or lose and still have fun with. Complete is required, the vanilla Civ III had tons of balance issues. I also like how in III the civilizations have a hint of individual flavor without being locked into an identity. After this game the wrong combination of civilization and starting position could be really killer, in this game it just means you don't have as much of an edge. There are some unique units that can be really game changing depending on the situation you are in when you hit them, but ultimately it's still very situational. I recommend playing around Monarch level for a good mix of challenge and relaxation, below this level enemy civs don't develop enough to make decent trading partners, above it they start with such an advantage you're scrambling to play catch up until late in the game. For fans of old school civ, this is the game you want.(Note I probably have played several hundred hours of this game, but mostly before Steam even existed).			"

												I will start this review in two seperate forms, one for interested newcomers and then the Old Guard.I will list off the pros first before the cons of this game, Civilization 3 is a different twist of the game than you may be familar with 4 and 5. Go in understanding this switch:     -Its an old game, if you can run the actual game, there should be no real issues.     -Graphically, it's a sound experience and not many real issues, the modding community can find you bug fixes or new skins. Its pleasing regardless and you won't really be let down by this game.     -Combat is similar to Civ 4, simple dice combat where units have health bars going between 3-6, strength and defense stats play their parts and very simple to understand. There are Offensive Units, Defensive Units and Manovuer units, no exceptions and combat is based on these theorectical roles.     -31 Civs that each have 1 unique unit, unless mods are involved. Civ bonuses are general in that they have two traits which give them bonuses which are shared by others, Militaristic, Religious, Industrists, etc.     -Diplomacy is sound and reliable, techs can be traded directly as well as maps, I will faults soon     -Happiness is based per city, with simple factors involved including conscription     -Civfanatics Community and its modding community are lovely and its still alive and well, just no WorkshopThe Cons:     -Civ 5 has a prediction based combat, units do no die with one attack on even matches. Not the case for this game, they fight till they die unless they are manovuer units against inf. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t can and will happen, don't cry.     -The AI Diplomacy is very defensive and almost always cautious, wary or spiteful towards you, no exceptions.     -Its really easy to find yourself fighting half the world because of one war, tech trading is enabled so you can find yourself backwater as they maintain amiable relations and trade those tech with one another while they fight you.      -Multiplayer is old, the members are not exactly nub-friendly, I myself was 3 years old when this game came out.     -Game doesn't work for you, you're ♥♥♥♥ed, not much anyone can do for you.     -In my opinion, the hardest Civilization I have every played, it will humble you many times over.In the end it is a Civ-game, you can't really go wrong with trying. It is the game that personally got me into Civilization and its unique-ness will likely find you some memorable gameplay. Hey and if you get the game and love it, I'd always be willing to play with you by e-mail or I might even try GameRanger. Good luck on your adventure To Stand The Test of TimeReturning Civ 3, should you get it on steam? Yes and no, while digital copies are nice, its not any different from the disk. That being said, I prefer it on Steam. I have purchased this game three times, one the authentic Civ III Gold Version, which was outstanding and I loved it. However, eventually I got a new computer and it turns out the disc was ruined. I got the game a third time over E-bay, the only source I could find which remains, this time the Complete. Features were missing and I couldn't even access them no matter what I tried, the conquest files corrupted and Play the World missing. I got a new computer, my current, running Windows 8.1, 4GB RAM and Integrated Graphics. The disc would not load the game, but viola, I found the steam version was the cheapest to begin with. Its the same game as you know, and for me everything was working well. Underneath I will discuss the major steam issues:     -For me at least, Steam Overlay does not appear to work and I wouldn't know how to fix it, it could be a personal issue, I don't know.      -There are serious issues people have with getting this dinosaur game to work on new computers. Win 7 tends to have more compatiability issues with the game than Win 8(.1). Your at risk here, but this is usually the cheapest alternative     -Modding is simple but remember, access the files through the properties tab by right-click the game in the Library Tab     -Multiplayer is not run by Steam servers, nor GameSpy Arcade, it shut down if you haven't followed the game. It is now accessible over GameRanger. I do not know how that works or even attempted to access multiplayer.			"

AUDIOCatchyVISUALSimplisticDIFFICULTYAdjustableVIBEAddictiveCRAVINGBoard GamesON SALEFrequentlyPROS: On Mar 16, this game received a much-needed update to get rid of the nonfunctioning Gamespy multiplayer! Ugh, what a relief! This is my favorite installment of the Civ series. The game has a slew of nice preferences to choose from, even including an aid for the color blind.CONS:  New to the game? Go into the options and turn the tutorial on. It's starts as off, for some reason. The cutscenes look horrible because of age and stretching. Resolutions are rough. Compared to modern installments, the opponent civs act rather erratically, to the point of being nonsensical. There is no balancing, so some Civs are OP and others you would ideally never play.WORTH: This is my favorite installment of the series, of course I think it's worth full-price. You may want to consider a discount though, if you're used to later installments. To the average player that lacks nostalgia, this is just the game you know and love but with less features.OVERALL:  It's very easy to lose track of time with this game. It's great fun and I'd recommend it to anybody looking for a good ""board game"" style game on Steam, since there aren't many. It's certainly more simple than four or five, but has been my favorite installment of the series.SCORE:9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												Originally I had some crashes with this game version (Steam), but managed to fix it. The info is at the end of the review. Civilization III Complete was one of the games I spent the most time with, and really enjoyed it. For me, it's easily one of the best 4X games ever made (at least in the time I type it).If you did not play Civilization 3 in the past and are wondering if you should buy it - below is some basic info that should encourage you to do that.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The pluses:+ Lots of civilizations, each plays differently+ Lots of different units + special military unit for each civilization+ The AI scripts are demanding (unlike in most modern games)+ Resources on map force you to play strategically+ Depending on the size and type of the maps, games might differ quite a lot+ You can play in really big maps+ The game has fine mods that you can find on the internet+ It's hard to stop playing it------------------------------------------------------The minuses:- It's hard to stop playing it- At higher difficulties the military victory is the most viable option (only)- When you control most of the map it's just boring killing of the remaining weaklings- At the industrial age, you probably control most of the map- At higher difficulties AI is cheating- Civilizations are not balanced (some are really good, some - really bad)- After you learn to use workers and diplomacy, it's not that hard (but still fun)- Old 2D game, so in native desktop resolution units and fonts might be too small- Old 2D game, so in native game resolution units might be too big (and no widescreen)======================================For native desktop resolution in game:1. Go to the Conquests folder in your Civ 3 folder conquests.ini2. Put ""keepRes=1"" in conquests.ini file (without """")======================================Those settings should fix crashes in Windows 7 64 bit.1. Go to the Conquests folder in your Civ 3 folder2. Rename LSANS.FOT to -LSANS.FOTIf that does not help:Set Windows compatibility to Windows XP Service Pack 2 and run program as administrator.If the game runs too slow delete keepRes=1 from ini file (in Windows XP mode the game is slower)======================================That's it. You can now go buy the game.			"

												Don't understand what people are whining about.Of course this game is old, so what? Old is gold (generally, not always, but certainly most of the time).Would I say that it is better than Civilization V? Yes and no, both has their forces and their weakness and I am certainly not talking about the graphics because I do love the graphics in this game, call me crazy, I prefer the graphics you find in this game than those in Civilization V, it's simple but beautiful, old school some would say.In my opinion, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Civization III and Civilization IV are the best in the Civilization series.Then you have Civilization V and Civilization II.Beyond Earth isn't that good, far too little content.If you love Civilization but haven't played this one, you'll probably love it!If you're looking for a fantasy civilization then you should give a look at Warlock and Eador which are the closer ones to this series, there are some other such as Age of Wonders but it has its differences, lot of them.9.2/10 "

												Three Civ games later and this one is still the best.Admittedly, I would recommend Civ V for than this just because has much more content and is overall better looking and running, also for the most part people tend to enjoy Civ V more as well.So first off to really enjoy it you must be willing to sit down for a looooong time, this game takes a long time to progress so be patient. With that out of the way lets discuss why this game is more favorable than Civ V1) Bigger armies, Bigger BattlesCiv III allows HUGE armies to battle. This means war is actually dangerous and you need to have a war plan if your are gonna beef with another Civ. Along with massive armies you can stack units, something you cannot do in Civ V, normally this would ruin the flow of gameplay when you have 60 units on one tile, but somehow it doesn't. Also, Civ V's fighting mechanics are straight up garbage, and some units are overpowered and too hard to fight.2) Governments, Сове́тский Сою́з!What the hell Sid, why would you remove an amazing part of the Civ experience? :(Governments are what allow you to determine how much money you make, how fast you produce things, how much millitia you can have, and some others. Without governments, Civ V has a laughably bad Social policies and World congress type deal that can basically screw you over depending on who has control over it.3) Trading tech, Who got the Wheel?Why was this removed. Trading tech was a central part of the Civ III experience, you could make some mad cheese, or skip entire halves of an age with this. Maybe it was too easy to get tech from the AI or something, but this needs to come back.4) Advisors aren't annoying and useless.In Civ V advisors are stupid and useless, simple.In Civ III advisors maintain your civ and keep things nice and tidy, simple.Now these were just some of the things that I think make Civ III great, but as I said, you might just want to buy Civ V instead, it has much more content and is better looking and running.Maybe it's nostalgia, Maybe it really is butter. Who won? You decide. "

												A flat out brilliant game.A classic in the making, Civilization 3 once again serves up a big plate of turn based gameplay covered in gobs of strategy and tons of choices, this is one that will keep you coming back for another helping over and over again.The game is still frighteningly addictive, constantly dangling new accomplishments in front of players who are still planning on playing ""just one more turn.""A worthy and immersive extension of the series, and comes close to perfection in terms of strategy.Complex combat, climbing the tech tree and resource management make Civ III a deep strategy game – far beyond a simple simulation game.The changes mostly seem to increase your options for trying new strategies, without altering the core game. And actually, that’s a brilliant approach.This is most likely the biggest, deepest and most spectacular strategy game ever made.			"

												Here's what I think of this game, I'll compare it to Civ 5 since most people consider that to be the best Civ game.Music: Both Civ 5 and Civ III have fantastic soundtracks as with pretty much all Civ games. CIV 5's soundtrack is better, but that doesn't mean this soundtrack isn't worth listening to. Diplomacy: The diplomacy here in Civ III, in my opinion is better. You can trade maps technologies, change how agressive the AI is. The AI does get quite a bit agressive once you get to medium agressiveness although.Scenarios: The scenarios here in Civ III are quite interesting. We have Rise of Rome, Fall of Rome, Napoleanic Europe, WW2 in the pacific, etc. I honestly can't choose between Civ 5 and 3 in terms of which had better scenarios.War: And here is where we start to see the flaws of Civ III. There are certain units made for attacking, defending, and seige units. The seige units must be protected otherwise they will be either captured or destroyed immediately, and the attacking units are vulnerable to counterattack. Defending units ensure your cities are protected and your attacking armies. This part of war, I liked, It made sure I don't just build completely one type of unit. Cities are instantly captured if there is no unit inside. I wasn't as fond of this as the unit diversity, but it was tolerable at least.But then their's the battle system. It's luck based, which I have a burning hatred for. I could attack a spearman one time with an archer and not take any damage, while another time, a defending spearmen exactly the same as the other one could take out my archer, without taking any damage. How does that make any sense? I get it it's an old game an all, but come on.Also the AI seem way too powerful. I met Scandinavia on turn 2 and it already said his forces outnumbered mine.CIv 5 definetly, has better war mechanics.Barbarian encampment and ruins/friendly encampments: Whether you love 'em or hat 'em these guys are around, some encampment are friendly and will give you something like gold or a settler to give you a huge early game boost. and of course the hostile. You can make the hostile encampments non existant, sedentary, normal, roaming or raging. Since there is more option than Civ 5, I'd say these are slightly better.Civilization balance: Civilization 5 isn't exactly balanced, (Babylon is much better, is pretty much better every aspect compared to let's say the Iroqouis). Civ's are more balanced here. Each Civ have a unique unit, 2 free technologies and 2 bonus'. Military bonus' allow you to build stronger armies faster, science allows you to build science buildings faster, religious allows you to build cultural building faster, etc. In my opinion the two best are science and religious (Which Babylon ironically has both XD). Besides that Civ's are quite balanced besides early game Unique units (I'm looking at you bowmen)Victory types: Time victory is always on here, which I don't like (although you can push back the counter for time victory to kick in) cultural victoy revolves around how much culture you can get in either one city or your entire empire, dominatuion requires you to own at certain percentage of the world's population or land area, conquest is to eliminate all rival civilizations., wonder is to build a certain amount of wonders, diplomatic is to get people to vote for you once the UN is built, and space race to leave this filthy planet. All good, although most of the time you will win by either cultural or time.Graphic: I don't really care for graphics much, but the graphic here are at best, pleasing to the eye and at worst, tolerable.Conclusion: CIV 5 is obviously better, but Civ 3 is extremely enjoyable also, I have many hours into this, and many more will be put into playing this. I know the flaws I listed here aren't going to be changed unless everyone at Firaxis gets high. I haven't seen any bugs, just a great game.I rate this 9/10- Aged beautifully, like a gem.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization III, the sequel to the great Civilization II, a game that by some is still to this day considered to be the best of the series, has the heavy duty challenge of not only living up to the standards set by it's predecessors but also to innovate the franchise enough that players of the previous installment can be bothered to upgrade.It starts out with a somewhat mixed feeling. Some of the great ideas from Alpha Centauri has been brought over creating a much more versatile playing field with a living map and more unique factions but many of Alpha Centauri's greatest assets, such as the ability to build your own units and terrain elevations are notably absent. and others, such as unique factions, are only half implemented.These improvements however do still manage to increase the interactivity of the game substantially particularly when combined with the many new features, such as culture, that Civ III brings to the table.Factions are not longer defined simply by their city names but now have a few unique units of little consequence and civilization traits of great consequence. Unique units are simply beefed up versions of regular units that give a faction a small military advantage during the time period in which the unit is present, this can be a nice boost if you happen to go to war in that time but it can also be ignored completely if the time for war is not right. The traits each faction receives now however are of a much greater importance and can range from getting a free technology every age to a half off cost on religious buildings. These traits are big enough in effect that they tend to define your entire game.A new and important feature in Civ III is culture. Each city generates culture through it's various buildings and the culture in turn defines the size of it's borders. A heavily cultured city can even envelop the city of an opponent and flip it to your side. While the realism or historical accuracy of such a device is laughable at best it does provide players with a new means of expansion and a way to deal with those pesky resource stealing late game cities that the AI is so fond of placing in whatever unoccupied corner of your empire it can find.Graphically Civilization III is passable as always, the city view is pleasant but the rest of the game gives only a mediocre visual experience. Nothing pretty but nothing that'll ruin your gaming experience either. The soundtrack is still mostly orchestral epics and works very well although the rest of the sound effects in the game are pretty forgettable.All in all Sid Meier's Civilization III is a good sequel. It doesn't create quite the same feeling of amazement and enjoyment that going from Civ I to Civ II does but it manages to provide a good solid experience with enough innovation to justify the purchase.

												Civilization III is the first 4X game I've seriously tried and I must say it was a surprise! At first the game wasn't likeable to me because my civilization was considered the worst at the easiest difficulty. I learned with some time (in multiplayer) the basics, I would say that it was a fun way to learn things.The feeling you get when the first game's over is unique, on both victory and defeat circumstances, you learn lots of things seeing the enemies' play on the summary.I want to say to all the new players to not get discouraged by the brutality that CPUs have in this game and I recommend to try it out with a person in multiplayer like I did and also to read the informations found on the civilopedia.

												My Dad thinks that games are a waste of time and that one can have much more fun and growth from reading Thackery or Trollope. That being said, he must have put in several thousand hours into this game since he bought it for me around my 6th-odd birthday in 2001. Our primay form of bonding is talking Civ strategy. He has no interest in 4, 5, BE or anything like that. Says they're not interesting like this one is. I'm inclined to agree. I think that Civ 3 is the essence of 4X, and that any designer wanting to know what makes 4x games great,  should play this obsessively. There are a few things here and there that I think could have been expanded on- such as plague- and the fact that some civilizations simply have uninspired Unique Units with bland mechanics. Nevertheless, one of my favourite games ever. Now that Civ 6 is happening, I do hope that Meier et al look back to this one, for inspiration, on how a truly grand 4X should be.  "

												Before I got this game on steam, I played it for 100s of more hours.  It's one of the best Civ games.Basically Civ 1 done right with better graphics.  Civ 2 was messed with.  Civ IV while good lost most of the strategy that was in Civ III.  Civ V is just bad:  No unit stacking, no city view, no love.  I haven't played VI yet, so I would say Civ 3 is either the best Civ game or the 2nd best.			"

												The game is old. The game is definetly recomented from my part.I had to lower the screen resolution to avoid the 'tiny-litle-units' making my ayes go into pain. :-) But after all these years, I really enjoyed again the struggle to build a sivilization. There are newer versions of the same game nowdays. But I really believe that each of the Civilization games has its unique satisfaction to offer the strategy gamer, even if Civ IV is my prefered one.I definetly recoment CIV III, especially moded with mods like ""Rise And Rule"", which add many new units, technologies etc.  The problem is, I can not clearly identify what is this 'different gameplay aspects' that kept me playing CIV II all these hous and not starting a CIV IV or CIV V campain... The differenses on units, wonders, railway inprovements etc, should not be enouph to get me playing a game as old as this one... On the other hand, I got myself missing the real-movie councelors of CIV-II, but I don't think I will play that old love again :-)In any case. Considering the very low price that you can purchse this old game (Civilization III), especially in a bountle together with the newet versions, I definetly believe that any gamer that likes turn -base build-expand strategies should give it a try. Even for the shenarios of the 'complete' edition, a CIV-V fun could find in CIV-III a way to further expand his Civilization gamepleasure.Have a good game everyone :-)			"

												Civ 3 Complete on sale for $1.24 so I buy it since I recall how great it was years ago.  I am a big fan of Civ 4 & Civ 5 with all the expansions.  And I am delaying getting a new PC until I know the system requirements for Civ 6.  Still I realize that there was a lot I missed from Civ 3:  Artillery that doesn't suffer damage.  The people's portraits in the city display (I liked Civ I's  full figurines even better).  The fashion progression for world leaders and the population.  (Nineteenth Century attire looks good on everybody; I don't know why).  Single figure unit graphics.  And extremely good graphics for the system requirements.     And the world is massive.  Civ 5, by giving every unit at least 2mp, really shrank the world.       Units simply gain more hits points on promotion; no decision on how to specialize.     Music that expresses the time frame of the turn.  Civ 5's music is just as varied but seems      designed as background music.Of course it all depends on what one wants from a Civ game.  But if it goes on sale again for $1.24 that's not much of a gamble.			"

												Not without its bugs and problems, but still a very fun game to play. Civ3 is easily of the best civilization games made (in my opinion). Even better than civ5. While newcomers from later civs may have trouble adapting to this game, if given time, it will grow on you. After playing out the main game, mods and scenarios will continue to take up your time and amaze how much can be accomplished with just a simple and easy to use editor.If you have problems installing and playing this game, dont worry the game works great even with steam. I see other users having problems with steam installation and modern operating systems, but the game does actually work fine it just may need a few tweaks depending on the issue. I myself have never had a single issue on Windows 7 (apart from if in a long session for several hours, like 3+, there's a possibility of it crashing, but this is minor and can be quite common on other games as well) using the steam version (I also have the disc version which works fine being on the same computer with the steam copy).

												Personally this is my favorite turn based strategy. The game is playable for anybody and is very addicting if a person likes to be in control of things. What I like the most, is ability to grow really big, to name stuff as one wants and to play on real World maps. Editor is really simple btw. AI is kind of not really good, but it's challenging on high levels due to bonuses to AI. Also, there is a city count limit on a map which is 512 I think and the game has kind of built in minimal turn waiting time. I have tested this with some members on the community, and it seems that game code doesn't allow for faster operation, regardless of PC hardware one is using. No matter what CPU/RAM/GPU one has, two very powerful cores or 8 core CPU (since the game utilizes only one core by default), the speed of the slowest turn will be the same. Which is considerable, when you have full map of civs, dip relations and modern units.			"

You'll most definitely have a fun time, with all these hilarious moments appearing left and right.The advisors actually have a use, and they have expressions, unlike Civ 4 and 5. (The Science Advisor is literally Sid Meier btw)There's whole government systems as opposed to civics. Means you can't fine-tune your government, but it takes a bit of load off your shoulders if you're not into figuring out what civics you want.Also, spearman vs. tank scenarios don't happen *that* often. 118 hours in at the time of writing, and RNG hasn't pulled any serious BS on me.The only real downside that sticks out to me is the loading lag between each turn that builds up late-game when you play multiplayer matches. That isn't too significant, though, since if you can sit through 2 minutes straight of nothing but an AI doing carpet bombing runs on your capital, you can survive an extra 4 seconds of loading time.This was a wonderful Christmas gift I got from a good friend of mine. I would most definitely buy the game for someone else, too.I mean, come on -- hours of endless entertainment for only $1.24? How could you resist?			"

												All Civilization games are awesome. This is my own personal favourite (i have not played 1 or 2).Each one takes something away and adds something new.I prefer this one because there are less factors you have to worry about, 4 is just missing something 'MAGIC'. I do love 5 but 3 is just slightly better (for me).If you're new to Civilization games, it may be worth you starting with 5 because I imagine peoples personal favourites are the first ones they try.A full game of civilization (3,4, or 5) can take several days. Obviously you can save and come back to it later. You need to play this game for at least 4 hours before you can learn to like it			"

												Still as good of a game as I remember it from my childhood, it's age shows a little, but for $5 (and potentially even less) it still provides that ""one more turn"" mentality. I probably sunk at least 200 hours into my local libraries copy, so when I saw it was on steam, it was a no brainer purchase.Having played Civ 5, I have to say that the portraits of the rulers convey far more emotion, at least in my eyes, than the full set pieces of Civ 5. The barbarians have multiple AI options and can be absolutly brutal. Certain civilzations have certain traits which affect what actions trigger golden ages. You get to upgrade your palace in a way that actually changes the way it looks on the city screen. Also there is a city screen where you get a detailed overview of your city and all the wonders you built. As opposed to Civ 5's jam packed 3D model of your city.Age helps, in a way, since with todays operating systems the turns are lightning fast, even with troop movement.I know I have my nostagia blinders on, but I really like this game, despite whatever flaws I cannot see. I suspect that anyone who likes these kinds of games and doesn't mind the lack of 4k graphics, will definitely get their money's worth. "

The game was a nice upping the ante of Civ II and hitting all of its marks it aimed for including its amazing play the world expansion which allowed a relatively stable way to play multiplayer that CivNet tried and failed to do and Civilization II attempted with its Multiplayer gold expansion)While I have poured countless hours in to my Disk copy I haven't really touched it since mid way through the life span of Civ IV. but I do still get requests to play multiplayer so it still does have a decent following.10/10			"

-Quick Review-Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete is a turn based strategy game developed by Firaxis Games and released Oct 30, 2001.

			Yet again I'm playing another game I can't seem to get my steam overlay working, so I can't screenshot the conventional way.		


-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The ""Story"" is more so in the individual experience you have playing these types of games. You're put into a random world with random NPC's (unless you try to determine the world and nations by selecting them...) the key defining elements are how you interact with the game's NPC's.My personal story is I kept to myself, and then people started threatening me, and I'm not going to take any of that from easy difficulty NPC's, so they declared war on me and I fought them until the game ended. (Maybe this is why other Nations always think I'm a war monger... but I swear the other guys almost always starts it! ..I just finish it.)Gameplay: I've played Civilization Call to power, and I've played Civilization 4... Civilization 3 is different then both, but difficult to articulate how it's different... the game feels slower paced, I can't wage war as effectively by bombardment as I can in civ call to power or civ4.The game just hasn't clicked with me in the way Civ5 did immediately. the User interface has a serious case of the 2000's (by that, I mean overly complicated, overly difficult, rather confusing.)There are scenarios and tons of special mod or DLC packs which are included in Civ3. If you're looking to burn some time playing a strategy game, Civilization 3 can easily eat up that time with the crazy amounts of content it has.Conclusion: The dilemma I have with Civ3, is that I prefer Civ5, and Civ call to power... but that doesn't mean Civ3 is bad... it's quite good and chalk full of content. Especially for the low price... But while playing I just find myself thinking ""man, I'd rather be playing Civ5"".I think it's nice to have Civ3 as a backup for my laptop when I'm on trips, or for a new/old challenge. (It's a new challenge because I haven't played it as much, but it's an older game... BAH, don't think about it) "

												This one is a classic. A very good game especially on the old times. Nowadays it's a little wonky to work on newer machines, especially because of resolution problems. But if you can make it work it can offer a very different playstyle we have from the new titles.I really recommend especially for the low price to try it out and see how much Civilization evolved throught the ages... I meant the game lol ;)Overall Score: 7/10			"

												Man this game. This was the 3rd or 4th video game I ever played after Hotwheels MicroRacers and LegoRacers. I started playing it at 5 years old and dude, I spent so many hours on that Windows 98 playing this game.10/10 would get grounded again for this gamePros:-the fricking sounds, not only the soundtrack (which changes from era to era and man is it the best ambient music ever) but the sound effects are so percussionistic and beautiful too-the uncomparable depth to the game; the vast amount of different things you have to pay attention to and manage: most games require only a linear train of thought like hey shoot the bad guys, maintain your health, upgrade weapons. Not Civilizations. Build Cities, Create armies to protect and expand your empire, research technology, explore the world, fend off barbarians, build roads, find resources, build farms to speed up your city growth, build settlers to build new cities, I could go on for hours.-educational, yeah it is. As a young kid I learned about Samurai, the Immortal Guard of the Persians, The Hanging Gardens, The Great Lighthouse, Names of Leaders of Nations like Hannibal and Elizabeth, etc. Proof that games can be subtly educational-definitely best of the Civilization series, Civ IV was ok, religion was the only noticeably cool aspect. Civ V was better but the lack of stackable units and limited resources was a pain to get used to. Civ V did have nice expansions and I very enjoyed their City Defense aspect but Civ III had much simpler everything without giving up anything. XP, technology, interactions with other civs are a few of the things both III and V but III had it much simpler and efficient.Cons-um I guess it looks really old now and the highest resolution is really low lol.-i guess i could see it being hard to get into these games for many people due to how old it is now			"

												Absolutely amazing game. I've played all linear Civilization games save for Civ 2 and this has by far been my favourite. I really wish they didn't stray from the feel of the first 3 Civ games, I'm really not a fan of the feel of Civ 5, but alas the masses seem to disagree with me. I don't want the bland interface of the fourth and fifth games, I want character, and my loyal advisors to guide me.I don't want to set my political civic 'Police State' and my economic civic to 'Central Planning'; I don't want to take whatever 'social policy' tree (with permanent effects + no drawbacks) or adopt the 'Order' ideology.I want to use the 'Communism' government and have my advisors refer to me as 'Comrade' as I free to the proletariat of the world from the bourgeosie and the 'Fascist' Aztecs!The character of the game, the way events and history play out, managing your empire and waging war, etc. is simply really something and it really seems to have been lost with the new Civ games. And the sad thing is, it has so much potential for future games with more fleshed-out content, features, etc.Definite 9/10			"

												This game is everything I want out of the Civilization series. It's not too easy (unlike Civ 5), but not too hard, either. The graphics remind me of a map of an empire, as if you were the actual leader of an empire looking at a map of said empire (I love that effect by the way, it just gives that much more immersion). Also, do you think you've heard good video game music? Yeah, this game's OST is one of the best to be created. I love nuking the living hell out of every other nation while the Modern Era's awesome guitar music plays in the background. The only flaws I find are the amount of corruption in cities (it gets pretty high, but that's why the game has COURTHOUSES) and the fact that a spearman can kill a tank (but that could happen IRL, the spearman just has to shove its spear down the tank barrel).

												The game is price worthy.If you have alot of extra time on your hands, this game is for you.The music, although limited, is great.Scenarios are fun to play.I've played Civ III off steam alot, so the hours on the Sid Meiers games is actually quite inaccurate. I had bought Civ III previously off of steam- then I hoped that buying it off steam I could find other civ III fanatics who I could play with online. Unfortunately, it was difficult to find one. There are some things in Civ III that compare better than do civ II, III, IV, and V. Civ III has no cheating console- so you can't exatly put warriors all over the map and destroy everyone before they found their first city. This forces the player to actually play the game- it took me a little while to get used to it, about an hour or so, but eventually it got better, and I got used to the fact that I couldn't cheat and I actually had to play a fair game. This game tought me that cheating is less fun than is actually playing the game. I'd actually like to thank this game, because without it, I would have taken a while longer to realize cheating is not as fun as I thought.Also, friend me if you would like to play a little good game of Civ III sometime. ^			"

												The Steam edition of Civilization III does not work correctly on Windows 7, which kind of defeats the purpose I had in getting it to begin with. Unlike the retail CD version of the game from years ago, it installs without hassle. What it doesn't do without hassle is run correctly. Every time I've started a game, I've encountered audio bugs where the music stops and the sound effects run an in endless loop like crickets. Heaven forbid you ever try to quit the game, either, because it will not only crash, but lock up your entire monitor and not let task manager launch over it.If a game is going to be sold on steam, I expect some kind of work to be done to make it compatible with current operating systems. If Gog.com can do it, so can Valve.			"

												From a humble start, hunting and gathering and establishing a small town.To a vast empire, mighty armies, establishing diplomatic ties, building great wonder of time, and lunching a ship into deep space.Civ 3 is a great game, and has aged relatively well. The game can seem a little overwhelming for a new comer, but once learned can be played easily. It certainly brings me back.The combat system can cause problems. It’s based of attack and defense, so occasionally a unit with a weak defense will defeat a unit with a strong attack (spearman vs. tank and wins!).Overall a great game! Totally worth the price!   "

												This is an amazing game. It's difficult to pick up, but once you understand how everything works, it comes together beautifully. The graphics aren't very good, but considering it was released in 2001, it's quite impressive. The music is not even as close to good as Civ 4, but it's still a very worthwhile game, especially if you only want to spend $5 instead of $30. The best part is, all the stratgies you used in one difficulty, may fail you in the next. There are also interesting scenarios, such as World War II in the Pacific. The game mechanics make everything so interesting. The game is well balanced, so you have to consider what each action you take may cost you. (Like nuking your neighbors.) If you want a cheap, good game that you can play for hours, Civ 3 is for you.			"

												Prabally one of the best turn based games out there. I remember pleading to my father as a child to give up his computer for a few hours so that i could make the Roman Tanks slaughter Aztec pikemen. I must have had four to five hundred hours into that game. Now, i am 14, have my own computer, and the disk seems to not support Windows 10. I went to Humble Bundle and got this for $1.25 and it works almost perfectly. I did have a crash for a custom game, and when i finished a nine hour game at the congradulations screen it crashed, BUT it plays just fine all the rest. One of the best parts of this game is the World War 2 built in mod. It is really well done. If you have played any of the newer Civilization games and you want to see the earlier titles, go for this one. In my opinion Civ 3 is the best Civ game in the series, followed closely by Civ 4			"

												If you like turn-based strategies you can't go wrong with Civ III, especially if your hardware can't handle new Civilization games or you just want to feel nostalgic.It's a great game that is playable even on new hardware, but if graphics are your priority you should probably check out Civ IV or V.Still, it definitely gets a thumbs up!

												Played Civ 4, then Civ 5, then Civ 3, along with seeing Civ 1 and 2 played afterward.Out of all of them? Civ 3 is by far my favorite.  There's just something about it that makes me enjoy it far more than the others.Not so much a review but a ""I played other Civs first and love this one to death"", showing that you don't become attached to games you play before others.Don't forget you can increase the game's resolution via an ini edit; makes this dated game not so dated anymore and actually pleasing to play (eye strain wise) on high resolution monitors.

												13 years after it's original release, heavily outdated in every technical aspect, Civilization III manages to keep being a very challengenling and fun game to play. The premise of the game is the same as in the first title back in 1990: Control a civilization, manage every aspect of it such as economy, military, foreign relations, production, culture and take it to glory by dominating the world by whatever means you want (or can). Of course, graphics are very bad as per today standards, but those doesn't interfere with the game pace and point at all.This game stands the test of time, 8.5/10			"

												So many many many years ago I played the first CIV game. I loved it. Barely understood it as I was too young but I loved it. Lost the game at some point and didn't play the other CIV games until I bought CIV4 during a Steam sale. While the graphics improved a lot from the first game I did not enjoy the game as much. It was rather simple and straight forward. So now during another sale I decided to buy CIV3 as a lot of people are saying it's the  best version. A few hours in and I have to say I like this one better then 4. The game is a bit more challenging even on easy mode and I am just having a fun time creating my own civilizations. That however doesn't mean there aren't any downsides. Some things do not make sense like older units being stronger then newer units. Then there is the little glitch that you will constantly be aware of and that is that it looks like the game is freezing at the end of every turn. It just freezes for a few seconds and then continues but it is a bit of a pain. So far I have no had it shut down on me completely like I am reading in other peoples reviews but who knows it might just happen at some point. Honestly for the money I paid for it I won't complain much. It would have cost me more to get the cd version though I wouldn't have the glitch. My opinion? Totally worth playing and if you don't mind waiting a few seconds at the end of every turn get the steam version. If you do then buy the cd version. Have a lot of fun with it! P.S. having the chance to build your own castle is something I missed in CIV 4 glad to see it in CIV 3 :)			"

The perfect game for older PCs and laptops as it hasn't lost any of its playability over the years, even if it isn't as streamlined and user friendly as the more recent civs (though some argue thats a plus!).If anything its worth the £3 just because its a Civ game, and I'm a firm believer that they all are worth owning.

												I don't understand why modern game developers (and a large portion of modern gamers) are so hell-bent on graphical perfection at the expense of actual content. Part of the beauty of this game for me has always been its balance of graphics,  being easy to navigate, and its underlying mechanics. To me, this will always be the pinnacle of the Civilization series. I don't know how many hours of my life went into playing this game since I started out with the CD version before buying a copy on steam when I lost the orginal disc, but I doubt I'll find another game that can entertain me for as long as this one did.

												What can i say about this version of Civilization? I've played Civ 5 - Brave New World for possibly thousands of hours, and i still go back to Civ 3, another game i've probably played for thousands of hours. Still highly addictive, incredibly difficult and a lot of fun. Very crude, in relation to the newer iterations of the game, but also, stripped for bull like annoying audio readings (""The meek shall inherit the earth but not it's mineral rights"" - yes, i've heard you before! - and what does that even mean?!). You still get a sense of a fully realized game by the end of each game, as is the same with other iterations.			"

												I understand, it's just not for me. When I was a child, I played this on and off constantly and never figuring out what I was doing. I played Diablo 2 around the same time and also didn't know what I was doing. This complicated empire micromanaging game is an old classic that many people remember, be it from watching one of your relatives playing or being that relative playing. You must manage large armies and cities while trying to expand your kingdom across the world. Disease, famine, civil unrest and poverty are just some of the factors you will have to deal with with trying to be the greatest empire. Doing things all the time is what will get you ahead, and failing over and over learning what does and doesn't work is the tutorial. Hardcore RTS is defined by the Civilization franchise.I never really understood this game and I still don't. I never really enjoyed micromanage games as they posed too much stress for me to correctly enjoy them. This is personal and won't sway the game itself. This game is for people who love watching massive amounts of action going on at the same time with rediculous difficulty options and really good customization for world generation. For being this old, it holds its complication and difficulty really well. If you love this kind of stuff, then it's a no brainer and if you have never heard of this or just faintly remember it from long ago, make sure you Youtube some videos to make sure its your type of game.It's not my kinda game, but it might be yours.Personal Rating 1/5			"

												This is my favorite civ game by far. Civ V is great and all, but my biggest complaint about it is that you can only have like 20 nukes tops. Civ III lets you have as many as you so desire. Plus, you get ICBMs (as many as you want)! Civ V doesn't let you have ICBMs. However, in Civ III, I've got ICBMs in at least 20-30 cities, tactical nukes everywhere, subs (with tacticals) spread all across the map targeting all coastal and inner coastal cities. I can start WWIII any time I want, and I can be sure that I will have no shortage of nukes. Plus just painting some island in that b, e, a, utiful orange coat is just a pleasure.

												Although the game is over a decade old, its gameplay, mechanics, and tactical strategies manage to please and challenge strategy gamers, especially within the harder difficulty levels.The highlights within the game include a wide array of civilizations to choose from around the world and throughout history, a refined isometric perspective from its precedessor, unique qualities to match your gameplay style, and challenging gameplay tactics as you progress through its difficulty. The Complete Edition also features a Conquests version for increased replayability that focuses on your tactical thinking without rapid reactions.Within the negative aspects of the game, the AI seems a bit limited on handling some of its positive attributes or buffs (normally happens with harder difficulty levels), meaning that it has no idea how to handle its resources efficiently, thus limiting gameplay challenge compared to later Civilization games.  Furthermore, it is difficult to establish friendships and allies within the game, as every opponent seems to collide against you (in the World War II map, even England is your enemy if you select the United States as your civilization), also limiting attaining diplomatic victories.Overall, the game remains strong based on its design and gameplay, and at an inexpensive price, you really cannot go wrong, especially when there is a discount lurking from time to time.

												This phenomenal strategy game is mentally stimulating and epic, though I will admit it might not be very rewarding. Standard games usually took me days, and each of the hourse you're playing requires you be goal-oriented and considerate. Strategic resources, oceans and capturable units can be a pain, but I recommend this game to those who have a lot of free time. I suggest choosing small maps and few rivals.			"

												I have played a lot of Civ games, from Advanced Civilizations on DOS all the way up to the brand new Civ VI. And this is still my favorite of all of them. It is definitely not the prettiest or most user-friendly civ game, but its grit and punishing difficulty (at the higher settings) give it a realism lost in a lot of the newer Civ games.  That being said the game is a huge leap foward from a lot of its easier counterparts, and while its not as difficult at Advanced Civilizations, you don't neet to mount your C:/ Drive to play it and there is a manual... Stupid RNG no explanation Civil Wars...Anyway, long story short:If you are new to the Civilization Franchise I might recommend starting with  Civ V, its an easier more friendly game. That being said, if you are a veteran of the franchise or of the strategy genre, Civ III will give you a more difficult, more immersive, and more brutal experience, and is well worth the $1-$5 it costs.

												All right. I got this game from a friend sometime around 2012, I think. I played it for a bit but honestly, I had trouble getting into it. A lot had changed from Civilization II and I never really caught on to all the differences.Picked it up during the Steam Black Friday sale on Thanksgiving. I gave it a whirl. At first, I had the same feelings I did last time I played all those years ago. It wasn't CivII, and the strategies that worked for me then were failing me now. It didn't help that there wasn't a tutorial or a manual of any kind, and the Civilopedia is not the most user-friendly interface, although it's critical to understanding all of the game mechanics the AI employs.I played on Chieftain for a while, just trying to get a handle on the game mechanics, but now I'm bored of chieftain. Too easy. Once you learn and begin to understand the game mechanics, this is a pretty great game. That said, it's virtually impossible to win if you don't constantly expand and build one city after another. I mean, that is all you will do. Build and build and build. If you don't, the AI will and you'll lose. Pretty much the only way to win is to begin building a ton of cities in the early parts of the game.I did like the implementation of cultural borders, and how borders clash against one another. The cultural conversion tool was also pretty cool, where cities could rebel and join your forces because they realized that their own culture was lifeless. So it's a pretty good game, and definitely worth the price for my 46 hours (and growing).I do have to say, though, that a couple of the leader choices are really dumb. Mahatma Gandhi was not a leader of the Indian nation. Although he championed the move for India's independence, making him the face of India is weird, because he was a guru and not a general. And Jeanne d'Arc leading the French? She was a teenager and a peasant who, by her own confession, never even used her sword in combat. They could have chosen Charlemagne or Napoleon Bonaparte, but Joan! Kinda silly!			"

												This is, by far, the best Civilization game I have ever played. Far better even the latest titles, in my opinion. It runs great on Windows 10, it uses classic isometric square tiles, and it has plenty of civilizations to choose from. Aside from this game's age there is little that makes it stand out. If you don't have a powerful device and you want something modest to help you relax or play with your friends, then this may be a game for you.I actually learned a lout about ancient Mesoamerican cities while playing as Aztecs, and this game helped me memorize their names, haha.I would give this game 9/10 for its versatility, customizability and variety.

												I didn't give this game a fair try back in the days when it was new.  The game was visually an improvement over Civ II, and the interface was actually functional.  I just felt the combat system was poorly done, diplomacy didn't feel right, and the game has a few design quirks.  Fast forward to now, I decided to buy the complete edition, which updates the game.  What I find now is a game that truly stands between the majesty of Civ II and Civ IV.  The Civ experience is there, and it's well represented.  The graphics haven't aged all that well, and the interface isn't as nice as the later games, but the gameplay remains classic Civ.  The complete edition adds the feature of customizing the game in ways never seen before or again in a Civ game, such as turning down (or up) AI aggression.  It is a good, cheaper entry into the world of Civ.			"

												Many believe this to be the best Civilization game in the series, and I have to agree. No other Civ has the same amount of sheer content as this one: From civs to leaders, buildings, wonders, scenarios, you name it. Also, the leader's personalities shine, and the diplomacy system is much deeper than in the newer iterations, you can basically tell Ghandi to go ♥♥♥♥ himself if he pisses you off. In general, the game is deeper than both its successors, but the tutorial does a good job of teaching you the basics. The rest can be learned through experience. The only thing that I feel could turn someone off is the graphics, which look a bit outdated by now, but if you're willing to look past the surface, hours upon hours of fun await.			"

												Firaxis certainly tried their best to make every title in their series feel unique. In fact, this is probably the oldest Civ that aged well, and does not require you actually being around, when it was the most recent, to enjoy it. Also noticeably more monotonous than successors.Civ3 is good, yada yada, game of my childhood, yada yada, but buy only if Civ5 and 4 are not for you.			"

												Where do I begin? Civilization III is in my opinion, the last, true civ game. Yes I know there are many more sequels, but from civ 4 onwards, the game begins to turn into a strategy game of sorts. It is Civ 1-3 that TRULY give you the feeling of an emperor over a fledling empire. This game is not to be missed out on if you are a fan of the Civilization franchize, especially if you want to go back to one of the classics. Civ 5 & 6 are really good in my opinion, but Civ 3 REALLY TRULY steals the show.For less than what a coffee at starbucks costs, GO BUY IT ALREADY!!!!			"

												I bought this game because of my experience with the newer Civ 5 series. I thought that I could give it a try for the very low price. I am still on the fence about this game because of its learning curve but I do love this type of simulation genre. The AI  is impossible to please, yet they relentlessly want all they can take from you. I am not a fan of the save point & retry strategy but sometime you got to do what you got to do. Overall, if you're familiar with the Civilization Series try this game a very low price. If you aren't familiar try it at a very low price. FYI I bought this game for less than a dollar. Manuals the are more detailed than the game manual are online. The version I brought did not have an activated tutorial either. Cheers.			"

												Vincent Price's most helpful reviews: Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete. Civilization III (or Civ III for short) is an argricultural war simulator, in which you build wheat, farm iron, and thresh people in a significant battle over land and cities.Should you take too long to murder your foes, the game may decide to just let you win by saying you're so cultural that there's no way they can challenge you, and they automatically forefeit. Which is stupid, because a rich culture like that is not as likely to have the vast killing potential an uncultured brutish army nation would, but alas, not everything in life, or Civ, is logical.10/10 with a friend, 6/10 by yourself, 2/10 when you spend hours trying to port forward to get it to work properly on multiplayer. Recommended for people who want their lives consumed entirely.			"

												Perfectly captures the epic sweep of the previous games but adds a bunch of new features that improve upon an already brilliant concept. It's superior in every way to ""Civilization II""—and for that matter, any game of this type in recent memory. To make a long story short, Civilization III is a worthy heir for the franchise and a definite must have for any strategy gamer who doesn't want us to make fun of them.			"

												I'll admit the first time I played the game I thought it was a huge mistake buying it. After looking online for some sort of tutorial I found out that you could enable tutorial mode in options. It was uphill from there. I built towns, By towns I mean 2, I fought barbarians, I claimed my own mini island... From... Barbarians... , I mined mountains till they were hollow and my towns were rich with resource but... I noticed something was wrong... The population in each of my cities slowly decreased... So I started making a new file... And a new one. And a new one. And a new one.Overall the games very fun and addicting :PBad review?			"

												Many, many, many hours played over the years, not reflected here (I still have the original box, just picked the Steamer up today in a sale).  Many, many, many crazy governments, wrecked military units, risky attacks, frantic reloads, stupid custom city names, unnecessary Wonders, swear words, sodas then beers, and wasted dating opportunities.  This is the classic example of a ""WTF did the last 5 hours go?"" game.  Sid Meier is truly a Gaming God.			"

												This is the first Civilization game that I have ever played. And I have nothing but pleasant memories about it.It includes all the basic mechanics that define a Civ game. But it hasn't aged very well. The interface is archaic and it's all 2D (except for leader animations). Not that it matters much for a strategy game, but still. Civ4 and Civ5 have much more to offer, so it's probably worth playing Civ3 only for nostalgic value. Although, I miss palace customisation and City View with wonders in the later games. Another cool feature is that the leader appearance and title change with each next eraAnyway, if you can get over occasional crashes, you will still spend hours building your empire, but, as I've said, with newer version on the market, Civ3 is mostly for veterans and those who'd like a more challenging game than Civ5.My overall rating: 7/10(-2 for crashes, -1 for not being as good as Civ5)			"

												I love this game because the theme the choice every move counts moving this one regular spearmen (while in the future tech research) here could effect the game nine turns later resulting in the fall of your country/nation so every choice counts and the maps you can play the units the ""mods"" (air qotations) or sonarios installed with the game adds research from the fan commitie when this game first game out and they were on websites so i give this game a 8.2/10			"

												I'll admit the first time I played the game I thought it was a huge mistake buying it. After looking online for some sort of tutorial I found out that you could enable tutorial mode in options. It was uphill from there. I built towns, By towns I mean 2, I fought barbarians, I claimed my own mini island... From... Barbarians... , I mined mountains till they were hollow and my towns were rich with resource but... I noticed something was wrong... The population in each of my cities slowly decreased... So I started making a new file... And a new one. And a new one. And a new one.Overall the games very fun and addicting :PBad review?			"

												Many, many, many hours played over the years, not reflected here (I still have the original box, just picked the Steamer up today in a sale).  Many, many, many crazy governments, wrecked military units, risky attacks, frantic reloads, stupid custom city names, unnecessary Wonders, swear words, sodas then beers, and wasted dating opportunities.  This is the classic example of a ""WTF did the last 5 hours go?"" game.  Sid Meier is truly a Gaming God.			"

												The game is awesome, everybody interested in turn based strategy games knows that. What i`m disliking is the fact, that the support for this version is really bad. I remember playing Civ3+both addons in my country`s language but this version won`t support anything but english. Oh and it removed some options from the multiplayer game. Like setting the game`s speed for example.This version somehow feels less complete than Conquests did.			"

												I bought this game, spent 30 mins downloading it and it justr doesn't open. I've serched the internet of all 'solutions' but every ♥♥♥♥ing time I try to open this game it just crashes. I realy wish Valve weren't such ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and let us have refunds, because this is just unacceptable.I have no doubt that this game is fantastic, but just consider the possability of the game not working on your computer, and remember that Steam doesn't offer refunds.

												The series ended here, as far as I'm concerned. Now, Civ 4 was a good game, and while the less that is said about Civ 5 the better (if you ask me), in my mind Civ 3 was the epitome of the Sid Meier vision for the series and the greatest achievement of aesthetics, style, pacing and general gameplay - as far as Civ gameplay could go.I think this has a lot to do with the predecessors. Civilization: Call to Power was an epic computer game, surpassing and extremely entertaining. Alpha Centauri was of course one of the very greatest titles the genre has ever seen, encorporating gameplay additions and features - so much recorded voice acting~ - that still feel fresh and ingenious to this day. It was into this setting of established 2D, top down turn based strategy excellence that Civ 3 had to plonk, and what a plonk it was.How did it work so well? Well it was the way the game juxtaposed itself against it's lineage as much as the way it reproduced and refined it that really rung true with me. Civilzation 3 was all about resolution, refinement, aesthetics and staid excellence. The pacific colours, the fantastic drawn visions of your cities, the subtly faux-3D border markers, the movements of the characters, sounds and the pacing of the game were all just totally lovely touches that made this experience feel high quality and timeless.Playing it today reveals a game that is completely succesful as a final installment in a series, even though the series itself continued on into the age of 3D. There are flaws of course - in end game especially the dominated maps completely cede any kind of influence over gameplay to your railways, aircraft and ICBMs, the voice acting of Alpha Centauri would have been really great here (it was used for Civ 4, famously, with Leonard Nimoy granting that game degrees of cultural magic that few computer games enjoy) and one could say that consequently the gameplay gets a bit stale towards the later stages of a long game, but it is what happens in the interim - especially the first three quarters of the span of civilization you navigate - that is a really wonderful experience, worth any price.Play it!

												Want to change history, dominate the World, rule as a dictator and have fun while while doing so. Than this is your game. Sid meier's Civilization iii offers players variety of choices to shape customise and dominate all other civlizations through out the game. A worthy sequel to the original civilization games, the makers of this game has outdone themselves. The game has no rigidiry of storyline as mentioned, there is an innovative tech tree which makes sense, there are plenty of civilizations to choose from, whats more is that the Worlds are randomly procedurally generated. Every time you do some thing worth while within the game you get to create an improvetment to your palace. Which is also neat.To be faor there are many positives to this game and relatively no negetives. But to name a few:-Positives1.The game is easy on the pockets2.The game can be played by players of any age3.The game has a neat set of ingame rewards which makes playing it worthwhileNegetives1. The game ends abruptly after reaching a certain technologyAll in all the game for presentabiltys sake is 7/10. A ghreat game for the entire family to play. "

												This has to be the game that I loved the most growing up. Offline and previously owned I have well over 500 hours on this game and I tell you now it has still stood the test of time. You can play this casually or relentlessly and still have the consistent experience of both enjoyment and replayability. Admittingly the AI is a tad bit off and, at the lower difficult, complete push overs but still competent to give you a challenging yet fun experience; plus Ghandi nuked me. 10/10 would be nuked again. You would be silly to not to spend the whole whopping 5 bucks to experience this phenom of a game.			"

												I love this game. Out of any of the Civ games, it is, in my opinion, the one with the best sense of scale. The combat is slightly unbalanced (Memetic mutation of a spearman beating a tank, after all...) and the interface isn't as perfected as in Civ 4, but these issues come up less often than you think. Its editor is simple to use and its modding community is huge even after all these years (possibly even the largest of the series from what I've seen). You can find mods and extremely well-done player-made campaigns about everything from the Reconquista and the Punic Wars to the Portuguese Colonial War. I especially recommend Age of Imperialism (the mod), and Escape from Zombie Island is another gem that shows just how much can be done with the game's relatively simple editor, completely transforming a game about empire-building into a game about zombie survival. But to be honest, even the vanilla, unmodded game is a blast to play and never really gets old.In short, this is a game with endless value and honestly $5 is a steal. It's something I never get bored of and always come back to binge on every month or so. Fantastic game, a masterpiece. My favorite in the series, though I like 4 and 5 too.			"

												When they rebuilt this game for use on modern computers, they -must- have adjusted the code in other ways as well.There is no other reason why, on the second easiest difficulty, I have lost 28 games in a row due to the AI having massive troops, every Wonder, hordes of cities, and all this faster than I can build, no matter what I focus on.If I try for city sprawl, the AI builds them faster than I do, and still somehow has enough time to also field a more advanced army because it's tech is better.If I try for tech, the AI outruns me due to having many more cities feeding it's research.If I go for military, the AI again has better tech, and more cities feeding the military.Playing this feels a lot like the original Reach For The Stars game, where the developers outright state the game cheats in it's own favor.I own the disks for the original game.  I used to play this, and beat it, on much harder difficulties all the time.I refuse to believe the transition to new computers is responsible for the stupidly hard difficulty by itself.  Not on a turn based game.   Ergo, someone screwed with the code and refuses to admit it.			"

												Well once again I am disappointed. I'm not sure why this only happens to me an nobody else it seems but whenever I buy a Civ game that runs with Steam I always encounter game breaking bugs that make it unplayable. For example in this game I have discovered that every time it comes to the victory screen and you get the screen where the leaders who lost are saying a bunch of comments to you.. Well once I attempt to close this screen with the ""X"" at the top right hand corner of the screen the game just completely stops responding and doesn't react or anything. It just gets stuck on that screen. I have waited for minutes at a time. Sometimes longer. Thing is this never happened to me when I owned the original version on discs before. Back then those copies worked with absolutely no problem whatsoever but this one apparently doesn't and I always love continuing my games after the time is up because generally I haven't made it through all the techs or ages even by then and there is usually more to do. Like sometimes I'm involved in an intersting war or world war or sometimes I want to make it my goal to conquer the entire world which gives me a purpose and a reason to continue playing. Giving each game a long life considering I never even come close to completely conquering the whole map. So this is my problem sadly.. I wish it wasn't like this. Sadly in Civ 5 I also had bugs, Beyond Earth same thing. Things that made it impossible to continue. It's pretty upsetting. At the looks of things I'm starting to expect the same thing to happen with Civ 6 since this has happened in all these games which will make me pretty upset since I will want to explore that game entirely.. I bought the Civ 4 collection as well during some sales.. Wouldn't surprise me if I encounter more bugs.. Sadly I am thinking this is more a Steam issue and not really the developers especially considering long ago I've played Civ 3 Complete and Civ 4 flawlessly.			"

												I'm going to start by saying I'm not a strategy 4X kind of guy. I'm terrible at them. This one is no exception. Additionally, I bought this a week before losing internet for an extended period of time, so my hours are waaay off.That being said, I've been playing since 2011 when I was looking for cheap games on Steam. To my surprise, I noticed one of the five dollar games had a 90/100 on Metacritic whereas many other games had a 70/100 at best (I cared about Metacritic back then, sue me.) so I knew I just had to have it. I had no idea what I was getting into.To this day, this one of my most cherished purchases on Steam, and by far my favorite strategy game EVER. I played Civ 5 for a bit, but despite its evergrowing modding scene, I always come back to this one. The graphics still look good to this day (Save for the civ portraits, and dated resolutions. Yuck), and the music will forever dominate space on my music player of choice. Buy it at full price.			"

												My first civ game: bought it dirt cheap during some Steam sale just to see what the series was all about. Turns out this one is so old it is unplayable - I spent 50+ hours getting my head around the basics and made it to a hard-earned ""space race"" victory, only to get an error message at the victory screen. Game crashed to desktop, no victory registered, had to restart from an older saved game. Got the same result again, discovered the error was not a one-off thing! None of the suggested workarounds on the internetz worked for me (.hof file didn't have any read only restrictions, tried changing the victory video file, switched to game's default resolution etc.). I reloaded the last save and went for domination this time, and boom - crash on the victory screen again. 80+ hours now, and while I will admit it was fun while I was learning the game, the lack of the satisfaction from registering any victories is seriously disappointing.The only good that came out of my investment was that I discovered that the series CAN be fun when it works. I bought Civ V recently; I hope that game works without any hitches like the ones that I suffered in Civ 3.			"

												Civilization III I purchased to go back to the roots. I've played 2, 3, 4, and 5. It is definitely worth the purchase if you enjoy older games and or want to see what the game was before IV and V were released. The gameplay is a bit slow but the build up is immersive and can have you hooked for hours. It only shows my short time playing here on steam because I usually play my original version of the game. I must say this port lives up faithfully and I find nothing wrong with it. The battles are interesting and fun but diplomacy and management is where this game shines. If you are more into the combat I'd recommend Civilization IV or V. I recommend this to anyone who played it in the past and loves video game nostalgia. And there's no nostalgia that beats strategy game memories of the 90's.			"

I really don't like Complete, with all its fancy add-ons and doodads. I rather prefer Gold, and Thanks to 2k and Steam, I can't.Thanks internet!			"

												Years ago I owned this game, and had long lost it. It was a game I liked and so when I found here on Steam, I figured it would be worth it to get it again. Publishers shouldn't sell things that they are too lazy to tweek to modern comps / operating systems. Should players really have to google fixes for all the slightly older games sold here? IF a publisher released something for free, no update would be understandable. On games where they charging though, take the 10 mins to update the code so it runs ok vs making playing spend much longer fixing it.I'm running windows 7, and when I start a new Civ3 game, I start with 7 duplicate leaders of my Civ. I have no idea why 7 Abraham Lincolns are doing running around, and with a big bug right from the get go, I have no trust of the game. I did google for it and couldnt find anything for it. After spending 30 mins googling and fixing other things just to get the game going and then going in windowed mode, that was enough. With the 2 hour limit on playtime for refunds, I am not going to push my luck on a game with questionable functionality.I tapped out at 46 min and submitted for a refund.			"

												Civ 3 is a classic, turn-based, strategy game that pretty much set the standard for this sort of game.Time has passed, and there are newer games that you can play (including newer Civilization games), but for those who played this one: it still holds a place in their hearts.For those who have never played this one, you can probably skip this edition. Not only are there many things that feel dated, but the newer Civ games refine this formula in almost every way, making this one obsolete.--- No score ---			"

I would not advise you to buy or download this game from steam, buy it on a disk and play from there. You will not be dissapointed from the disk release. You won't get:- Lagging- Screen Tearing- The game will actually work- The game Speeding up so that it is unplayable- The game crashing all the timeIf steam patches the game to make it playable again, i will edit this review and give it a 10/10. For now, i will not give it any score by default due to coding errors which render it unplayable.Thumbs Down.			"

												This maybe the cheatingest game I've ever played. Literally, at the later stages, it is essentially unplayable, because either your units are so nerfed or theirs are so boosted that nothing can be done.You manage your cities perfectly. You carefully build a technological advantage. You've diplomatically played enemies against enemies.And now it's time. Your tanks are ready to move on the helpless city guarded only by a few men with spears.But there is a problem. For some reason, your tanks lose. So you send in the the airforce to soften things up. But, again, men with spears win the day. So, you park a battleship off the coast and start shelling. No damage. No damage.Wait, an enemy trireme rows up armed with arrows... and sinks your battleship.That's when you realize. The game is a cheating piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												General - 8.0Sid Meier's Civilization is one of the greatest game franchises ever, it's a landmark for every turn-based strategy game. The name itself tells what the game is about, you pick one civilization, select a location to start, select CPU controlled civilizations and settings for that specific map. Your job is to make your civilization meet any of the victory conditions, which can be through science, military, culture, diplomacy, points, etc. The first game of the series I played was Civ II, back in 2001, which instantly made me a fan since then. However I skipped Civ III at its time, and that is what made me buy it many years later. I paid around 1USD for the game just to see what I missed, and unfortunately, not much. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but if you played Civ IV, in my opinion, there is nothing in Civ III that will be better than in the later game. It's only worth playing for saudosism purposes. It's heavily outdated.Content - 8.5Steam version is a complete version, which includes both expansion packs released. You have a vast number of civilizations to pick and you can adjust some major settings for a location, like temperature, umidity, geological era, water level, etc. You can also chose the victory conditions for a game, which you can fit into your play style, along with difficulty level. The Civilopedia is a tool of great educational value, it contains real data about the civilizations, technologies, unities and almost everything you can find in the game. There is a highest scores table too, but I believe it only displays single-player scores. I don't know if steam is providing some sort of multiplayer support at this time.Gameplay - 4.0Like most Civ games, you start with a settler, a worker and/or a warrior in most cases, from this you have to build your city and administer it's growth with the resources gathered around it, which can be selected in the city radius. Each unity you create in a city has a better use, and through the years (turns), as long as your cities and citizens are productive you'll eventually discover technologies which improve your unities and your cities buildings. You can focus your whole civilization in a few aspects or diversify your knowledge. Every civilization on the map have it's own personality and choices, from warmongers to pacifists. What you have to do is to secure your civilization a place in history. But why I give 4.0? It won't help you get started at all. I'm not asking for a strategy guide, I just wanna learn the basics of the game, what's unique to it, what options I have and what they do. I couldn't find a tutorial or at least a checkbox to display tooltips, even the options in the main menu don't have a basic description. It's one of the less intuitive game I've ever seen, unlike it's predecessor ou sucessor. Of course after sometime you'll start to get used to the controls, but they still feel weird. The UI is not friendly even for games older than it is, Age of Empires II is older and has a much more friendly interface and controls.Graphics - 2.5The game looks very bad even for its generation, Age of Wonders and Medieval Total War had much better visual quality. Civilization III looks so bad that if affects gameplay, you need to often take a closer look to identify some terrains and unities. There are no options for good graphic enhancements, you can not adjust resolution, it's based on desktop resolution, and even tweaking can't get satisfactory results. I know it's an old game, but the ones I cited are old too and are from the same genre. At least the game showed an improvement compared to the previous title, texture quality is better and there are movement animations for the unities.Overall - 5.8Current specsIntel Core I7-4770K at 4.2ghzNvidia PNY GTX 770 2gb at 1201mhzKingston HyperX DDR3 8gb at 1600mhz (x2)HP 1TB SATA III 7200rpmWindows 7 Premium SP1Sony Bravia KDL-42W655A at 1080p			"

												I purchased this game in order to understand and have an enlightenment on the essential game mechanics of the Civilization game series. I am still not sure whether Civilization III was the right choice.Here are a few topics that I wish to highlight:- It is a low-paced, turn-based strategy game with a significant amount of historical content.- There are a few variables in the game that the person should learn before starting to play. Luckily, steam provides us with a manual, so DO read it.- For beginners, this game may become tough, even at the lowest difficulty setting. Even after learning the basics, there are many things one can do wrong.- This game can take MANY hours of your time, and once your civilization has more than 10 settlements, it may take more than a minute to play each game turn. In addition, there may be dozens and dozens of turns before a victory condition is met.- Although it DOES seem to work on my Windows 8.1 machine, there are a few frustrating issues, such as window switching not restoring the original resolution until the game is terminated. Also, the game may occasionally crash on some particular user, and so far it has always crashed after the end of a game. This means that the game could have had a better preparation for modern systems.Therefore, it is both hard to recommend and unrecommend this game. Take this as a midline evaluation. If you have time to spare, go ahead and give it a try. Or who knows, the other games in the series might be more interesting.			"

Product received for free
												I'm sorry, but the game is way too buggy, and super slow when playing with others. I was in a multiplayer game with one other person, and we only got to 640 AD after playing for 3 hours straight. Also, as I retired in anger, the game crashed as I tried to close it. Also, unit stacking is possibly the worst feature the Civ series has ever had. You order your units to move, and they move one... by one... by one... until you are in your coffin, 600 years later, and you finally get that last spearman over. Speaking of units, these cities keep on making military units, past your limit, and you are soon in civil disorder because of money. Money should never be a problem in a Civ game, ever! I'd hate to give this game a bad review, as Civilization is one of my favorite game series(es?) of all time. Please, save your five dollars and use it on something else. May I suggest: save 25 more of those dollars for Civ 5? Or, you know, any other game?			"

												Let me say that this was my first Civilization game, and for being on sale for $5, I am sure I would buy the game again.If you're new or interested in Civilization games, I HIGHLY recommend reading further and/or watching videos to understand what you are getting into:Pros-This game is highly detailed and allows for a significant amount of strategy-management decisions. Learning the system and ""how to beat it"" itself was an enjoyable that I still can't fully claim to have achieved.Cons-There is no help in-game in actually learning the game. This will either add hours of patience in learning the game, or frustration.The computer AI is abhorrent for trading.Fair Warning: This game is SLOW. I am okay about slow games, when I am mentally prepared for it. This game is so slow, whether due to micromanagement, organizing your thoughts, or constant unit/city decisions. In my opinion, the pacing of this game is not evidence of a detailed well thought out game (which yes, it is), but of a poorly designed game. Even in ""speed-mode""...just ugh, it's still slow.I suggest that if you are interested in a strategic, decision-making game, and ok with long games, the Civilization games will suit your needs. Furthermore, I suggest looking into Galactic Civilizations, at the least for the sake of a real tutorial.Again, if you're new to these games, do your research and check out other people's opinions before diving into the Civilization world.

												2 options in this game. Trial and error in a game where nothing is connected. Or just google until you find out what ever it is you are supposed to do. There is no help in the game.There is no advice.I got destroyed by 15 barbarians on easiest game mode in 4 turns.Do not waste time on this unless you are one of those wonderful few who enjoys reading 5 paragraphs of text about how best to utilize workers only to realize there is absolutely no explanation on how to use them or even make them. 2 turns in and city starts burning, without fail. 4 tries on easy mode and either I'm the dumbest creature to ever roam these parts or this game is a waste of money, take your pick.oh, and turning sound off only turns off screen borders for some reason. So just endure the so called ""music"" if you play because if you try to mess with it you can't move the screen around anymore.1/10			"

												6/10, very enjoyable game. Would rate higher but it's very historically inaccurate, racist and a stolen concept. There are too many fictional characters with silly names such as 'Abu Bakr' and 'Shaka' (which is racist because the latter is an African American and they named him Shaka after the character in Land of the Lost). Also, the game is obviously a rip off of Shogun Total War 2, there's even a character called Shogun Tokugawa.			"

												Civilization is like pizza. It's bad for your health, addictive, has a base of wheat and lots of tasty stuff on top...and most importantly, even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. This is by far the worst of the square grid Civilization games (so it's still better than V will ever be, but so is shooting yourself in the foot with a hexagonal bullet.) If you're seriously considering buying this, go play Civilization IV instead; it's a much better investment of your money and time.			"

												Dont trust the one line fanboy reviews. This entire series is one those emperors new clothes type of games. No one wants to say how crap it really is because its a 'classic'. There is no strategy involved. It really doesnt matter what you do. You wait for your advisor to tell you what to build and you click ok. The game is very buggy. A strange glitch produces seven of your main characters eg 7 Queen elizabeths. It randomly crashes when attacking a city. The 'city view' has to be the single most pointless thing I have seen in any game. An identical view for each city that is of no use whatsoever. The cartoonish attempt at humour is just embarrasing and ruins the feel of the more serious stuff like the scientific research, that would have been interesting if it was more detailed. The AI are not funny or clever for that matter. If you like strategy and history this will not challenge you in any way, maybe get it for your kid?			"

I enjoyed it, the learning curve was interesting and I wanted to know how good I could get at it. Some great features stood out, I even played it with a friend on LAN. But it being so dated, and lacking modern user-friendly polish that so many devlopment teams easily manage nowdays, it regretfully doesn't stand up to modern games for me. I would give this one a miss, unless you love RTS turn based games or lost your original disks, since it's cheap.			"

												Well I was hoping for a different experience from Civ IV.  I was hoping that Civ IV was that point where the devs went through a 'lets temporarily sell out and ♥♥♥♥ up the franchise for a while' phase, but it turns out Civ III is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well.Okay, it's not as silly as Civ IV.  In may ways, I still despise Civ IV, but I'll admit it's a nitpick.  I'd give it the same rating otherwise, because it's almost the same game.  Civ IV's interpretation of religion is silly.  Read the other review for more about that.Okay, enough about ♥♥♥♥ing Civ IV, lets talk about Civ III.  But what is there to talk about really?  I tried to have fun, but it was the dullest 5 hours on chieftain (easiest difficulty) of moving around a bunch of soldiers and workers (that's all this game is, soldiers and workers and building ROADS) with the scandinavian vikings that I used to conquer the Aztec empire (ultimately a game of city tag), while fending off Japanese and Romans, I've ever had.  Eventually, I resigned, because Sumeria was really big, Persia entered a 'golden age', and I had to end it at some point.There was no way to end this game properly without playing for another 8 hours, and that was a standard size map.  The one thing I sorta appreciated was how the enemy leaders poke fun at you for quitting.  The victory screen scores, such as 'children per family', 'population', and 'average lifespan', are mostly purely for flair and meaningless.  Final Score - 38/100			"

												If you're looking for a Civilization game try either Civ IV or Civ V, both are better than this.The combat feels too random and the AI seems to be overly aggressive (Something is wrong when someone like Gandhi demands tribute and refusing makes them declare war on you.) The AI also is very expansionist, creating new cities whenever it can.I found no tutorial, so I had to learn how to play the game myself through trial and error.On the bright side, it comes with its own scenario editor.

												A game ahead of its time but a game you have to play if your into strategy turn based games. $5 is not enough for a game of this depth. being around for over 10 years you would think that the other games would replace this, but the newer CIV games just damage the reputaion that CIV 3 has created for itself. with games lasting hours long and a screen resolution required at 800x600 you can really understand how old the game is. This is a must have game for your library, and for this price! what are you waiting for! buy this game!!!			"

												Ahh.. some good old turn-based action, this game is an absoloute master piece! fun and exciting gameplay, MASSIVE diversity between different civilisations, unit diversity and especially game customisation. you can practically change every aspect of the game to make it as easy or as difficult as you possibly can, you can set many ways for different civilisation victorys, adding an even deeper layer of customisability to this game. This game is a must have to any strategists steam library and i recommend this to all of my friends.			"

												This is my favorite of the Civilization franchise because of its pace. Unlike IV and V it is easy to raise large armies and lots of cities. You don't advance through the ages so quickly, so you don't miss out on early age fun and your armies don't become prematurely obsolete. The best part of Civ3 though is the historical scenarios, which the latter Civilization games haven't done nearly as well, they alone merit replaying this game many times.			"

												Zimbabwe conquered the english. I've played my fair share of Civ 5, but this game tops it without even trying. It is just so good at what it does that ... it's difficult to describe. I'll put it this way. I have played one game, I was conquered prematurely, 50 minutes flew by in what seemed like a second. If you're looking for a game to buy which still holds up to the better games of today even, this is definitely it. (also it's like £2.99, so it's not really gonna make much of a dent in your bank account)			"

												I have been playing Civ 3 since I was... hm... actually I'm not entirely sure. It's been a really long time. When it went on sale on the Humble Bundle, I had to get it. The game is simple enough that I could play and enjoy it on the lowest difficulty as a little kid, but complex enough that if you don't think about what you're doing on a higher difficulty setting, you will screw up.I'm currently taking a World Politics class at my college, and I'm constantly realizing just how spot on with how the world operates that the Civilization series as a whole is. Dealing with your citizens while at the same time maintaining foreign relations. Making sure you don't owe the other civs too much. Deciding how much funding you want in each and every little thing...*Sigh* It's a good time.			"

												If you love the wargame aspect of the CIVILIZATION games, this game still has a lot to offer.  I put in a lot of hours in the last two weeks.  Domination games ran about 48 hrs on the lowest setting, longer at higher settings where one must think more about each move, for those who like to micromanage....keep cranking up the difficulty level.   Sorry, CIV I and II fans.  No more Diplomat units.  A very different experience than CIV IV, which became awesome with all the fine mods available.  I admit. This game hits my Turn-Based-Strategy  sweet spot for kicking back and wargaming.  One of the best ""old"" computer games I bought in the last year, not because I did not have it already; because for $5 I got to play an apparently bug  free game inside of 5 minutes on Windows 7 and no making it run on a VM virtual machine.  Gets my Happy Camper award.MAJOR IRRITATING PROBLEM:  From the origional, after a unit moves, the game jumps to the next (not nearest) unit that may be half a world away.  There is no way to stop and look at what your just-moved unit saw without scrolling to find it.  This becomes very irritating after a while.  I had forgotten about it.  It is not a bug, it is programming design.  This got fixed in later games so the game paused after each unit moves, allowing you to stay in an area and complete a battle before moving on by hitting a key when YOU are ready.  Think of a scar on Mona Lisa's face.   Think of a good movie that periodically stutters, jumps or freezes.   Oh, wait.  I already have that.  Verison FIOS, may the gods bless their awesome up and download speeds.			"

												Hey, it's Civ. A great improvment on the original (I still have a copy, and have played it off and on since it came out), and plays great on my old work laptop. Use the .ini tweak (google it, something like adding the line KeepRes=1 to the end of the .ini) for widescreen displays.I hear that either this one or Civ 4 are the best versions of the game. I got both during the Humble Bundle for $1 with some other Sid Meier games. Another great deal!			"

												Civ 3 has kinda been forgotten now with Civ 4 and Civ 5 out, but it remains my favourite. Whilst I can't think of anything in particualar that it did better (other than the attack/defense of troops instead of some weird strength system that makes no sense and a clear hit point bar showing you how much health your troops have left) the overall feel of this game (and it's soundtrack!) make for the most fun out of the 3 games (3, 4 and 5) that I have played. Civ 3 was the first game of the series I played and so there may be a lot of bias based on nostalgic value here, but I still highly reccomend this game to any strategy fan.			"

												My favorite Civilization game, despite its flaws and quirks. I spent a good 10+ years playing this particular entry, and even own multiple copies of it in various forms. (3 to be exact!) I'm a real power gamer when it comes to turn based strategy, and I've always found everything in Civ III to be very easy to minmax. Maybe that comes from over ten years of experience with the game. But I just can't truly get bored of this. Even if I do own Civ IV and V I still find myself going back to III on occasion. I want to chalk it up to it being a good game and not just my own nostalgia.For $5 (and under during sales) this is a really good deal and you can't really go wrong with Civilization, now can you?

Civ IV and Civ V are still the easiest and best versions to play, but if you don't have a lot of money to spend, or have never played before this version is still fun to play to learn how the game works. However, once you play the newer versions, you may not want to come back to this version.			"

												My first real video game, being brought up on all those educational ""Leap Start"" games from way back when, never getting any real games until this one, I loved it from the very first turn. This game is quite possibly one of the best strategy games ever created. It has perfect balance, great gameplay, its very hard to win but you still have fun with it because of the flawless design, the units are all unique and each one is cool in its own way, from the days of stones and swords to fighter jets and skyscrapers, you'll have fun forever. I still remember my first victory, so many years later. I remember just how proud I was, looking at all those beat up other leaders, mine staring at them with a♥♥♥♥♥♥faced grin of complete pompus superiority, I felt like I was god. When you actually win, which I've only done once, it feels SO ♥♥♥♥ING GOOD. You feel like you just took over the world in real life, especially with all the other leaders sitting there, cowering before your might! Its just awesome, please please buy this game, it is a classic that will never die, and everyone should get it, try it at least once. 9001/10			"

												Civilization is the best strategy (none space) 4x game ever made, I love all the Civ games, and Civ3 Call to Power is my favorite, unfortunately it's not avalible on Steam. but none of the Civ games are bad, and this one is also really good, even it's quite old now and the graphics might suck a bit, but these kind of games are not played because of graphics, they are played because of strategy and tactics, then the graphics  doesn't really matter. because it's all about the game play. Civilization 3 is also very light on your computer, so if you don't have the latest monster machine, Civ 3  will run smoothly on your rig. I have ran this game on an old pentium 4 without problems. definitely recommend it. Civ3 is just as deep as Civ 5, it's only older and doesn't look as good, I love Civ 5 to death but sometimes it's nice with some variation.			"

												Probably my favourite of the Civilization series! An oldie but a goodie. It's simpler than Civ IV, and still has loads to do. Plus it's based on the old square tile system instead of the hexagonal system, which is great for if you're not used to turn-based strategy gameplay. Finally, this game has absolutely wonderful music that doesn't get old. Especially when you hit the modern era and end up watching 100+ bombers blow the countryside to smithereens.			"

												The franchise is run through to the bitter end, with players opting for piracy and spacecraft without help or hail-mary, as the plot devolves unerringly to next advances in technology. The tech tree from Civilization II carried the throne room. In Civ III, the multiplayer and marginalised are in an open door to cultural centres around the world, egging on the tech-savvy, New York hipster, python coding sky rise. The introduction is the selling point. Closing on the propogandist last installment, Civilization V: Brave New World. Not everyone knows, but Huxley's Brave New World Revisited is a non-fiction debacle couched in a comfortable sequel for bugs from early adolescence to young adulthood. The gateway to television since Iraq is clouded by war still now, and today, a friendly reminder of our spiritual needs as anthropogists is as healthy as any Black Sabbath. Drugs tear families apart. But babies need drugs to grow. Weather control is a superpower. I recommend frequent save games with a friend			"

												Are you looking for a Time sink?Here you are!This is a basic turned based Real Time Strategy game based around building a civilation from a tribal state to a modern age.The Charm of this game really comes from your opponates, how they'll mock you, or try to threaten you to give them what they want. You can completely civil, or you can be a thorn in everyone's side, which can get to the point of the entire planet trying to destroy you.A problem is that the mechanics can be confusing, heck it took me a solid three hours of reading to get a basic grasp on the game. but once you learn it, it's down, and it become second nature.Another problem, if you can call it one, is that this game will burn hours of your life without your consent, seriously, you will play 4 hours stright and swear it was maybe 30 minutes.8/10 PROS:Great RTS game playAged nicelygreat freedom to chooseCONS:Quite a few things to learn to even start playingWill sink hours without you knowing it.

CONS-Kinda Laggy-Can't really find any multiplayer games-Your cities will try and produce war units and what not, so you have to tell them all the time that you want a library built or something.-When somebody quits in multiplayer, all their cities evaporate into nothing.-In multiplayer, it may say the other player is annoyed with you for no reason.      PROS-Bored of the 16 old civs? This game adds 15 more to join you! That's a total of 31 incredebly diverse civilizations to play as!-Bored? Spice up gameplay with the tons of different strategies to employ along with different ways to win!-Need to get your anger out? Nuke somebody!-Each civilization has a different apperence in each of the 4 ages.

												The game is great itself, but there are couple of flaws, that spoil the pleasure:- random civilization pick always take same seed, as a result you always have same set of civs- sounds are bugged- some buldings does not shown on city viewI contacted tech support, and they told, that will not spend time on this game.This is no surprise, as it is old.Still, I spent a lot of hours in this game and enjoyed it a lot.

Has great in-game scenarios/mods out of the box. Only thing I recommend when you launch the game is adding KeepRes=1 in the conquest.ini file as there is no resolution option in-game. Still has multiplayer too. Probably my favorite Civ game with Civ 5 being a close second.			"

												Review written ~20 hours playtimes;This game is fun, that said it is fun for a certain type of people, I tend to enjoy the early game most(I have trouble actually keeping large militaries)First off you have to micromanage to be effective for longer than a few dozens of turns. You have to at least a thousand years in the future to avoid dead ends. You will at some point have to deal with long stretches of nothing to do but click the next turn button. Which WILL leave you paranoid that your enemy is pulling ahead. (On higher difficulties they are)That said seeing a strategy work when you weren't certain it would, or looking at the 5-6 techs you have on EVERYONE can be amazing.So if you like a game that makes you fear idling, an AI that won't give you a break, and some amazing victories, pick it up.If you have the dosh though pick up one the later ones first; "

												The franchise is run through to the bitter end, with players opting for piracy and spacecraft without help or hail-mary, as the plot devolves unerringly to next advances in technology. The tech tree from Civilization II carried the throne room. In Civ III, the multiplayer and marginalised are in an open door to cultural centres around the world, egging on the tech-savvy, New York hipster, python coding sky rise. The introduction is the selling point. Closing on the propogandist last installment, Civilization V: Brave New World. Not everyone knows, but Huxley's Brave New World Revisited is a non-fiction debacle couched in a comfortable sequel for bugs from early adolescence to young adulthood. The gateway to television since Iraq is clouded by war still now, and today, a friendly reminder of our spiritual needs as anthropogists is as healthy as any Black Sabbath. Drugs tear families apart. But babies need drugs to grow. Weather control is a superpower. I recommend frequent save games with a friend			"

												Are you looking for a Time sink?Here you are!This is a basic turned based Real Time Strategy game based around building a civilation from a tribal state to a modern age.The Charm of this game really comes from your opponates, how they'll mock you, or try to threaten you to give them what they want. You can completely civil, or you can be a thorn in everyone's side, which can get to the point of the entire planet trying to destroy you.A problem is that the mechanics can be confusing, heck it took me a solid three hours of reading to get a basic grasp on the game. but once you learn it, it's down, and it become second nature.Another problem, if you can call it one, is that this game will burn hours of your life without your consent, seriously, you will play 4 hours stright and swear it was maybe 30 minutes.8/10 PROS:Great RTS game playAged nicelygreat freedom to chooseCONS:Quite a few things to learn to even start playingWill sink hours without you knowing it.

												My first real video game, being brought up on all those educational ""Leap Start"" games from way back when, never getting any real games until this one, I loved it from the very first turn. This game is quite possibly one of the best strategy games ever created. It has perfect balance, great gameplay, its very hard to win but you still have fun with it because of the flawless design, the units are all unique and each one is cool in its own way, from the days of stones and swords to fighter jets and skyscrapers, you'll have fun forever. I still remember my first victory, so many years later. I remember just how proud I was, looking at all those beat up other leaders, mine staring at them with a♥♥♥♥♥♥faced grin of complete pompus superiority, I felt like I was god. When you actually win, which I've only done once, it feels SO ♥♥♥♥ING GOOD. You feel like you just took over the world in real life, especially with all the other leaders sitting there, cowering before your might! Its just awesome, please please buy this game, it is a classic that will never die, and everyone should get it, try it at least once. 9001/10			"

												Civ3 is the best turn-based strategy game ever!  I originally bought this game when it was released in 2001 and I still play it in 2014.  I have played the sequels on both console and PC and they just don't have the depth or variety that this masterpiece offers.  The graphics are dated and 2D but that isn't really a bad thing because this game isn't about eye candy; it's about strategy.  This is definately a niche game and not going to be for everyone.  If you are a fan of turn based war games then you must give this a try.  The game starts slow but before you know it you are hooked.			"

												Do you have a life? Not anymore. Civilization 3 is great. It takes a bit of micromanaging to get things going, but once you have a few cities estabished and a decent army built, there's no need to manually select what they build each time a tas finishes or your queue empties. A warning: The game's tutorial mode is nicely hidden, and turning on ""tutorial"" isn't as helpful as it sounds. To play through the actual tutorial levels, go to ""Campaigns"" from the main menu. Then go to the campaigns that begin with the number 0. These levels will help a lot.			"

												I own both Civ III and Civ V and I would say that I enjoy Civ III more. It has a much easier learning curve than Civ V and I find it all around easier as well, plus some nice retro graphics and a very enjoyable soundtrack. My gradfather gave me vanilla Civ III and I got hours and hours of gameplay out of it, then I decided to buy the complete version on steam, and let me tell you, it DOUBLES the content of the original game. For the low price of $4.99 (and occasionally lower) I definatly recomend it. Fair waring though, in all of my games with the french as my competitors, I can safely say that they are giant, self-rightous♥♥♥♥♥holes. Never make deals with them.			"

												(ignore how long it says I've played; I got this game when it first came out for MacOS 9, and actually have a couple hundred hours sunk into it.)This is the first Civ game I've ever played, and even after IV and V, it's still my favorite. There are a number of wonderful features that don't exist in the later games that I miss whenever I play them (palaces, roads across mountains, subtle references to Civ I bugs, actual in-depth physical documentation, etc). If you can stand the dated graphics and hard-to-set-up multiplayer, it's a 10/10. If you can't, it's a 10/10. Get this game. It's so good.Rating: 10/10			"

												OKay, First off, this may be a little biased as Civ 3 was the game that introduced me to the franchise. That said, It' s a solid 4X title, Graphically, it's obviously not going to be State of the Art, but I've never found that to matter with this genre; and apparently neither have most people given that one of the most popular 4X games around is Alpha Centari, which came out in 1999. Sorry, got a bit off topic.Like all the Civ games, Civilization 3 puts you in control of a settler and warrior, kicks you into the oceon that is its game play and tells you to swim. The tutorial is there, but it's basically a series of tips that pop up when you start doing things. well written and concise, but they don't force your hand. Also like the other Civ games, there is a large tech tree and ages to advance through as your empire grows. The main appeal of the game is that no two playthroughs [which can take weeks to months if you play casually] are ever going to be the same. One game History may play out as you destroy the Aztecs as the Spanish... but in the next game, Gahndi might nuke your American♥♥♥♥♥into oblivion. Ultimately, 4X games aren't for everyone, but everyone should give the genre a try and at the price they're asking for it, Civ 3 is an affordable, still good looking, and complete introduction to the genre as well as a game that experienced players will enjoy for years to come.[[A note on the CIv Franchise: those of you who started civ with 4 or 5 should also give 3 a try, the three titles are honestly different enough that they could be said to be equally good in their own right, assuming of course that you have the DLC for Civ 5, otherwise.... *shudders*]]			"

This game is a must have to any strategists steam library and i recommend this to all of my friends.			"

I hated how all my citizens would be unhappy all the damn time.Then I started playing as Gandhi, supreme overlord of death and war, and all my problems got trampled by hoards war elephants that cost no extra resources to build and have the same attack, defense, and movement range as knights.This game still makes me feel like I've just been cucked though.10/10 would request a refund again.

												Civilization is the best strategy (none space) 4x game ever made, I love all the Civ games, and Civ3 Call to Power is my favorite, unfortunately it's not avalible on Steam. but none of the Civ games are bad, and this one is also really good, even it's quite old now and the graphics might suck a bit, but these kind of games are not played because of graphics, they are played because of strategy and tactics, then the graphics  doesn't really matter. because it's all about the game play. Civilization 3 is also very light on your computer, so if you don't have the latest monster machine, Civ 3  will run smoothly on your rig. I have ran this game on an old pentium 4 without problems. definitely recommend it. Civ3 is just as deep as Civ 5, it's only older and doesn't look as good, I love Civ 5 to death but sometimes it's nice with some variation.			"

												--My review is done from the viewpoint of having played the iOS version of Civilization: Revolution--Thanks to playing Revolution, I had some idea of how everything would work.  I do recommend finding tutorials on this if you've never played anything Civ before.  http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3910/manuals/manual.pdf?t=1400366001  This seems to be a very complete version of the manual, maybe to such a degree as to be an overload of information, but it should be useful in addressing issues.My first impression is that it is a good game, with a decent balance between depth and simplicity in the gameplay.  It is not so overwhelming as to completely kill any hopes of learning how it works, but it is no walk in the park either.  If you prefer simplicity though, you're better off playing Revolution.I enjoyed the half-hour that I spent playing it, and I'll hopefully get some more time in every now and again.  When I do, I'll try and update this review with more details.So to sum it up, it's a good game, fair level of complexity, if you prefer simplicity, play Revolution instead.			"

												For me, this is my favorite Civ game of the series. I like the whole series in gernal but think the ones after this get too complex and the one's before this were still a bit too simple. This one fits the right level of fun and complexity for me.I've been playing since the original so the UI doesn't seem that complex, but I could see player's who never played a Civ game having some troubles. I do think the Civ guide in game though explains well what everything does.If you like a slow strategy game, I think you could find yourself playing this for 20 hrs straight like I just found myself doing :)			"

												(ignore how long it says I've played; I got this game when it first came out for MacOS 9, and actually have a couple hundred hours sunk into it.)This is the first Civ game I've ever played, and even after IV and V, it's still my favorite. There are a number of wonderful features that don't exist in the later games that I miss whenever I play them (palaces, roads across mountains, subtle references to Civ I bugs, actual in-depth physical documentation, etc). If you can stand the dated graphics and hard-to-set-up multiplayer, it's a 10/10. If you can't, it's a 10/10. Get this game. It's so good.Rating: 10/10			"

												I absolutly love this game. It is really fun. If you like the other Civilizaton games you would like this game. The only problems I have had is if you have a newer computer it sometimes has some problems like it crashed on me a few times. Besides a few crashes this game is almost perfect. The graphics are outdated not but the game is still fun and it is a cheap game you can. You cannot beat the price so get it today if you have the money.			"

												I've played this for over a decade and return to it, in terms of graphics it feels twenty times better than Civ IV, in terms of gameplay it's the absolute peak of the Civ/Alpha Centurai series. Multiplayer support that isn't reliant on email (much like playing chess over the phone) would have been a nice fix for Steam, but I'll be honest, I play this alone a lot when I have nothing better to do and my life as a social being is a mess of cataclysmic proportions...Much like my run with the Mongols, we never got very far as I don't like to attack early on in the game...cultural victories for all!

												Sid Meier’s Civilization III is a 4x strategy game, that means the objective of the game is to eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate to win. First off, the game takes some time to get the hang of the concept, but it also just takes time to play. A game could last anywhere from 30 minutes to multiple years. I first read the manual for the game which did help out. It told me of keyboard shortcuts that I never actually used. It also explained to me the basics of the game so when I started my new game I wasn’t completely lost. (This is coming from somebody who hasn't played any strategy games.) The first 30 minutes of my first game I wasted my turns walking around then finally building a city. I played as the Iroquois, they are proficient in agriculture, though I started producing warriors and getting very aggressive. My neighbors killed me and within an hour my first game was over. My second game ended much quicker, within 30 minutes my tiny city was captured. I felt very lost within the first turns of my first game. I felt the game didn’t do a very good job explaining what to do. I just felt a desire to discover the dark parts of the map because it didn’t look very good to me. However, I did find the advisors that would pop up and tell me information that I found very useful and helpful. In this way the game was able to help me assimilate myself with it’s complicated mechanics. One interesting mechanic in the 4x strategy game is its robust diplomacy system. There are many treaties, alliances, trade opportunities, agreements to be made, and wars to be waged. On my current playthrough I am a militaristic expansionist Roman empire I encountered the Aztecs and began fighting a war with them.  Upon seeing the I could overthrow them the Aztecs asked for a peace treaty which I agreed to. From there on out the Aztec and I created a rite of passage where we would be able to cross each other's land. However, I plan on expanding cities and surrounding them then I will take over their cities and kill them. This diplomacy system is a major part of my strategy to win the game. This will play a consequential role of my playthrough of this game. In general I have never been a big fan of strategy games, however I did find myself enjoying this game to a certain extent. I don’t expect to be putting too much time into the game anymore, but I can say that my time spent with it has not been all negative.			"

												Zimbabwe conquered the english. I've played my fair share of Civ 5, but this game tops it without even trying. It is just so good at what it does that ... it's difficult to describe. I'll put it this way. I have played one game, I was conquered prematurely, 50 minutes flew by in what seemed like a second. If you're looking for a game to buy which still holds up to the better games of today even, this is definitely it.

												Civ3 is the best turn-based strategy game ever!  I originally bought this game when it was released in 2001 and I still play it in 2014.  I have played the sequels on both console and PC and they just don't have the depth or variety that this masterpiece offers.  The graphics are dated and 2D but that isn't really a bad thing because this game isn't about eye candy; it's about strategy.  This is definately a niche game and not going to be for everyone.  If you are a fan of turn based war games then you must give this a try.  The game starts slow but before you know it you are hooked.			"

												I have civ5 complete too. Like some of the other reviews I found the game fairly different from civ5. Definitely worth the buy ($1.37 on sale). Not having the culture group stuff from civ 5 makes the game alot better. Another up compared to civ 5 is that it doesnt have the fancy graphics, so I can run it on my work laptop (which has no dedicated gpu) [civ 5 to go? lel].I find the whole idea of *clicking on my temple to add an upgrade (all visual?)* pretty pointless and dumb. I literally just hover my touchpad over the whole screen till i hear a sound, then click and escape. It was pretty annoying to The time it takes to finish a game is both a pro and con. If you are a time sensitive person I would suggest you turn off move animations for all units because you will leterally have your eye pop out waiting for allt he units to move at the end. Some of the other default settings also made the game annoying to play. In particular, if you have units which are fortified or in alert stances, the turn may very well pass away under the default setting unless you do some annoying repetitive camerfa movement. There was a setting to wait at the end of ever turn to make this easier, I'm totally fine hitting space bar or enter at the end of every turn then watch things happen in a way i didn't want it.I still have to learn about some other mechanisms in this game before I comment further. I'll probably add more next time i stop by.			"

												Date: 2/2/16Review Number: 7Game: Sid Meier’s Civilization IIIFrom (Creator Publisher): Firaxis / 2k gamesPlayed On: LaptopSteam Price as of Review: $4.99Total Time played: 60 minutesReview:I had been waiting for this game, and really I was surprised that it came up so quickly in the randomizer.  Now, I have been a fan of the civilization series for well over a decade and a half, since the first version came out on PC, and have played it in one form or another almost constantly between then and now, and on nearly every console or PC I have owned.  That being said, more often than not the versions I have played have either been first generation games or one of the many free clones, so it was a treat to be able to play one of  the games I haven’t played yet.Now, I have to admit that spending only an hour on any civilization game isn’t quite enough to have an adequate run with the game, but I still intend to give it a review based on that limited experience.  The gameplay is solid, though Civilization has a steep learning curve, providing little in terms of understanding asset management and growth.

Instead, you’re playing to feel the inexorable crushing defeat of having your little peaceful civilization on the  corner of the map overrun by whoever is the aggressive one of the AI monsters.  You play to waste time clicking on your cities each turn to watch the build counters drop.  You play to try, and fail, to understand why your citizens in just that one city won’t shut the ♥♥♥♥ up about taxes.  I mean, come on, every other city is okay with it.  You really don’t have much to complain about.  So why riot?

												I really wanted to get into this game. My brother has it and wanted me to play with him. I got it, and noticed it suffered from frquent crashes on my machine (even after going on countless forums and looking for answers there), no multi-monitor support (I couldn't move the camera to the left without moving my mouse off of the screen), and I found it to be a chore to even attempt to try to get it working (from y'know, the frequent crashing and such). It looks like a fun game, but that doesn't matter if the game just simply doesn't work.But who knows? Might just be a problem on my machine...			"

												A very confusing game to play if it is your first time playing a Civ or other turn based strategy game. With enough perseverance, you'll learn the ropes though. While a more simple game than its successors Civ 4 and Civ 5, this game is extremely complex but still wildly fun and addicting. It doesn't make my computer slow at all and is fun to play alone, especially in an airport or on a sick day. It can, however, still be enjoyed just as much in 5 minute intervals as a pick-up-and-play game. 5/5 would recommend to anyone with patience and an appreciation for historical accuracy.			"

												--My review is done from the viewpoint of having played the iOS version of Civilization: Revolution--Thanks to playing Revolution, I had some idea of how everything would work.  I do recommend finding tutorials on this if you've never played anything Civ before.  http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3910/manuals/manual.pdf?t=1400366001  This seems to be a very complete version of the manual, maybe to such a degree as to be an overload of information, but it should be useful in addressing issues.My first impression is that it is a good game, with a decent balance between depth and simplicity in the gameplay.  It is not so overwhelming as to completely kill any hopes of learning how it works, but it is no walk in the park either.  If you prefer simplicity though, you're better off playing Revolution.I enjoyed the half-hour that I spent playing it, and I'll hopefully get some more time in every now and again.  When I do, I'll try and update this review with more details.So to sum it up, it's a good game, fair level of complexity, if you prefer simplicity, play Revolution instead.			"

												I still hold that this is the best Civilization that Firaxis ever did.

												Bought this originally when PC games came out in those big square boxes, and to be fair it does show its age. The graphics aren't enivable at all because, well, it is nearly 14 years old. It crashes sometimes too. There is quite a learning curve, but after a while you do get through it. The AI is random or too predictable at times, if they plop a stack randomly into your territory and refuse to leave, they're 90% going to declare war. Playing on easier levels, outsmarting the AI is fairly formulaic, aggressive expansion for the first half, strategically stealing all resources and then ploughing through them all. Small maps are too small, and if you create a massive map (which you can do in the editor, which itself has a learning curve) there is a city limit of 450. The game reaches its limit, but by that point each turn is so long, why bother. Naval conflict is always a bit piddly too. But really the base game has a simple enough format that its almost like a PC version of Monopoly. You can play it again and again, no fancy 3D experience or anything, the graphics really don't impede gameplay. 14 years later its still perfectly playable and, importantly, provides a fun and varied experience. Each game comes out wildly different from the last one, and every time you play a new challenge will arise. The randomized earths created offer nearly infinite variety and eliminate any boredom you could experience with similar games. I can easily play this game for hours and hours. Similar to Paradox games, once you start a campaign its hard to finish, there is enough variety in maps you always want to do something else. Games can easily go far into the future, and with some mods you can add some variety onto the existing game's timeline. 9/10 game!			"

												A little less than a decade ago, this game got me started on the whole Civilization series. It was definitely a life-changer: after many years of playing, I liked it so much that when Civ 4 came out I still preferred 3 over the new one. The map editor included with the game is very straightforward to use - that's always a plus with any game. (cf. StarCraft) I used to use it to do things like editing the Earth map so that all the civs start at their actual capital locations. Oh what fun I had over the years, not only standing the test of time but also writing my own world history...Now that I am well and truly a Civ 5 player, I doubt I'll ever go back to this game; but this game is definitely worth a play if you have never played any of the Civilization games before. While I do recommend that you start with the latest title, it could also be a good idea to start at 3 and work your way up, see how things have changed over the past decade.... Just don't come blaming me 5 hours later asking where all your time has gone after just a few ""short"" turns.			"

												Date: 2/2/16Review Number: 7Game: Sid Meier’s Civilization IIIFrom (Creator Publisher): Firaxis / 2k gamesPlayed On: LaptopSteam Price as of Review: $4.99Total Time played: 60 minutesReview:I had been waiting for this game, and really I was surprised that it came up so quickly in the randomizer.  Now, I have been a fan of the civilization series for well over a decade and a half, since the first version came out on PC, and have played it in one form or another almost constantly between then and now, and on nearly every console or PC I have owned.  That being said, more often than not the versions I have played have either been first generation games or one of the many free clones, so it was a treat to be able to play one of  the games I haven’t played yet.Now, I have to admit that spending only an hour on any civilization game isn’t quite enough to have an adequate run with the game, but I still intend to give it a review based on that limited experience.  The gameplay is solid, though Civilization has a steep learning curve, providing little in terms of understanding asset management and growth.  This version does allow workers to auto-update the surrounding areas around the cities, so some of the more mundane tasks of the earlier versions are removed ,at least to an extent, however the controls around individual units have been reduced to a sort of drag and drop system, which can get confusing, especially when requiring units to change direction mid order.

												If you're looking for ludicrous and war-mongering AI, as well as the ability to make your civilization happy without a circus and other buildings that provide happiness, this is the game for you!In all seriousness, this is a great game. It is 100% worth the $1.24 you pay when it goes on sale! It is very easy to manage your cities' happiness and production! With Civ III, you can que production items, unlike Civ V, which makes the game enjoyable. As well as allows you to have very productive cities. The way it makes that aspect of the game more enjoyable is that you don't have to click on the choose production icon every few turns. However, it sometimes likes to just switch to needless outdated military units after it runs out of production items in a que. Another nice feature of this game is the selecting how you want your game to be set up. It allows you to choose how old the earth is when you start the game. As well as has a few more features that are absent in Civ 5.The only cons to this are the aforementioned AI, and playing it on a newer computer. The AI are typically kind of crazy when it comes to deals, and get really annoyed if you decline them. Which typically leads to war with them eventually. I seem to have a problem where the AI all declare war with me. Also, the AI expand their civilizations really fast, so if you buy this, make sure to settle as many cities as possible in the beginning of the game! Although that really applies to any Civ Game. Finally, Civ 3 seems to run too fast on newer computers, and it will skip through some animations. Other than that, this is a really great game! Especially when it is slightly more expensive than a pack of gum!			"

												Sid Meier’s Civilization III is a 4x strategy game, that means the objective of the game is to eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate to win. First off, the game takes some time to get the hang of the concept, but it also just takes time to play. A game could last anywhere from 30 minutes to multiple years. I first read the manual for the game which did help out. It told me of keyboard shortcuts that I never actually used. It also explained to me the basics of the game so when I started my new game I wasn’t completely lost. (This is coming from somebody who hasn't played any strategy games.) The first 30 minutes of my first game I wasted my turns walking around then finally building a city. I played as the Iroquois, they are proficient in agriculture, though I started producing warriors and getting very aggressive. My neighbors killed me and within an hour my first game was over. My second game ended much quicker, within 30 minutes my tiny city was captured. I felt very lost within the first turns of my first game. I felt the game didn’t do a very good job explaining what to do. I just felt a desire to discover the dark parts of the map because it didn’t look very good to me. However, I did find the advisors that would pop up and tell me information that I found very useful and helpful. In this way the game was able to help me assimilate myself with it’s complicated mechanics. One interesting mechanic in the 4x strategy game is its robust diplomacy system. There are many treaties, alliances, trade opportunities, agreements to be made, and wars to be waged. On my current playthrough I am a militaristic expansionist Roman empire I encountered the Aztecs and began fighting a war with them.  Upon seeing the I could overthrow them the Aztecs asked for a peace treaty which I agreed to. From there on out the Aztec and I created a rite of passage where we would be able to cross each other's land. However, I plan on expanding cities and surrounding them then I will take over their cities and kill them. This diplomacy system is a major part of my strategy to win the game. This will play a consequential role of my playthrough of this game. In general I have never been a big fan of strategy games, however I did find myself enjoying this game to a certain extent. I don’t expect to be putting too much time into the game anymore, but I can say that my time spent with it has not been all negative.			"

												Civilization has been one of the main cornerstones of the 4X genre since its first entry in the 90s. I grew up playing tons of Civilization II until my brother got a copy of Civilization III for Christmas, and I've loved it ever since.PROS:+Grand strategy based on ruling an empire and balancing multiple facets including your militaristic, economic, industrial, scientific, and diplomatic agendas.+Impressive number of Civilizations to play as (over 30), each with its own advantages and disadvantages.+Despite the number of potential Civilizations, each plays with its own distinctive style.+More peaceful options to win than spaceship-building.+Numerous scenarios (or Conquests) including WWII in the Pacific, Sengoku-era Japan, Pre- and Post-Columbus America, and the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.+Abnormally good soundtrack.+Difficult to master, like many good strategy games.+Introduces new game mechanics like war weariness, forced labor, and corruption.+Included is a Scenario-maker, which is very comprehensive and allows for the addition of entirely-new civilizations, technologies, and maps.+There's many of the popular fan-made maps and scenarios already installed with the game.+Mods! (on CivFanatics)CONS:-Loses some of the characteristics form Civilization II (such as wonder movies, animated high councils, and ""Our words are backed with NUCLEAR WEAPONS!""-Doesn't run as well on modern machines. I've had game crashes on the Victory Screen, but I've heard of people not even being able to start the game.-Tutorial hints hidden in the Preferences menu, so unless you've played Civilization II or IV, this one's pretty hard to learn. Other Civilizations (including this game's direct predacessor) automatically turned on the hints if played on the lowest difficulty, or had menus for learning the game.Personally, it's my favorite of the grid-based Civilizations, and I always come back for more.

Never really allowing the ability to imerse yourself in it. If you're a computer genius and can figure out how to get it to run, I highly recommend this classic.			"

												This game is complicated, difficult, frustrating, and oh my goodness so much fun. I think this is probably *the* gold standard for turn-based strategy games, even now, all these years later. I've tried later iterations of the Civ franchise, but /// is still my favourite. The 2D graphics are clear and very pretty. The mechanics are incredibly detailed and complicated, but also fit nicely together into a unified whole. The gameplay is fun, and the game always gives you plenty of different things to do -- without making you feel overwhelmed (well, at least once you get used to the basics). The interface gives you access to tons of information and lots and lots of options without ever feeling cluttered; in fact, on most of the screens you'll be seeing, the UI feels slick and very attractive, while still remaining effective. The game even has a lovely sense of humour -- the ""you say you want a revolution?"" bit always makes me smile. :)In short, this is one of the very best computer games I've ever played, in any genre, and definitely the best strategy game. At this ridiculously low price, which includes all of the game's various expansions (including internet multiplayer, which still works very nicely and will lead to lots of fun and/or horribly frustrating gameplay time with friends), there is no reason not to snap it up.

												Who cares what I think? This reveiw will give you the facts, then let you decide if it's good or not by yourself!     CONS-Kinda Laggy-Can't really find any multiplayer games-Your cities will try and produce war units and what not, so you have to tell them all the time that you want a library built or something.-When somebody quits in multiplayer, all their cities evaporate into nothing.-In multiplayer, it may say the other player is annoyed with you for no reason.      PROS-Bored of the 16 old civs? This game adds 15 more to join you! That's a total of 31 incredebly diverse civilizations to play as!-Bored? Spice up gameplay with the tons of different strategies to employ along with different ways to win!-Need to get your anger out? Nuke somebody!-Each civilization has a different apperence in each of the 4 ages. For example, if somebody is playing Rome, in the industrial era, Ceaser will be wearing glasses!-Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It is AWESOME!!!			"

												From the very beginning, every mainline edition of the Civilization series has gotten an average of a 90-95% user approval rate which is a greater approval rate than that normally ascribed to civilization itself. This could be due to the fact that the Civilization seies simply soars while civilization itself seems to soar and stink in equal measure. Then again, it could be that the game of Civilization simply appeals to the inner narcissist lurking somewhere within us all. After all, how often is it you can be elected ruler of your nation by popular acclaim, rule them in a governmental form of your choice, eventually rise to rule to world, establish Earth's first off world colony, and live for centuries. I have to admit that is slightly more ambitious than my own real world expectations, but I do have an eye on the North American continent. Consider yourself warned.Now don't get me wrong here. I am not trying to say that Civilization is the best turn based, civ building, strategy game ever. That would be unfair to all those games I have not gotten around to trying. What I can say is that it is by far the best I have ever played, and narcissist that I am, I will try most anything that gives me a shot at world domination.The Civilization series is up to Civ-5 at this point, but Civ-3 is a game which endures the times, remains comparable to like games of more recent production, and holds a special place in my heart when compared to the newer versions of this long running classic. Later editions of this game introduce elements which alter the play style and base strategy of the game, but while I believe that Civ-4 & 5 remain true to the original construct to a large degree, it is Civ-3 which most closely  resembles the original. In fact, it is exactly like the original, but with greater user options, and smoother game play. If you have been thinking about giving this series a try, Civ-3 is a great place to start. With the release of Civ-5, the Steam price for Civ-3 is a mere $5.00 which in my opinion makes it one of the best bargains in the entire Steam Library. Just one run through of this game will keep you occupied for longer than the run time of a long movie, and when was the last time you got into a movie theatre for &5.00 eh? I began playing this game when it first came out for PC in the 90's, continue to play it to this day, and played Civ-1 & 2 before that. How's that for a testament for long term replayability? I simply could not recommend another game of this type more highly.			"

												If you're looking for ludicrous and war-mongering AI, as well as the ability to make your civilization happy without a circus and other buildings that provide happiness, this is the game for you!In all seriousness, this is a great game. It is 100% worth the $1.24 you pay when it goes on sale! It is very easy to manage your cities' happiness and production! With Civ III, you can que production items, unlike Civ V, which makes the game enjoyable. As well as allows you to have very productive cities. The way it makes that aspect of the game more enjoyable is that you don't have to click on the choose production icon every few turns. However, it sometimes likes to just switch to needless outdated military units after it runs out of production items in a que. Another nice feature of this game is the selecting how you want your game to be set up. It allows you to choose how old the earth is when you start the game. As well as has a few more features that are absent in Civ 5.The only cons to this are the aforementioned AI, and playing it on a newer computer. The AI are typically kind of crazy when it comes to deals, and get really annoyed if you decline them. Which typically leads to war with them eventually. I seem to have a problem where the AI all declare war with me. Also, the AI expand their civilizations really fast, so if you buy this, make sure to settle as many cities as possible in the beginning of the game! Although that really applies to any Civ Game. Finally, Civ 3 seems to run too fast on newer computers, and it will skip through some animations. Other than that, this is a really great game! Especially when it is slightly more expensive than a pack of gum!			"

												Sid Meier’s Civilization III is a 4x strategy game, that means the objective of the game is to eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate to win. First off, the game takes some time to get the hang of the concept, but it also just takes time to play. A game could last anywhere from 30 minutes to multiple years. I first read the manual for the game which did help out. It told me of keyboard shortcuts that I never actually used. It also explained to me the basics of the game so when I started my new game I wasn’t completely lost. (This is coming from somebody who hasn't played any strategy games.) The first 30 minutes of my first game I wasted my turns walking around then finally building a city. I played as the Iroquois, they are proficient in agriculture, though I started producing warriors and getting very aggressive. My neighbors killed me and within an hour my first game was over. My second game ended much quicker, within 30 minutes my tiny city was captured. I felt very lost within the first turns of my first game. I felt the game didn’t do a very good job explaining what to do. I just felt a desire to discover the dark parts of the map because it didn’t look very good to me. However, I did find the advisors that would pop up and tell me information that I found very useful and helpful. In this way the game was able to help me assimilate myself with it’s complicated mechanics. One interesting mechanic in the 4x strategy game is its robust diplomacy system. There are many treaties, alliances, trade opportunities, agreements to be made, and wars to be waged. On my current playthrough I am a militaristic expansionist Roman empire I encountered the Aztecs and began fighting a war with them.  Upon seeing the I could overthrow them the Aztecs asked for a peace treaty which I agreed to. From there on out the Aztec and I created a rite of passage where we would be able to cross each other's land. However, I plan on expanding cities and surrounding them then I will take over their cities and kill them. This diplomacy system is a major part of my strategy to win the game. This will play a consequential role of my playthrough of this game. In general I have never been a big fan of strategy games, however I did find myself enjoying this game to a certain extent.

												Date: 2/2/16Review Number: 7Game: Sid Meier’s Civilization IIIFrom (Creator Publisher): Firaxis / 2k gamesPlayed On: LaptopSteam Price as of Review: $4.99Total Time played: 60 minutesReview:I had been waiting for this game, and really I was surprised that it came up so quickly in the randomizer.  Now, I have been a fan of the civilization series for well over a decade and a half, since the first version came out on PC, and have played it in one form or another almost constantly between then and now, and on nearly every console or PC I have owned.  That being said, more often than not the versions I have played have either been first generation games or one of the many free clones, so it was a treat to be able to play one of  the games I haven’t played yet.Now, I have to admit that spending only an hour on any civilization game isn’t quite enough to have an adequate run with the game, but I still intend to give it a review based on that limited experience.  The gameplay is solid, though Civilization has a steep learning curve, providing little in terms of understanding asset management and growth.  This version does allow workers to auto-update the surrounding areas around the cities, so some of the more mundane tasks of the earlier versions are removed ,at least to an extent, however the controls around individual units have been reduced to a sort of drag and drop system, which can get confusing, especially when requiring units to change direction mid order.  The graphics are about what you can expect from a fifteen year old civilization game, though units are easily enough distinguished from each other, there isn't much else there in terms of fancy looks.  But then again, that isn’t why you’re playing.  Instead, you’re playing to feel the inexorable crushing defeat of having your little peaceful civilization on the  corner of the map overrun by whoever is the aggressive one of the AI monsters.  You play to waste time clicking on your cities each turn to watch the build counters drop.  You play to try, and fail, to understand why your citizens in just that one city won’t shut the ♥♥♥♥ up about taxes.  I mean, come on, every other city is okay with it.  You really don’t have much to complain about.  So why riot?  I certainly wouldn’t know.Game’s Fate: This one will remain, and probably take up all my spare game playing time, at least until another one of the series comes up in the randomizer to replace it.Buy/No Buy: Does Ghandi love Nukes?  you damn right you should buy this			"

Peppered with the best in-game encyclopedia this side of Mass Effect, a fantastic selection of community-created content, and you get to live out history pretty much exactly the way you want to. What's not to like? :) Before Civ 3, strategy games were boring. Well, hold onto your hats, because this re-writes the whole damn rule book. Enjoy!			"

												My hours played do not reflect my time on this game, because I had it long, long before it was out on Steam.  What game could better deserve the 'Test of Time' award (except, perhaps, Civ 2: Test of Time, but that's not on Steam).  Civ 3 has a timeless appeal that will bring old players back, and give new players (who, perhaps, have played a more recent Civ) a look at the glorious history of the series.  The beginnings of National Wonders, the Worker/Settler split, rivers on tile borders, rather than on tiles.  All these and more began with Civ 3.			"

												Civilization has been one of the main cornerstones of the 4X genre since its first entry in the 90s. I grew up playing tons of Civilization II until my brother got a copy of Civilization III for Christmas, and I've loved it ever since.PROS:+Grand strategy based on ruling an empire and balancing multiple facets including your militaristic, economic, industrial, scientific, and diplomatic agendas.+Impressive number of Civilizations to play as (over 30), each with its own advantages and disadvantages.+Despite the number of potential Civilizations, each plays with its own distinctive style.+More peaceful options to win than spaceship-building.+Numerous scenarios (or Conquests) including WWII in the Pacific, Sengoku-era Japan, Pre- and Post-Columbus America, and the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.+Abnormally good soundtrack.+Difficult to master, like many good strategy games.+Introduces new game mechanics like war weariness, forced labor, and corruption.+Included is a Scenario-maker, which is very comprehensive and allows for the addition of entirely-new civilizations, technologies, and maps.+There's many of the popular fan-made maps and scenarios already installed with the game.+Mods!

												So first off I'm going to start by saying even though it might show about an hour or so of playtime it does not mean I have not played this game before. I first came across this game at GameStop and I really hadn't played any games since I was young. But I needed a past time because I was dying of boredom being at home laid up in bed unable to do much. I had severely injured my back and I wasn't going to work anytime soon and the depression started to kick in. So anyways by now the game had been out for about 3 years and it looked interesting so I bought it. Went home and started playing it and it was my first time playing a strategy game so I didn't even know if I was going to like it. I started playing around lunch time by the time I know it was dinner time so took 10 minutes got my food and came back and ate while I played. By the time I knew it was freaking 6am the next day! I had never had lost track of time by that much, but man was I enjoying the game. I thought the graphics were pretty decent, the game play was very good and the UI was also good. Of course it was the first time I've had played a game with an in game Civilopedia and I thought that was awesome. The other thing I miss from Civilization III that has not been added to any other Civilization since is building your capital building when your citizens were happy you were able to add one section at a time until you finished upgrading your building. I thought that was fun, even though it was a very simple and quick thing. By the time Civilization IV came out I had around 3500 hours invested in this game and I still have the original disk I bought, but I went ahead and bought it on Steam because they had a very good deal on Civ III, IV and Colonization which I already have the other two also. But I want to keep those disks from getting any damage and besides Steam keeps a running track of your gaming time. So I can safely say this game is what got me back into gaming and becoming a full time gamer. I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME, EVEN THOUGH IT'S AN OLDER GAME. Keep gaming.			"

												Interesting and exciting game!Optimalization: I have a 21:9 LG monitor and the game is perfectly running without any aspect ratio problems! But I have to mention something wrong, too. The game is usually crashing and lagging (maybe it's just for me) but      sometimes it can be serious.Gameplay:Strategy, exciting, relaxing, nice! Nothing more!It seems to be an old game, but that retro feeling during the game is amazing! One of the most historical game on Steam and I think the best part of the Civilizatons series!Try it and play!			"

												A very confusing game to play if it is your first time playing a Civ or other turn based strategy game. With enough perseverance, you'll learn the ropes though. While a more simple game than its successors Civ 4 and Civ 5, this game is extremely complex but still wildly fun and addicting. It doesn't make my computer slow at all and is fun to play alone, especially in an airport or on a sick day. It can, however, still be enjoyed just as much in 5 minute intervals as a pick-up-and-play game. 5/5 would recommend to anyone with patience and an appreciation for historical accuracy.			"

												The fact that having over 100 hours in this game is generally considered as not really that much is a testament to how good it really is, and at 3 pounds this is easily one of the best purchases you will make as a Civ fan.			"

												This game is complicated, difficult, frustrating, and oh my goodness so much fun. I think this is probably *the* gold standard for turn-based strategy games, even now, all these years later. I've tried later iterations of the Civ franchise, but /// is still my favourite. The 2D graphics are clear and very pretty. The mechanics are incredibly detailed and complicated, but also fit nicely together into a unified whole. The gameplay is fun, and the game always gives you plenty of different things to do -- without making you feel overwhelmed (well, at least once you get used to the basics). The interface gives you access to tons of information and lots and lots of options without ever feeling cluttered; in fact, on most of the screens you'll be seeing, the UI feels slick and very attractive, while still remaining effective. The game even has a lovely sense of humour -- the ""you say you want a revolution?"" bit always makes me smile. :)In short, this is one of the very best computer games I've ever played, in any genre, and definitely the best strategy game. At this ridiculously low price, which includes all of the game's various expansions (including internet multiplayer, which still works very nicely and will lead to lots of fun and/or horribly frustrating gameplay time with friends), there is no reason not to snap it up.

												A true classic, marred by inability to play on newer systems. I have attempted to play this game five times now; each time the game has crashed at different points of the game. Never really allowing the ability to imerse yourself in it. If you're a computer genius and can figure out how to get it to run, I highly recommend this classic.			"

												A gem, a cheap gem, a five dollar gem. However unlike other gems that are expensive and for show, this gem is one of the greatests. I have over 400 hours in this game. This was the game that made me make a steam account. In my top 10, hell maybe in the top 5. This game is so good, so good that the five dollars for it is chump change. If you don't want to buy it, wait till its on sale, buy it for the same amount it costs for a soda.			"

												Interesting and exciting game!Optimalization: I have a 21:9 LG monitor and the game is perfectly running without any aspect ratio problems! But I have to mention something wrong, too. The game is usually crashing and lagging (maybe it's just for me) but      sometimes it can be serious.Gameplay:Strategy, exciting, relaxing, nice! Nothing more!It seems to be an old game, but that retro feeling during the game is amazing! One of the most historical game on Steam and I think the best part of the Civilizatons series!Try it and play!			"

												Recommended because it's so cheap. Yeah, the game's old and flawed (and not totally stable), but it's still good fun as well. Even if you only play through a few games, at this price it's still worth it. Go ahead and give it a shot.The one exception to this would be if you're used to playing Civ 4, in which case the issues from this game that that one fixed might be too frustrating for you.			"

												Like all 4x games this is more addicting then it has a right to be. Playing my first game right now but was getting tired so I figured I would check the time because I didn't want to be up too late (past 10p), figured it might be 11-12 considering how tired I was. 4:30am lol... It's 6:30 now, looks like I am committed to an all nighter... oh well...Just one more turn...**50 turns ago			"

												For those who wish civ 5 and 6 are too complex and overly detailed, and want to play a simplier, more caual civ builder, then id recommend civ 3. You're able to epand and control your empire with ease. You baely need worry about whether you have enough resources to build certain units, as long as you have whats needed to make them (i.e.-swordsman need iron). Buildings and improvements finish production quickly, units are easy to move and can be watched as the avartars fight on your map in front of you. Its not for hardcore civi gamers who want challenge and complexty, its for casuals who just want to vent some stress by invading and massacaring a neighboring civilization.features include-diplomacy, combat, instructing workers and armies, building roads and railways, choosing what sciences to discover, trade, world wonders, differing ideologies and several ways of winning the game.

												I bought Civ III from the grocery store. It was in some 10 dollar PC game dump, and I saw the holy grail standing out. I picked it out and never saw anything like it. Had to beg my mom for it. That was 2004. Played it for years off and on, trying to learn everything about Civ III will drive you mad. Little did I know there was a complete edition with so much more content. Civ III Complete is the best Civ game. The game concepts are way ahead of it's time, and the way you have to manage you're Civ matters more than any soldier. Just opening the game and reading the Civ-pedia will leave you speechless with history lessons. I learned alot just by reading in-game. If you love prior Civ games before III, I reccomend you pick up this game and enjoy the good old days of Civ. This is the high point in Civ.			"
