												My review is becoming riddled with updates, as the developer has been fixing stuff. Rather than keep trying to patch it, I'm just going to add my latest thoughts up here.They've been very good about fixing issues quickly, and in particular the fact that it no longer pauses or resets when it loses focus is a massive improvement. There are some lingering issues related to the game's touch-interface-heritage (e.g. the requirement to drag tokens around, rather than being able to just click on a spot), but overall I'm much more satisfied with it now.To be honest, I still don't heartily endorse it at the current quality and price (especially considering the price of DLC), but the steam rating system requires a thumbs up or a thumbs down and I think it narrowly makes the cut. Hypothetically, it should only get better from here.I also should mention that at the moment, my review says 164 of 197 people (83%) found this review helpful. Those ratings were from before these updates, when I was giving the game a thumbs down, and that negative review. Hopefully my review is still helpful, but I don't want those people to feel like I hijacked their endorsements or something.------ Mostly-original review below ------Board games are my thing. I have almost 500 board games, and Small World is one of my favorites. I even kicked in for the collector's edition in the kickstarter that brought Small World 2.And... I can't recommend this. Besides being overpriced (the Android version is $10; no idea what DLC costs for Android), it's really poorly designed for PC.Doing everything requires dragging tokens from one place to another, which would be fine on a touch display but is a huge hassle with a mouse.The game pauses if it ever loses focus, which means you can't browse the web and such during the computer's turn. Also, if you're playing an online game, and you leave the window's focus, even if it's played every other player's turn for you and it's your turn now, the game rewinds and plays back every turn again. What the hell?!UPDATE: Quick play is now working, although the sub-minute estimates are quite optimistic. Took me a couple minutes to find a game. I'd previously written that only quick play wasn't working at all (and it wasn't, at the time).There's support for a friends list, but it uses Days of Wonders' servers to manage your friends. There's no way of seeing your steam friends, as far as I can tell, which is particularly baffling since it already goes out of its way to tie your steam account to a Days of Wonder account.That said, the quick play issues is the only real 'bug' I've encountered in the hour or so I've had it. All the other problems I have with it are design issues. Technically, it runs well. There's no full screen option, but the window resizes smoothly to whatever size you want (including maximizing).I'm enjoying it, but I've already sunk the money for it. I don't recommend purchasing it until at the very least the online issues are ironed out, and ideally some more thought is put into how the game should work on PC differently from tablets.UPDATE: Match making for online quick play is working now			"

												When Small World 2 functions properly, it's a fun and faster incarnation of its tabletop predecessor. The game is arguably easier to play than its tabletop incarnation because it prevents players from making invalid moves and sometimes indicates possible moves. It also makes it easier for players to keep track of numbers like turns and quantities of troops. The game also captures the aesthetic of Small World very well, and actions are played out rather pleasantly. However, the game crashes or bugs-out frequently. The game is locked at one specific resolution, which cannot be changed (except by maximizing the window, which may sometimes result in letterboxing). There are no settings options whatsoever, aside from game volume and music volume. And finding a game online is horrendous because creating and joining games is tedious, and that's if there's even anyone online to play with (which there more often than not, is not). Many of the UI elements can be confusing, especially since the tooltips (when functional) aren't always informative. Parts of the UI, particularly text, will even change the game's cursor to the system or text cursor, making the entire game feel cheap and poorly made. One would expect many of these issues to be solved, or at least addressed, shortly after the game's release, but since at the time I'm typing this the game has been released for over a year, I believe that it's safe to say that these issues will not be addressed any time soon, if at all. The entire game feels like a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥money grab, and despite the genuine entertainment it may provide, albeit in small amounts, I cannot recommend this game while these issues continue to exist.

												The core small worlds game is fun and a lot of people want to see a computerized version of it to play online with friends. However it's quite expensive for what you get, only took half a year to make and the DLC option is an insult to any other passionate developer that works his♥♥♥♥♥off to go that extra mile who truely deserves it. Back in my day DLC was called an expansion pack and it was worth every penny. Here we have a set of simple and over priced DLC packs on day 1, something alreay made & a number of fans could poop out in an afternoon if they spent that time to support mods. OK, It's understandable that a company seeks to maximize profits but this developer goes a little too far with asking consumers to purchase an aditional andriod version even after they have brought the PC one. Not sure if that also requires purchasing the DLC twice but its deserves critisim because the combined price tage is approaching a tripple A title.As for the quality of the game itself, there are a few bugs with it. The race descriptions don't always render properly, it appears to use flash/html pages for that and suffer from a font issue on my machine. I also caused the game to freeze when attempting to read the rules as the bots were taking their turn. There are limited graphical options for resolution & sound. All said and done, its entertaining for an hour or so but for that price I think you can find something else that will keep you going for far longer.*update* Some parts of the game looks nice, but the quality of developement feels rushed in how it responds, the screen doesn't scale well in places.

The application must also be active at all times to play multiplayer otherwise you get a re authorization message followed by the turn replaying itself from start which means no browsing on your 2nd monitor to pass the time and even reading the in game rules causes this issue to occur. I like the game but the quality could be better.			"

												Rampant censorship. If you cuss, it not only censors you, but even goes so far as to presume to mute you (even if you are just playing with people you know, who couldn't care less if you cuss or not). So, congratulations, now you can't type anything to your friends at all.Accidentally clicking the ""redeploy"" button automatically ends your turn. No take-backsies. Given that the arrows to skip forward to your turn are positioned in the same place as said redeployment button, it is very easy to accidentally click it.Similarly, if you accidentally drop your tokens on a space (or change your mind about where you want to deploy your troops), too bad.There is no way to change your mind about your turn, even before clicking to end your turn (which is totally ridiculous given that it is a turn-based game. No one can make any moves until you click your ""done"" button to indicate that you are finished with your turn, so what does it hurt to let you change your mind about what you are going to do during your turn?)Other problems with the game:It crashes out frequently.Game options are embarrassingly sparse. You get sound volume, music volume, and some minor profile edits. That's it.Tooltips take several seconds of hovering to show up and are uselessly vague.As I understand it, this was a cellphone game that was ported to the pc, which could explain why it is so restricted.You have to set up an account online to play it, which is an annoyance.My conclusion:Not even worth $2			"

												2/10 Buy the board game, it will run smoother and have more graphical options.Tutorial video won't run. Despite having no idea what the game was about, I managed to win a few games by randomly clicking on stuff. It crashed.It crashed a lot.It's a port of a mobile version of a board game. Which gives you all the thrills of broken drivers, low resolution graphic, no options, and a game lacking any real life or depth. Nor does the game require any skill, strategy or basic knowledge of what you're doing, s you can beat it by just blindly guessing what it's about.			"

												I LOVE the Small World board game (own nearly every expansion, including the hard-to-find ones). Unfortunately, this game is terrible. The computer strategies are often broken, some of the rules aren't implemented correctly (prevents legal moves), and some combinations short-circuit the AI, rendering it useless....all that was when the game actually worked. Now it just bugs out every time I try to play, shutting down the game completely. In it's current status this game is unplayable.			"

												I own the board game and most of the expansions, and my kids and I love it. This is a pretty faithful digital version. My son digitally crushed me twice in a row last night, and it took less time than it would have to play one game with the physical board game. We were pleased that it clarified a couple of rules that were not clear (to us) previously. The art is in keeping with Small World art, although the graphics don't scale well when maximized on a wide screen. Touch functionality is awesome, and using a mouse is not nearly as bad as some other reviewers have suggested. The AI is not 100% there: I've had AI opponents walk all over me, but I've also had an AI opponent play an entire game with their first-turn pick of Hordes of Amazons... Online play, Solo, and Pass 'n' Play all worked like a charm. I've had it crash out of the game twice during solo play, but I expect that will get ironed out in the near future. Overall, I believe it's worth the price for the base game and the DLC. I would really like to see Tales and Legends DLC.			"

  Introduction            	A Small World 2 is the digital adaptation of the popular board game A Small World. Simply put a Small World 2 is a huge land grab that requires a decent amount of thought and strategy. It also has a great tutorial for beginners and multiple game modes. (Solo, Pass’nplay, Local game, and online arena) Along with multiple game modes, it allows for 2-5 player in most game modes. Small World 2 also has three dlc that add different and cool races/combos. Small World 2 is very fun, but the only thing that really bothers me about this game is that it is very obvious that the game is made for mobile devices. This is not a huge issue, but this is very obvious and I thought it should be said.  Pros                Fun gameplay Addictive  Requires some strategy to win Great AI opponents  Skipable AI turns Plenty of Race/combos Online gameplay Local Co-op    Cons               Made for tablet/phone (Pass and play mode) No full screen mode Some overpowered combos     Conclusion                 	Small World 2 is a great game that is fun to play with friends and even the AIs. The dlcs adds diversity to the race/combo selection. With all the different game modes and different races/combos to play with/against, I highly recommend Small World 2 to anyone that wants to have fun with friends or just by themselves. Small World 2 is a great adaptation the real life board game Small World.-HiPFiRED   If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												As much as I enjoy playing this game, I no longer have the patience for it and cannot recommend it. This game punishes you for attempting to do anything with your downtime between moves.Want to Alt-Tab? That crashes the game. Want to view available race combos while you're waiting on someone else's turn? That crashes the game. Playing against bots and want to skip the animations for their turns? Then be careful how quickly you press the button to skip each of them, because one too many results in you wasting your next turn, and you still have to watch some of the animations anyway.			"

												Small World 2 is an easy to learn and quick to play digital version of the popular board game by Days of Wonder.  The object of the game is simple, be the player to gain the most coins by the end of the game, through occupying regions of the map and taking over opponent’s regions through conquests.The rules of the game are simple and easy to learn and this digital rendition makes it easy to keep track of everything and prevent mistakes that can easily be made when playing the original board game.Once the basics of the game have been grasped the skill comes in when deciding if it is worth paying coins for choosing a better race/ability combo, choosing which regions to occupy/conquer and when to send your race into decline and choose a new race.The DLC’s add new race/ability cards creating new combinations to master and get used to.  At the moment, there are only a few DLC’s available and not all of the expansions available for the board game version have made it to the digital version as a DLC.There are many ways to play: Solo V’s AI - The AI of the game does seem a little unbalanced with dice rolls frequently failing for the player and constantly succeeding for the AI (way above what the statistical average should be).Online Multiplayer - Unfortunately recently there does not seem to be a lot of players wanting to play online.  I have gone into the Online Waiting Area to find very few or no games at all available to join.  I have also had the game crash or freeze a few times when playing online with a private game between friends.Local Multiplayer - Great for playing against family and friends when all on the same network.Pass & Play - Tedious way to play but means that the game can be played on just one computer and with only one copy of the game.Overall Small World 2 has made a successful port over to a digital version.  It has been sympathetically done, in line with the artwork and lore of the Small World board game.  There are one or two small issues with the game, but generally these do not detract from the convenience and speed that the digital version brings over the original board game.Pros:Quick to play as there is a turn limit on games.Easy to learn.Many ways to play.Prevents miscalculations/mistakes when trying to conquer regions/calculate coins earnt.Cons:Limited ability to play online due to very few games being available to join.No graphics controls meaning that the quality on larger screens suffers.Occasional glitches especially when playing multiplayer.Unbalanced AI/random number generation.

												I'm still of mixed minds about this game.  I've watched let's play on youtube and Wil Wheaton's Table Top review of it, and it looked like a lot of fun.  Thing is, I haven't had time to play this with others yet, and I wanted to really Learn the game first, so I've been playing only solo matches against the AI so far.  I expect when I finally start playing with others, I may like the game even more.Basically this is a conquest board game for 2 to 5 players, any of which may be live opponents or AI.   A typical match shouldn't take even as much as a half hour and that's With the full complement of players.  The game rules and procedure resemble Risk somewhat, though in a fantasy setting rather than the real world.  It's all about conquering the world, though with a twist;  your 'army' only has a short lifespan and will inevitably be replaced by another army that you also control.  The goal is to build up gold units that you earn primarily at the end of your turn for holding territory, but also through special abilities your armies might have.  The armies are very diverse and represent fantasy races, from hobbits to skeletons, giants, and dwarves.  You get to pick which race you want to make 'active' but their abilities are randomized each game.Strong replayability is built right in as no two games will ever play alike.  The graphics are decent, though the game map/board is a little 'busy' with all of the counters, symbols, borders, and artwork vying for space and That can make things a little confusing at times.  The music is fun and matches the light hearted tone set by the art style.I don't have any major complaints, though I'm not fond of the nickle and dime aspect of the DLC.  It'd be nice if the developers had just bundled the dlcs rather than parcelled them out as they did, but I'm guessing it had something to do with rewards for the kickstarter investors.TL:DR?  Bottom line, if you like board games that involve a good portion of luck, you should enjoy this.  It's easy to learn the basics but has enough 'meat' to make you want to invest some time in mastering the strategies.			"

												Very buggy, but at least gets the gameplay right. A problem occurs when you are in two games and it asks you if you want to switch. If it is your turn in both, it will take you through all of the other players' moves, even though they already went, and then if you switch to the other game, and back again, you have to watch all of those players' moves yet again before you can go, all the while everyone can't understand why you won't take your turn. Lots of crashes and disconnected player in multiplayer.			"

												This was my first experience with Small World.  I've had a lot of fun with it. I like the randomness with the races and powers.  I don't find the computer too easy to beat.  Several of the recent reviews mentioned bugs that freeze the game or cause it to crash, but that hasn't happened to me once.  After I'd played quite a bit of this version, my friends and I got a hold of the board game and gave that a try.  Sheesh, this game is even more complicated than it looks.  I immediately went back to playing the online version where the computer keeps track of all those little details for me.  It was NOT fun to keep track of all the little pieces and markers and gold and move them around each turn.  There were also debates between players about some of the abilities and what could or couldn't be done and I prefer for the computer to very clearly show things you can do in green and things you can't do in red.  I did also get the DLC expansions.  They add some nice variety, but usually I only enable one of them at a time.			"

I hear you collectively cry!Because there are constant bugs and errors. This doesn't deserve to be released. It's a disservice to a great game! The developers don't care that it is putting people off as long as they keep selling right? Wrong.

You can exit the game and continue at a later time once your opponent has finished their turnSteam has a notification pop up when it’s the player’s turnThe Bad:The online multiplayer is bugged and glitchy, which leads to dropped games and nonstartersSeeing as most players will be picking up this game to play with friends, it seems as if it could have done with some more quality assurance testing in the online multiplayer departmentThe overall user interface is clunky and not very intuitiveTrying to get a game going has far too many steps and the lengthy registration requirements seem unnecessarySound design is awful and really could have helped with the immersion should some decent music and sound effects been utilizedCan you play it while the children are awake?:Absolutely. Had a good time playing locally with my seven year old.Did I make time to complete it?:I played and finished five multiplayer games. I would have played a lot more, had the online multiplayer not had so many issues.Recommended Purchase Price:The gameplay is a blast just like the board game, but the online problems really hinder the overall experience. I applaud Days of Wonder for implementing the oft-requested feature for video game versions of board games (so many come out with just local play), but just wish they’d spent more time fixing the infrastructure before releasing the game.$9.99or67% of current retail value of $14.99Reviewer:MisterS42http://www.gamersglance.com "

												Being a huge fan of the board game, I was a little disappointed by this electronic version. No solo campaign-type mode; only thing you can do solo is play a basic game against a few bots (can't even adjust difficulty) Hardly anyone even plays the multiplayer mode. There's no real variables you can adjust when creating a game except for the number of players. There is only one board to play on. There's none of the races, abilities, or places/relics from the Smallworld Underground board game. The DLC packs are pretty skimpy as well. I just felt like there was not enough content in this game for the ~$15 that it costed with DLC; I've played free and $1-2 games with way more content. However, I do still enjoy the basic game and isn't a bad way to spend 10-15 mins now and then. Overall, I would suggest saving your money until the developers add some meat to this game.			"

												Great boardgame gets a great videogame treatment! Local multiplayer makes a great alternative to getting out the box and playing tabletop when kids are around to grab at the 100+ pieces in the game.As for the game itself:It's a Risk-esque territory accumulation game, set in a fantasy world, but without the massive luck based elements of risk. Over the course of the game you'll control different factions (elves, orcs, sorcerers, etc.) all with different attributes that tweak the core rules. Each faction gets assigned a random special ability like flying, berserking or dragon master that further tweaks the rules. Each territory requires 2 soldiers to conquer, with 1 additional required for each additional factor like terrain, fortifications or opponents troop occupation. Eventually your troops will wear thin and you'll have to put your active race in decline; all but one troop in each location is removed from the board. You still collect points for those territories; but special abilities & troop movement are no longer an option. At the start of your next turn you'll be able to select a new faction. Play continues for 10 rounds with points being accumulated for each territory you control at the end of each turn. It's fast paced, with fun art and concept; and also scales very well. It supports 2-5 players, but has a different sized game board depending on how many people are playing!			"

												„Small Word 2” reflects the spirit of the original. I would even say it does it too well, because it duplicates the board game’s issues. The map is beautiful but still motley to the point it hurts the eyes. For that reason, while the application can be ran in full screen, I preferred to play it in windowed mode. In some place new tabs open or the table is cut, but it doesn’t really collide with gameplay. Also I didn’t notice any freezes, long loading times or waiting endlessly for any online opponents.Pros:+ High replayability (different races and special powers);+ Dynamic, colorful, with many negative interactions;+ Working smoothly. Cons:- Paradoxically to pros: many negative interactions (not for persons who doesn’t like competitive games);- Even if you really, really like your little friends… sooner or later they have to die;- Pretty map but hard to look at, the eyes get tired, because of too much chaos on the board.Going to the last verdict: as for the visuals, audio and the game mechanics, Days of Wonder give us a fully satisfying product… but I still prefer the shared hours spent with friends at the game board.

This version gives you everything you have ever wanted from a board game: Something that deals the game components for you and counts the victory points without you bothering - not to mention the ability to skip the CPU's turns and get back to your turn in less than 10 seconds!Not as ""useful"" as the mobile phone version, but great if you ever need to pass the time on a laptop.

												Smallworld 2 is a perfect online version of the great Smallworld boardgame. If you have friends to play with, then pick it up without any doubt whatsoever. If you don't... well, keep in mind that the player base nowadays (early 2017) is fairly small, so the chances to join an open online game are small (no pun intended).			"

												The boardgame feels way better. There is a huge lack of online players to play with. There is no undo button. Background music becomes soon a bit annoying. I hoped for something better. AI is nice by the way. Not a bad game but nothing great.  My rating 6/10			"

												The game itself is extremely buggy, and the developers have known of these bugs for a period of time according to the forums. There has been no recent bug updates (hopefully there is a huge patch coming soon?) but only thing I can say is that it is annoying.It is fun enough, but that's just because Small World is a fun game, I'd recommend buying the real game if you want to play it, but this could be an alternative for those wh want to play online.

												Pros: a straight-forward porting from the boardgame. UI is just like the original - someones may like it and someones may dislike it, and I'm the former. A little inconvenient, but it makes me to feel like playing the boardgame.And...I DON'T need to find a real friends to play the game!!Cons: The friends the game provides are not the best to play with.Above all things, I can't select their level. I want them to keep step with me, but they don't.After several games, it may becomes boring a bit.Anyway, thanks to Day of Wonders for their great boardgames, and the PORTINGS!(More portings please. I will NEVER sell off my hardcopies :)			"

												It's an OK adaption of the board game, but the digital version lacks the role play and social interaction that makes the board game so endearing when played around a table with friends and family.On top of that, they didn't exactly go the extra mile. The graphics are basically the same as the pictures in the board game, the music is irritating, and the implementation is buggy. Graphics twitch as they resize back and forth. The game crashes with regularity, bug reports no longer tended to by the developers. It's basically abandonware at this point, a cheap and cheerful digitization and monetization of the board game.

												I've had a lot of video games on my wishlist but this was one of the few board games that I had always wanted to play but never had the opportunity. After picking it up earlier this year, I can defintely say it was worth the wait. As far as electronic versions of board games go, this one plays quickly and intuitively, and you can run through games against the computer AI fairly quickly. Given the drag and drop controls, I do wish I had purchased it on iOS instead, but I enjoy it enough that I wouldn't mind owning both version. Unfortunately the online community is not terribly strong and it can be difficult to get a multiplayer game going, though I've found that creating a game and waiting usually results in a game within five minutes or so. The AI is actually quite good and presents a decent challenge if you are willing to play by yourself, although they can become exploitable at times. I see it on sale for $2, which is a decent enough price, though I feel the DLC is necessary to fill out the game and that will run you $8 total while on sale, which isn't as slick though probably still worth it. My hours are a little misleading because I've left it open before but I've easily gotten 12-15 hours out of this game-maybe more-and find myself going back when nothing else sounds tempting to play.

												Superb translation of the board game. The AI isn't too bad and often provides a good challenge, which is impressive given the number of different races and special powers they can be combined with. The online and local multiplayer options are truly superb. The game isn't without some bugs however, the android version often crashes but works ok when rebooted and the final scores occasionally disappear only to reappear a few days later. This can be quite frustrating when all you want to do is see who won. The DLCs only work on the platform they've been purchased on, so a steam DLC won't work on android or IOS - you can however, continue or join a game started using the DLCs on a platform where you don't own them. The game is great fun, particularly if you like the boardgame but I've introduced it to friends who've never heard of the boardgame and they've loved it too.			"

So yeah, I'm just happy I didn't pay for it (it was part of some bundle).

It is riddled with trolls who just go afk at the beginning of the game, and those members of the community that aren't trolls are 12 year olds who take the game way to seriously.To be fair, however, 3 quarters of the community are legit players.However, the game itself makes up for the shortcomings of the community and rating system, and I would still recommend playing it.

Only windowed mode!No Resolution size.The Sound volume has a slidebar.The Music volume has a slidebar.There is a tutorial... It's a video however. Which is stupid.You can play the game online.You can play the game Local.About the game.This is a board game that may start very confusing. Because nobody is waiting for to watch a single video. However there is a manual in-game though. You choose a Race and a combo at the right side. Then you will have to select the unit and place it on the field. If it says like 7/11. Then you are able to place it. Then 7 troops will go there. You can only place many troops as you are able to do so. After it you Press on done and then you are able to reinforce and make the troop on the tile stronger. By supporting it on the remaining troops that you have left. And then u have to conquer regions for regions. The game is short because it ends in 8 turns. You can't increase or decrease it.There is a Fast forward, Which will automatically Fast forward that turn of that player. (So you don;t have to wait)Music is okay.Graphics could be a little bit too much.??? is happening moments.Other things.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10			"

												PC port of a table top game. Never played the boardgame, but I'm glad I did not pay the full boardgame price to add this to my boardgame library. Races feel very unbalanced (Think MTG Common vs Mythic cards) and very much leaves you at the whims of of other players (Think RISK but worse) Map construction leaves for minimal strategic choice. Probably worth getting for under $5 to at least experience the design elements if you are into game design. A game better played in person, preferably drunk and when you don't feel like Catan or Ticket to Ride.			"

												I was waiting to review this until I had at least 10 or 15 hours in it, but I think this one needs to be reviewed.This game is good. It's fun, addicting and such an unparalled board game experience. You startled by the bad reviews on Steam? Don't be, and here's why:1. The second highest negative review is written by a guy who has poured in 4+ hours a day into a 'buggy' and 'overpriced' game.2. The three main complaints are as follows: no fullscreen, high priced DLC, multiplayer crashes. One of those is fixed, one of those can be emulated by pressing the large box on the top right corner of the application, and one is true in almost every other Steam game in there. Oh, by the way, did I mention that it's DLC? And that the DLC are not shameless plug-ins, but based off the original board game expansions? And that you don't NEED to buy the DLC to play the game?3. People have said that the SINGLEPLAYER mode of a board game is addicting. The SINGLEPLAYER mode. Of a MULTIPLAYER game. Does that not tell you how much fun you will have in the newly-improved multiplayer?4. People complain about the people who abandon online matches, yet there is a system that allows you to play with Steam friends, and on the forums you can friend people who want to play with you.5. The multiplayer is Asynchronous, meaning when you enter a match, you aren't forced to do your turn. Mum calls you to have dinner? Wait a moment, I'm not forced to rush my turn!6. Multiplayer being Asynchronous means you can have more than one multiplayer game up at a time. Waiting for a slowpoke to finish their turn? Play a turn in another game! The opportunity is there for you.To actually review the game: it's diverse, and you never feel like you're doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥all over again. That was one of my main problems with such board games like Risk/Catan/Ticket to Ride: I could figure out a way to win that was pretty much the same every time. In this game? No such luck. Completely and utterly replayable.The reason my hours are low is because I've had stuff to do, and I play this game called Dota in the times when I'm not free. But I assure you, I'm playing this game a helluva lot more in the future.If you do get this, and you want to play some multiplayer with someone you know won't abandon the game, feel free to add me. I'm open for business in this marvellous game. I guess it is a Small World after all.			"

												**Disclaimer, I was one of the people who helped kickstart this game and therefore have bias towards this game as I love the board game**The Good:* Great board game just as a general rule* The UI is easy to use and works exactly as you'd expect it to.The Bad: * Cannot be played full screen and maximizing window creates a strange cut off look* Expansions are rather expensiveVerdict: The game works reallly well despite the lack of a graphics options for full screen or resolution changes the game plays well and is very fun. $25 is kind of rough for the game with all the expansions and I think they sould lower the cost of each DLC by a dollar, it is a fantastic game and if you can catch it on sale such that the game with all the DLC is around $20 it will be well worth it. For those who don't know what small world is, it is a board game based around map domination. Using races and powers the goal is to try and get the most coins (gained for owning land at the end of your turn) by the end of the game. It is one of my favorite board games and I looked forward to to this game before it was even announced because of how well days  of wonder did with ticket to ride on PC.The game launch was rough to say the least, day one I couldn't play a game online succesfully because it was buggy. I waited for the patch before attempting to play again and once they patched it I haven't had any issues since.  "

												I have very mixed feelings about this. The board game is a lot of fun. I like this on a surface level. However, it's VERY frustrating when you have multiple games where ALL your conquest rolls are blank side up, and the Bot's are ALWAYS full points. This is more rigged than just a strategy game against an AI that makes you work for it. At least randomize it.			"

												The original Small World board game remains a family favorite, but this just didn't make the cut despite a recommendation from a fellow game design student.1. Something seems to be wrong with the computer enemy AI.2. The rules seem to be implemented incorrectly.3. It isn't the wonderful game balance I've been accustomed to.4. Too much of the game seems to be left to random chance as opposed to player choice compared to other, more fun board games of this century.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I guess mine stinks. But then, this game doesn't exactly smell so sweet either. It's been stinking up my Steam Library up for a couple of years and I still can't bring myself to try it again. I recommend extreme caution if you intend to purchase this game. Watch a bit of gameplay before you make up your mind.You also have the benefit of purchasing this game and trying it for over an hour before deciding if you want to keep it. Valve never gave me that opportunity, unfortunately.			"

												Being a board game with ""pass and play"" (i.e., local co-op), I thought this would be a good game to throw up on the TV for parties. It's not. As far as I can tell, there's no full screen mode, and you can't adjust the resolution, meaning that playing at 720p requires hiding the task bar just to see the entire screen. To make matters worse, the fonts are small and hard to read from any distance you'd normally expect to view a TV from. If you're looking for a party game, look elsewhere.Also - there's no in-game tutorial, only a video tutorial that inadequately explains the rules. Be prepared to read the rulebook if this is your first time playing. You might also be unable to view the video tuorial from ingame, as I couldn't, because the ingame browswer ""doesn't support HTML5"". My guess is that it's trying to run internet explorer from within the game, and if it's not up to date (as mine isn't, since I don't use IE), you'll have trouble.			"

												Pretty good if you know what to expect, but buggy.Pros: Recreates everything about the game. The game is great. Has online play, which I admittedly didn't try. The bots do pretty well and can make some really vicious moves.Cons: Bugs. Lots of them. The game froze several times. If heroic halflings hold less than 4 territories, the AI will lock up completely. If sorcerors swap out a pyhmy's tile, the pygmy doesn't get to roll for reinforcements. The A.I. is often very stubborn about going into decline, where it will stay even if its only got 1 or 2 tokens left. Also, even if you click the skip button as fast as you can, the game moves kind of slow. I wish there was an option for turning off animations. The menus are in dire, dire need of tooltips. There should be an indicator for the absolute maximum number of tokens you can have. I went werewolf skeletons and completely decimated everyone, but then it capped me at 20 tiles.Despite these misgivings, overall the game was challenging and fun. 3.5/5			"

												The board game is great, don't get me wrong. But Days of Wonder stifling the Freedom of Speech of my girlfriend and I in a private game between us and her brother is infuriating. She was frustrated with a glitch in the game, so she said ""f*ck*. It BIPPED, meaning it didn't even show the word. She was then MUTED for ""cursing"" in a private game between friends even though the word didn't even show up.This is enough to make neither of us ever want to buy a Days of Wonder product again.Besides that, the first game I tried to create booted me after one turn. The aforementioned game booted her brother from the server randomly. It's very glitchy and not even worth the cheap price tag it bears.			"

												This is a very sloppy port of the mobile version of a very fun board game. The text has letters stuck together. The game runs in a window. When you choose a new race to play as, the description of their abilities needlessly covers the map (which you need to be able to see to choose the appropriate race to kill off your friend's filthy Merchant Orcs) and if you click ""Show Map"" then the races you can pick from also disappear along with the bloated help text. That's right - the area beside the map that's used to show the races you can pick just goes BLANK when you show the map. Just an awful, sloppy port.			"

												So, I should preface this with the fact that I am, first and foremost, a board/card/tabletop gamer. I kickstarted this because I hate Small World.....let me back that up. I hate playing Small Wo...wait.....ok....I hate playing the board game Small World. The sheer number of tiny pieces that are hard to see on the colorful board makes it just the last game in my collection I ever really want to play. So when I found out they were going to put it out on PC and android (Yes, I know it was already available on ithings, butI don't have an iOS device) I was excited because I hoped it would eliminate the thing that makes me hate Small World....and it does!There are some minor issues. The complaints I hear about it from other people is that you have to drag tokens rather than just click, that it doesn't fullscreen right or at all....but these really seem like quibbling things. Yes, it's obviously a PC port from tablets, but it still controls well. The day one DLC kind of sucks, yeah, but as a board gamer trust me....ridiculous add-ons are standard in some games...and this is still cheaper than the expansions for the physical game.So far, my only actual criticism is how horrible the screen is for explanations of racial and bonus abilities....font size and style just looks tacked on, which is really bad for new players....but if you are familiar with the game mechanics and are just looking at that screen from time to time to refresh your memory, it's fine.So....the tl;dr is: If you like the board game but hate how long the setup and breakdown is, this is a must have.

The game is amazing, to the point that you're going to want to buy the physical version. Each game is exactly the same, but each game is radically different- the perfect combination for games. (See 2, Dota)Small World 2 goes on my list of absolute must-have games, and it's up there with a very highly regarded few, such as Ticket to Ride or Settlers of Catan. Get it, invite me to a game or three and let me show you why it's called Small World.			"

												One of my favourite board games makes its appearance on PC finally. All the fun of the board game, with the convenience of automatic scoring by the computer with some AI tossed in if you want a solo game. The DLC decks need only be owned by the game host, which is great if you have friends to play with and are looking to save a few dollars. The one con I can think of is that if you don't buy the DLC you're pretty much only getting the version people have been playing out of the boxed phsyical version for years.Grab some friends and play one of the better board game ports I've seen in a long time.

												I was considering buying this board game (physical board game) so I decided to give it a go in the latest steam sale. I was very disappointed with the result. The game was cheap so I dont think I can ask for too much but the game crashed in every other game. I played like 1 hour and had to restart the game 4 times. The interface is very clunky, sometimes I had to leave the game and come back in order for the ""Pick"" button to show up. The battle against the UI left a very bitter taste and took away the joy of conquering the small world. This is the first game I asked a refund for on Steam, this was very clearly a low effort mobile port. No options, no resolution choices, frequent crashed, frequent UI bugs. I didn't even try multiplayer online because the process was long and no one seemed to be online anyway.I will not be buying the physical board game because this experience was so bad. I'll probably get Blood Rage or something.			"

It keeps the game mechanics, so anyone who has played on the table can translate their experience to the game here easily. I chose to buy the online version for a couple reasons:1)	No set up and no accidentally missing or moving pieces.2)	No accidentally mistaking a rule.3)	The online experience lets me play with friends who have moved far away.If you play German board games or if you like strategy, Small World 2 is fun because there are so many variations on the player’s character choices. You might play trolls or amazons out of habit, but the attributes they have in a given game can completely change the way you play them. "

												This is a brilliant adaptation of the aweome board game... if you've played the board game then I assure you that this is an authentic replicate of the samne game, including the expansions. If you've never played it, then just watch the video, it's vair straight forward to figure out.There's a major, and a minor, problem them; Trying to play online is like pulling teeth. Constant ""authentication"" problems with people trying to log in. Getting a game going is extremely frustrating because of this. (That said, when you're actually playing it's a smooth ride IME).The other minor problem is something that the board game suffers from too but it can't be helped there... they could have fixed it here and didn't. I play games like this with my family; there's 3 of us that play. That means when we play the board game we're always stuck on the 3 player board... never used the 2, 4 or 5 player board. In the computer game although you can play against the AI in single player, you can't have the same bots in multiplayer... if you could you could have 3 people, and 2 AIs. A big missed opportunity.Like many people (probably) I got this from Humble, so it seems harsh to be negative about a game for charity, but if you're getting this for multiplayer, don't bother. Single player is fine though.			"

												Small World is based on a somewhat popular board game, and I purchased this to improve my skill in playing the board game. However, much like the board game itself, this is almost totally confusing. The presentation is nice and entertaining, and plays almost exactly like the board game. What I noticed, though, is that a player has to have either incredible luck or an almost ""genius level"" of strategic skill or else suffer defeat after defeat. This can be especially frustrating, and if you're like me, you figure it's not worth it to be knocked down so often. I haven't played this game much after buying it, and probably wouldn't buying it again. One out of Five Stars.			"

												This game is the digital adaptation of a board game that I had never played, so I was a little skeptical about purchasing it; and if I didn't have friends with which I could play the game, I probably would have regretted my purchase.  However, this game does something that most other Digital/Steam board-games don't: it pushes notifications.During your game-play, you have a choice as to whether or not you actually want to be present.  You and your friends (I would not recommend purchasing this game for the single player) can play the game ""live"" or you can complete your turn and log off.  Your friends will have 48 hours to complete their turn before forfeiting the game.  This 48 hour window allows you to have a very ""Words with Friends"" style of game-play, giving you a 3-5 minute window of board game into your otherwise packed video gaming schedule.  You simply wait for Steam to alert you whenever its your turn, and you go about your business.The actual game rules are pretty straight forward.  The rules are kind-of-sort-of similar to RISK, but with an element of randomness that prevents static strategies.  Every player selects a race with a random special power every game, and while the race bonuses stay static, the special powers are randomly assigned every game.  This can, unfortunately, lead to some relatively overpowered combinations; but so far I haven't encountered anything that has completely dominated the game.Unfortunately, the Steam integration needs some work though.  While it does, for the most part, link a ""Days of Wonder"" account with your ""Steam Account"" (which raises some concerns), it does not import any of your friends.  So you must manually add buddies, who may not have the same Days of Wonder handle, and then invite them into a game through the game's multiplier console.  Once a game is created, players do not receive a notification that they've been invited until it is their turn.  You cannot invite players through the Steam Overlay.  As many accolades as the game got for the notifications, it lost for the lackluster integration.6/10 - wait for the Christmas Sale.			"

If you're a new player, the one thing you know is this is a 'Take That' style game where if you want to win you'll need to attack other players.The huge number of race/power combinations keeps the gameplay fresh and rewards creative thinking on how squeeze the most points out of your pick before setting that race in decline and starting anew.  The downside to that is new players will have some trouble when behind the learning curve for all the options.This digital version plays swiftly and recreates the physical game accurately.			"

												I bought the board game first and didn't understand the point of it. So I bought this thinking I was missing something, and that I would discover the grand strategy of this beloved game. I still don't get it, where is the game, what is the point of it. Its a pretty good conversion, it's just a bad game.			"

												Its the board game.Small world is based off a board game of the same name and has you and your opponets picking from a random selection of races and perks each with unique abilites and trying to conqure and hold sections of the board.This playes just like the board game and does a good job of replicating the art style of the original game.  The UI is pretty easy to use though i wish you could undo actions before ending your turn.  Its also a little confusing trying to figure out how many troops you need to take a specific area.  This can be really bothersome if your trying to figure out which race you want to pick next but you effentually get the hang of it.  Its cheaper than the actual board game and has online support so if you want a board game night but can't get any friends over to your acutal house, this might be a decent back up.			"

												The game is great. The only issue is looking for matchs with other players. unless you look for 1v1, wait times can be as long as a half hour. Although 4 player matches tend to work out to about 5 minute wait times so it's not terrible. The game itself offers an almost infinite amount of replayablility with the race/ adjective combos. Very fun and addictive and would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good board game on the computer.			"

												This game is the adaptation of my favourite board game, Small World and I really love it. The gameplay and the art is the same and it gives you the opportunity to play against players with whom you'd never play the board game or against the AI (which sometimes play very good). The fact that you cannot make an illegal move also makes it easy to understand the rules compared to the board game where there are a few ambiguous rules.Unfortunately the game has a few problems too, namely sometimes the multiplayer connection is unstable and at least for some linux players - like me -  one race (the ghouls) is, in some sense, unplayable. (Meaning that going into decline crashes the game. In singleplayer this marks the end of the game while in multiplayer one can reconnect but by that time the AI replacing them could create a less favorable position.) Still, I'd recommend the game for those who loves board games and does not mind said bugs too much -- personally I haven't had any connection problem for several months now and until the issue is fixed, not being able to play with ghouls can be considered as a challenge. :)			"

												Small World is one of my favorite board games and when schedules get busy between friends, it's great to have an online version available to play from the couch. You can also play with computer opponents or challengers from all over. I wish all my favorite board games offered this sort of gameplay!If you're just starting out, I think the online version is a solid starting point, especially if you plan to move on to the physical board. I bought this after playing it briefly and it was a great refresher course but also got my boyfriend's feet wet before committing to the tabletop game.The race and power combinations create a lot of replay value. There's always a new strategy to adopt or a new race/power combination to discover.If you're a Small World veteran, you may be disappointed by the current lack of expansions available. I still have a lot of fun with it, there's a limited amount of DLC to add to the base game. The one great advantage the online version has, for me, is that it keeps track of everything for me. Who has time to remember to keep track of what turn we're on when you're trying to plot world domination?!Highly recommended.			"

												An enjoyable adaption of the popular board game. All the strategy is left in place while you no longer need to keep stopping to count your victory coins gained each turn.Graphically, the game is fine, maintaining the cartoony feel of the board game. It can suffer from some unusual ratios when opening, but maximising the window will address it. For some reason it appears to lack a full screen option.AI seems to vary between utterly foolish and amazingly prescient - so be prepared for issues there if playing solo. Where the game shines though is in hotseat multiplayer. In this regard it functions as a replacement for the board game that handles all the mechanical side of the game for you.			"

												Yup, basically like the boardgame, except without all the people taking 20 minute turns.  I am quite impressed with how well the game translated, but the AI for single player is pretty bad.  I hope that over time they work to improve that, because without AI, then this has the downsides of real (20 minute turns) without the upsides (friends and conversation).			"

												If you like boardgaming but can't meet with your friends all the time, this one is a no brainer.  Smallworld is a fun and fast game easy to learn hard to master but it will get you addicted quite fast.  The real life variant and this digital on give it a go, it's worth the cheap price, the boardgame itself is way more expensive.If there is any flaw, is that it takes forever for a three player online game.  To me the most fun part, when you finally get into a game it usually is with people that either have the attention span of a musquito , so turns can go on forever.  There is no option to make people take their turns in under 30 seconds or something.  Well unless you first forcably create a friendslist with probably people you never met ... not really a friends list ...			"

												VERY NICE simulation of the legendary success of the board game.  Or atleast half of it at the time I am posting this.  The whole base game is available sans Underground, Realms and the card deck.  Perhaps those will be added to the DLC pile eventually.  I got this on a half off deal and was beyond pleasantly surprised.  Lets all be honest.  Steam DOES NOT have a rather bright track record when it comes to cross-over or co-op games.  This one happily is simple enough that they really could not mess it up.The bot play is about what you might expect at this level of programing tech.  Not so clever but it will give you a run for your money if you stop paying attention for a round or two.  The real gems (pun intended) can be found in the online play.  I never had such seemless transition from start to finish in the regular table top board game version.  All the tedium of bean counting and 'Risk style"" clumsy stumbling about with a handfull of pieces is now relagated to point and click bliss.  there is a somewhat annoying music track which thankfully can me muted and some sound effects that I suspect were ripped from the arcade era circa 1983.

												Overall an outstanding adaptation of the board game by Days of Wonder.Be weary of small gliches that can impact online play.Don't leave your chat window open, it pauses gameplay for you.If you suddenly don't see any races/abilities on the side the game will most likely have stopped showing you updates.To solve, simply exit the match (it will save your involvement in the game) then return to it through the games in progress menu choice.ENJOY!

												The game is great. The only issue is looking for matchs with other players. unless you look for 1v1, wait times can be as long as a half hour. Although 4 player matches tend to work out to about 5 minute wait times so it's not terrible. The game itself offers an almost infinite amount of replayablility with the race/ adjective combos. Very fun and addictive and would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good board game on the computer.			"

												Awesome adaptiaotn of the boardgame. So easy to use but you need to read up on the rules if you have never played before. I found a few glitches while using it on my tablet but nothing that keeps the game from working great and being a blast.

I had yet to play the Cursed! expansion for example, but now i've gotten to, and this is definately a simple-to-learn game worth the fun. Think of it as an investment war against the other races, just get more coins. But, runs smoothly and the randomness in the game makes the re-play endless.			"

												Funny little game. Small World is exactly what it promises to be, short, funny and relaxing. You sit down for a little while as a distraction and the game is over before long. There isn't all that much depth to it. Luck plays a strong factor. You cannot negotiate with AI controlled players, even though it would be to clear, mutual benefit against a stronger third party. But that really isn't so bad. Not all games have to be deep to be good. And Small World is good. "

I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the table top version, or even people who are new to board games in general. If it goes on sale during the Holiday Sale, pick this up!

												I consider myself pretty critical and difficult to please, and I think this game is great. I played the board game once, and I liked it a lot. This feels like the same game, and seems very well made. Games play very fast, but there is a nice amount of depth, but also character, to the game, which makes it rather fun. Multiplayer works quite well. You don't need the expansions in order to join a game that is using any of the expansions. You can play hotseat. The AI seems decent.Now, if you want something as deep as Panzer General, Civilization 4, or one of the Total War games, this game is not for you. You can finish an entire game in about 20 to 25 minutes (less if it's with only two or three players).I was especially impressed by the price.I have now played the game a bunch with the DLC, which I got on sale, and I like it. Worth it if you can get it on sale, adds a lot of nice variety, but without ruining ballance (for the most part anyway).			"

There is nothing wrong with the programming, design or anything - it's flawless. I find the actual mechanics of the game too shallow for my taste.

												If you like boardgaming but can't meet with your friends all the time, this one is a no brainer.  Smallworld is a fun and fast game easy to learn hard to master but it will get you addicted quite fast.  The real life variant and this digital on give it a go, it's worth the cheap price, the boardgame itself is way more expensive.If there is any flaw, is that it takes forever for a three player online game.  To me the most fun part, when you finally get into a game it usually is with people that either have the attention span of a musquito , so turns can go on forever.  There is no option to make people take their turns in under 30 seconds or something.  Well unless you first forcably create a friendslist with probably people you never met ... not really a friends list ...			"

												VERY NICE simulation of the legendary success of the board game.  Or atleast half of it at the time I am posting this.  The whole base game is available sans Underground, Realms and the card deck.  Perhaps those will be added to the DLC pile eventually.  I got this on a half off deal and was beyond pleasantly surprised.  Lets all be honest.  Steam DOES NOT have a rather bright track record when it comes to cross-over or co-op games.  This one happily is simple enough that they really could not mess it up.The bot play is about what you might expect at this level of programing tech.  Not so clever but it will give you a run for your money if you stop paying attention for a round or two.  The real gems (pun intended) can be found in the online play.  I never had such seemless transition from start to finish in the regular table top board game version.  All the tedium of bean counting and 'Risk style"" clumsy stumbling about with a handfull of pieces is now relagated to point and click bliss.  there is a somewhat annoying music track which thankfully can me muted and some sound effects that I suspect were ripped from the arcade era circa 1983.

												A fun game with plenty of replayability, at it's core that is, which is unsurprising since it's based on a popluar and successful board game. However - most people will probably get this to play online with friends, and this is where it gets worse. The mechanics for setting up and playing a multiplayer online game are confusing and irregular. Oddly worded prompts, multiple iterations of games set up by accident, no common game board at the start of the game, etc etc. It is just poor UI design choice after poor UI design choice. I think, since the game is receiving updates it's not impossible for these issues to be fixed, so I am still recommending this game. Beware of possible frustration when setting up games though!			"

												Overall pretty good.  The AI only has one difficulty, which new players may find difficult.  However, experienced players will get bored pretty fast with the computer-controlled opponents.  The multiplayer options work fairly well, although the ability to remove unwanted races or powers doesn't exist the way you can do it on the board game (I think were- and cursed- are terrible powers but I like the rest of that expansion).  Additionally, there are some strange bugs that occur mostly on AI.  Overall though, it plays like the board game and lets you play asynchronously with friends, so it's a good game.  7.5 / 10 for me.			"

But, I haven't seen that.  The game's been stable and crashed maybe one time so far.   So, no worries there, whatever was plaguing this game isn't anymore.If you like the board game you'll enjoy being able to play a few games quickly.  And the bots aren't awful, though they aren't aggressive enough.  And that's saying a lot since I don't play aggressively.			"

Victory is usually possible with a good strategy, but luck will help ;)I have all Small World games and add-ons. I am very glad that I have it.

												I own the physical board game but havn't had much chance to play it with friends or family. So when I seen they made a steam version I jumped at the chance to try it out. Has a very simple interface and menu system nothing flashy and pretty rudimentary. But it's easy to use and gets games set up fast and easily.The game is almost a cross between Risk and Settlers of Catan if you want to simplify it down to it's basics. Gameplay is fun, tactical, and rewarding also only last 20-45 mins (relatively speaking). Interesting and familiar fantasy races to play that coupled with the seperate ability combos ensures you'll never have the same game twice. The toutorial video is a big help for newcomers and is a big help at laying down the basic rules.So very fun, entertaining, and good practice until I can get a proper board game setup to add the human interactive element (which can be obtained by local hotseat play for those with only the digital version).

												I enjoy the board game version of SmallWorld and was pretty excited about trying it as a digital game.If you're a fan of the original game, you'll like this. It's really nice to not have to do all the set up and fiddliness. The game plays a good fraction of the time of the traditional game. A game can easily be played in 10 minutes (vs. AI, real players obiviously may take longer).The only thing that I'm not fond of, it can be difficult to follow during another player's turn if any of your units or locations were just attacked. You really have to pay close attention or have a good memory of where all your locations were. Aside from that, I have little that makes me unhappy with the game.I've only played one game with other random players and it worked smoothly for me.If you're able to get the game on sale, it is certainly worth it if you enjoy the board game. If you've never played the board game, I'd say it's still probably worth it if by looking at the videos and descriptions managed to grab your interest. Being that I got it on sale, I've been quite pleased with the purchase. Even moreso since they upgraded the game for free shortly after I bought it.			"

You can play with your friends and expansions with only 1 person having the expansions. Overall, Small World 2 is fun, if you haven't played the board game itself, the only short description I can give you is that it is like a mini RISK-ish game that doesn't last more than 1 hour, and it's random enough to make every match different from each other.

												Game is fun, seems easy against bots. I'm only annoyed I'm having to spend money AGAIN for the game and expansions. I love smallworld, and it's a lot of fun, however i didnt spend around 100$ just to only have to turn around and pay 25$ more for the same game and expansions I already own. I bought it on sale - the base game. All ranting aside, it's a fun game and i'd recommend it.			"

												I enjoy the board game version of SmallWorld and was pretty excited about trying it as a digital game.If you're a fan of the original game, you'll like this. It's really nice to not have to do all the set up and fiddliness. The game plays a good fraction of the time of the traditional game. A game can easily be played in 10 minutes (vs. AI, real players obiviously may take longer).The only thing that I'm not fond of, it can be difficult to follow during another player's turn if any of your units or locations were just attacked. You really have to pay close attention or have a good memory of where all your locations were. Aside from that, I have little that makes me unhappy with the game.I've only played one game with other random players and it worked smoothly for me.If you're able to get the game on sale, it is certainly worth it if you enjoy the board game. If you've never played the board game, I'd say it's still probably worth it if by looking at the videos and descriptions managed to grab your interest. Being that I got it on sale, I've been quite pleased with the purchase. Even moreso since they upgraded the game for free shortly after I bought it.			"

												Pro:Incredibly solid core gameplay.Power/race combinations stay entertaining.Good for quick games against the AI.AI is quite competent. Con:Computer moves too slowly, requiring constant skipping.Scoring happens slowly as well, and is obnoxious for Leprechauns.No variation in boards.Lacks races/power/artifacts from Smallworld Underground.No option to disable specific powers/races (Cursed/Leprechauns).Players aren't shown in order when playing with random starting player.Forgettable music.ConclusionSmallworld is a very fun game but it's a shame this digital implementation is more limited than the physical board game. The constant requirement to spead up AI movement also is a huge drawback.			"

												An amazing digitalization of the tabletop board game. For those who don't know the board game, it is very enjoyable, highly interactive, with tons of replayability. The randomization after decisions are made is fairly minimal, leaving lots of room for strategy and skill. The replay through the numerous combinations of racial abilities is always interesting and fun.For those familiar with the board game, the digital version is fantastic. The rules are seamlessly coded into the interface in a very intuitive way - you might even learn some rules by playing it this way! It plays very fast for familiar players, and no clean up time!			"

												This game captures all the fun of the tabletop version without the messy cleanup! It's well made, true to the spirit of the game it's based on and can be either fast paced or slow depending on how you choose to play. AI opponents use strategy that makes them challenging to beat. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and am having a lot of fun with this game.			"

												While it's fun when it works, the game is plagued by poor design choices, bugs, and crashes. When I am invited to a game by a friend, I can't actually join it until I exit to the menu and then resume a game in progress. I have a game in progress that can't be resumed because every time I try to join it, the game crashes to the desktop. And just in general, the interface is dumbed down to the point that it just doesn't have enough information. Maybe a few patches down the road this product will be worth the money, but for now, it's more frustration than it's worth.			"

												I keep hoping Days of Wonder will improve, and they keep going in the other direction. For a free-to-play game port of a popular board game, this would be quite good. For its price, it's a bit of a letdown, still quite a few bugs (e.g.: complete crash when you accidentally send an empty chat message; random freezes), and clunky proprietary solutions that don't work as well with Steam as they should (no inviting your Steam buddies or joining their game, you need to register separately with DoW and then invite your friend player123456789xyz). The UI could use another patch or a few, and improved functionality, such as seamless switching, multiple instances running, not having the game overwrite your current action when something is happening in the game, more clarity on some functions and how to use them, less clunky, and for the Dragon's sake stop plastering ads for paid DLCs everywhere.It's still a port of Small World, which is a fun board game in itself, and if this is the only way you get to play that game with your friends, you may want to put up with what you're getting for your money here.

												It's a decent game.  It's everything entertaining about the board game.  When playing multiplayer with my buddies, they're able to use the DLC races because I owned them.  That's a nice touch.  My one complaint, aside from the crashes which're obviously a problem, is the timing.  If you alt tab during a multiplayer game, it ""resyncs"" you to the game, making you watch everything that's happened.  In a five player match, you'll be waiting two-three minutes to get back to your turn.  Then the next chap waits a few minutes.  This is solved by not alt tabbing, but come on.  Who doesn't alt tab?  Adding a skip option would make this game incredible.  Without it, I still recommend this game, I just wouldn't suggest it if you're not a patient sort.			"

												Smallworld 2 is the digitalised version of the boardgame Smallworld.This remake is very true to the original boardgame. It features online as well as offline play, aginst bots or Friends and has a huge amount of replayabillity through its sheer mass of possible combinations.The Artstyle is very collorfull and high quallity, the Pictures for the abillitys are quite topical so they help you remember who can do what TrickWhen you start the game you enter as one of the 28 Races that has been paired with one of the 35 random abillitys.You then try to conquer terretory, that fits the special needs of your race, the Magicians for example score more Coins from terretorys, that hold a source of arcane power, while the Dwarfs prefere Goldmines.The huge amount of variety enters the game when you factor in the abillity´s that every race gets randomly assined, you could for example get an Army of diplomatic  Skeletons wich enables you to go for one player while forcing the other to sign a truce with you, or you can rampage the countryside with pillaging orcs, that get more and more coins by invading other races.Once you run out of Warriors for your race or you just feel like getting a new one, you can send your Race into decline and pick a new one next turn. The old one will stay on the board and still score points for you, but it will be weakened and easy Prey for a Fresh Race, maybe even your own.The Tutorial is presented to you in the Form of videos and a Rulebook, just like the boardgame these Rules are quite clear and easy to understand.Also the rulebook can be accesed during the Game to make sure you make informed decisions.While the game does not have the incredible amount of deaph some other boardgames offer its great for a quick game aginst 1 other player, or for a longer one for up to 5 players.All in all i reccomend this game for everyone that likes games that can be played in short bursts or just boardgames in general. My only complaint about the game is, that it features asynchronous play wich means you can make your turn, leave and come back later, this can drag a game out quite a bit but since you can start multiple ones at a time you can occupy your self otherwise.

												Considering this game was entirely funded by kickstarter.. I was shocked to see the sticker price, and the add on price as well... But that aside, the gameplay is nice.. When it works... The game is laggy/bugged at an insane level. If you are going over the race/power combo's while your opponent is playing their turn.. it litterally pauses the gameplay.. causing a lag for the other player.    It is as if the developers themselves have not even attempted to play this game. I played enough of it to get my money's worth I guess... But the entire time has been an uphill battle. Game crashes mid turn, have to close/reopen and go to currently running games to resume... It has NOT been a good playing experiance at all.**Edit**Since my last review, they have changed the multiplayer to include a mandatory chat room thing, it makes finding/creating games a joke, I have not played one multiplayer game since. Solo play is alright, however after a few games you will start to miss the multiplayer games. Honestly, this company has ridden this cash cow as far as they can without completely reworking the game. They funded 100% of the development on kickstarter, but then still charge a hefty price to buy the game. Instead of using the online version to market their actual boardgame, they are sticking with a hit and run policy.			"

No Under World, so the game is missing depth.  Hah!  No but really, it's so simple.  No places of power or artifacts, nothing to fight over there or aim for, nothing to make you a target.The fun of small world is there, a bit.

or read this review.It's a board game clone, albeit one I'd never heard of and I play a lot of board games so I had to play it. Apparently loads of people had heard of it as it was crowd funded successfully by some over seven thousand people and nearly got three times its kickstarter goal and according to Days of Wonder half a million people have bought the board game. I guess that I've just not being paying attention. However, it is also one of the worst tablet ports ever. There are no options other than changing the sound and music volumes. You cannot alter the resolution, enable full screen and as for colour blind options forget about it! There are also numerous other nasty things. Bugs, connection problems on multiplayer and day one DLC if you'd like something in the way of a choice of maps.  The game play while well explained with video tutorial and in game rule book, is solid but if you like this sort of thing why not buy the board game instead? What works great on the table top does not necessarily work so well on the desktop. Even with the full range of game play modes, solo, lan and online I doubt you'd ever have as much fun as getting a couple of friends around and playing SW on the table top.  "

												I don't own the boardgame of this yet but a couple of my friends and I spent several hours playing last night and well play many more in the future. A charming game that is much deeper than its whimsical appearance may suggest with a lot of replayability despite the (at least currently) singular map. I would love to see more expansions for it, especially the modular map, to come to the PC version and more races and powers means more options and crazy combos. Some of these combinations were laugh out loud funny (flying ghouls, peace-loving barbarians, etc.) so even more of these would enhance the game immensely. It needs a fullscreen option and we had some minor hiccups getting our games set up (invite friends and bots, the go button wouldn't light up everytime, had to go back to the previous menu then select current MP game and then the button worked) but we encountered no other bugs.Essentially the objective it to hoard the most coins by fulfilling victory conditions while placing race tokens to conquer land. All races are matched with a power that modifies what they do and helps determine how many tokens you have to use for attack and defense. As your race spreads out it becomes harder to expand anymore so you will usually have to go into a decline and select a new race/power combo. A race in decline will normally be left weak and unable to do much but still accrues coins for you. These race/power combos are on the right side of the screen and you can take the top one or skip down for penalites if a combo isn't to your liking. Players take turns conquering and reinforcing, trying to get more coins than anyone else to win at the end of the last turn.There's a lot of subtle strategy involved in both the races inherent abilities but also in the power they are attached too and how many tokens they can get. Pushing your self thin can net a lot of early coins but if the others gang up on you it can backfire and some races are much better at this than others. Knowing if and when to go into decline and when to take or skip a race/power combo as well as when and where to attack and is that last possible understrength attack worth risking that die roll for(?) combine to make it an excellent game. Highly recommended.			"

												Small World 2 is a tablet port of the board game ""Small World"", of critical acclaim.Sadly, I cannot recommend this game, and warn those to proceed with trepedation.The game feels as though it is meant to be played ""once in a while"", multiplayer, via e-mail with a friend. I say this because every single time you tab out of the game, if you are playing live, you need to watch the moves of those who played after your last turn over and over again. Every single time. Even if you tab out for a few seconds. What this boils down to is that if you and 4 friends are playing (as was our case) 80% of the time spent ""playing"" the game translates to watching back previous moves while you laboriously await your turn. This is hopefully something that could be patched/fixed, but as this is a direct port from a tablet variant I don't foresee this happening.Next up, if you don't know how to play Small World, don't in any way expect this game to teach you. Thankfully, we had a seasoned pro of Small World playing with us so we had some idea what was going on, but the shear lack of tooltips, information and tutelage was kind of staggering. I'd say this is the type of game that is a) aimed towards someone who already plays Small World and b) a tablet device or phone. The controls, the feel, and the entirity of the game just scream tablet game. And that's great! On a tablet. Sadly, as a PC title, it falls short. After enduring one hour long game with my friends, I immediately requested a Steam refund for this severely underwhelming game, which was rejected as I'd already used the title, so for everyone else out there: beware.The title has great promise! Small World is a GREAT board game, but this digital port just does not deliver. Maybe the devs will pick this up and adapt it, and if so I'll happily edit my review and re-review the title; after all, Small World itself is a great game! But for now, again, beware.Nilesy			"

												An overly complicated modernization of the Risk board game with a mild Fantasy theme. Very difficult to see text. Annoying graphics and animations. Terrible Tutorial (it's a youtube video). Insanely annoying voice acting.If you like digital Board games, and want a family-friendly one, get Days of Wonder's other title, Ticket to Ride, or Carcassonne, Agricola. A lot of people prefer these games for iPad or Android tablet because of Pass and Play.If you want more grown up board games try Talisman (kind of DnD lite - has single player against AI plus robust online multi-player and numerous content expansions and updates coming all the time) or Elder Sign: Omens, which is basically a Cthulhu-Horror themed Yahtzee mashed up with a board game. ES: O is single-player only.Not recommended unless you really, really like Risk.-----P.S. I've played this on iOS too, so disregard time. That's just this version, which is worse than the tablet one, which isn't that good either. I've actually played the game for about 3 hours. The first SW was inexplicably, somewhat better (though the core game mechanics are still ""Risk, but too complicated""). DoW doesn't seem to be supporting this game. Ticket to Ride (which is really good, btw) seems to be their golden child now, so I doubt this will get much in the way of updates.			"

												I highly recommend this game. I plan on getting the board game soon as I have wanted to for some time. It's a very light and quick game to play with friends. The fact that it has turn-based play is great for me and my friend(s) that don't have free time that aligns often.The random combinations of special abilities with races is what gives this game great replayability. I hope people on my friends list buy this so I don' thave to rely on online quick play :)			"

												A great adaptation of one of my favorite board games, Small World 2 is an innovative, light-hearted strategy game with minimal interference from Lady Luck.  The Race + Ability combo system ensures that every game is different and interesting.  Even though your personal skill level will improve over time, there is always a chance that the next game could hold a surprise or two!  The AI is decent, but you can alwyays find a game online if you'd rather go against humans.			"

												""All in all, there’s every reason in the world to love “Small World 2″, even if you’ve never played the board game.  The interface was fluid and easy to read, and I really appreciate the fact that the developers went the extra mile to include tutorials.  I often had to look in the manual when playing the board game to clarify powers and the like…I didn’t have to do that here.  This makes the game extremely user-friendly.  Online play is certainly a bonus, though I have a feeling I’ll be making use of pass-and-play when I don’t feel like digging through my board game closet to find the physical board game.  My only concern is the lack of fullscreen and the fact that you can’t make the AI easier…beginners will surely become frustrated as the AI is pretty difficulty to defeat.  The game is only $14.99 (as of 12/18/13), which is about twenty to forty dollars cheaper than the board game (depending on where you shop)…making it a great (and cheap) way to buy into the “Small World” universe.  Based on the strategic gameplay elements, replayability, and accessibility, I’d have to say that “Small World 2″ is most certainly worth the investment.""Review:  http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/small-world-2/

												Good game, flawed interface.  Take that for what you will.While I enjoy Small World it's also just a digitalized version of the board game.  It's a fun game, fast paced and easy to pick up.  I think they did a good job transitioning the game elements to Steam.Single player works fine.  I've read that some consider the AI easy but I've had a fairly difficult time with them.  After several games I've yet to really win one against the four bots I've been playing, though I admit I only have a half understanding of which abilities are good, and when they're good.  Online play is also fine save for one missing feature: unlike Ticket to Ride, you cannot play with both bots and human players through the internet.  Kind of an annoying absence.I commented about the interface but it's not so simple as saying it's bad or good, as parts are fine.  While you're in game everything works and is intuitive, though I have yet to figure out a midgame score for other players (recently discovered that I can find my own score).  The trouble is that almost nothing in any interface is labeled and many of the icons are not self explanatory.  If you hover over --some-- things you get an explanation of what it means but you're otherwise left guessing as to what certain icons mean.  I've also yet to find a proper way to exit the game without either closing the window or crashing the game.  That's not to say one doesn't exist, but well, the interface is convoluted as I've already indicated.Anyway, it works, it's fine and most importantly it's playable.  Fun game with friends or even alone if you want to play but can't get anyone into it.  I would say it's definitely worth the price but there are glaring issues that I would have expected to be patched away before release.			"

												Summer 2014 addendum for Smallworld 2.5: Many of the horrible design choices, especially concerning the dismal online matchmaking, have been corrected and the game isn't broken anymore in that way, but it's still terribly glitchy and prone to crash. I doubt the developer's commitment to Sparkle Motion here – probably never will work properly, which is amusing for a boardgame port.Original review: The board game itself is solid, casual multiplay, but jeeze is this version pretty lamely ported. Originally a touch screen mobile game, this Steam version looks nice but harbours some pretty dumb UX design choices and bugs that, mercifully, the developers have been patching from day one. It's a little broken, crashes and glitches out every now and then – and people that just stop doing their turns (or quit the game, aborting the match for everyone involved) are still a huge problem as of Feb 2014.

												Small World 2 is a pretty great adaptation of the boardgame to PC. The AI isn't half bad and can certainly present a challenge sometimes, although the semi-random nature of the game probably helps with that. I definitely recommend it if you're looking to play more of the boardgame but can't get people together to play it as often as you would like (or at all). I haven't tried multiplayer so I don't know how well that works, but the singleplayer has caused me no problems other than my own dumb mistakes.			"

												An excellent port of the tabletop game.  I have the physical boardgame, as well as the Steam and Android/mobile versions (through a bundle).  Both electronic versions are exactly like the boardgame -- which is exactly what I wanted.  The AI is good enough to be entertaining, but the real value of the electronic versions, specially the mobile version, comes from the convenience it adds to playing the game with other people.What I found most interesting is that because the electronic versions remove or streamline the elements of the game that take the most time (setting up the pieces, counting the score, etc.) a single game only takes about 10 minutes to play.  This makes it possible to play several games in the same time it usually takes to play the physical boardgame only once.			"

It is a fun tactical board game with the main objective being to have the most gold at the end of a set number of turns (depending on how many players there are). In addition to Single Player against AI, there is both Online and Local Multiplayer (Local has the option of playing one on one or against each other and the AI, not sure if Online has the same option, as I haven't tried it yet as of writing this). There's plenty of races and abilities to try out, which are randomized each game and there are 3 expansions available as DLC, adding more races and abilities to what is already in the base game.

												 Usually, some people may think a lot of board games seem boring...but don't judge a game by it's cover; ""Small World"" is a SERIOUSLY must have, for those who love good strategy-based games with plenty of depth into it's gameplay! (And nothing too complex, either!) And this is something that I DEFINITELY would prefer, over Monopoly, for a good reason; it's a GREAT underrated title! The idea is kinda silly; I'll explain it. The story takes place in a world that's WAY too small for all the races to live in, at once...so what did they have to do?!? FIGHT TO THE DEATH OVER IT, IN A WAR! (And it's seriously fun and silly stuff!) It's clearly a simulator of a real-life board game, yet it's a TON of fun, and all ""Small World"" games are literally the same game, in different versions! Though if you can't manage to have anyone to play this board game with you, try playing online...or simply play against the computerized opponents, to help improve your strategy!			"

Pot roast, when made according to a few fundamental rules, can be a totally delicious addition to your repertoire. There are lots of different, equally delicious ways to make pot roast. Today’s version is the first of many I’ll be profiling here.The meat you use is important. My favorite roast is the chuck roast; it has wonderful marbling throughout the meat, and when given an ample amount of time to cook, chuck roast winds up being tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. To understand the importance of adequate cooking time, you must understand that these tougher pieces of meat have lots of tough connective tissue that will only soften when cooked at a lower temperature for a long period of time. You can’t rush a pot roast; you’ll be disappointed with the result if you try. But if you reach deep down into your soul and find your patience—at least, the patience that was given to you by your Maker to relate to beef-related circumstances in your life—you won’t be disappointed.

												This is one of my favorite board games.  Hands down.  It is not without its issues, but they will not stop me from playing it.That said, the game is very luck based, reducing the strategy element.  Combo selection is critical, but can be very random.  If they removed the die, and went to a bidding system instead of the coin-drop, the game would be much more strategic.  Hopefully they can add a gamemode for hardcore strategists some day.For 2 players, the game falls apart pretty fast.  Combo selection owns, and some combos are just broken.  At 3 players this abates with the introduction of some classic game theory situations - the ability to gang up on a third player.Overall this is a GREAT and fun game.  Emphasis on fun - even with the randomness it is wildly entertaining.  I picked it up for 7 bucks and it has been one of the best purchases on Steam thus far.			"

												I see a lot of the reviews are negative, but i am enjoying it so far. I've only played a few games so I can't provide too much detail other then, if you like the board game, you should like this game. It moves pretty fast (on opposing players turns) so if you don't already know the rules, it might be hard to figure out, even with the tutorial. The AI seems pretty good, I haven't won a game yet (although that's not saying much). All in all, a good adaptation of the board game.			"

YouTube™ Video: Small World: Wil Wheaton, Jenna Busch, Grant Imahara, Sean Plott. TableTop, Episode 1

			Want to play Small World with your friends at home? Visit your friendly local game store to purchase it! Or buy it online at: http://amzn.to/175l0q5 Subscribe to Geek and Sundry:...		

 There's a Video of Wil Weaton playing it with Grant Imahara from Mythbusters and a few others. The game basically plays exactly like that but adapted to a computer.It's a fast pased, 8 turn long board game with a suprising amount of in depth strategy inolved.Now, some considerations. First, the game is complete in and of itself, there's no need to buy the DLC. But if you do wish to buy the DLC it can get a bit expensive.Second, the game is slightly cheaper on Android Pads. If you want portability that's probably the way to go. if you want to play with your steam friends? this is probably a better bet.Third, there's no full screen mode, but if you want, you can maximize the window for much better detail without losing any of the board to cut off.Fourth, the ""tome of Knowledge"" also known as the glossary of terms and rules, is slightly buggy sometimes. the information is easy enough to read once highlighted, but initially it sometimes shows up obscured (particularly when showing races and powers).Overall, this is a solid game well worth purchasing if you like board games in general, or the original Small World Board Game in particular.

												If the only consideration was whether or not this game is fun, I'd recommend it. I love Small World. I love playing it on my tabletop with my friends and I love playing it by myself on my tablet or PC. What I DON'T love is that purchases made in one version of the game don't carry over to the other. So this is fun as long as you don't expect cross-platform support. I do, so I almost can't play it. I bought a couple DLC packages on my tablet and now I can only play on my tablet because I can't unlock those purchases here on the Steam version.			"

												Risk with a twist. This game does a good job representing the best selling board game. You conquer regions of the world similar to Risk but the randomized Race and Ability tokens make it so that no two games are alike.  There are some missing features that you'd consider standard in PC gaming like a proper full screen mode but I have hopes that they'll patch it down the line. The AI is brilliant most of the time but sometimes they stroke out and do stupid things.  Online support is good so if you get sick of playing against AI, you can take on some real people. Highly recommended even with the bugs!			"

The THREE Day-One DLC is really a kick in the shins and pick-poket'ish though.

												This is like a very bad version of Risk. Every turn, all of your extra cards go back into your hand, and you can not place them on territories you already have, so territories can not be reinforced by other units. Some strategy game. This game also has the worst tutorial I have ever seen. If you want a game like this, just buy Risk, it is much better. The only thing I liked were the races, which I thought were pretty cool, and the placing victory coins on them was a very good way to increase the stakes. This game is almost good. 4/10			"

Some of the interface actions regarding your pieces are a little fiddly but overall this is a nice rendition of the game.  The artwork is great if the sounds are a bit obnoxious.  You can turn these off in the options.  Great for a quick game of Small World inbetween matches with real people which is always the best way to play.			"

												I do enjoy the fact that this wonderful board game has been converted to an online format, making it easy to play anytime. However there is one major flaw in this gem, match making. It take about ten minutes for a game to time out, and rather than just dropping the idol player it dumps the whole game. This is very irritating when you have a five player game going that you, and others have invested time in. Other than this snag the transition was very nice. "

												Small World 2 was a game that I have played with friends as a board game. I loved it so much, that I quickly picked up the game on Steam during a suitable sale. What I will say however that the game, albeit a faithful ""port"", does not capture the same amount of fun... and due to the speed of the AI decisions a game typically takes no longer that 15 minutes, if not perhaps a little longer. The online play is practically non-existant due to the few players who actually seek online play. Overall a 3/5. Pick up this game if you want a reminder of the real thing.			"

It also helped me clarify some rules that I wasn't quite sure how to interpret for the board game simply because the computer did or didn't allow certain things to occur when it came to it.  I haven't actually gotten to play online with anyone yet, but I'm hopeful.  If anybody also bought this and is looking for people to play online with, friend me!			"

												Fairly simple strategy game, but one with lots of interesting tricks to learn. I've only played single player against the AI so I can't comment on the multi-player. The computer knows the rules and plays reasonably well. I haven't played the board game so after about five hours of play I still have lots to learn. It seems to me that luck plays a significant role. If the computer players gang up on you instead of each other you're going to have a tough time. I managed to win my first two games when I didn't really understand the rules. Now that I know the rules I'm losing more games, but it's still fun.Despite what it claims, the introductory video does not tell you everything you need to know to play the game, but it will get you started. I would suggest downloading the manual from the store page for some of the details the video glosses over.			"

												The interface recreates the tabletop environment very well, without the need to setup or keep track of a ton of tokens. Would be nice if there were more multiplayer users, if it was possible to set up or schedule games for future times, or if a list of games being played (with number of players and current turn) was available so that you know how long until new matches might start.

												I Love Board Games!I really love Small World in classic table top form.And here we are, with PC version of this iconic ;) title. Is it good? Yeah!! Basically it is a the same game but only in electronic format. We have the same art, the same rules.What is extra? Multiplayer over internet, so there is no need to look for other players with a free time to play table top version.I recommend this to all board game lovers.			"

												I love this game, it's a great way to kill time.  Each game generally lasts around 10 minutes so it's a nice relacement for solitaire, hearts, minesweeper, etc.  I mostly play single player against AI opponents but I've played a few multiplayer games and they seemed to work well.			"

												Curator Review:This board game, developed by Days of Wonder, is a game of many pieces but also a game in which you are encouraged to slaughter your friends. Pick a race, conquer some regions, go into decline, conquer some more, and make money along the way! The person with the most money at the end of the game wins. This risk-esque game is elegantly designed and a beautiful replica of the physical board game. If you love board games or you just love wailing on your friends, I highly recommend it. 8/10

												I have not played the board game version, but I really like this version. Simply well done & fun to play. Kind of like Risk with fantasy creatures. Only ""complaint"" I have is the expansions do not work off-line. ( the base game, itself, does ) At least, I haven't figured out how to do so.			"

												If you're a fan of the board game, you'll love this digital version. Gameplay is speedier thanks to the computer handling the basic rules and accounting for you. And of course, the big benefit is being able to play a game with friends (or strangers) remotely rather than having to wait for game night.Only gripe is that the game is still a bit buggy. I've had some oddities when starting games where the game begins, but it doesn't switch from the lobby to the game board screen. This was easily fixed by backing out and re-entering through the ""Games in Progress"" panel, but it probably wouldn't work for arena mode. I've also had it drop me out of an arena game against a friend, erroneously claiming I lost my internet connection.			"

												I had heard good things about the board game so when I saw this on the Summer Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot.  It's a ton of fun.  Nice balance and enough randomness that even after several games I can get some wins but I'm far from dominant.  At three bucks, it's a steal.			"

												Great game that is let down by lazy software. The board game itself is fun, challenging and reinvents itself everytime you play. The software on the other hand disconnects if you switch windows and disconnects randomly even if you don't switch windows -- causing lost games and timeouts for no reason.At the time of writing this review, the online servers have been down for at least 3 days, giving me an ""Unknown Auth Error"". As much as I enjoy the game, I can't recommend it because of the shockingly bad and broken software that should have been fixed a year ago. Great stuff Days Of Wonder /s			"

												I have this boardgame, and at first I was disappointed at this version. Until the day I got bored and gave it a go. I mighy have been unlucky, but I got the impression that the AI is quite tough to beat. I lost three solo games in a row. Then I join two games online and I won them both.Solo doesn't look too solid, and it is also a pity that you can't change bots' names, change AI level, or create some house rules. But I was happy playing online, and this is how I'd recommend you to play.			"

												Smallworld 2 is a must for anyone who likes the boardgame. Better yet, is you ever had any questions on the rules for the boardgame, this will clear those questions up, as the game forces you to play by the rules. The music and sounds are enjoyable as well. It is great as an intro game or exit game after a long night of playing other “stuff”. I hope a few more expansions come out!			"

												Based on the board game, I would say this is a passable version of the board game and great for a quick solo match when folks are not around to play in real life. I will have to try the online version against others once I get more fimilar with what is going on in the rules and how to play the game a bit better, as the AI kicked my♥♥♥♥♥  All and all no issues with the game, it played nicely on my gaiming rig I hope they continue to support this game for a bit.  4/5 for sure, the fact that you got some basic stats at the end is nice, I think people like that.

												loved the board game, and this does a great job of recreating it.  didn't seem to have any glitches, something that i usually expect from a digitized board game.  still, a board game is centered around spending time with people playing it.  Unless you are on comms with someone else, you will never have that from ANY digitized board game.  Still, 2 thumbs up.			"

												Small World 2 is a decent board game and this game does a fair job of providing a computer game version. Once you fully understand the rules and start learning the races and special powers, you can have fun trying to improve your strategies. Eventually the game wears a bit thin. I do appreciate that I was able to learn the rules to this board game through this Steam game but now look more forward to playing this game in real life moreso than the online version.			"

												Small world 2 is a great game, but if you are buying this game to play anything other then solo mode then please reconsider your purchase. The online for this game is broken, you have to make a seperate account which will not work half the time and then the game will not allow you to group up with your friends accounts. I wish this worked but sadley it just doesnt.			"
