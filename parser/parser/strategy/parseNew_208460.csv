												This game is bad. It is badly made graphic wise, story wise (for the campaign), sound wise and play wise. Everything looks bad including the sound and talking. Everybody sound stupid in the game and well, could it be more rehashed crap we've seen 10 thousands time the last 15 years? For god sake starcraft 1 today after 15 years is a more inovative and fun game to play than that crap that come from who knows where. I don't mind indie dev with poor graphics as long as the game is fun, but this crapfest is just not worth it. I got it for cheap on black friday sale and i still feel like i got riped off. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THAT GAME! DO NOT PRESS THE BUY BUTTON, YOU WILL LEAD A HAPPIER LIFE!			"

												The graphics and playstyle remind me of Universe at War, Command & Conquer, and Supreme Commander.  The single player campaign is good.  I don't know what everyone is complaining about.  There are things that frustrate me a little such as no low health warnings for a Hero that you must keep alive to complete a mission.  Most of the time I've failed missions it's because a Hero died without warning.  Being attacked doesn't always trigger a warning either.  There's a LOT that needs to be done to make the single player campaign more enjoyable.  It's worth the $10 I paid during a holiday sale.  I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this game.  Haven't tried multiplayer and have no desire to because of how slow the game is.  It took me 20 minutes to build an army of 100 soldiers and unit cap is 100.  Painfully slow to build reinforcement units.   I love the tech tree!  It's simple and intuitive.  Wish there were more upgrades to choose for each unit.  Basic tech tree is also it's weakness it becomes too basic too quickly.  The menus and hotkeys are good.  Everything about this game is pretty good.  I've really enjoyed it so far.  I absolutely loved Universe at War and Supreme Commander.  If you like those RTS games then you'll like Tryst.			"

												A brilliant strategy game buried under an extreme lack of polish. Everything feels like it hasn't undergone a final quality pass, so much so that it's obvious in less than an hour that you've bought and paid for a half-baked effort.			"

												At first I thought ""This reminds me of the 'old times' :D "" but after playing few missions It got boring and suddenly the difficulty level jumped up a multitude of time. The game seems as if the quality insurance manager was on vacation.Do yourself a favour and learn from other people's failure. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!!!			"

												I feel genuinely sorry for these developers, They tried to make good games, But they just failed, Or maybe they didn't but still, I feel sorry that they have made two bad games now and basically any game they make will just flop like these.			"

												Bought this game a while ago when finishing SC2 HOTS Campaign.I thought that the game looked an awful lot like the original StarCraft in 3D and paid the full price (~18€).BIG mistake, this game is no fun at all, despite of all the technical issues and the unifinished, unpolished state.

												Honestly, just no.It's just nothing I was looking for. An RTS with original, believable, fun, and exciting ideas. It fell face first in the first mission and the skirmish what just ""wat.""I'm sorry but I found this unplayable.			"
