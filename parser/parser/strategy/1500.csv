												Darwinia is one of my favorite games of all time. So it gets an obvious reccomendation from me. There is a lot going on with Darwinia and I've never played anything like it. It's one of those types of games that is really hard to describe, and you can only really understand after playing it for a bit. It's a weird game to get into at first. But once you get past the first two or so levels and understand what's going on it really takes off. So basically what's going on with this game is your thrown into a level, and your given a few goals to complete the level. There are a lot of different objectives in the game, but most of the time your goal is to kill all the enemies on the map, and move your little Darwinians to key locations. What's really nice about the levels is all tools the game gives you tie in together in really clear ways. You make soilders to kill enemies and create souls, the engineers retrieve the souls and bring them to the soul collector to generate new darwininans, and the Darwinians interact with the map and you don't have direct control over them. It all comes together really well. My favorite part about the game though is how much freedom you get. It sounds weird but let me explain. Darwinia perfectly lets you experience it at your own pace, and in your own way. There's so many ways to handle each situation in the game, and you're encouraged to handle it any way you want to. You can be super effiecient and try to carefully mine every enemies' soul, or you can do things more crazy and charge in with air strikes. Both are valid strategies in Darwinia. You can try spam engineers to take over a semi-hostile base and raise hell from inside the enemy territory, or you can enter from the shores and work your way in. The game doesn't care which way you do it. Nothings timed, nothings scored. And I love that. Because if you had a score, or a time limit it means you'd have to play the game in the most effient way, but without those things I felt more encouraged to try out crazier ideas, or ideas that I knew were just stupid, but its ok because it's fun. And that's what Darwinia encourages. It's all free. But it's more than just that. The game let's you jump into and out of levels at anytime and it you'll be able to jump right back into exactly where you left off instantly. You can acess more than one level at once so if you get bored or stuck on one level, you can jump out and start working on another level. It's great! Probably my absolute favorite part about Darwinia is how free the camera is, and that's a really weird thing to say, but lemme explain. The camera in Darwinia is very free. You can move it to any location, and look at anything from almost any angle. It's almost like a camera you'd see in an editor of some sort. But it really really works in Darwinia. Because the camera is so free it really makes the game feel like a world that's actively happening, and you're just interacting with it. Almost like a little toybox world, or at least that's how it makes me feel anyway. With the camera, and entire game giving you so much freedom, and a lot of the units do things on their own in this game, ontop of the very simple art style(which is perfect for this game), and the great ambience the sounds create, I felt like I could get really immersed into game. I liked to put the camera at dramatic angles and imagine all sorts of adventures and stories as things were happening. I've taken more screenshots in this game than any other. So basically what I'm getting at, is if you like to imagine weird stuff or like to get really immersed into a game both strategically and artistically, then this game does the trick. And the game has a level editor and mod creator. Yeah. ♥♥♥♥in sweet. This is one of those games that I have NO idea why this isn't more popular. And the story is really weird and cool. And it's really existential and you are an active part of the story... like you the person sitting at their computer, not you the player in the game. It's a bit weird, and I didnt really understand what was going on for awhile. But I really like that kind of stuff so the plot I really really liked. So final reccomendations: Definity get this game. It's amazing. It really really appeals to what I like personally, so you probably wont think it's the most amazing thing like I do, but I think you'll definitly have fun. Don't get it if you don't think you'll be able to handle the controls. Darwinia can also be really weird difficult to understand at first so if you're not willing to do that, then you probably wont enjoy it either. Anyway, love this game. Personal favorite. And it's $10. So no excuses. That's less than a movie, or dinner at a nice restaurant.			"

												Darwinia is hard to describe. It's part RTS, part god game one could say. You are in charge of protecting and restoring the Darwinian population, however you can't directly control them. Although the officer tool does make up for that fact. Instead you spawn in several programs to assist the little guys in order to destroy the red virus that has infected their world.The gameplay is pretty solid, and becomes massively fun during the fights where you get to utilize your Darwinians. Having two massive forces collide and duke it out while you influence the battle field with your programs is something not many games capture too well.Speaking of the Darwinians, they are the stars of this game. They are important for manning buildings, turrets, and eventually the main fighting force at your disposal. They have a few things they do that adds a nice little touch, such as jumping into the air when a mission is complete, or mourning over the loss of a fallen comrade. The story brags about how smart these guys are, but they don't do much that isn't scripted. They really come to life in battle however, their digital screams, panic, and blaring war trumpets and marching tunes give them character.The story is servicable, although nothing groundbreaking. They thankfully allow you to skip through it if you aren't that interested, although I soaked in as much as I could. If your a sap like me, you'll grow fond of the little guys, otherwise the gameplay should suffice.All in all, the game is great fun and a blast to play. It took me around 6 hours to beat on one playthrough. Beating it will give you a level editor to muck around in and another profile with all locations enabled, so you can edit to your heart's content. Some would argue it's a little short, and I feel like it could have a few more levels, but what it does offer is more than worth it's price tag.			"

												This is the only strategy game I feel good when playing. Normally, strategy games are either so insultingly easy you steamroll the enemies without really working out a plan, or complicated enough that I don't understand what's going on when I'm suddenly wiped out.This game isn't like either of those! There are challenging moments, frustrating events, hilarious little quirks, and of course, beautiful digital environments, but all in all, the game is really genuinely fun to play. I just wish there was more to do, since it ends so quickly.			"

												It's fun!The retro, polygonal graphics, (tasteful) chiptune soundtrack, and overall atmosphere are really interesting to experience. The gameplay is fun in a non-frustrating way - it's hard to get into a position where you lose, and even if you aren't employing the optimal strategy for a level, given enough time, you will be able to beat each stage in different ways. I rarely got frustrated with this game and never really felt bored, even though a lot of the gameplay isn't necesarilly that complex. The story doesn't dominate the experience, but the brief sections where you learn more about Darwinia are definitely rewarding. Overall, all these little details don't really matter in the face of the fact that I constantly was entertained while playing this game and never really felt bad, something that even modern games don't necesarilly provide.If you're expecting a complex RTS, this is not that game. Think of it as more of ""digital weeding"", as you slowly and carefully purge the viruses through each stage using a variety of tools. "

												I don't know what compelled me to even buy this since I can't stand RTS games generally, but it didn't take long before Darwinia became one of my all-time favorites. Something in the way it's presented just made sense to me, and I found the context to be especially endearing.Part of what really appealed to me was how simple and straightforward everything was: soldiers shoot stuff, engineers build stuff, etc. Even the upgrade options, in the context of file updates (v2.0), made everything feel more accessible. The game code is mercifully stable for an ""indie"" game and I found myself wasting hours defeating every last enemy and making sure that every uninhabited piece of land was repopulated. I frequently found myself rooting for individual scouts and soldiers that bravely out-maneuvered their enemies. It really says something about a game that can make you feel so attached to its literal pixels.The excellent score and sound effects coupled with the game's relaxingly retro aesthetic have proven great for replayability, making Darwinia a world I'm happy to revisit often. 9/10.

												An absolutely wonderful casual game. You dont need the latest and greatest hardware to play this one on the road. It doesn't eat your laptop's battery for breakfast. The 8-bit sound track is awesome, gives it that retro feel, it only enhances the game play. As for the graphics, love the volumetric effects and the old looking shadow effects. Very engaging, on the edge of your seat as you get attacted from all sides just trying to keep ahead of the battle. Bought this originally on CD-ROM when it came out. I'm glad Steam released it on OS X. Brings back the early 2000's.10/10			"

												The lackluster trailer, uninspiring description, and graphically deficient screenshots for Darwinia made me gloss over this game for years. And for whatever reason, I decided to give it a test drive. The game does not disappoint. It's a really fun, simplistic RTS. The developers have stripped out all the typical complexities of a traditional RTS and provide extremely intuitive controls making it manageable fun that does not overwhelm. The story is quite good as well--a creative evolution of a digital species. Very enjoyable.			"

												""Fascinatingly charming"" is how I'd describe this game.  The retro graphics are vaguely evocative of Tron, and the enemies and characters are all subtle references/homages to video games and video game culture of the mid-to-late 80s and early 90s.  There are Spiders and Centipedes reminiscent of Centipede, the Engineers which are evocative of Recognizers from Tron, even the Bombers that respond to Air Strike beacons look like they're right out of Space Invaders.The Darwinians themselves are adorable.  Though they have no animations and are simple 2D sprites in a 3D world, they manage to demonstrate a lot of personality.  From the little mourning kites they release when souls ascend to the Central Repository, to the way Officer Darwinians chant out a marching cadence when issuing a ""Follow Me"" order, to the screams of horror and pain Darwinians have when terrorized with explosive weaponry and laser fire, you can't help but feel a little for the little guys.As far as gameplay goes, it's very intuitive and usually pretty solid, some camera wonkiness aside.  Managing a Squad is simple (Everything you can do aside from secondary-weapon switching is handled with two buttons) and intelligent use of Squads forms the cornerstone of gameplay.  The game doesn't punish you for failure - replacing Squads is as easy as hitting F1, then clicking within a valid spawning area.  You're encouraged to replace your Squaddies often and try out different tactics to accomplish your goals.  All of the other units you can control are similarly uncomplicated, and the game gives you plenty of room to learn without holding your hand and beating you over the head with forced tutorials.Darwinia encourages freedom of choice and lateral thinking in ways I haven't seen a lot of games do - stages are frequently nonlinear and the objectives can be accomplsihed in any order.  Often times, you're simply thrown into a stage and challenged to figure out your own method for victory.  Do you burmush your objectives or methodically wipe out the virus infestation between you and your target?  Do you take your foes head-on, or can you sneak an Engineer around to a different comm port and use it as a second beachhead?  Do you carefully avoid enemies in order to get a shot on a particularly annoying foe unopposed, or do you just carve your way in?All in all, Darwinia's one of the most refreshing tactical games I've had the pleasure of playing, and I heartily recommend it for anyone who enjoys a little old school nostalgia, adorable faux-retro graphical charm, and solid gameplay.

												Darwinia is a one of a kind strategy game where some of the units are directly controlled and some are indirectly controlled. Looking after Darwinia does not feel like a chore. Instead, it feels like a necessity. You will develop feelings towards Darwinia and your Darwinians.Pros:-Different gameplay (RTS) feel-Darwinians are cute-Darwinia's graphics is beautifulCons:-Camera sometimes feel clumsyConclusion:9/10Go (buy it and) play it.

												Let me start off by saying that this is in my top ten favorite games of all time. Darwinia's a cool retro-style game about a digital world populated by little people called Darwinians, who are under siege by a dangerous computer virus. Under the instructions of Darwinia's creator, you have to help get rid of the virus and restore Darwinia to it's fully-funtional self.The whole time playing I thought I had the ending figured out, I thought it was going to end on some lame twist where Darwinia's actually Earth or something. But no, it actually ended very originally, and on an extremely bitter-sweet note.My only complaint, and it's really a minor one, is that for a game called ""Darwinia"" it's not very Darwinian. I was expecting a lot of heavy symbolism reflecting Charles Darwin's Theories of Evolution, but there's only a few, very subtle, nods to evolution where you can upgrade the troops of Darwinia. In fact the game's sequel ""Multiwinia"" is more Darwinian, since the Darwinians are battling eachother for supremacy.There's actually more symbolism for religion than anything else. But don't be alarmed by that, the symbols are very subtle. And even then the symbolism is actually really good, the symbolism helps the message it tries to convey, which I won't tell you, because it would spoil the ending. Just trust me it's a really good and interesting message.I can't recommend this game or the team behind it enough. I've never seen anything like Darwinia, and I'd say you should check it out too.

												Introversion is a small development house that deserves more attention than it gets.   The team makes modest, beautifully conceived, games that are compelling to play and darwinia is one of their best.The gameplay is challenging enough without, save perhaps one small exception, being frustrating. This allows you flexibility in play so, whether you are the aggressive type or slow and methodical, you should find a satisfying game.  I never felt forced to find the trick to advance forward and the game never worked against my approach to the maps, as often happens in other games.The graphics are simple, as you would expect from a group that isn't cranking out a million dollar blockbuster, but beautiful and enhance, rather than detract from, the experience.  At first it might seem offputting, but you quickly realize that it isn't something that requires tolerance but actually fits the game's story and design. The story doesn't feel like an afterthought.  It is well written and has a strange emotional pull for a video game.  The lovely music changes to help drive this emotion  but is never in your face and never becomes tiresome. It all combines beautifully, and doesn't feel slapped together, but has a spare, elegant quality. I found myself amazed at how emotionally attached I became to each little stick figure and its survival. This game is well worth the modest price.  It isn't a throwaway, have a look during a sale, type of game. I never felt that I was having to overlook flaws or that I had made a donation to an aspiring developer.  Although relatively short it has great replay value, especially the later missions. I finished the game and have played it numerous times through and I go back and replay it every so often.  This should tell you something, in an age where we have steam accounts bursting with games we play for a few minutes and never glance at again.  "

												Darwinia isn't an RTS, because there's not a lot of ""strategy"" to it.  There's no tech tree, and you only directly control a few units or squads at a time.  It's mostly ""action tactics"": player skill is applied in unit positioning/movement/targetting on 3D terrain, and in switching your focus around.  Darwinia is also mostly about its theme, if a game is allowed to have two mostlys.  It's a Tron-like journey into a retro cyberspace.  The goals of each mission are set in varied and beautiful techno landscapes sparsely populated by artifical life, friendly and otherwise.So it's a sequence of setpieces really, with a small-scale hands-on feel.  It's not too frantic.  Compared to a traditional RTS like StarCraft 2 it is downright leisurely.  Which is fine with me; I like to be able to take a few seconds occasionally to watch an Engineer cruising across a digital seascape with a string of glowing souls in tow.The demo is a good sampling of the game's content & mechanics.

												In most RTS games, resource-gathering and military power are two mostly separate things. In Darwinia, your resources are actually the souls of dead units and you need to harvest them soon after you kill them. This choice between harvesting and military is very dynamic. You can and have to change your tactics fast to deal with the situation. You have a low maximum number of units but there is no build time. However, you can only build at certain locations, so waiting time depends on where the battle is taking place.Third, micro-management is quite different from what you're used to: You don't just click to attack, you decide exactly where your soldiers shoot. Macro-management is really narrative-driven. Levels have very different goals with each other and winning feels more like solving a puzzle than managing and allocating resources. Darwinia is a weird little game, it's one of those things that broaden your horizons. That's why it shouldn't be missed.			"

												Darwinia.. think digital cats, TRON, and simplistic design.Darwinia's debut was an absolute success for Introversion and rightly so. An interesting story about AI and developing societies in which you help bring back from the brink of destruction all from the guise of a pseudo-user (if you'll pardon the TRON reference).The UI is tastefully simple, combat is also fairly simple, which makes the game easy to learn.

												A truly unique game, in gameplay and style. It mixes mellow management with tactics with white kunckle combat. The concepts and mechanics are well defined and easy to use.The WASD-mouselook camera control system is one I wish every RTS would adopt.Excellent sound design.I am not into RTS, but this isn't really an RTS. You should get it.			"

												Darwinia is a classic indie game, an RTS on a large yet microscopic level.  Very tron-like in it's intention and it pulls the theme off well.  I highly recommend it, and it's ""sequel"", Multiwinia.  The basic story revolves around you, a hacker, that finds a scientist's private server, that contains his experiment on creating a digital species (Darwinians).  But viruses have corrupted the majority of his life's work, and you need to command his creations to free themselves from the malware and virueses that are destroying the world that the scientist has created for them.  It makes you feel good when you have a victory, and mourn the loss when innocent souls are slaughtered on a mass scale in these epic battles.Gameplay-wise, it has essentially no resource management whatsoever.  But that is a good thing, especially for those that are just dipping their toes in the RTS genre, and just want action.  You instead control the battlefield by initiating various programs and deploying them to fight the infection. as well as appointing captains of the local population of darwinians that rally those nearby to attack, move to a position, and such.  The programs you can initiate to help fight your battles include engineers that collect dead 'souls' to be revived, and capture important buildings such as spawn points and traffic lanes.  Then there are you direct combat commandoes, the squad.  The squad is a group of 3-5 heavily armored humanoid soldiers that you can command to directly move anywhere, and you can direct their fire yourself, like in a top-down shooter.  Upgrades can also allow them to lob grenades at your will, among other things.  As I mentioned before, you can appoint a Darwinian to be a captain of sorts via another command.  The final program is initiating an airstrike over a designated location, devastatingly ripping anything below (including your own troops) to pieces.As you progress through the campaign, you can find boxes of previous research from the scientist, and tell him to research (essentially, upgrade) one of your commands, which takes some time but is useful.  Upgrades include adding more members to a squad, allowing regular darwinians to throw grenades, adding another bomber to your airstrike runs, etc.No buildings that you can control ccan ever be destroyed, and there is no resource whatsoever that you have.  Darwinians spawn in waves, coming out of large buildings that you can take control of with your engineers.  Your engineers can also pick up the souls of dead enemies and allies that linger after they die, to deposit them into these buildings that resurrect them.  As you can see from the trailer, the battles are massive cluster#$!@s of friendly and not so friendly darwinians, other enemies lke snaking viruses and spiders, etc.The story is inspiring, the gameplay is unique, simple, and fun - I would recommend it to anyone, even those that don't do the RTS genre.  To be honest, this a a gateway drug to the RTS genre.  What I have to say to the customer who wants to buy this, is that they should buy this in the pack you can see below that has all the classic games from Introversion (The development studio behind this) and two of their soundtracks.  Multiwinia is essentially the same as darwinia just without as much direct unit creation, but focuses on the aspects of using the darwinians in legions and using such strategies.  You can get power ups too, that allow you to do various things like in Darwinia, plus some more.  DEFCON is a good RTS that takes heavy inspiration from movies like 'Wargames' and the general Cold War scenarios that were hypothesized in the mid 20th century.  You control a world power with nukes.  You are just the general in the bunker, not any politician.  As the situation escalates, you mobilize more and more forces that you place strategically early in the game.  Then everything goes to ♥♥♥♥ as thermonuclear war breaks out.  It really is more complex than what I'm saying here, and you might as well get it with getting the other games.  Uplink is a neat, almost too-plausible hacker simulator inspired by the things you see in your average action movie.So I would get all of their games for the value price when they are bundled, and it includes the soundtracks to two of them.

												Even though it is an RTS game, it reminds me of god-games.It might be the setting or the 'story', I'm not sure.It doesn't have a multiplayer mode (however, a separate multiplayer game called ""Multiwinia"" exists).What it does do, however, is mixing genres into something both unique and enjoyable.It doesn't fail to create an interesting atmosphere, mainly due to the soundtrack, which reminds me of Introversion's later title ""DEFCON"".Not having humans but rather ""abstract virtual digital lifeforms"" who can't speak and who don't have any emotions (or do they?) probably adds to that fact, along with the ""cyber-world"" that you play on/in, which does have water, hills et al, but, after all, also has a digitalized and abstract look-and-feel.The featured game mechanics were not surprising, but overall very enjoyable.Along with an intuitive control mechanism the game was easy to handle.The included ""loaders"" (intro animations) are a nice gimmick.One of them parodies a typical 80s crack intro that looked so authentic, a steam employee believed there had been a compromise[forums.introversion.co.uk] and thus delayed the game's Steam release.In the end, I hope you have realized how this isn't your normal off-the-shelf strategy game.You might want to go watch some gameplay videos on your favourite video platform to check if you can cope with the game's style.

												From the gameplay to the soundtrack and graphics, this game is beautifully designed. It has a low file-size, an extremely pleasing retro artstyle, and intuitive and fun gameplay. The setting and atmosphere are perfect, the difficulty is perfect, and the story manages to be interesting and compelling despite being given almost no time for exposition of any kind. I have played through this game many times now - even more than my playtime suggests since it can run on a toaster and so is perfect for old laptops with no internet connection - and every time I find it entertaining and challenging. For the price, this is an amazing purchase, and I wish Introversion would give it the sequel it sorely deserves. No, Multiwinia does not count.One protip if you play this though: Don't use the GUI. Hotkeys are significantly better.			"

												 An old favorite of mine. I bought it on Steam to see if it was as good as when I played it a while back. The game is amazing. The art direction of the the world is beautiful even though the game was made a while ago. Dealing with the virus in each level requires more than just running in and shooting at everything, especially in the later levels.  The game does have a few minor flaws though. Mostly just squaddies getting stuck on narrow strips of land and the rare frame rate drop when several explosions are on screen at once. But all in all, if you're looking for a good RTS, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

												This game is great, and I remember seeing it on the store back in 2005.  Back in those days, my computer couldn't even RUN the ♥♥♥♥ing thing.  Seriously, I got engine errors.What I'm trying to say by saying that it came out in 2005 is that this game has NOT aged well.  Graphically, it's fine.  Infact, the graphics are still very appealing and I like them.  Technically, it isn't good.  The game forces Vsync on, and not only does it cause input delay, it also causes serious mouse issues.  The mouse is really glitchy and jumps around a lot.  Force disabling Vsync in your graphics card's control panel helps alleviate this issue.  It does not FIX it, it just makes it bearable.On the gameplay side, you control little dudes called ""Darwinians"" and you're fighting back a virus.  There is no resource aside from ""souls,"" which drop from your Darwinians and the virus monster that you kill.  There's also a ""task manager,"" which means you can only have 3 to 5 (depending on your upgrade progress) 'programs' running at once.  Programs include things like armored units, 'engineers' (workers who collect and process souls), and armored tanks.  Oh, contrary to what I said: you cannot directly control a Darwinian, instead you control them through Officers, who give basic orders like ""go over here,"" or ""follow me.""  The game's AI does the rest.There are a few SERIOUS gameplay elements that annoy me a lot.  The upgrade system is time-based, but once you get an upgrade, you keep it forever.  However, the upgrades take FOREVER to finish.  No joke, I think upgrading a system to level 3 takes something likes two full HOURS of real time.  Despite this, you can still play the game normally and the upgrades work in the background.  Each mission can take about an hour, so you don't really notice the time, especially if you're going for 100% objective completion.  The second serious complaint I have is a monster called a ""Soul Eater,"" or something along those lines.  I just called it a ""dragon"" because it looks like a dragon.  This monster is pure luck to kill.  You have to kill it with explosives, but rockets don't hit it, only grenades and air strikes do, and only when the monster is near the ground.  It's pure luck if the monster is actually near the ground when you launch your explosive.  These monsters can also one-shot every unit you can create, which means they slow the game right the ♥♥♥♥ down.  I hated fighting these guys.  The only tactic I found to be effective is to switch to rockets, and have my squad suicide by shooting rockets at themselves, hoping it does some damage to the dragon.Besides these two complaints, I love playing this game.  It's slow-paced and casual, but still very enjoyable, especially if you like RTS.  It also has its own hectic moments, as well.			"

												The virtual world of Darwinia has been overrun with viruses.  You must help the simple AI denizens of this cyberspace reclaim their home.You do not have direct control over the cute little green Darwinians themselves.  In fact, they are mostly defenseless, peacefully ignorant wanderers.  You’re given a small set of programs which you can command, and you’ll use these (with the slightly unintuitive controls) to win back all the territory the green guys have lost.  Defend the little green guys, though.  You need them to operate the machines scattered around the landscape.The world is an archipelago of mountainous islands which house different building that the Darwinian society needs to function.  You’ll travel from level to level, recapturing them as you go, wiping out the virus infection.  Your squads are not very strong, and they move rather slowly, but they are effectively infinite, because they require no resources to create.  Battles are hard-fought and measured in inches gained. Forget turtling or trying to build an overwhelming army: in Darwinia you can only use a few units at a time.The cyberspace world is rendered in interesting triangular graphics which really set this game apart from most others.  It took a little getting used to, because often hills and valleys can sometimes be completely covered in shadow.  But the two-dimensional Darwinians have so much character, even though they don’t really do that much.  You will grow attached to them, not individually but as a group.  Losing some to an avoidable mistake is heartbreaking, and you’ll want to protect them from harm, even though they are easily replaced.Exploring and conquering this world is an adventure you won’t soon forget.  Each level is unique, every battle a story.  While the game can play a little slowly at times, and there is no way to pause it in the conventional sense, these are minor problems. This is a great little strategy game, like nothing that has come before, and nothing that has been made since.Darwinia is a game about a peaceful civilization rising up and retaking their homeland.  It is a story of a creator underestimating his creation.  The open-ended way the missions are designed allows you to write your own legends.  Most strategy games reward balancing resource gathering and shoring up defensive positions; Darwinia does away with all of that in exchange for a simpler, more fun interpretation of a commander leading his army.  I highly recommend everyone check this game out.			"

												One of my personal favorites. I dearly love Introversion software for their unique and new games. Darwinia focuses on a virtual world on the server of Dr. Sepulveda, with little green people figures called Darwinians. As you find out, they're under a viral attack and desperately need your help to survive. Dr. Sepulveda's life work is on the line, and it's up to you to use the programs he gives you, or can find, to destroy the virus and save a breakthrough in AI programming. The gameplay is simple, easy to understand, and while the visuals aren't 'photorealistic' they are perfectly fitted for the theme of the game, and very Tron like, lending it a perfect visual capacity. You can upgrade your various programs to greater effectiveness, and guide the little Darwinians to help them get their world back. It's incredibly fun, and the story is quite compelling.			"

												I LOVE this game, it seemed like such an odd premise at first, as the tutorial explained how to play, it seemed even more odd, but ti was so engaging, it had me hooked from the first proper level, the gameplay is fun, the visuals, unique, and the story, whilst being minimal, is excellent for the game, it immersed me so well. If you a fane of strategy games, this game is an excellent twist on the genre.			"

												One of the most satisfying RTS games I've played to date that isn't just a copy of an existing formula. I've probably played through 3 times completely, and still pick it up for a couple of hours each year. Not intended to be a graphics powerhouse, this game relys instead on a good story and playability with solid (and creative) level design.  It is unfortunate they never made s second installment (Multiwinia was not really a sequal.) Oh, and as a bonus there are some RPG elements in the form of research upgrades for weapons and commands, so it can be a little different each time you play.			"

												I personally liked the game.I beat the whole story in 13 hours (that is killing every enemy on the map not just completeing each objective) and enjoyed every bit of it! Frist i'll tell you what i liked about the game: The story, the art style, and gameplay! I haven't read much about the story in other reviews but i like it and thats all ill say. The art style is supposed to look like you are in a computer world(kinda like tron) so it is really simple but kinda ""cute"" or cartoony. The game play is what everyone is talking about so first the problems.I couldn't unplug my headset while playing the game or else an error would appear and it would crash.The Darwinians are like cattle where they move in straight lines but if you use officers correctly then you're fine.a bug happened where i couldn't build anything but restarting the game fixed that.The first mission (not prolouge) is really boring and that deterrs many people.Positive:Alot of game time for 1$ (currently 13hrs)I thought the sound effects were funny.Some stratiegic thought and tactics do go into this game. (its not just run at each other, get more units and repeat)You unlock something at the end that increases the amount of time you could play it! ;)Nice soundtrackThere is alot more that i like but i must go to the counter arguments or problems.Dubhe said""- Units with bizarre controls, like:--- Left click to select--- Left click to move--- Left click and hold to to special action 1--- Left click and hold near the unit to do special action 2""I don't know what game he was playing but you do use left click to select and move but you hold right click to shoot and while holding right click if you left click they do their special.Dubhe also said""--- Don't worry, though, because your units will randomly exit and reenter the turret every couple of seconds! Even during battle!--- Also, you can't control where the turret fires! And it does damage to friendly units!--- And, it's inexplicably easy for enemy units to kick your guys out and take control of the turret!""My units never reentered and exited turrets unless the units inside the turret were killed. You can control where the turret fires but darwinians have to be inside and your units can also kick enemy out of turrets too. (kinda funny when they just keep kicking each other.) XDLidion45 said""Unable to select more than one unit at once?!?!Clunky controls for moving unitsUnits don't fire by themselves, yet randomly play the shooting sound when you're not looking?Bullets bouncing on uneven terrain makes shooting very awkward given most of the map is mountainous""Yes the first is true but i didn't have a problem with it. My units did fire by themselves (maybe he/she didn't have darwinian reasearched to level 2?) Bullets do bounce on terrain and sometimes that got annoying so i avoided terrain like that.Overall i loved the game even though it does have its little bugs and problems but wouldn't buy it for the 10$ (or 20$ for both) I would get them on sale so you get both games for 1.30$. (No offence to the other reviews I just used yours as counter arguments.)			"

												Story based game with an extremely virtual feel, as if you truly are messing around with the internal workings of a system or network... but in an RTS way!Starting off by controlling a squad, you slowly improve throughout many levels until you can pretty much command armies. Once at that point, it goes from micro RTS to macro RTS to defeat the virus.Interesting gameplay, fun as any Introversion game.			"

												A very different RTS! Great fun, with a nifty aesthetic (and a superb soundtrack), and every time you think you've worked out how to win, it introduces something new, forcing you to get creative and start trying new strategies. This is definitely not an RTS you can beat by 'turtling'. Thoroughly recommended! (Even if the controls are a tad confusing and the game rarely bothers to explain just what something can and can't do).			"

												This is one of those few, odd titles which really doesn't have a home in any genre, but in every true gamer's heart and mind. Having emerged from the almost-literal Twilight Zone of games, Darwinia eludes definition with its unique visuals, quirky gameplay, oh-so-subtle humour and simple yet deep story. There's never been a game like Darwinia before Darwinia, and odds are there'll never be another Darwinia either. The game is, right now, unique. That alone makes it well worth looking into. 9.7/10			"

												This game is simple and unique, yet at the same time it is frustrating and tedious. If there was a neutral rating I would have chosen that. Works fine on a Win 7 laptop without a video card. There are 10 missions, but by the 2nd or 3rd mission you should know whether or not you will like this game. I almost quit after the 2nd mission, cause I thought I didn't convert enough people and I didn't feel like starting over. There is no manual save but it does automatically save your progress at any point you exit the game, but I always had the worrying factor that I would screw up and would have to start the map over again. In reality that wasn’t a problem. Killing and converting the enemy is not really hard since you have an unlimited amount of lives and ammo. I think I killed myself more by running into my grenades, since movement and grenades both use the same button. The tedious part was moving the darwina to a specific objective after I cleared out the enemy, but it kinda grew on me. Missions are basically the same so not really any variety. The game did last me around 12 hours. I did get this for $1.99 as part of the introversion classic pack, so it is a good deal, I just didn't find the game fun enough and a little too casual to give it a positive review. I give it a 4.75/10			"

												Virus busting simulator to the max. You are a hacker who helps an awesome informatic doctor who created Darwinia and has viruses everywhere on his world. With the simple programs he gives to you, you can control them directly and bust viruses as you upgrade the researches you have and what you have found.Introversion Software is best for their technologic indie games such as Uplink, DEFCON and the newer game Prison Architect, which instead it bases off the daily prison life. Consider getting this game and the other games by Introversion for your maximum enjoyment.Story: 10/10 - The story is intense and quite heartwarming, the writing of the story is best having a story about the Darwinians and its locations are different. There's also a Prologue level in where you can get to be teached how to play.Controls: 8/10 - The controls for the game are well-prepared, but sometimes when you get to move with holding your cursor you'd sometimes get swapped off with another unit. But its use of Keyboard & Mouse controls are good enough the same.Graphics: 10/10 - From what i have saw, this game makes clever use of pixellated shaders for the unit models (Squad, Engineers, enemies, etc.) and aswell the 2d sprite entities of the Darwinians. Their frame rate of the model turnings have a excellent take, the HUD looks like as a futuristic PSX game design and it reminds me if this game was made in the 1990s with great graphics.Music: 9/10 - It has some music, and it is especially intended for cutscenes. None music is intended to work when you play the game, as to face with the atmosphere of the 1980s technology setting. But in the intros you'd laugh that some are took from the amiga cracktros for the cracktro-styled intros. I have even heard one which is a remix to Thunder Cross by Konami, a obscure space shooter arcade game.Gameplay: 9/10 - It has a different genre of strategy in this game, you can find research cubes in some of the locations to obtain more stuff such as more weapons for your Squads, new units, and more. Sadly, you have few units like Squad, Engineers and Officers for the Darwinians, but it's good the same because it would be ridiculous to have like a team of different units. :PTotal: 4.6/5You might also check out Multiwinia, the multiplayer-driven sequel to Darwinia. It has the same gameplay but with 6 different game modes for greater enjoyment with your friends. ;) "

												This is a unique and interesting theme for this game, I can see why people compare it to the likes of Tron etc. I have given this game a not reccomended stamp, do not let this say that I do not appreciate it and I will try to give it a short and fair breakdown. Firstly this was part of a bundle and free games are always a welcome distraction and even if you buy it, the price is very cheap, this defianatly gives it a plus point as too many really bad games get waya with charging far more than this. This is not a bad game, not by any stretch. The first thing I would say is that I absolutly LOVE the soundtrack! the mix of old 8 and 16 bit music with a modern twist is greatly appreciated. I can acutally see me listening to some of this outside of this game it is definatly good enough. The theme of the game being set inside a network that has been invaded by a virus,and you have to help restore systems and giving personification to the systems and AI is a wonderful touch. I also like the progression it is tied into finding upgades via research that your enigneers have to scan in order to upgade your capabillites. The graphics are pretty simple, and this works in its favour, almost like a visual representation of something much more complex. The unlocking of new areas is tied into the opening of ports in the maps you visit, this is wonderful as it both plays on the theme, keeps within the story and makes you push to the ports in order to open up more content.You can clearly see the effor that has been out in here and as an indie title the has definatly got some wonderful features and a little bit of a story to carry it.Now the bad, Firstly the tutorials are awful, they simply do not explain things enough, I am not asking for hand holding here just it is kind of like; to do this... go in that direction.... meh figure it out yourself..... I spent a few hours playing around with it, and a lot I had to figure out myself, some people said oh its a learning curve, no a learning curve implies that you actually are told what tools you have at your disposal, and you have to learn how to impliment those tools, that is not the case here, the tutorial is just to sparse. In order to progress any further I would have had to look up how to get any further outside of the game, that should never have to happen with this type of game in my opinion.Secondly there are a few little annoying glitches and bugs, like when selecting a unit to build, often I would not always get the one I chose, and so had to dismiss the unit just built and give the build order again, its annoying the first time, by the tenth time I was actually getting into the habit of automatically holding down the unit menu [TAB] in order to cancel what it was going to build... thats not a good thing. And a number of troops would happily walk into force feilds or danger despite having a clear path they could have took, meaning micro management is compulsory.Thirdly there is no way (that I have figured out, forgive me if this comes a little later in) to group up multiple units, this makes micro management even more annoying and takes away from the flow of gameplay as you cannot split tasks easily. Overall this is not a bad game at all, the theme is enjoyable the story is alright and for the price you definatly get a good few hours distration, and the soundtrack it as I said earlier really good.

												You do not lose much when you pay for this game, but do not expect a great game experience. It is older than your aunt Mary's hat she wore to the first marriage she attended as a teen. And it was designed by a dev team when they had just learned how to spell pathfinding algrirothm and fuhn.Oh, it was entertaining for very few hours when it came out for the first time, but nowadays there are stronger free flash games.What I would recommend, if you insist on playing games that are older than mammoths, is Uplink, the dev team's previous game. Uplink has aged better, as it had an intentionally archaic user interface already when it came out.			"

												I first saw this game in 2005, after someone told me there is an RTS with decent looks which only weights 1.5MB. Indeed it was so small, due to absence of textures and usage of ""procedurally generated"" graphics or something instead, which look stylish and very original. Unfortunately my experience at that time ended right in the first mission because I didn't know how to complete it and the ""help"" system gave no clues.10 years later, in 2015 I got this game inside a bundle together with Prison Architect from the same dev (Prison Architect is a very good game btw). So, now, again, I almost got stuck in the 1st mission. Luckily I then guessed that you need to capture some satellite dishes (or something, the graphics are pretty low-polygonal) by placing an engineer next to it. And to go to a different island - since you can't send squads there because they don't walk over water - you need to delete a squad, then create a new one near a satellite dish on a different island. And - engineers walk over water and get to that dish... ok. This time I completed the first mission and got stuck in the second one because I don't know how to transport a flock of darwinians over water. And I ran out of patience because it took me half an hour to guess why red snakes keeps respawning (you need to kill a big red egg-laying spider with grenades or something - normal shots don't seem to hit it? the presentation was very unclear). That basically sums up my experience with the game.Pros:- great unique graphical style- pleasing music- nice intro scenes at the beginning of the game (one of them is a ""game of life"" simulation well-known to programmers and mathematicians; another says the game was cracked by a hacker which it's not since I got it on Steam..)- intriguing storyCons:- terrible tutorial, nothing is explained -> which alone makes the game unplayable for the vast majority of players and would actually make this game worth 0/10. Yet, judging from other reviews, also ones I read on professional websites, I still think that's it's me who is dumb and there is tons of gameplay which I wasn't patient/clever enough to get to. I'm pretty damn sure I represent the majority though- non-existent pathfinding (basically, units can only walk in straight lines, and if there is something in the way which they can't walk thru - they will keep pushing into that obstacle forever)- awkward camera system, with mouse wheel zooming in/out working in reverse (!), with no way to reconfigure that- unique but awkward unit selection/creation/ordering/combat system- units walk too slow over huge landscapes, no way to speed up the game- no save/reloadOverall, this game is more of ""look how much we can stuff into 1.5MB"" rather than a product for real people. I doubt they even tested this game on anyone outside their office. If you get it in a bundle for $1 or less - fine, it's worth a look for its originality. But most likely you won't be able to play it due to the described issues.			"

												Have you ever thought ""I really like RTS games, but jeez, I really wish I could find one where my units have absolutely no sense of self-preservation, unimaginably bad pathfinding, and need to be micromanaged so hard I'll be able to mention this game when I apply for babysitting jobs""?Well, Darwinia is the game for you!With amazing features, likeUnits that, when selected, don't attack enemies!The inability to select multiple units!Not using the right mouse button at all!Resource gathering units that will straight-up run into patches of enemies!Units that, when given a move command, will go to that point in a straight line and STOP if they run into any obstacle!--Hope you like hunting around the map for those reinforcements that should have been here already!--Is that enemy at the top of a mountain?  Sorry!Units with bizarre controls, like:--Left click to select--Left click to move--Left click and hold to to special action 1--Left click and hold near the unit to do special action 2------Also, we define any click longer than 2 microseconds as a ""Click and Hold""!A turret unit that you can deploy that requires 4 of your units to operate!--But once you put four units in there, you can't take them back out!--Or undeploy the turret!--Don't worry, though, because your units will randomly exit and reenter the turret every couple of seconds!  Even during battle!--Also, you can't control where the turret fires!  And it does damage to friendly units!------Did I mention resource gatherers will run straight at enemy groups without any regard for their life?--And, it's inexplicably easy for enemy units to kick your guys out and take control of the turret!Not to mention a research system that is basically just waiting!Don't buy this game.

												In the first five minutes, you will realize that this game offers close to zero instruction on how to play, and its in-story help mode/tutorial are deplorable examples thereof. Then, about 30 minutes into the game you will realize that the path finding is probably the absolute worst in any game you have ever played. The controls and operational methods are so inadequate and poor that you will wonder if this is the result of a bug (or many bugs), or even if the game has been installed correctly. Proceeding past the second mission without help is impossible. Because Darwinia does not explain itself to the player, you will be forced to search on Google for help and explanations, as this is the only way to make sense out of this presentational disaster. Further, because many aspects of the game are obscured by terrible presentation choices, you will feel as if the game does not allow you to play it. You will not know how to do several things that are required to achieve many of the mission objectives, thanks to the developer's choice in being vague and uninformative. The goals in Darwinia are explained so badly, that once again, I imagine that this portion of the game is also among the worst in any game I have played. The developers clearly did not have any care in designing a game that is intuitive, user friendly, and enjoyable. The feeling is that Darwinia is simply not complete, nor is it fully operable by the user. It is as if there are numerous amounts of game play that were not done to completeness, leaving the player at a loss and in frustration. In addition to the aforementioned problems, you can not save during a mission. The game does all the saving for you, after you complete each mission objective and at other seemingly random moments. This means, that you sometimes have to restart a mission from the very beginning, if something does not go according to plan. This is totally unacceptable. If the rest of the game was better suited, this saving problem would not bother me as much. The responsiveness of your units is atrocious. Ordering the units and Darwinians around is quite problematic, as they simply do not respond as they should, nor are they very useful to your commands. The processes required to order them around are tedious, slow, and unresponsive. They have such a difficult time maneuvering around the map, it's disgruntling. These shortcomings are so major, that enjoying the game as a whole is an arduous chore as you progress through the missions. Slowly, as you learn to endure Darwinia's league of problems, there are minor and sparse hints of quality gaming behind it all. Achieving the mission objectives as you hurdle past the developmental shortcomings and obstacles can give the player feelings of accomplishment and relief, since Darwinia is so inefficient and unfriendly. After all, this takes more work than it is fun. The creativity from the developers is undeniably present. The plot and storyline are original, going along well with the artwork and aesthetic style. Each map is basic, but they do have their stylistic charms. The missions can be repetitive, but at least they make sense in relation to the story. Unfortunately for the developers, creativity does not equal a quality product. There is a serious and widely known bug that will not allow you to deploy new units to the map, and the only way around it is to quit and restart the game. There are also some placement glitches that mysteriously do not allow you to deploy units. Darwinia is all about being an annoyance, a bother, a bore; a game with severe flaws that barely works or provides the player with anything remotely enjoyable. It is an incredibly tedious and inconvenient game. You will be spending your time and money better elsewhere.Darwinia is bad.			"

												I do not recommend this game at all. It makes no sense and one of the first objectives is impossible as your unit is killed instantly when you try to capture a base on another island because the enginers can't attack and you can't send your attacking units to the other place. All in all, do not buy this game, I only got it because I bought prison architect and the version I bought had all the introvision games.			"

												This was one of the first games I got on Steam... got it several years ago when Darwinia and Multiwinia went on sale. This is primarily a real-time strategy game, but I remember the controls being more difficult than they should be. Ultimately, I found the game to be incredibly boring, so I stopped playing it. I also remember trying multiplayer, and I died before I had any idea what the hell was going on. (My memory's a little hazy about this game, since I haven't picked it up in a long time.) This game seemed to get some praise from the critics, but I don't know why.I wouldn't recommend picking this up at any price.			"

												Alright, so let's see what all the fuss is about...It seems like the kind of RTS someone who had a vague idea what an RTS was but had never actually played one would make. There's less focus on massing units or build trees. The closest thing to gathering resources is the spirits you pick up from dead ""virii"", which are... floating arrows, mostly. There were these snaky things too and this giant egg-laying spider.I guess that brings me to the graphics. They're awful. I get that the blocky low-poly was an aesthetic choice, but everything looks so... bland. It kind of reminds me of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, where everything's pee-and-poop green and yellowish. The units are all pixel blurred like they're hentai genitals or something.There's... no music as far, as I can tell. I certainly didn't hear much of anything while I was playing. I apparently bought the soundtrack along with the game in a big bundle. I imagine I got a big empty folder for my money.Pathfinding is nonexistent. Everything tries to travel in a straight line. If something gets in the way that's intraversible then the unit moves straight into it and stops. If something gets in the way that's deadly then the unit will move straight into it and dies. I lost engineers and spirits that way. When some of your units are described as ""AI decades in development"", being unable to traverse a simple landscape is a little ridiculous.Well, order queueing is a thing, right? No. I don't know what it is with Introversion games and not having the ability to select multiple things or queue up actions with shift clicking but it's just not there, and that makes the lack of pathfinding even more infuriating. Games in the 90's had pathfinding and order queueing. Come on!I'll tell you why I quit. I was in the second level, and I was expected to get 150 darwinians under the tree. To do this I needed to reincarnate them in incubators by gathering spirits. The problem with this is while you're gathering spirits they drift away and then you can't pick them up. This leaves you with the very likely possibility that you'll not have the minimum 150 by the time you've scoured the map, killed everything, captured all the buildings, and painstakingly escorted these little dudes all the way back to the start of the map. I happened to have 138 by the time I was done, with a stray darwinian stuck on the wrong side of a deadly fence surrounding the starting area. Considering this all took me an hour, this is infuriating, and it's the second level.When a game starts to feel like a chore or work, then I stop playing it. I feel kind of bad giving it a negative rating based on two levels, but I really don't feel like I screwed up hard enough to warrant failing the level. The second level. A level where I'm still getting the grips of the mechanics of the game. Something that shouldn't take very long to get through. Something that shouldn't have ESCORT MISSIONS. Or, well, I didn't fail the level, since it didn't even bother to check if the objectives were completable and tell me. Nice.			"

												Top-down realtime strategy game that takes place in Darwinia, a virtual world that Darwinians live in. Darwinia was taken over by a virus, and it's up to you to control different programs to wipe out the virus, rebuild the population, and connect the world back together.I love this game and I love it's story. I have played it all the way through multiple times, which I never usually do with story-based games. Once you complete the game (which does take a decent amount of time), you are able to create your own worlds and share them with others to complete. What's also interesting is that after every location, there always seems to be a new mechanic that is introduced, always keeping the game fresh and more difficult.There is another game called Multiwinia that is a multiplayer version, though I haven't really played it too much.

												Darwinia is pretty old but don't let that stop you.  The graphics can be off putting at first until you realize they fit perfectly within the confines of the story being presented.  You stumble upon the world's first internet based theme park but soon find out that a massive virus is taking over and all of the users are being booted off the servers. That is, everyone but you and the server admin who enlists your help in fighting off the virus by completing various objectives, building up your antiviral army, and upgrading weapons as you go.  The game is a mix between RTS and third person action.  You take control of various buildings or nodes and create troops to push back the virus.  It is a difficult game to explain but I am having a blast with it.  At the time of this writing, the game is on sale for $2.49.  I've easily gotten my money's worth revisiting this old game.  Highly recommend if you have never tried Darwinia.			"

												Top-down realtime strategy game that takes place in Darwinia, a virtual world that Darwinians live in. Darwinia was taken over by a virus, and it's up to you to control different programs to wipe out the virus, rebuild the population, and connect the world back together.I love this game and I love it's story. I have played it all the way through multiple times, which I never usually do with story-based games. Once you complete the game (which does take a decent amount of time), you are able to create your own worlds and share them with others to complete. What's also interesting is that after every location, there always seems to be a new mechanic that is introduced, always keeping the game fresh and more difficult.There is another game called Multiwinia that is a multiplayer version, though I haven't really played it too much.

												i'll say this before you buy it. The first levels suck. they're boring and its common for a lot of people to go 'wtf boring' and give up its a world building game with a fair bit of character. those little darwinians are pretty interesting to watch. I wouldnt reccomend this game to just anyone though, its not a lot of people's cup of tea.so if you do get the game, stick with it past those first 5 or so levels			"

												I'll be honest, when I first discovered this little gem, it was a bootleg copy.  But I loved it so much that I had to give the devs their due.The game is short and sweet, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.  Darwinia drops you into a virtual world inhabited by Darwinians, A.I. programs that are the result of a 10-year research project.  Unfortunately, a virus has gotten loose in the system, and it's up to you and Dr. Sepulveda (the world's creator) to eradicate it.The game plays like an action/RTS hybrid, with a look-and-feel heavily inspired by TRON.  Your main ""programs"" (read: units) are the Squad, which can attack the virii directly, and the Engineer, which can recapture buildings taken by the virus and collect digital ""souls"" for reprocessing.  Most levels consist of the having the Squads and Engineers clear out an infected area, converting the dead virii into new Darwinians, then sending in the Darwinians to work the various buildings that are central to Darwinia's operation.  Later on, you get some upgrades and new programs that allow the Darwinians themselves to join in the fight.The control scheme is interesting; you create programs by drawing gestures with the mouse.  Once you master this, it's a snap to quickly roll out whichever programs are suited to the task at hand, especially when it comes to switching between the Squad's secondary weapons.  You can switch to a menu-driven interface if you prefer, but I personally think the gesture system is more fun, if a little finicky at times.  Maintaining your composure enough to accurately draw a gesture while in the heat of battle is part of the challenge!If I had one complaint about Darwinia, it's that it's just too darn short.  You can reasonably finish the game in a weekend, but it only leaves you hungry for more.  Guess I'll need to check out Multiwinia next...			"

												Darwinia is really great. Perhaps not the best ""game"" or RTS out there, but there are some really unique aspects to it, if you can get past the frustrating and confusing first missions.This is very clearly an indie game, but it's one of a kind we don't see too often, nowadays. Everyone can make some kind of game, so our focus has shifted and broadened from what it was back then, when mainly programmers and computer scientists could make a game on their own. And this game shows that perspective a lot. This game is you trying to clean up an accident that happened with sentient AIs that downloaded a Spam e-mail's virus. And the way that the story is presented is clearly from a more technical point of view which is not all that common, nowadays. I'd think of Darwinia more as a Sandbox than as a game. Honestly, the campaign wasn't all that good. The game hasn't aged well (suprisingly, the graphics still looks fairy modern). It doesn't explain its mechanics well at all, and I was stuck on the first two levels for completely different reasons. For example, the missions don't end. You'll get a message that your objectives are complete, and then you manually leave the level. It's... strange. And if you miss the message, good luck finding what's wrong!Also, a lot of the missions boil down to ""wars of attrition"", while you figure out a decent strategy.I thought of dropping the game after the first couple of level.By the end, however, it gets really good. Once you get past the micro managing a squad with a very awkward path-finding, you get to spawning dozens and dozens of Darwinians, and exploding dozens of the enemies at once. Then it gets really cool!It's mostly a Conquest game, where you try to spawn as many Darwinians and move them to a ConqueredPoint to spawn even more of them, and eventually conquer the whole map. But something about the way its done is really charming, and it's just fun to see the AI do their thing.I didn't enjoy the campaign, for the most part. But certainly something to try out!			"

You are dropped into an AI simulation that's being overrun by a virus, and help the *adorable* little green guys fight back, until by the end of the game your role is just giving them a vague direction to go and they do the rest. And then you learn where the virus came from. And why they'll gather around green and red souls alike to help them ascend into heaven.I'm moved to tears every time. This is simply the best game story I've ever been a part of.			"

												Darwinia has a lot of neat things about it: - RTS elements: resource gathering, unit making, protecting bases, annihilating opponents - A quirky, smart and somewhat obnoxious at times map navigation and targeting system - A simple and interesting, if a bit short, plot;It's a rather fun game that has but one major fault: it's a bit short. Unless you're aiming at getting all the research items and killing every virus, you'll probably beat it in a maximum of 7-8 hours.The one thing I would've loved in this otherwise fine game is co-op multiplayer. While Multiwinia provides a bit of that, it ends up being a very different game.			"

												This game is a blast!  A unique RTS that allows you to both solve the various ""problems"" the game throws at you in your own unique way while also providing you with the ability to control your focus to battle a virus that has corrupted the world of Darwinia by allowing you to control what ""upgrades"" are worked on first.  For example, you get ""engineers"" that resemble the icon next to my review (A.K.A a recgonizer from the Tron franchise) that collects souls.  One upgrade allows these engineers to be able to collect more than the initial ten souls.This game is by far worth every penny and highly recommended!			"

												If you do not have this game, and it isn't on sale right now; Put it on your wishlist. This game is a gem from a glorious age now past. The gameplay is solid, if slighty difficult; The story is very thrown together until- Well... To be entirely Honest, my jaw Hit my table when i first played the game and i had to fight back tears as i finished the game... Might not effect you in the same way, but for a game that honestly doesn't look like much, this is easily a B+ game. Introversion created Gold with this one.			"

												Great game. I'm not really sure you could ever lose though. Every level is just a war of attrition.			"
