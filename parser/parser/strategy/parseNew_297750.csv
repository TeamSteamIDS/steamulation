												I promise anyone who looks beyond the seemingly dated graphics will find an unrivalled strategy game.Each and every soldier on the battlefield has a limited supply of ammo, and each situation your men face during battle will affect their stamina, morale and emotion...Stick with it and you will love it.Even better against human opponents!The only con is the price. Don't expect any major price reductions as Matrix Games titles have always been a bit steep in my opinion.			"

												i have not played a CC game since a bridge too far(1997) which was one of my all time favorite games. i was happy, suprised and a little disapointed to see that not much has changed in that time. game play is good but not much different from 7 years ago, altho the campaign mode is a little more refined than the last CC game i played in 1997. if you have liked the game series in the past you will like this one also. the graphics are a little better than 7 years ago, but no where close to the level they should be. if this game was $20 i would give it 9/10, but at $40 i will give it 5/10. way to expensive a game that is in essence a slight improvement from 7 years ago. if you are a die hard fan of the series i am sure you will like it, or if you are new to the series it might be worth the money. i can not recomend it for the current price.

												Its a very good game, that hasnt changed at all, so when you like the older cc's you will like this one. I love remakes of old games and i like the 2d style a lot. But 40€ for a remake that bassicly just updates the explosions and minor other things is a bit too much. I cant understand why they are so greedy at this part i would easily recommend this at 20€ also a lot of more people would give it a try i think. But 40€ looks like a cash grab to me, i would'nt have bought it myself if i would'nt have found it for 20€ on ebay.So veterans of the previous games will buy this anyway, cause its the game you love.But for newcomers i can only recommend to wait until its cheaper.

												I like this game Its so much more realistic then most strategy games based around the same time period. However a few things really irritate me. One is the price! its utterly ridiculous and greedy by the developers they haven’t added nearly enough in the way of improvements or balancing to the game to warrant that price tag. This isn’t a HD remake or anything to that regard its just the same game engine  with the same ai and a few tweaks.  The Second is the games lack of support after launch. Where’s the patches? Literally where’s any attempt to improve the game or fix some of hit detection issues or ai bugs. The game has a terrible UI it really does , its so awkward you have to learn a fair few hotkeys to get anything done. I want to like this game more I really do its something so different and simulation esc but at the same time I cant stand the lack of support after release instead relying on fans to make the patches? Its scandalous. I feel sorry for diehard fans because from what ive read there’s better games in the Close Combat series its just this one is on steam  so of course people will buy it. I mean I did the same with Age of Empires two … the fool			"

												A more up-to-date version of the CC classics.I will edit this review later, but first off I want to say something immediately.I see people claiming to be CC ""fans"", give it thumbs down, and post stuff like ""you can't pause the game"".Guess what, you can.. just hit the ""pause"" key on your keyboard. Now, that wasn't so hard, was it? And if you truly had played any of the predecessors, you'd realize that this version works just in the exact same way.By the way, you can press spacebar to activate range info (I have command influence range as standard). There's a comprehensive list of keybindings in the manual.Now, off to the game. CC is a top down, real-time action WWII strategy game, with roots as far back as 1996. CC is legendary for those beknownst to it. It continues the style of a few other games in the series with a grand-campaign-style strategic map. This strategic map will progress on a turn basis, with battles occuring after a movement phase. Battles will take place one by one, where two battlegroups clash on the grand map. Available at some points on the strategic map are also air support and artillery (to inderdict). When you battle, you will get loaded onto the proper map for the region you're in on the Strategic map, and the real-time action starts. The battles are realistic and intricate, with morale, cover, angle of attack, suppression, ammunition and range all being important factors to the outcome.Of course, you can scale the difficulty yourself, do skirmishes instead of a grand campaign, and set up your own battles, or even campaign if I recall correctly. Last time I checked there was also a functional multiplayer. And I guess this would be really fun to play with (against) friends.As for the price, I had to get it, not nescessarily because it's fairly priced (although I don't find it that steep) but because I want to support the making of anything CC, since the series are one of the few classics that stand out with great quality, which in my opinion should get all the support it could get. We have enough throwaway games today published by companies that care for nothing but money, with employees that have no passion for it whatsoever.			"

												I am sorry to all the Close Combat fans like myself that have devoted COUNTLESS hours to this series. This game is a disappointment to the franchise/company of Close Combat. To Pay $40 is outrageous for a game that is subpar in almost every dynamic since Close Combat I. Even then Close Combat I has some advantages to this game. I am severly disappointed about #1 The Opening Graphics (I feel like I am going back to 1991 when I first CHOOSE my mission). #2 The movement of troops and tanks are ABSOLUTELY horrible. #3 You are no longer able to change specific Units like you were able to in the past 2 Close Combats (granted this gives it more historical basis but when you are the Nazi's it is almost a sure loss.) There are more errors in this game than what I have reported, but this is what I have seen in the reviews that not many people/nobody has brought up. Like I said I have been a die hard Close Combat fan and I have love the way it has progressed up to this point. This game is a failure and insult to the Close Combat Series.			"

												Close Combat is a series you either just get, or you don't.  Gateway to Caen is the last of the traditional 2D CC games, for better or worse.Pros-Beautifully drawn mapsVaried, interesting, accurate forces (Though, not as much as say the earlier game, Last Stand Arnhem)Realistic paceSimple UI, improved over previous CC titlesDetailed moraleScalable difficultyHedgerows :)The new 32bit effects are really, really nice for sprites!Cons-Pathfinding still a little weak, much improved though.Armor doesn't automatically turn to face threatsOut of game menus aren't full resolution, campaign map is a little wonky to navigate. (4:3, switches to your full resolution in the tactical game)Maps a little too big, Earlier games had somewhat quicker, more vicious fights.Hedgerows. :(Misc.-Since Panthers in the Fog the series has used a Platoon, rather than team based battlegroup selection, this is more realistic, but I really preferred putting together my own battlegroup in earlier titles.I have some issues getting mods to run, I think this may be a steam thing, the custom shortcut always dumps me out at the loader, rather than in game. Very annoying.Would like to see this thing go on discount. Also, previous titles on Steam would be nice!All in all, if you enjoy RTS, want a really historically accurate one, and don't get all huffy any time you see drawn sprites, you'll enjoy GtC.Also, your Sherman is already on fire, even though you haven't bought the game. Just FYI.			"

												I would hate for anyone new to pass this game series up just because of the mixed reviews.  I started playing with the original game by Atomic back in the '90s and worked my way up to CCIII which just completely blew my mind.   I then dropped out for about a decade and came back to the fold recently with this title and the remastered Cross of Iron.  These are amazing tactical games.  They offer a unique play experience that you can't find any place else.  If you are into World War 2 as a historical subject and are interested in small unit tactics and tactical combat, you will enjoy these games on some level.  My recommendation does come with a couple qualifications.  First, for series veterans, the newer games really do not do a lot different or new.  Playing these later day Close Combat games feels more like playing a heavily modded original, or remastered expansion pack.  The formula is the same, the limitations are the same, it's all just a little bit smoother and prettier.   If you already have and enjoy other titles in the series and aren't especially interested in this conflict, it may not offer enough new content for you.Now, for the new players, I would say that these games are awesome and you may well enjoy them, but they are dated in a number of ways and they're by no means perfect simulations either.  If you're a casual gamer or someone looking for a more 'traditional' RTS experience or coming from sometihng like CoH, you may be frustrated with some of the game mechanics and the dated UI and graphics. That said, if you're someone with a serious interest in history or small unit tactics, this game might just hit what you're looking for.   If you enjoy other games like the Steel Panthers series or Combat Mission, there's probably something you'll enjoy here.  I certainly do not regret the purchase.			"

												This was really a low effort attempt to revive this game. The original game is great, but somehow the newer version manages to make you feel as though you have less options at your disposal. The ui is phoned in and lackluster, the campaign menus are clumsy and lack any kind of necessary explanation (the campaign map is not even referenced after a victory save for the zoomed out view of the last map placed somewhere near where is goes in the lattice). I'm not sure how you can pay 40 bucks for this game and not feel ripped off, even if you loved the original series. Hopefully there are some add-ons for this thing or it will get very little use.

												Some history:-As time went on and sequels were released for the original Close Combat so to did the maps get ever bigger. Around the time of Close Combat 4 the map size reached a point where the AI began to act odd. This was because the AI was never really adapted for the now giant high resolution maps. The result was they began to cluster in one corner, essentially covering an area that was once the size of an entire map but is now just a small part of one large map. This was not fixed in 5. It was not fixed in remake of CC 3 or the remake of CC 2. It is not fixed in this one. A great game in multiplayer where the AI is not an issue but basically broken for singleplayer.			"

												What a shame!Such a step back from Close Combat Russian Front, Battle of the Bulge and Invasion Normandy (and even Cross of Iron and The Longest Day)The new graphics makes your soldiers small and hard to track and unreasonable map sizes make terrain evaluation extremely tedious.Pratically no freedom to modify your platoons (just like Last Stand Arnhem)NATO symbols for squads are real turn offs.If you compare this to free outstanding mods crafted by the community over the years for previous CC (Stalingrad mod, kharkov mod, Scheldt mod) it's borderline criminal to sell this for 40$The only thing positive here : the explosions are beautiful ...lol			"

												I did not like this game.  While I am a fan of close combat 2 and 3 I feel that the series has peaked.  Problems with this title are mainly the large number of units (compnay sized elements) and the very, very, small resoultion of the screen.  As there is no pause to this game I find it overly diffcult to give orders to all my units in a timely manner.  Bouncing the camera from the front to the 6(!) mortar teams and then dragging the camera back to the target is not fun. This game engine is almost same as it was in the 90s and is best suited for platoon plus sized battles.			"

												RUS end ENG review for old cool game.RUS/ Свершилось. То, что должно было произойти давным давно, произошло сейчас, лучше поздно, чем никогда, легендарная стратегия в Steam. Когда не было еще Company of Heroes  и не было Man of War  со штурмами, был Close Combat. В игре есть одна большая стратегическая карта, разбитая на сектора в которых и идут основные боевые действия. Я помню как удерживал маленькую французкую деревню от немцев, которые предпринимали штурм за штурмом, что бы выбить моих солдат. Линия фронта уже давно была в тылу, и солдаты были отрезаны от основных сил и подкреления. Деревня превратилась в руины, округа была усеяна сгоревшей вражеской техникой, а мои ребята все еще окапывались и держали оборону и отражали штурмовавших гитлеровцев. Часть сил вражеской пехоты пыталась пройти через кустарник с запада, но была остановленна пулеметным расчетом, Базукой выбили еще одну Пуму, из которой экипах высыпал, как грибы, и разбежался в разные стороны. Затем опять поперла пехота, которой потребовалось всего 15 минут для отступления. Еще не остывшие тела лежали на снегу, словно рождественские подарки под елкой. Снова пошел снег.Нас начала утюжить артилеррия. Close Combat - одна из лучших серий тактической стратегии, выходящей аж с 1994 года.ENG/Happened. What was supposed to happen a long time ago, happened now, better late than never, the legendary strategy on Steam. When there was Company of Heroes, and was not a Man of War with the assaults, was Close Combat.The game has one big strategic map, broken down into sectors in which most of the fighting. I remember holding a small French village from the Germans who were taken assaults that would knock my soldiers. The front line was long in the rear, and the soldiers were cut off from the main forces and podkreslenia. The village was in ruins, the district was dotted with burned-out enemy equipment and my guys were still digging in and kept the defense and reflected stormed the Nazis. Part of the forces of the enemy infantry tried to go through the Bush from the West, but was ostanovleno calculating machine gun, Bazooka knocked another Puma, which began poured out like mushrooms, and fled in different directions. Then again poper infantry, which took only 15 minutes for a retreat. Not yet cooled body lay on the snow, as if the Christmas gifts under the tree. Snow was again falling.We start to iron artilerry.Close Combat is one of the best series of tactical strategies that go back to 1994.			"

												Close Combat: Gateway to Caen is an excellent Close Combat game that details Operation Epsom, a British plan to flank German positions at Caen to basically create a short cut into the city, whilst at the same time taking down German defenders at the Odon river. Historically, it was a costly battle for both Axis and Allies, and technically the Allies won, as German defenders committed all of their armour to close the gap, essentially wasting their fuel and vehicles on re-establishing their positions on the river Odon after the initial British attack. The British, as said, paid a high price, as they were up against veteran armour 'fresh' from the eastern front, that chewed up British armour like nothing else. The battle could have gone either way, and so the 'what if' factor is perfect for a game where you can play both sides.Gateway to Caen takes some getting used to if you are a veteran of the CC series. Unit scale is back to somewhat smaller, and unit choices per battle when playing the grand campaign are somewhat more limited. This is by no means a bad thing as you are finally forced to truely consider what you field when. When playing the campaign, as troops grow tired you HAVE to rotate them out every so many battles, or they eventually panic/surrender, no matter what their quality.Units included in the game are, amongst others, 2nd & 12th SS Panzer ('Das Reich'& the infamous 'Hitlerjugend' fanatics), The Royal Scots Fusiliers, the 46th Highland infantry brigade, 9th RTR and 43rd Wessex Infantry division. The main campaign is pretty well balanced: Generally speaking the British forces outnumber the Germans with what they can field at any given time, but the Germans often outgun the British with their heavy armour and 88mm Flak batteries. German troops do consist mainly of 'ad hoc' defenders initially, making for a pretty steep start when playing Germans, despite the prepared positions and the big guns.On my YouTube channel, I dedicated a series to this game, playing the main campaign as the Germans, check it out here:

												The game is a remake failure. Not worth the  $20 on a steam sale.  Though reviews say it is better or somehow different than Panther's in the Fog, it has the exact same flaws as Panther's in the Fog.I'm a huge fan of the close combat series.  I'm not sure what this game is.  It looks like CC, but does not act like or play like it anymore.  I was very disapointed it is just not fun.  It is severely dorked in AI in the single player version and campaign play to the point of ridiculous.  Unit selection, supply, you name it...they pretty well broke it from the orginal series.  Many times, the AI is supposed to be attacking, but just sits there....forever.  Pathing and tank disabling with hedges is to the point of ridiculous and absurd.  What was not broken in the original CC series they somehow systematically found a way to break?   How? why? who knows, but the remake is plagued with bad game design choices/paths.  Like Panther's in the Fog, it was a complete disapointment for me to the point I'm wary of any future purchases from this developer. Skip these remake titles from this developer and just buy the old windows 95/98 versions.Before someone says..ya but..ya no!...lol.  The multiplayer is not that special and yes..the old CC had multiplayer. (rolls eyes)  The only improvement is updated graphics and network abilities for new operating systems out there...but who cares if ya broke the game mechanics and playability?

												Last chapter in a 15yr journey. One which has inspired a great degree of loyalty and an inordinate amount of frustration in the slightly masochistic fan base. Despite various moves between publishers not much has changed. Incremental improvements in cosmetics have only served to cover the significant failings of the game. Issues which were complained of long and hard by the fan base a decade ago continue to collect under the increasing undulations of the Slitherine rug: Path finding resides in the domain of a game of blind mans bluff. Units fumble around unable to distinguish between a straight line and a circle. Frequently regarding enemy LOS (Line of Sight) much as a moth regards a light source;The AI displays a form of paralysis, possibly catatonia. Slightly more advantageous to defence than attack. Awaiting an advance from the AI can resemble watching paint dry (Don't switch the scenario timer off). When it does chose to move, it’s invariably a drip feed;LOS could be redefined as LOP(Line of Possibility). Set up a units field of fire at the start only to discover a tank in midrange has become a form of terrestrial submarine;Campaigns can become highly repetitive. Grinding over the same maps repeatedly. An exercise in patience and/or frustration;Pricing. A world unto themselves. Cited by customers and reviewers consistently as overpriced for the age of the game, game engine and the lack of development. Slitherine persist with the tried and tested fingers in ears....’la,la,la...’.How is this a positive review? Short of hitting the invisible ‘middle button’, it’s a pretty good multiplayer experience. Even single player has it’s moments and manages to show glimpses of what the game could have been if it had been given the same investment Slitherine demand of it’s audience.If you have a history of war gaming you’ll no doubt suffer through the shortcomings and gain a modicum of enjoyment. More so if you can engage the multiplayer. If you are a casual visitor to war gaming don’t damage a possible future in the area by choosing this as your initiation.Whatever your interest....wait for a sale. Slitherine have their own around Christmas, and Steam offers their titles at a reasonable price about every six months.Lastly, there is a new Close Combat title soon to be released. ‘Close Combat: The Bloody First’. A new game engine and an opportunity for Slitherine/Matrix to redress the issues which have accompanied the series. If you are new to the series...I’d wait.And, probably pay the ransom ;)GM			"

												As a long time fan of the close combat series i wish i could recommend this game but i just can't with the main reason being the broken a.i. it literally just sits there and does nothing whether on attack or defense it doesn't matter it just sits there. Its a real shame because the graphics of this game are definately a step in the right direction with the artillery explosions and airstrikes looking amazing. I mean the a.i has never been particularly good in any of the close combat games but on the larger maps in this game it leaves battles feeling sterile. You can literally spend half an hour crawling your troops around the map; moving cautiously to try and keep your men alive, only to find the enemy has spent the entire time sitting in the same corner in which they deployed. In comparison to the first close combat game i brought which was invasion normandy way back in 2000 or something the a.i would just charge your positions; also very dumb, but at least something would actually happen and on occasion the enemy would actually suceed in overrunning your defences forcing you to hastily react. Its a real shame because with a little passion and some creativity the close combat series could be an amazing game and its simple control scheme would appeal to many people but unfortunately the developers have just tried to milk the series without making any real changes. I mean it was common knowledge within the community that the a.i was crap so how did the developers not know? and why didnt they do something to change it? If you really want to see an example of what im talking about with regards to the broken ai then just watch this video: Video If you want to play something more exciting i suggest watching paint dry simulator 2 the multiplayer mode in particular is fantastic :)			"

												As a fan of tactical level squad/commander games (Jagged Alliance, XCOM, Wargame) I purchased this title on a whim, but was very happy to see that it offered what I expected - and more. At first look, the game might appear to be quite simple, but as with any strategy game, the complexity is in lieu of your opponent. Although the A.I. is 'ok' the real gem of this title is it's multiplayer. There is room to improve multiplayer matchmaking as I only found one game all evening; however, I expect I will be playing more with friends than with random people online so I cannot really complain. The visuals are quite nice for a 2D game and sound effects are fitting. All in all, this game is perfect for a hardcore realism fan!			"

												Like many players of my generation, i have played the hell out of Close Combat, Close Combat: A Bridge Too Far and especially Close Combat III: The Russian Front. After being away from the series for many years and losing a bout with nostalgia, i have decided to give it a second go. I must say that it feels like i have never left...Indeed, Gateway to Caen simply takes the old CC games (admittedly mostly the good parts) and adds a touch of polish and a new setting. The explosion, smoke and sound effects are much improved and the campaign/strategic map is nicelly done. I also like the new, more realistic mortar and fire support systems. I know that other factors have been revamped (weather, moral, weapons) but i think those changes are hard to see and the troops pretty much behave like they did back in the day.I have also seen many complaints about the price of the game being too steep for a fairly simple ''reboot''.  I must say that in this day and age it does feel a little bit pricey but that in the end, you will probably end up spending hundreds of hours on this game, which makes it pretty cheap by the hour.Recruits: Enjoy this vintage game. Reading the manual is a must!Veterans: Indulge in nostalgia. In this case, it's a good thing.Experts: You know what you're in for.			"

												I wish to show this little game that is a few expensive, even with the -13%. It's the last version of the Close Combat Series, and i think the first one on Steam. It's about World War 2, and if you pass through the 2D low graphics, it's a very, if not the best, realistic simulation of battles. When they are shot, men don't run: they hide and they get fear, when they are hit, they are wounded or directly killed. With the right click on an unit you can give several orders like fire, launch smoke, run, walk, sneak, defend and ambush, with very different effects on your men or on ennemies, also you have infantry, leaders, tanks, guns, machineguns, mortars, anti-tank support, flame-throwers as units and airplanes/mortars/guns as support. And there is a lot less, if not at all, ""mouse skill"" like still in total war, where fast clicking can help a lot. Here all is in position and orders (with still a random factor).			"

												Another CC game. Same game engine, same UI, just different maps and some mixing up with the troop selection. If you had fun playing other CC games then this fits the bill. Lack of a good multiplayer match up limits you to single player which the CPU isn't particularily challenging. The difficultly is simply the CPU getting more resources that you. Nothing tactical or strategic about the CPU play style. No tactical retreat makes battles an all out brawl instead manuevering and fighting to put battles on prepared battlefields.			"

												I'am a big fan of this series since 1998 and since then this game changed little but in its simplicity this is one of the best RTS out there in representing the true tactics of WWII.This is also the RTS that brought me in RTS genre and one of the first bringing this depth on PC gaming so it's not just a normal RTS but a piece of history that all RTS players should have played at least once.

												If you're a fan of the classic Close Combat series, you'll probably be satisfied by the refined gameplay and updated graphics. The campaign mode is improved from the original, as it adds in a turn-based strategy layer to define how the real-time tactical game plays. The multiplayer matchmaking is not very effective, and I think it relies upon a forum to find opponents. Overall, I think the $40 price is too much for the scope of the game. There are plenty of campaigns, operations, missions, and you can create your own, to create several hours worth of gameplay. However it's limited in terms of scope, as you will always be fighting in the hedgerows and towns near Caen with British and German units. Watch for it on sale - definitely worth it around $20. I hope the publisher adds more of the recent Close Combat remakes on Steam and bundles them for a fair price.Bonus points for bagpipes.			"

												What happened!?Firstly, I'd like to make it clear that I have been a huge fan of the Close Combat series since playing on it as a child in 1998.  Since then, I've played on many of the releases and found them to be fantastic.  This game, however, has been a massive disappointment.  The interface is no bigger than 1024x768 and the map screen is a massive step backwards compared to previous releases, it just feels like a cramped mess.The battles themselves are entertaining.  I mean, they’re still exactly the same as the old games, so yeah they are good!  However, the interface is really, really dated now.  Scrolling through the map is painful, especially if you're ina  hurry. Trying to select and give orders is infuriating.  The AI has not been improved at all (as far as I can tell).The worst thing? The price.  My god. I’m all for supporting games like this, but £30? It’s almost insulting.Sorry, but it’s a no-go from me :(Do yourself a favour and go purchase Close Combat:  Invasion Normandy or any of the other previous releases!			"

												Great new CC game.  I own every single one including the remakes and this one is quite good.  It has an easy to use and smooth multiplayer system as well which my friend and I have been playing with lately that is similar to the one used in panthers in the fog.  If you are a CC fan this is a must by.  The updated engine is sharper and nicer, and the battles are bigger and more epic.  The only downside to this one is the vehicles (common problem in CC).  They move INCREDIBLY slow and just cant pathfind all that well still.  I have not played that long yet, but there is enough in this game to keep me coming back for more.			"

												Solid strategy. Not the most in-depth one, but I've always liked how fluid the gameplay is for the most part in Close Combat. The new effects and sounds are a welcome addition, really brings the battles alive and the sound of a MG42 opening up is as terrifying as ever. The AI in combat is OK. I find it really depends of the scenario and difficulty. I stalled the Allied advance almost instantly in the Grand Campaign playing as Germans, but after playing 5 turn of operation ""Digging in"" as Allies, the AI is putting up a good fight. I also see improvement in the driving AI, it's still not perfect and tanks often swirl around like idiots, but once I ordered a Tiger tank to drive down a road just barely big enough for it, it did follow it flawlessly.Some might say the graphics are dated, but I would disagree. This is a top-down strategy game. Graphics rarely matter in this genre, and I must say, it does look rather good compared to the older games in the series.The only gripes I really have are the new mortars introduced in PitF. Basically, when you order your mortar to shoot at a target, it takes 20-25 seconds to aim the first round, 5-6 seconds to aim the second and after that it starts to hit very accurately. This is devastating if you are not inside a multistory building. Also, the MG42 is a bit too accurate in my opinion. Most german infantry squads carry one and they fire 8 rounds per burst, making the extremely effective against the Allied infantry.But all in all, it's a very good game. Of all the CCs I've played (CC2 through PitF), I rank it among the best in the series.8½/10			"

												Wow, what a blast from the past! I used to play this game religiously when it was first released almost 20 years ago. Having it remastered and re-released for modern operating systems is, quite literally, a dream come true. I thought I'd never play a Close Combat game again. Despite the decades old, hand-drawn graphics -- which are a totally charming aspect anyway -- this is another Close Combat which sticks to the forumla and delivers an unmatched tactical experience. This game really brings home what it is to command a Company in combat. Every last detail of your soldiers is considered, their ammunition, fatigue, morale, suppression, accuracy, and courage or cowadice. You will revel in their success and you will cringe at their destruction. You alone are responsible for both. Notable improvements include revamped explosion graphics, the addition of waypoints to movement orders, and, finally, persistent tracking of individual soldiers between battles. Your men maintain their kills, awards, and performance. A word of warning, don't become attached to a particular Platoon, because there is nothing more gut-wrenching than watching a decorated, three battle veteran, finally succumb to his own bravery. My rating: 9/10. I cannot recommend this game enough. I am a biased reviewer, that's for sure, and if you're new to the series then perhaps you'd want to wait for the price to drop. However, if you're looking for a visceral, challenging, and realistic tactical strategy game, then you cannot go past Close Combat. There is literally nothing like this on the market.			"

												I've been a great fan of the close combat series all the way back to the second installment ""A bridge too far"". The third edition was by far the best. I played all the other sequels but I got bored quite easily and kept going back to the 2nd and 3rd installments. With Gateway to Caen, I'm happy to say that it is just as great fun as the forementioned games. Great balance and lots of good single player action. AI is quite good even though the opponents sometimes holes up forever despite having a superior force, which is a bit annoying. "

												I really enjoy Close Combat series since first I've played, back in 1996. I can't recommend the game for younger players or those who are into modern RTS. It's a completely different game from all the major RTS games, with a waaaaay slower pace. But every battle feels like an acomplishment, every match can be fascinating and every small detail is accurate. It's a history lesson. If the game happens to be on sale, get it. Be warned about the pace though. And the dated graphics, even though the artwork is actually pretty good and colorful, the game looks like something from 2000 or earlier. Soundtrack and SFX is just great. Same with the behavior of the soldiers and the AI.			"

												The graphics may be straight out of '95, but the slow-paced, platoon-sized and  fairly realistic combat is what I enjoy when it comes to strategy games.In combat, it comes down to controlling victory points across the map, at your disposal you will for the most part have two infantry platoons and one support-platoon. The latter one including vehicles, armor and static weapons. The combat itself comes down to suppressing the enemy troops as you attempt to outflank them and using your support-platoon to deal with entrenched infantry and enemy armor. Your units may refuse to follow your orders, act on their iniative and even surrender if the situation is dire. Each side has a certain morale depending on previous battles and current events on the battlefield, if this drops to zero or you lost all victory points, you will loose the battle.There's single battles, operations and campaigns in the singleplayer. In the latter two, you control serveral companies that you move in a turnbased-fashion around a larger map. Battles will most likely be fought on the same map serveral times during these, where you start off around  the victory points you control, a nice feature being that wrecks, craters and ruined buildings remain throughout the entire operation or campaign.The negative aspects are that it does a poor job at explaining some of it's mechanics and evidently the previously mentioned graphics from 1995. And considering how little has changed since the previous release of ""Panthers in the Fog"", it's not really worth the current asking price. But if it's on sale, I would strongly reccomend it.			"

												For fans of CC: A Bridge Too Far this is very similar in style and play but with a few major imporvements. The way you manage your reinforcements is greatly changed. You can rename units if you like and it's easier to select and deselect your choices within a more regimental structure.The user interface is modernized allowing you to ctrl-group units and choose which elements you would like on your HUD and where you want them on screen. The graphics and soundsa are upgraded as well.Combat resolution is different. Truce is still there but there is not rout button that I've found. The games last longer and the maps feel larger. Improvements all around.Finally, the campaign map has an entire system of movement and action selection (rest, reinforce, move, attack) that helps tie the campaign together and makes the game less rail-roady.

												Ever wondered what would happen if someone made a cheap lazy remake of the awesome Close Combat series? Well you get this.In a large number of ways the series has gone backwards fast, like the AI pathfinding is outright stupid and game wreaking.There are times in the game where you are both infantry and armour in the area however you will have to choose between the two for no real reason. This a part of a new system which does away with requisition points in favour of a cumbersome ‘pick a platoon’ model that fails time and time again while reducing fun, tactical flexibility and a lot of what made the original series great.One of the most disappointing games I have played for a long time.

												   So I had the game Close Combat A Bridge Too Far, I thought that game was awesome... of course that was like 15 years ago. I cannot find that game anywhere but I found this one which is the game they made after A Bridge Too Far. I think I paid $20.00 for this game... not worth it. Maybe free or for a few bucks, it is pretty much the same game as the one I played on MS DOS. Graphics haven't changed, gameplay is the exact same, the levels in this game are acctually less exciting than ABTF, and it is only England vs Germany. ABTF had American, English, and German armies.   There isn't much more to say about this game except... there are better options out there. Get something more modern like Company of Heros or for a cheaper option get Men of War. This game is way out dated and not even as good as the older Close Combat I played in elementary school. Plus way over priced too. Keep looking for a game, because this one isn't it.Rating 3/10-Outdated.-Over priced.-No advancements in graphics or gameplay from the previous Close Combat.-No tutorial, some of the campaign options are difficult to understand and or operate.

												I am big fan of the Close Combat series. I have bought and played all the games so far. I saddly cannot recommend this game since it is not working as intended.The new multiplayer lobby is rubbish. When playing multiplayer (as this game is inteded to, since ai always been extremely poor) the game crashed or freezes. I have tried many times and so far never been able to finish more than two battles before the game crashes or freezes. Sadly it also seems like developers have given up fixing the game as new patches are extremely rare. As it was for it's predessor Panthers in the fog. I never got it working in multiplayer.To bad for the new graphic is great, I like the changes they have made ingame. Like how mortars work. But the game is to flawed and should not had been put on the marked before issued fixed. Something you sadly see very often in the pc buisness at the moment.Also the game is way to expensive even if it was working since it is a remake of a 18 years old game.			"

I played the game maybe several minutes and thankfully steam refunded me the money..in short? if you are new to the series and a ww2 buff? it might be for you.if you are a veteran of CC? stay away..even if it's on sale..maybe like 5 bucks..last but not least? for the publisher to ask 40 dollars for this game that is a joke..please justify that cost to me with no improvements whatsoever thank you			"

												I really like these kind of WW2 games. :)MY ISSUES with the game...1. Very often you see the units getting stucked in each other. So the pathing could have been much better done.2. They could have improved the game so it's much more responsive. Just to move units takes an eternity... Like 10-15 minutes just to move a canon a few centimeters. Together with that and the unit easily gets stuck frustrates me a lot.3. No tutorial exist.4. Looks manual don't explain all things in game like for example how to deal with unintuitive battle group screen.5. 3D graphic would be great to have, instead of 2D where you see all ugly pixels (almost like in minecraft to exagerate a little or 10-15 year old games).6. A price tag as for a AAA game but which feels 10 years old, both regarding graphic and game play, is way to much. A price tag of $10-$15 max would be a better price. The price Valve and Slitherine takes feels like a scam to me.7. I need to have line of sight to shoot with most of my units. I can't even shoot through bushes. It's not very intuitive to use the mortal team for example. They seam to lack grenades as they never launch the grenades!? There is a mortal button I can press but it looks I can only use it once during a whole battle!!! Don't know if that button is for my mortal team!? If it is then I can only use that squad once in each battle more or less!? So why have a mortal team if so.8. The UI isn't very intuitive. When you for example want to zoom in to see units closer with mouse wheel you instead switch and start to look at other units!!! The line of sight thing is also something which frustrates me especially when you have canons which needs to move around to be able to shoot against tanks.SUGGESTIONS for next game:1. Much better graphic. You know 3D graphic from today.2. I hope next game will include more options regarding what you can do with units, like throwing grenades, using bazokas, use mortal team, etc... Right now it feels strategy light.3. An improved UI wouldn't hurt which is much more intuitive.4. Pathing and units which moves slightly faster could be improved. Units should move much faster if you choose ""fast move"". Units should almost run and not walk in slow motion.5. Better price tag.			"

												Ive played most of the CC franchise and I was real excited to see this coming out on Steam. The games visuals have been somewhat improved on with my favorite being explosions; from mortars to artillery!The price is a little heavy but as a CC long time fan this was a must buy and i havnt been disappointed with the game itself.Now my only criticism would be the multiplayer, there seems to be much room for improvment as finding a match with someone can be a ""little"" difficult at times but not impossible. Over all very satisifed looking forward to lots of hours of gameplay4/5			"

												Having played the first Close Combat series. My expections were set. This game is just quite boring. I honestly wanted to like it, but I really did not. HOWEVER, if you love low intensity skirmishes with your enemy often out of site range... perhaps you might like this... but I doubt it.			"

												I didn't know what to expect, but upon firing the game up, this is the classic Close Combat experience that I remember from over a decade ago.Imagine a more ""thinkier"" version of Company of Heroes.  If you want a slower paced, more strategic RTS experience, then this game is right up your alley.  On the battlefield, position, moral, ammo, physical conditioning, line of sight, and many other issues come into play as you decide where to place and move your soldiers.  Battles are slow, gripping affairs, as every single soldier is valuable and the fog of war is dense.  Indeed, it is very possible for matches to end in stalemates, as both sides decide that it is completely unsafe to advance into the open killing fields.On the campaign map, you have to decide where to move troops and where to place support options.  Having artillery ready on a map can mean the difference between victory and defeat, but if you deploy your options in the wrong sectors, you may find that your lines and resources will be stretched completely thin.It's very old fashioned, for sure, and it doesn't look great compared to Company of Heroes or any of the other modern RTSes.  But if you're willing to forgive that much, then you're in for a great war game experience.			"

												I have played the CC series since the 90's, especially CC5 and its wonderful mods, Gateway to Caen being the first of the re-releases I've bought and I shouldn't have.We all know the AI perfomance isn't stellar in CC but they somehow managed to make it even worse in this game, moreover they've managed to ""pussify"" the soldiers to the extent of them being unable to do a thing when under the slighest stress.Pass this one or wait for a sale if you want it.

												I recommend this game for fans of the CC series. For other players I recommend buying A bridge too far and test that first. Now, even for fans, here is my +/- list.General pros and cons.Pros:Good strategy game (slow paced, realistic).Typical top view RTS with overal good unit managment and control.Good sound and explosion (visual) effects. Pretty much the same gameplay as CC: Bridge too far (don't change what's not broken). Familiar to fans.Cons:Editor (feel limited and complex, no simple 'skirmish' setup (you need to read the manual and learn the editor setup and are bound to its rules.Campain(there are 6 or 7 campains (?) and some 20+ battles. As for campain-feeling (a -> b) goes i'm lost since none of them are locked and can be played whenever and in what order you fancy.) Campain and battle gameplay(There is this overview map that also pretty much requires you to read the manual to understand what it is about. Between campain maps you are turned back to this overview section but I have not managed to understand what battle that actually will start and if I can/ should do anything to my advantage on the overview section. Seem like a middle-type mini-game (like stratego), but rules? More reading in the manual...)TRUCE.In the game, truce can be 'clicked' to offer cease fire (i.e end map and continue campain but not exit). Your opponent (the 'A.I') will do so when morale, possibly among other factors, is to low. If you click it however...all my units were dead down to a sniper. I had since long pressed TRUCE. 10 min of looking at the screen (7 tanks not moving), waiting for what I think is a hidden timer. That does suck for the games that you open up with heavy losses early on - beacuse 10-15 min wait.Limited in-game help(Have a question? Don't understand what that icon means in the editor? Wondering if that canon is AT or AP in-game? Read the manual...)My rating(s)6/10 (for non-fans)7.5/10 (for fans - because Close Combat!)			"

												[TL;DR] NOTHING NEW HAS BEEN ADDED. IT IS LITERALLY THE SAME GAME AS FROM 2001, EXCEPT IT COMES WITH THE PRICE OF A BRAND NEW GAME ($40) WHICH, BEING RELEASED A YEAR AGO, IT IS NOT. IT IS STILL A GREAT GAME, JUST NOT AT THIS PRICE. WAIT FOR A MASSIVE SALE (LIKE 75-90% OFF).I bought this as part of a Humble Bundle, so my frustration is not completely about the price, but I will address it in a bit. My biggest concern is that, even as a fan of the original series, this company (Slitherine) is attempting to call this a new game... it's not.It had been mentioned in another review, but it is also quite apparent when playing, that it is the same engine, the same assets (although 32bit, which i think is a lie because it looks the same as the 15 year old CC:III), and the same artwork. It has been a while since I played CC:IV Invasion Normandy, but I recall that the maps in this game are taken from CC:IV. Normally I wouldnt have a problem with all that I mentioned above, afterall I looked at this game from the perspective of being an update/remake of a game that I loved. The problem is; they didn't do a damn thing to update it. NOTHING. The strategic map was taken from the older games. The RPG-ish elements of having command and soldiers throughout multiple battles/campaigns was taken from the older games. Absolutely nothing has been done to this game to separate it from the old games, which again, being a huge fan of the old games would normally be OK. Except for one huge thing...THE PRICE. Now being that I paid $10 for this in a humble bundle, I don't feel like I have been swindled. But I can sympathize with those that paid $40.00 for this game thinking that it was some new iteration of the CC series.This may be hyperbolic, but, Slytherine should be ashamed of themselves. I can only imagine how many people have been tricked into buying this game at the price of $40.00. $40.00!!!! Let that sink in. I will wrap this up by saying this... I paid $10 and sent almost all of the $10 to charity. I gave slitherine one cent. One cent is about how much effort was put into this game.That may sound really harsh, but again, I am a huge fan of this series and I am going to continue playing this game, but not without constantly feeling lucky that I didn't pay full price for it.

												It is a good game and much better than a lot of the more actiony RTS games that are out there at the moment. However the price, and it seems all from this studio, are very high. I honestly really like the game but I think it is worth 20 at most, I got it for 15 in the sale.Obviously the graphics are quite outdated but they are good enough that they don't impact on the game. The AI could be better, especially when attacking. The multiplayer seems good but havn't tried enough yet to say for sure.The style of the game is like a bit of a simpler and more outdated version of the Wargame series, It is sometimes clunky and slow to react but once you get used to it, it isn't so bad. The style of the game allows for much more realistic combat than in a game like Company of Heroes, which while fun, has little to do with the way WW2 was really fought.			"

												I like this game a lot. It suits my wargaming style and most importantly its historically accurate. Looking down on the battlefield gives you a great perspective of what is going on. The graphics are 1st class and the countryside of Normandy in the summer of 1944 looks spots on - mostly dry and dusty judging by the photos from the camapign. The British voice acting is good and the explosions very nicely done. If you're interested in the Normandy camapign, the n get this and ""Panthers in the Fog"" which covers the German counterattack at Mortain and gives you US forces too. A nice mix of the 3 main armies in the campaign are fun to wargame with. You'll need combined arms to succeed.			"

												I am really disappointed with this game.  It is a good idea but poorly executed.  I don't mind the 2D look but there needs to be more player aids to deal with it.  Often you cannot tell what unit has Line of Sight or what obstacles block LoS.  In addition, you are often engaged off the screen and scrolling around is tedious(esp. if you are being fired on by someone who is concealed and you have to play ""find the pixel"" to locate them).  You also cannot zoom in and out in order to deal with this problem. The second issue is the speed of the game.  It is slow even on ""fast."" Seriously, it takes a minute for infantry to ""move fast"" 30 meters(with no obstacles) in game.  While it is probably a feature, it seems like a work around for control/AI problems. The third issue is you cannot rebind the hot-keys.  While there isn't that many, they aren't that logical.  The alternative is to find the unit, right click it and find the command you want.  Fourth is the inability to customize squads.  This makes it extremely difficult to play axis because there is almost no way to defeat Churchill tanks in the 6-8 battles I played.  I have tried to ambush it in side but that didn't work either.  This inability to deal with heavy armor is compounded by the fact that you cannot retreat(or I haven't figured it out).  Lastly, there is no tutorials when there is clearly a button for them(it is greyed out).  It would of helped in order to deal with the controls.  Overall, this game feels half finished and the price(while on sale) was not worth it.			"

												I recently purchased this game as I am a long time fan of the close combat series.PROS: 1-Very realistic. In fact the most realistic war game I have found so far. Infantry have experience, can fear and surrender      if not supported by tanks or another flanking squad etc...  They can gain experience if they are kept alive from one battle to another... ALSO, if one team gets surrounded, they wont receive resources any more, and their ammo and fuel will deplete from one battle to another if you dont support them by sending another team to clear the road for them.2- The operation and campaign need a good strategy in order to win the operation/campaign, BOTH in the tactical map phase( where you can see all the maps) to move your teams from one map to another, AND in the map itself where the battle begins3- High level or replayability : You can play the game for like a thousand hour and not get bored, because you can play as both the Germans or the Allies,  It has many campaigns to choose from, many operations and many single battles. You can set the difficulty as well. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY is that you can create your own custom scenario and campaign!  Example Select the difficulty you want, the maps you want to capture/defend, location of resources, the squad you want etc...You can also play online if you need,CONS:1- The AI needs to be smarter, sometimes he rushes into you and capture victory locations, but some othertimes it just sits back defending without capturing enough victory location,  AI needs to be more aggressive.SO ALWAYS play as the attacker if you want a good challenge, because the AI is good on defense and counter attacking, but not so good on offense.You can play as the defenders, but then you need to select a weaker team than the AI opponent, because the AI is not smart enoughI strongly recommend buying this game :) "

If you are a fan of the CC series then you really will not be let down with this game, I do think that £30.00 was a tad too much hence why I waited untill it came on sale.

												I bought this game for my friend and myself.First we had to register an external account to enable multiplayer. - I dislike that a lot.Inside the lobby is not a single soul except us. No one else is playing this game.I host a game and cant connect to my opponent. - I have to configure the windows firewall.I restart the game and host again. This time it works but the game tells me that the connection will most likely be laggy because i need to establish a direct connection by manually opening port 1944 on my router. Why do you sell games on steam, imo the number 1 multiplayer platform, if you manage multiplayer with your own servers or have people go through the hassle of opening ports manually?We start a battle map and - no surprise it is the exact same game as it was in all the previous installments - no problem. We are long time afficionados of the CC franchise and can handle subpar graphics, interface, clunky map scrolling etc.We play for about an hour and the game crashes with the ""Connection lost"" error.And that was the point when nostalgia finally wore off.The only reason i wanted this on steam was because i hoped the multiplayer would be stable and i could avoid workarounds like router configuration and the use of Hamachi network.So i cant recommend this game. Not even to long time CC fans. Single player CC, as we all know, was and is boring. You only buy this game if you want to play with a human opponent and the most important issues (unstable connections) have not been fixed.When the game crashes you loose your progress and can start anew. It screws up the outcome of the battles and the long time campaign you have been playing.I cant play the game longer than 2 hours and request a refund, therefor I am gonna punch my ticket right here.Back in the days i would have worked for hours to get CC running more less stable on two computers. No more.			"

												Hi AllI have played Close Combat games many years ago and is nice to play it again. The graphics improved and game has the same feeling like the previous ones, which is very good. The game doesn't bring many new features, but this is not a bad thing, because Close Combat series was always good, so is no point to change much. For someone who never played it, the game can looks little bit simple, but a soon you start to play you can notice that it is an advance strategy game, not like Cannon Fodder :-) if you know it. If you don't like the price, wait for the sale and grab a discount. I definitely recommend this game for players who likes WWII real strategy games. Game is very easy to learn and offer many maps. You also don't need a high spec PC to run it. Definitely recommend this game.			"

												Normally I am a big fan of the close combat series.  However, this title is severely flawed to the point of being almost unplayable.  The arty system will effectively stop you cold in your tracks if you attack cautiously, however, you will be severely punished if you move quickly.  Thus, defender will win everytime!  Attacks simply are not viable as AI pathing is terrible.			"

												Cannot recommend for the sheer stupidity of armored units and the implementation of terrain.In case you did not know, a hedgerow or garden wall can be an impenetrable obstacle to a tank(not all hedgerows, not all walls, but some). They cannot, by any means, pass through such an obstacle. Also, said tanks will think it's a great idea to dance around a chokepoint, e.g. one created by another tank or a stationary gun. Since they are deadly afraid of touching a hedgerow, they will just rotate on the spot, looking for another way to go to their destination. So just sit near a chokepoint, ready to one-shot them from their vulnerable back.(Even weak allied tanks can easily take out Tigers at great distances this way(as long as they hit, which is not a given, but rear attack seems to pretty much equal instakill.).So yeah...I liked CC series back in the day. But Slitherine obviously does not do anything to improve the series. They polish up effects so things look prettier, but stupid pathfinding and tank AI were in since the beginning, and nothing seems to have changed.I got this as part of a humble bundle at 10$ tier, and I feel it's not worth even that. While generally I would like a modern version of the Classic CC games, this studio does not seem capable of delivering that.Edit: Oh, also, forgot to mention: I am writing this review since I accidently blocked my only way out from deployable area with a stationary gun. So, my tanks are trapped in a corner. Yay. Since its a tank division, tanks is all i brought(really, ersatz truppen or tiger tanks? no competition) . Did not realize i was ""hedged in"" before starting.Just watching the timer tick down and thought I'd spend the time useful, warning others.			"

												June 8th, 1944 I wish to report the action of 51st Highland Division at the vinicity of Caen. Sir I was awarded generous amount of mortar teams. I had about 4-5, do pardon my unsure of the exact numbers. The battle started off immediately and it was a near diaster for the British force. I had two section with HQ platoon moving into the northern end of the map as similar amount of men to the south attached to a single Cromwell tank. With the centre force of 3 section and 2 HQ platoon and 2-3 mortar squad and cromwell. The bosch immediately made an ambush at the distillerie on my bren section. They responded with high firepower and Rifle section flanked. We repelled the jerries at distillerie however as we moved in. We ran into an large Panzergrenadier company with several SKDZ vehicles and backed by Mortars. We suffered heavy mortar fire and I directed the centre to flank the PzGren as i resumed the south force to clear through the south unopposed.  Unfortunately with my utmost regret, 1st Platoon at distillerie were all killed over time as the centre lagged however we crushed the jerries. The south force completled the south moved up north under light rifle fire. The German centre was immediately attacked by all sides and i directed the mortars to the centre forcing the jerries to surrender.  Signed, - Colonel Cook  I rate this game 20/10.  The sounds and realism went over my expectation. Dont let the graphic fool you. This is the best WW2 stragety game you can get your hand on steam.			"

												I have been playing the close combat series for 14 years now, and this game is a worthy instalment to the series. Im so happy to see this series making a come back and hitting steam. Truly a milestone of a series that isn't all that well know. The best tactical strategy game on the market in my opinion. If you like this one, you can find the rest of the series on the Matrix games website.			"

												Huge maps, not enough units.  I remember the original CC and you could actually have enough units to defend across the entire map.  With this you get about 20x soldiers and a few vehicles, no where near the size of a real unit which would attack maps this big.  Save yourself some time and money.			"

												One of THE best war sim's ever. Just as good as I remember it from the 90's. Look past the graphics... This is not your call of doody, son. You will get pwnd. Easy to play, tough to master. A single little battle can be over in a flash or last an hour or longer. Especially if you obssess in the setup phase as I do. It also pays to be cautious in your orders, which is the smart way to play this one. The only negative I have for this game is the inability to give orders and/or scroll the battlefield when paused. Otherwise, this is a MUST BUY for any true wargamer.			"

												This is Old School Close Combat with a slight upgrade. If charging $40 dollars helps to support continued expansion and further development of this game, I am all for it and it is the reason why I put my money where my mouth is.Is it perfect? Nope, but, it does what it's supposed to, and remains faithful to the old school genre. If you want to play or expected an up dated version of this game, then go play Company of Heroes, because that's not what this is.I highly recommend this game for the folks who like to keep things simple and don't need to feel like they're playing a hyperventilated version that is better suited to people with A.D.D..

My only real pet peeve about this particular CC title is the lack of blood, otherwise its an easy ten out of ten.

												Another lazy addition to the series, I have been playing these games since the late nineties when CC3 came out and it seems like they still all have the exact same issues. Tanks are an especially big problem in this title, it's extremely frustrating when you finally get your tiger and it goes down in one shot from a sherman, or when you are launching a big panzer assault and single crocodile knocks out every single one of your tanks. Personally, this is my biggest gripe and why I refuse to play any more. I've read quite a bit about world war 2 and this just seems to fly in the face of all the tank combat stories I've read about.Infantry combat and the new explosion effects are excellent too, which makes this review all the more unfortunate.

Couldn't even zoom in to view the battle closer than like being in a blimp observing the battle which was what really bothered me about the game. I gave up after a couple hours. I cant believe i spent $40 for this,,, I was still craving a game like the close combat i foundly remembered playing when i was younger and found and bought company of heroes1 and 2 series (which i've spent over 500hours so far between the 2 ). Wow what a diffence in game play, graphics, sound and how you can zoom in and out and spin around to view the battle. Can i get a refund?			"

												Close Combat: Gateway to Cash GrabFrom the player perspective there doesnt seem to be much added to this game. It is the same engine as the Close Combats of past times, with the exception of the wonderful new explosion and smoke graphics - they look great, but thats where it all ends for graphics - vehicles and human models still move awkwardly and have extremely poor animations.Gameplay wise, the AI is still horrible and cannot mount any sort of offensive movement or use terrain with any advantage. They seem to be simply programmed to move to victory points. See the following videos for an example:

												Played Close Combat when it first came out and true not much has changed.  That being said really enjoy these games and highly recommend to strategy fans, especially those with interest in the period.  Havent played series in over a decade and could not remember having a campaign/operation aspect to the old ones....basically an overview map where you have a movement phase and then must fight the battles on the battle map.  Is annoying that mechanized units move with no sound but overall sound of battle is good.  Love to see the enemies tanks brew up...very satisfying, however just as big a downer when you watch 4 of your Cromwells get pasted by a Tiger that you cant get around in time.  Hard to stop playing once you get into it as you want to try one more battle.			"

												Close Combat was always one of my all-time favourites when it comes to tactics and strategy - much more approachable than Combat Mission, realistic and nice looking (yes, even today the simplicity of 2D graphics makes this game allright in the visual department).This means that as a fan I get every iteration of the series, including Gateway to Caen. It's a fun little addition to the Close Combat family and for those who love this game it's more of the old, good classic gameplay with a few new fancy things (the explosions are neat). It's also a good part to introduce the newcomers, as the campaign map is pretty straightforward and the battles are on large, mostly open maps which give you a lot of leeway and let you play more with the armored troops.The only con? The price of course - I don't doubt that Matrix games put at least a little effort in making Gateway to Caen, but there is nothing that justifies the expense. Wait for the discount.			"

												One of the best real time strategy games that gives realistic company sized WW2 battles, modeling supplies, psycology and PTSD, this game series has been a solid entry since 1996.  If you like game that rewards patience and strategy over reflex and brashness, if you like a game that lets you impliment in real time a course of action only for it to fail because your soldiers cower under the realities of battle conditions or heroicly stand to the last man and snatch victory from defeat because of courage and comradery, then this game is for you.I never met anyone who did not love this game once they learned to understand its intricacies. Every bullet counts. Not just because you can run out of bullets but also because, desperate, a courageous AI will pick up weapons and ammo from the battlefield dead while a coward will break and run with your best vehicle and ammo right before you need him most.The interface is clumsy for the modern era and their will be a learning curve as this game looks like it belongs in Windows 95 not 10. The graphics are not optimum for the modern era but functional. Vehicle drivers are terrible and so you will need to micromanage the drivers to keep them on the path. this may be the weakest part of the entire series.Still, if you can get past that then you will find the best Company sized military strategy game available, far exceeding the modern AAA such as company of hero's. it doesnt have there AAA looks, but its much more realistic psycology model and battlefield tactics makes this an infnatry commanders dream training tool.

												I'd like to begin saying that I'm biased towards this series, seeing how I've played every installment since the first. To me this is the optimal WW2-tactical game. What got me to like this series was how it got you close to the action and provided you with an efficient interface to command your combating soldiers. To me every battle I've played has been a mini *insert-your-favorite-war-flick-here*. Before long the battlefield is scarred by explosions and fire, the dead and dying are piling at the victory points and you are sitting by the keyboard ruing for Fritz or Cambell who's lying in ambush trying to capture that Sherman/Tiger-tank off-guard.The strategy portion of the game is as it's been since it's inception and as always to me a distraction, I find the heart to be in the battles. Each battle can range from 30-60 minutes so set aside some time if you choose to play the campaign. The system is impeccable, with only minor changes here and there from the previous games, and as always a wonderful historical accuracy. The battles and missions who are just based on history are noted as such.The interface is the only main concern I have. But this may be because I'm so used to the bottom-centered interface after years of playing that I'm unable to get to grips with the changes. I haven't played so much yet so maybe after a couple of more hours I'll get a hold of the new setup.Every battle is a story and if you have the time to dedicate you'll not be sorry. This is if you have a little interest for military history and good strategy games, but who doesn't? Now I just hope they'll start porting the classics too, I'd like to play The Russian Front and Invasion Normandy again, this time with support for multiplayer via Steam. Get to it!			"

												Bad: Tank movement is still borked. Micromanagement is (still) required to prevent tanks moving in utterly stupid ways. Most galling is the little jig they can do, before crossing a small hedge, only to be tracked (movement disabled) which wouldn't have been as likely to happen if they hadn't spent so long dancing on top of that hedge. They seem to like turning 330 degrees one way, when 30 degrees the other way would be quicker; and turning to face their rear, weaker, armour towards the enemy as the result of a small tweak to position. This stuff should be fixed by now.The strategic map is clear as mud to me. I'm off to read the manual again. Fog of war should apply during battle, not operating game mechanics. There are new features (units moving past each other, resting, merging, ...) which seem great, but they've not been implemented clearly. I'll keep at it though, because the game is ...Good: Good old Close Combat (sort of computerised Avalon Hill Squad Leader) working at full resolution on an up-to-date PC. You either love these games or you don't. I wouldn't pay ""full price"" for this, due to the issues still not fixed, but am very happy to have paid ""above the average"" to get it in a Humble Bundle. I'd pay the same again (each) to get refreshed versions of all the old CC games I've already got.Don't buy this if you expect a fast-paced 3D experience such as from the Total War series.			"

												The last Close Combat game I played was the CC III Russian Front, this close combat has kept all the good qualities from the old one and added some more. Highly recomend any strategy gamer to pick this game up. It is without a doubt the most accurate warfare simulator of WW2 at the company scale. Can't wait for CC The Bloody First 3D to come out!!

												It's good, but it's a little buggy on my usually stable rig. Gameplay is similar to A Bridge Too Far, the last Close Combat game I played, and this is a good thing. Really, this is what I like about these games - the realistic battles that require some degree of actual skill to succeed at.The map editor feels awkward compared to the older style, but seems like it allows much better campaigns to be developed once you get the swing of things. Infact, there is a whole new campaign design to it, albiet one I don't personally find overly interesting.Favorite new stuff: New additions such as long distance mortar and artillery support are kinda neat. There are lots of little tweaks and stuff to the same units, and a bunch of new ones. Quite a few UI updates.Least favorite new stuff: As I say, I'm not a fan of the new campaign setup beyond the above mentioned parts. I might just not be great at it, but it's really too restrictive to feel like a proper grand strategy element. It feels like you need to replicate the actual events of the battles depicted to actually succeed in most of the campaigns, which is not great when you're a pretty casual WWII history buff like me.Also, they seem to have removed the ability to see LOS during deployment, something I remember being in A Bridge Too Far, and really a ♥♥♥♥-er of many otherwise good plans. Perhaps it's a realism thing, but I think a real MG team would notice if they were setting up facing directly into a a slight bump that would completely block their line of sight.Summing it up, I am a  mixed on it because I think A Bridge Too Far does just as good a job of the parts that I enjoy. Maybe even does it a little better, really. If you somehow have a working copy of A Bridge Too Far, you might want to check out some gameplay videos of the grand strategic mode to see if it's your thing before dropping $40 on it.Dunno if it's worth $40 if you have a working copy of Bridge Too Far, but it's the game you expect, for sure.

												I used to play the CC games back in the 90s and early 2000s without fault or fail. I found this game a little too familiar and not adding anything fresh to it is a no no. Surely there is loads of room to improve the game engine. Shame I couldnt get into it. I really hate the game map. Its very unintuitive and flat out undescriptive for what is going on.			"

												Gameplay is terrible.  I have loves the old Close Combat series for year sna had hoped the reboot would be a chance to love the games again.  But alas, it was not to be.  This game takes all the fun out of the series.Move your tank = it gets destroyed.  Move your infantry = they get mowed down by hidden sections of enemy infantry or that enemy tank hidden behind the sapling.  If you actually manage to spot an enemy, you can mortar them all day long but it won't make a difference.  After trying the first campaign mission about ten times, I'm done.			"

												Not recommended due to the extremely poor AI. The AI rarely moves it's troops which means there are no strategy or tactics to talk about. You sneak from building to building only to find out that the AI still havent moved from it's starting location, except for possibly a few of it's units. I tested the AI by simply placing all my troops in one area of the map, selecting them all, gave one single order to move fast (rushing) straight to the AI start location. My only other action was to start an artillery strike. It ended with me winning a massive victory. Extremely pointless.On the good side the sounds are great, as they have always been in this game. Especially the background sounds. But it's a shame that the heritage of this series havent been managed better.			"
