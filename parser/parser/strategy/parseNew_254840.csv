												Oh boy, I've been waiting long for this one to be released on Steam. It's been on steamdb for more than a year!Anyways, Ground Control II is an RTS game made by Massive Ent. (who made World in Conflict afterwards) and initially released in 2004. The key feature of the game is that you don't build bases here, you earn points by killing enemy troops and capturing control points and call in reinforcements to the landing zones you captured. The game doesn't have a lot of units and only two playable factions, but every unit has an alternative mode that can drastically change its capabilities (a standard NSA trooper can turn into a heavy rocket trooper that is very effective against vehicles, but can't move); two identical Viron (the second faction) units can meld together to form a unique third unit (that has an alternative mode as well). So the game offers a lot of freedom as to how you use your soldiers. The highlight of the game for me has always been the campaign. I would go as far as to say that it is at least on par with campaign of Startcraft II. It has cool cinematics, very neat sci-fi aesthetic and surpisingly good story. I am a casual RTS player, so this game is one of my favourites because of it. Not to mention that the game still looks gorgeous. I remember how astonished I was as a kid by sky reflection in the water. The music is very good and extremely fitting as well.One thing needs to be mentioned however, ONLINE MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD. You can still play locally though. As for this version of the game, it works fine on a modern system, but has no improvements over original release (not even Steam features like cards and achievements, which is a shame).That being said, for 5$ it's a steal. Buy it, have a blast with campaign (it's pretty long) and it would be well worth it already.			"

												This was the best childhood game of my life.Controls are easy to pick up and understand,Not too many unit choices though.Then again, I wouldn't want to have to remember the abilities of too many units.Storyline is good, with a little plot twist.Battle scenarios are not based on a scissors-paper-stone kind of fight.Eg. Infantry units are supposed to get beaten by tanks, but their secondary ability (once activated) allows then to even the odds abit.I did enjoy playing as a 12 year old and I still enjoy this game from time to time!Get it now before the sale ends! Definitely worth your money.			"

												Now, if you enjoyed Ground Control 1 and love RTS/Tactical games, you cannot miss this one.Graphics are amazingly better than the previous installments, storytelling is much more captivating, gameplay is challenging, fun and rewarding. It feels good when you beat a mission. It feels even better when you finish the game, and it makes you want a sequel. I'm still waiting for Ground Control 3. :P			"

												At the time of the game's release I wanted a true sequel to the original Ground Control that continued to break away from the generic RTS mold. I was ultimately disappointed. Despite being a relatively original take on the RTS genre, Ground Control II isn’t going to redefine the genre as the original did. But it’s a solid game with a few interesting tweaks and innovations, making it good enough for any gamer looking for a fast-paced, story-driven, real-time strategy title.

												Man Finaly is this on SteamGround Control series are my favourite no base RTS. You have a spawn point and cann buy any units, from ground troopers till air craft. I really liked this game. So let us rejoin in old good glory.Even if Ground Control 2 is pretty old, 2004 It still the most best looking game ever produced. By the way the Terran Empire Mod work here, just download from here the mod, put it in the game folder and startGC2 Reviron 3 - NSA v Terran or GC2 Reversal 3 - Terran v Viron and CampaignSo you can play the awesome third Mecha/Walker and Hovercraft faction, The Terran Empire.http://www.moddb.com/mods/gc2-reversal-mod/downloads/reversal-mod-3-repackThey do have Additional maps by the way there.http://www.moddb.com/mods/gc2-reversal-mod/addons/gc2-custom-map-pack "

												I don't need to play a second of the game on Steam, never mind the 5 minutes in order to post a review as I've owned on CD-Rom since it was new & it is a truly outstanding RTS. It made the C&C franchise look like the tired, worn out beast that it was & was a match for it's contemporary; Rome: Total War every step of the way on graphics, right down to looking in the eyes of individual troops.Throw in a simple resource system, truly beautiful environments & a really atmospheric story line that from minute 1 you're convinced is destined for tragedy & defeat for you & your people... In fact, I got really attached to the characters throughout, something a lot of story-based games struggle to do, never mind a strategy game!The game play stands up to close inspection as well; whether you're defensive or aggressive, infantryman or tank-man, there are units to suit all styles. You even get to control an alien species who can combine two of the same unit to create a totally new one. It's even reversible, so offers real tactical flexibility.The only downside is that you still can't play as the 'evil' faction in the multiplayer, despite the game offering just as much detail & info about the units as your own.Basically, it's a truly superb RTS & all fans of strategy games should own this fabulous addition to the genre.

												This series is great and still this particular game is one of my all-time favorites.The story is very enjoyable and flows.  Not a ton of continuation of the original game however which initially disappointed me until I played and completed the game.Over the years, I have played this game continuously.  The graphics, even today, are great and better than a lot of other RTS considering the age of this game.Units have a primary attack mode and a secondary.  Utilizing the secondary does come at a cost to the unit, though.  Infantry has rifles in primary mode and rockets in secondary.  In secondary though they lose mobility.  Every decision about a unit comes at a cost.  Be wise.This game isn’t about gathering resources but is about spending your command points wisely and deploying the necessary units to complete the mission.  You want be overwhelming your enemy with a superior number.  You will be overwhelming them with superior weapons and firepower if you deploy your units correctly.  I will recommend this to anyone who enjoys an RTS game.  Definitely get this it is worth a couple of bucks and if you’re like me and so many others you will be playing this 10+ years down the line.Still waiting for Ground Control 3.			"

												A good game on its own, this RTS is 'streamlined' compared to original Ground Control and is very loosely tied to its story. It's nearly a different universe.

												So many pleasant memories of this game...and a couple of unpleasant ones. Will this review be biased? Of course, but I will give you the good and the bad as objectively as possible.Ground Control 2 was the first game I ever bought with my own money, the first RTS I ever played. It was sitting forlornly at the bottom of a bargain bin, not even in those thick plastic CD cases (remember those?XD), but in a box made of flimsy cardboard.I was dismissive at first, but soon it captivated me with its beautiful graphics, dramatic soundtrack, and intruiging story. Unfortunately, I never really got into the multiplayer, since Massgate servers had been down for several years by the time I finally got it, but from other reviewers who had battled with and against each other, it was deemed a fun and challenging experience.Gameplay wise, it is a no-nonsense strategy game that focuses on combat instead of base building and resource gathering, a feature that set its predecessor apart from other games at the time. But a patient (or lazy) player could exploit the resource system if they know what they're doing and build themselves an unstoppable steamroller army, which actually runs contrary to how the game wants you to do more with less, and utilize what you have to its full potential.The easy to master 3D-camera allows you to immerse yourself in the thick of the action or view the battle from a loftly perspective, as well as letting you admire the intricate detail that is woven into every fibre of this game.The plot and characters intrigued me, and though some might consider them to be cliches or boring stereotypes, they found a special place in my heart. It was one of the very few RTS games out there that has some really decent emotional substance to it (Warcraft, Starcraft and maybe even C&C fall among these few, at least in my opinion) and the overall setting and atmosphere might even remind you of the utter bleakness present in the Gears of War series.I experienced a deep sense of hopelessness as I played through the storyline's campaigns, and began to realize the grim futility with which the game's protagists have to deal with every day, knowing full well that they are going to lose this fight. But still they fight on, giving their all just to keep their people alive for another day.And that ending...I won't spoil it for you, but it hit me right in the feels.In comparison with its predecessor, GC1, it improves in some areas, but drops the ball in others. If GC1 is the revolutionary progenitor of the franchise, then GC2 is an evolution of it. Not a perfect or massive evolution, but still impressive in its own right. But if you want the full and final culmination of the series, an apotheosis of its greatest strengths, then look to World in Conflict, the franchise's spiritual successor.The spectacular locations, beautiful skylines and incredibly minute details present in both games is truly amazing to behold, especially if you consider when they were released. In terms of cutscenes, voice acting and the way the story is portrayed, 2 is mostly superior to 1, but the voice talent as a whole feels severly underused in some aspects, and an in-game video or lore section would have massively improved a player's understanding and appreciation of the universe, but unfortuneately this is only available through online downloads of both games' booklets in PDF form.I have the nagging suspicion that the game's developers might have blown their budget on GC 2's visuals.Now for the meat of the game: The Factions.Though some might find the Virons' portrayal as a warrior culture to be a bit cheesy and unoriginal, their uniquely organic look, hovertechnology and strategy of melding two units into a new, more powerful fighters (Fusion-Ha!) will undoubtedly appeal to many sci-fi fans.The resident good-guy faction, the NSA, can be compared to GDI from the C&C franchise, with its focus on tracked vehicles, conventional ballistic-based firepower, and more noble portrayal as righteous defenders or peace and freedom. But here's where this group starts to fall flat: You get the distinct feeling that they should be the unstoppable juggernaut faction, but they're not. The NSA's playstile demands that you bunker down and diversify your forces, otherwise you face failure. Most of their units feel weak, slow and oftentimes even ineffective in comparison to their counterparts in the other groups, and you sometimes get the impression that the only reason you're winning the campaign is because the AI is predictable and can be manipulated to your'e advantage.The Terran Empire on the other hand...oh boy. I remember developing a deep and seething hatred them, not only because of how vicious and evil they were as a political and militaristic entity, but also for how horribly overpowered their units are, which you begin to notice very early on in the campaign when playing as the other blokes. However, without mods you cannot play as the Empire in single-or multiplayer, but if you have, and have gotten a taste of their power, you don't want to play anything else. NSA? Stuff em and their plight for survival. Virons? Send 'em back to Space-Mexico.Perhaps the exclusion of the Empire was an intentional move on behalf of the developers to futher increase the sense of the Alliance's inadequacy in the face of an overwhelming opponent, but seeing the conflict from the POV of the baddies might have given the game more substance.There's also another problem with the OP-faction: NSA's war against the Terrans lasted more than fourty years according to the lore. FOURTY DAMNED YEARS. Judging by the Empire's power and sheer ferocity, its a miracle the NSA has survived for fourty damned minutes against them, which can hamper your suspension of belief and remove from the overal experience.Further qualms include the AI, which can be truly asinine at times (it's an improvement over GC1, which isn't saying much), and the support powers feel mostly useless. There are also severe spikes in difficulty on some missions, especially on higher difficulties (they are not the fun kind of difficult challenge, trust me on this), and I wish they hadn't cut out so many of the core features that made the first Ground Control so fun to play.Balancing, story portrayal and gameplay issues aside, my biggest problem with the game its ending. Many people, including me, hope(d) for a sequel, but that isn't going to happen. The series simply never gained the same renown or large enough fanbase to justify another game, and the developers have close up shop many years ago and sold the franchise to a group which simply buys and re-sells other franchises.If you've managed to endure my overly-long ramble until now, congratulations. My final recommendation is that you buy the game. It's dirt-cheap, and you get quite a lot for your money. I know I did.Apart from a few quirks that might rub you in the wrong way, GC 2 (as well as GC1 and WiC for that matter), is a solid experience that will leave you satisfied and wanting more in the same vein once you're done. I simply wish there were more games like these, a return to a genre which many say is dead and broken, the victim of the accursed MOBA-plague.My advice? Play it and judge for yourself to see if I'm right, or if you think I'm just being nitpicking yobo who's stuck in the past and blinded by nostalgia.   "

												What are the similarities between Ground Control 2 and its spiritual successor World In Conflict? Both ended in a cliffhanger, yet neither are getting any new sequels made to pick up where their endings left off.Which is sad, because both games have yet to feel outdated (graphically showing its age but still held up well) and are as addictive as ever even after all these years. Ground Control 2 in particular is sold at an unjustified low price that its easily snatchable even during non-discount period. If you can't afford the latest RTS or looking for random curiosities in the bargain bin, consider picking up Ground Control 2.			"

												Viewing it as a standard RTS game, Ground Control II is solid, respectable offering. It's amazing the in-game graphics have held up this long, and it's nice to simply watch all the little effects pop up here and there. The dropship and resource mechanic is appealing too, giving the game a much faster feel than games like Starcraft or Command & Conquer.Of course, as someone who has played the original Ground Control, how does this fare? It's a bit of a mixed bag to be honest. On one hand, the sequel really improved in some areas where I found the original to be lacking, especially in the speed department and general streamlining. Of course, it also lost a bit of its personality, doing away with or belittling  some of the original game's features that made it standout amongst its contemporaries.Still, Ground Control II is a good game and definitely worth a look for any RTS fan.

												If you want to play this game, you're going to need to downgrade your system. (And no, not downgrade as in get a Windows XP machine.) I have an AlienWare M17 xR4 running all the latest updates on Windows 7 Professional, 64bit, with an i7 Quad-Core Intel processor with on-board integrated Intel HD4000 graphics card and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 660M with 6 GB of RAM, and I can't start this game (or the original Ground Control, however I can start Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon, and Star Wars: Dark Forces.... yeah, explain that to me, 'cause I don't know either.) on that computer.(Before you think that it can't run anything because it's Alienware, I've rebuilt it from scratch so that the only thing Alienware is the case and the ports themselves.)However, I also have a laptop that CAN.It's a Lenovo G50 running an AMD A8 Dual-Core processor with 4 GB of RAM which came with Windows 8.1 which I have now running Windows 10, Standard edition, 64bit. Integrated graphics card of Radeon design.You know how I got it to run?I disabled the Steam overlay, and when I ran it the first time I ran it as an Administrator, which helped out quite a bit. But it still wouldn't start.So I went into the Windows settings on Windows 10 and enabled drivers and updates for Legacy software (Which yes, that IS A THING you CAN do with Windows 10,) and after reading a few of the guides on the guides page in Steam, I got it to work.Bear in mind that that Lenovo was bought at Wal-Mart, on the clearance rack, for $100.And it runs. The ORIGINAL Ground Control too. No emluators or anything. It. Just. Runs.Before you read anymore bad reviews and think that people who ""can't get it to run but have never played it before so it must be crap and the developers are crap too because this game should be able to run and play on my 4K ultra machine blah blah blah.....THIS GAME WAS RELEASED IN 2004.The ONLY game to get an update that hasn't been a COMPLETE remastering that basically meant you had to pay for the entire game as far as I know is Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II. (Before you ask about the new EA Star Wars: The Old Republic, yes, I know it is free. I have an account and regularly play it, but I like my classics better.)This IS NOT a bad game. It takes some finnicking, but once you've gotten it started, you're literally half-way there.And for those complaining that there isn't multiplayer support:~~~~~~~~~~~XXXXXX (READ THE DETAILS PAGE A BIT MORE THOROUGHLY) XXXXXX~~~~~~~~~~*Multiplayer notice: Because Massgate is no longer operating, playing over the Internet is no longer possible. Playing through a LAN is still available.^The above was taken literally a half-mousewheel-down from the About the Game/Key Features Menu^Remember that not all computers are the same. But before you discredit a very amazing game, that is literally older than most of the kids that are in Middle/High School depending on where you are, go to Wal-Mart and check the clearance rack. Most computers that are running AMD Dual-Core processors are generally going to run a lot more of the older games than a 4K Hyper machine will.Overall? Really good game, just gets a lot of flak for being too old to be viable to update anymore. Yes, there are a couple of bugs here and there, but c'mon. 2004? This game ain't half bad for being a 2004 game.			"

												Alrighty, GC 2, the successor to one of the most ""interesting"" RTS games of its time.If you just played GC 1 and want to continue on beware that this game is VASTLY different.Key differences:- still no base building, BUT permanent landing zones and victory points that accrue AP, with which you can buy units and have them delivered to an LZ under your control. Capturing is easy...just get troops to the point long enough with no opposition. Holding those points is a lot more difficult, however, since you can't just leave them undefended. The enemy will just retake them. However, the more units you have, the less AP you get from your victory points, kinda like Warcraft 3.- No more squads. Units are built individually.- Healers. You have healing units, which are vital...unfortunately also extremyl fiddly...- Units can finally hit things more reliably. Accuracy is greatly boosted.- Units level up in the field.- A functioning interface. Actually a pretty good one.- Full HD resolution support.- Actually different races.- A ♥♥♥♥ing save feature!!!!!!!!! (but no auto save after checkpoints, so USE that liberally).So, basically, as I said above, every mission usually has different goals, but to achieve those goals you always follow the same pattern: capture points and if possibly the enemy LZ. Denying all LZs means there will be no more units for the enemy, which basically means, you've won the game. The mission objectives are more varied and fair than in GC 1. The upgrades for your drop ship, however, are a bit weird. You can upgrade your ship with better weapons, more cargo space, more fuel, etc. but the upgrades are not persistent, so you do that every mission, which kinda sucks.The pathfinding in this game is still HORRIBLE. Units get stuck on each other, formations split up randomly to follow completely different paths, etc. etc. You really need to babysit your units.Graphics and interface are mighty fine for a game so old.The story: You first play as the NSA (human colonists) and then the Virons (alien slaves) vs the eeeeevil (humans from Earth), who want to get all colonies back. The story could not be any more cliched. You have a British hero, a snarky sergeant, a redneck major, a hot doctor, a ""Black"" general (stereotypical racism. When you hear him talk you know what I mean), honourbound and honourless aliens and some really cheesy antagonists, the main one you only get to personally meet very late in the game and then poof. All in all the plot is not ""bad"", it's just cheesy as hell. GC 1 was a bit better in that department. Speaking of which, the story plays out 300 years later, so Sarah Parker and her ilk only receive some cameo ship log appearances. What happened in GC 1 is pretty much unimportant, apart from that one Pillar blowing up (you know the one).GC 2 is a very slow and deliberate game, faster than GC 1, but still moving at mostly glacial pace, however the action is frantic, just your units move sooooo slow. Some units also die very very quickly. Moving a bunch of infantry over the map without having access to a transport is just masochistic in 2016.All in all GC 2 is a pretty nice game with obvious flaws, which may mostly be attributed to it being over 10 years old by now. Safe buy if you like old school RTS without base building. Perhaps comparable to the CoH playstyle.			"

												This game has it all. Almost everything you loved from Ground Control 1 translates here and amplified. Now I will say I prefer the first one and I think it has better music and gameplay but that's just my opinion. The graphics sure are gorgeous in this game and there are lots of new gameplay mechanics. Where the 1st gives you this hopeless feeling as you're fighting in a desolate barren planet this game offers a multitude of enviroments, I especially enjoyed urban combat and there are memorable characters just like the 1st game.

												A non-biased quick look @ the game:


YouTube™ Video: ➜ A Quick Look @ 'Ground Control 2' (GeForce GT 640) 

			Views: 157		

			You can pick up the game here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/254840 Massive Thanks to Rebellion for the Review Copy!		

Sequel to one of my favourite all-time RTS games. It’s 2741 and the universe is at war. The Terran Empire is laying siege to the NSA, a treaty of colonies that upholds freedom and democracy. After losing the battle in space, the NSA is forced to retreat to its last stronghold. Can you snatch victory from impending doom? - Highly Recommended!			"

												Ground Control 2 both improves on and messes up the, somewhat flawed, Ground Control 1 formula.On the bright side, you're no longer spending quite as much time fighting your own units' AI(though it's still pretty bad and requires a LOT of babysitting), and the flaws in their AI can be more easily forgiven since you can now actually call in reinforcements, rather than the entire mission being screwed if one squad decides to forget their brains at home and get killed.On the downside, the formula for calling in reinforcements is based on infinite resources, as they slowly tick up(though slower the more units you have), meaning that the instant you have a stable defensive situation, and a reliable resource income, the only limit on your victory is your patience, not your intelligence. Since at that point, your military will be growing faster than your enemy's and you just need to build up the surplus to defend a landing site while attacking your enemy's positions.It's like a less aggravating version of the last Command & Conquer game(I know, setting the bar low), which isn't really high praise.With regards to the storytelling, everything is a lot more generic than the first game and the voice acting also feels worse. Though at least now the character faces have more than one polygon. That, however, isn't exactly praise for the competency of the design, just an inevitable result of it being a more modern game.I also still wish they'd just give you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fog of war to help you determine view ranges. You can now at least see your units' (theoretical) view radius by mouse-overing them, but doing that for an entire squad, especially when it doesn't display terrain occlusions(are there no enemies here, or is that one ridge blocking me from seeing them?) is frustrating.

												I see no reason why this game is a part of Ground Control series. Ground Control I and II are absolutely different games, and personally I'm very disappointed with GC II. Here are the reasons why.In Ground Control I, I liked to manage my squad: select correct equipment and correct units (each have their own strengths and weaknesses), and then go with my party of battle-hardened veterans from one mission to another. They gain experience and start to fight better.I liked naming my squads, I liked statistics, medals, ranks and other cool stuff, which kinda left some 'wargame' feeling, and make some bounds between you and your soldiers, the feature which was absolutely great.In GC II, this part of a game was totally cut off.Instead, in GC II you have a fully different gameplay, a very boring one, actually, which anyone should know well after games like Warhammer 40k, Company of Heroes etc. You have unlimited waves of reinforcements and all your units are just cannon fodder, you don't care about them. Instead you select them and throw to the enemy's face till death or till all control points are captured. That's all.Yes, GC II has way better graphics than GC I, but that's the only advantage. Gameplay in GC II is boring and stupid. I don't recommend this game at all.If you liked Ground Control I, then you should definitely play Codename: Panzers I and II. I guarantee that you'll be happy.			"

												Been quiet a few weeks. Devs have yet to patch the game so it works on newer computers. Namely laptops. If you have a laptop, or new hardwear do not purches. Do not give thes company your money. I've tried postin in the forums here, sending support tickets. Last I hear they where apparently working on the issue, but that was a bit of a while ago now. And I still can't open the game period. Just to post this review had to stare at the launch for 5 min. That's as far as I can get			"
