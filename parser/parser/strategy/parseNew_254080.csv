												For all the people that do not recommend this game: you should probably stop buying games that are older than you :)Now about the game: It was and still is a great RTS and keep in mind this came out in 2001. It brings back so many good memories and bad (when my WWIII:BG CD got scratched and couldn't play the game anymore). I recommend this game to people that started gaming with 8-bit graphics games, not with COD and CS :)			"

												Boy was I excited when I saw this title on Steam. WWIII:BG is the first real video game I've ever layed and I absolutely loved it. While the gameplay itself may not be up to 2013 RTS standards, the music, ambience, mission creativity, mechanics, and immersion are top notch for its time. Sure there are annoying pathing bugs and stupid AI, but it's definitely not gamebreaking. A nostalgic 10/10.			"

												Why all the hate? Do not buy this game now if you don't collect games or if you haven't played the game before. I got WWIII:BG the date it appeared on steam out of nostalgia; I used to play it years ago.If you're actually looking for a good new flashy RTS game look elsewhere (hell, even World in Conflict), don't hate on this game just because it's old. (that being said the map engine was awesome at the time. heavily changing terrain during gameplay, building structures, hidden units, etc.)			"

												A fun albeit, dated, rts that gives you the most enjoyment from the skirmishes. They are rather large skirmishes, and I mena LARGE, I was honestly surprised to see the number of AI you could add, it was this feature, really that made the game so much fun for me, the large scale rts battles made this well worth the, less than a dollar, I spent on it. In terms of gameplay it is rather standard and sometimes tedious, though despite all its short comings, I'd say if it's on sale, pick it up if you want another rts, nothing too special but for less than a dollar you get your money's worth.

												With all the ""StarCraft"" and ""Age of Empires"" wannabes clogging store shelves, it's rewarding to find a real-time strategy game that does its own thing and does it pretty well.It ain't particularly novel and it ain't particularly easy, but it is engrossing and refreshingly reliant on strategic thinking to see you through.Reality Pump have refined the genre to near perfection, and until we see some radical changes to the RTS formula you’ll be hard pressed to find a better title.A deep, hard strategy game that offers tons in the way of customization and length.

												It was one of the first games in strategy games.Over time, new strategy games appeared. The images were different but different from each other. All of them were the same. ""World war III Black Gold""When the video card battles begin, between Command & Conquer etc., We got out and we fooled in a series.But now it's like loyalty. Yes, the image and the game are a little unusual but sometimes it was good and we spent our hours.I would recommend it to gamers. Keep it in your archive. Maybe you like to do nostalgia like me.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Strateji oyunlarında ilk sıralardaki oyunlardandı bir zamanlar.Zamanla yeni strateji oyunları çıktı.Görüntüleri farklı oynanış farklı ama hepsi aynıydı.Anlatımı ile çıkış amacı ile bir oyuna benziyordu. ""World war III Black Gold""Ekran kartı savaşları başladığı zaman nvdia ve ati arasında kaldığımızda Command&Conquer vb. çıktı ve seri halinde şapşal olduk.Fakat vefa gibi oldu şimdi.Evet görüntü ve oynanış biraz alışılmışın dışında fakat bir zamanlar iyiydi ve de saatlerimizi harcadık.Oyunseverlere tavsiye ederim.Arşivinizde mutlaka bulundurun.Belki bazen benim gibi nostalji yapmak istersiniz.

												First let me sy that I got this for a steal on sale, so can't complain too much, butGraphics are ok (cir 2005 style), blocky 3D but effective enoughTypical RTS Gameplay, not much reasource management, just drill for Oil -> Money, focus on combat and base buldingHowever, overall, this is a pretty flawed game, based on what I played at least (US campaign, then got bored).Its tough even on normal difficulty, odds are often stacked against you, and silly restrictions (in single player campaign) such as this 1 unit must survive, and no repair capability offered, even between levels!!!?Enemy AI is pretty simple, but effective enough... units will stay where they are, didn't see a lit of patrolling, and then they swarm as soon as you attack. Own team AI is where most of the problems are... can only set 3 basic tactics per unit/group... chase 'em, stand still, or stay within area. Even on stay within, you units often roam into areas they shouldn't and get picked off easy. Wost part is the route finding... the game relies on building many units and swarming when you outnumber the enemy... often groups of 15-20 units per group. But the pathfinding is bad. often the first 3 or 4 units head in the right direction, and the ones behind bump intoi them and then head off in another direction for an alternate, often with disasterous effects.Base building is pretty noddy too. no sign of upgrades for most buildings, just build one to access a certain list of units and then forget it. Having to manage power was a nice touch (each gen can power two nearby buildings) which gives some tactical options of blacking-out your enemy buildings... but most of the time you'll get mashed before you get near ur enemies gens.All in all this seems a dissapointing basic RTS cir 2000... if you want a very cheap nostagic RTS shot then grab it on sale, if not avoid, there are much better ones out there.

												Had this game when I was much younger, absolutely loved this game and any other RTS game. Most people probably wont know this game but Dogs of War : Battle on Primus IV (came out in 2000) was my favourite RTS game back then. You could either control vehicles from an eagles eye view or directly control a vehicle in 3rd person, which was my favorite feature of the game. The game doesn't have that feature however, I still loved playing it. The game is pretty difficult but that's what makes it fun for me.

												Possibly one of the worst RTS's ever.  First mission: drive to another base.  On the way, avoid extensive enemies.  Units die almost immediately unless you are driving the tank.  Bridge blows up after _second_ car goes over.  Once you arrive at the next checkpoint, nothing happens.  Even for its day (which was 2002 or something) it sucks.  Also, they made an extensive rendering pipeline configuration utility that doesn't even do what it claims (looks like you can pick the monitor but only runs on main monitor).  Waste of money.			"

												I am a big fan of RTS - especially modern RTS...  but this game really lacked a lot of polish.  The mini-map is almost useless because you can't make anything out on it.  It's hard to see your own units on the play-map because they are often the same color as the terrain.  The controls are lacking too...  CAN'T SHIFT-ORDER MULTIPLE COMMANDS!  Finally, I can't stand how the American units have a foreign accent 1/2 the time.  I am so totally unhappy with this game I want to delete it from my game list.			"

												Be very careful and look at the date of release before you think of buying this. It's 13 YEARS OLD!! The release date of 2001 is in very small print.The videos above make it look like a modern game. However, these aren't in game graphics, just footage from cut scenes. When I bought this game, it was being advertised on the main Store screen as being ""new!"" However that is deliberately misleading and this has now become a very vocal and major issue of the way Steam is deliberately misleading it's customers (some are saying ""downright rip off"" on many gaming sites and gaming focused YouTube channels).I find this very sad as Steam used to be held in high regard by myself and many, many others for it's integrity and honesty to it's customers.As for the gameplay of WW3: Black Gold, it looks very dated now and has been left way behind by so many more modern games in the RTS genre. It just can't be compared to more modern RTS games in ANY possible way.I bought this game and before playing it, went to visit my big time PC gaming neighbour. By coincidence, he was playing the game and was ranting how he had been ""conned"" by Steam and cursing the game and it's gameplay. So I sat watching him playing it for a few hours, hoping it would get better the further he got into the game. It didn't. So when I got back home, I uninstalled it and never bothered with it again. So I haven't logged even a minute of gameplay on it on my own computer. What I saw at my friend's was enough for me. So when I want an RTS fix, I go for Company of Heroes 1 and 2, Starcraft 2 (both of the already finished games of the intended trilogy), the Warhammer RTS games and the Paradox Grand Strategy games such as Hearts of Iron 3 TFH, Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings 2, etc.So the lesson to be learned here is that Steam is quickly losing it's integrity and high regard in the gaming industry and so be careful to look at all the small print in the advertising for EVERY game it sells. Plus, assume ""new"" means the game is new to being available on Steam and not necessarily new as in made in 2014.I really hope this isn't a downhill spiral and that Steam gets back to how it used to be which made it essential to all PC gamers.

												I couldn't even try to play this game, its that bad. It doesn't exactly tell you any basics unless you go into the stupid turtorial, the graphics could use a little update (even for 2001 this is bad) and when you try to build♥♥♥♥♥♥ nothing happens? The music is also very loud and really hurts my ears at the random noises in it, and there is no settings to turn down the music or change the very face mouse sensitivity. You also can't use WASD to move around, only arrow keys. You also get attracked straight away in the campaign and your vechiles run out and die when the sentries could shoot them.The ♥♥♥♥ is this game.			"

So - let me talk about PROS now :D + Interesting action game about World War III+ Good graphics for 2001 (Don't forgot it)+ Cool voice lines+ AI isn't that bad, not like in 2 last reviews game+ Nostalgic game with avg. memorable musicI don't found any cons for now, but when i complete this game, i will talk about cons.But anyway - I recommend this game for retro fans. Very unique. That's cool too, that i got this game for free.			"

												Even it's really ancient product, using DirectX 8 or OpenGL - it supports FullHD and above.A classic RTS, where you farm limited resources ($$$ directly from the oil field :) ), build buildings&units out of money, defend them...Multiplayer is supposed to support voice chat - but you probably need some sort of codec pack for that on Win10 64-bit.The game setting is ""Arabs decided to stop exporting oil and Russia and USA have to start struggling for resources, resulting in WW III"".The only huge drawback is you need to enter a C D K e y!  It's really weird - it has steam DRM and CD key protection as well. I wonder if CD keys are all the same :)))No fancy graphics either. First start on Radeon 270 resulted in initial cutscene video with company logo turning into a slide show with sound played fluently and video frames appearing for next several minutes one-by-one. "

												Let us clarify a couple of things first, mostly concerning the playerbase in regard of the current generation. Graphically, those players who never really tasted the look of games from 2001 and around (yes, a gamer's eyes do feel tastes) will mostly find this piece unpleasant, or even outright trash. Those who begun their gaming hobby or 'passing of free time with games' around then, might still find it great and fun to this day, unless they completely grew out of it. And I am sure that most of those who first faced pc games around the time of DOS and her sisters, will likely forever classify it an amazing corner of strategy gaming. With the discussion of graphics coming to an end (as highlighting these three groups of players among the hundreds of hybrid types of players revealed that this game can not be realiably up- or downvoted via the judgement of graphics), we should move on to the nice and those couple of nasty (but light-years away from fatal) points of the gameThere is a little thing that might have eluded the sight of a couple of people, the issue is only an issue in terms of tech lore, but on the other hand, it is sorta obviously there to strenghten the gameplay by allowing the players to be the sneaky types. There really isn't a simulation of night vision equipment, meaning that it is rather hard to detect vehicles and buildings if their lights are off, basicly you need to be close to them to spot them. On the other hand, as stated, it opens up a wider array of tactics, such as opportunities for ambushes, surprise attacks, and thus driving the players to utilise the use of radar equipment aviable in the game. While the AI is not really doing these sneaky things, players finding said AI a bit persistent and troublesome could even the odds with turning off the lights at night, as indeed, there is a day/night cycle, with additional transitional (dawn and sunset) visibility values as well. Then the vehicles, they all exist in real life, so they may be good of bad in different situations, such as armored or unarmored cars which hardly feel a difference when facing main battle tanks. Oh, and there is an interesting piece, the RAH-66 Commanche helicopter of the NATO, which is meant to be a stealth helicopter. However, you very soon end up finding out, that it is not so much more stealthy than any other helicopter of the game. But! Probably not many of the players are aware that this is exactly how the actual RAH-66 project turned out! A stealth helicopter which ended up being not so stealthy, and the game mirrors this fact well, thus some of the pieces of equipment here, even if not utilising night vision tactics, share the blunders with their real-life counterparts. Probably this is the reason for the Russian units relying on their own crew for repairs: they might not be the least fragile things, but they also are a less of a brain tumor to fix than those high-tier NATO vehicles. Then while the Russian and Iraqi soldiers are both willing to utilise any leftover equipment of the enemy against them, the US need no incompatible and somewhite less refined weaponry (only in the tutorial), thus they only capture buildings with their M113 apcs. The only sad thing here is that you cannot design the M113 model into carrying machine guns or anti-aircraft weapons, but you can vary other combat designs. Coming to anti-aircraft weaponry, just as in real life, they utterly limit your aerial operations until you wipe them out, prompting you to utilise combined warfare tactics, albeit turning off lights sometimes allow you to swarm these installations first, before they return fire usually pretty soon. And sure, aircraft disappear in a matter of seconds in great balls of fire, unless chaff system installed provides a couple of life-saving one to three seconds. And the AI that I mentioned, is goodBut enough of the technical stuff and gameplay, as Reality Pump did not just threw up an rts about war out of the blue, and a bit later I will highlight that there is even more, in fact much more than that (but probably many old players are aware of that by now). This will contain spoilers of course, and this is why I left this to the endSet between 2006 and 2008, most of the Earth's sources of fossil fuel are seemingly about to run out, at least those controlled by the Great Powers. The OPEC nations, who still seem to possess enough to keep it running for a while, decide it is best to conserve the fuel reserves. Iraq especially seems to probably nationalise the oil industry, and thus the G.I. Joe of the World who drinks oil for breakfast, the United States of America jumps into action. This time however, it will not go as smoothly as beforeThe first NATO campaign is centered around this new Gulf War, the invasion begins and after they effortlesly make landfall and star military operations, the Iraqi Army shows themselves and actually manages to cause a mass confusion, It is your task to undo this and revitalise the stuck offensive, to reach Baghdad and force an Iraqi surrenderMeanwhile, the Russian Federation resolves to invade Azerbaijan, just that it seems that organizations based in Iraq are supporting the Azeri as well. Starting at Shaki, you must eventually seize the Baku Oil Fields for the FederationIn Mexico, several cars and a truck are stolen and surprisingly, the News seem to be making a couple of correct guesses, and thus you must act quickly. This isn't a true Iraqi campaign, you play as a terrorist cell, which seeks to become a nuclear terrorist cell and strike US targets with their own nuclear arsenalAnd here picks up the second US campaign, where you need to take control of the situation and take back the silos before... you knowIn Iraq, you finally take up the sword as the Iraqi Army and with some jihadists helping out, you get the chance to free your homeland and destroy the US Fleet in the Persian Gulf. You also get a glimpse of the threat of the US satellite systemAnd now in Russia, shadowy men talk of a new revolution, a revolution that if succeeds might restore the glorious Soviet Union. The catch is: you are to lead itOne in the end might wonder about the intro cutscene. How despite of at least three atomic bombs going off in game lore (at least, since you can use tactical nukes ingame sometimes) this is a World War that dwarfed that of the previous World Wars? Just what really happened in the story that you failed to notice while playing? Is the destruction of DC, a US Fleet and an Iraqi desert region warrant for such a scale of loss? Well, didn't you feel like when those nukes went off, that the cost of victory begun to be ignored and thus the moralty of mankind started to go downhill? And that is what occured, in the game that you have played, here began the end of Earth.This story is just a catalist, in exactly 40 years after the story's end, the mayhem will begin anew, but this time the world will not stop at just three nukes. This is not just World War III - Black Gold, we can also call it 'Earth 2006'. The events that led up to an actual nuclear holocaust of 2048 begun here. First in about a decade or two, NASA will be known as the Lunar Corporation, and sometime after, the catastrophic conflict sweeps across the planet, and from its ruins will rise the Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States. This is the beginning of a new saga, the Earth Trilogy - which is in fact a Quadrology with this game/Search for 'Earth 2160 PC Games Trailer - Trailer.' on a search app, or look around on steam and you will see it all summed up and comfirmed, which will all make a sense if you played any of those games and cared to read the manual/With these things in mind, do I recommend this game? Absolutely for those who do not mind older graphics and sometimes challenging AI, and for those who loved the preceding Earth games, you absolutely do not want to miss this out of the collection! Because as I said, it all began here			"
