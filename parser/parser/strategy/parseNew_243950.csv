												A good game...  Just one that is so strong in one part... And so weak in another two.... I find it difficult to recommend.. I think some will really love this game, and others will bounce off it. I am somewhere inbetween... And after 8 hours, I just felt like I'd had my fill.There are three parts to this game, the RTS battles where you can take the form a dragon to rain down fiery terror on your enemies while commanding your forces about and building a base... the strategy map where you move your forces around in a turn based environment, very much like the board game RISK.. and the part of the game that I call the Emperor simulator.For me, the RTS part of the game is the weakest, and ultimately what made me run out of steam and stop playing. I spent most of my time in RTS battles and to be fair they are half decent. The graphics are competent, the AI is good on Normal difficulty and although the units all kinda look the same they are varied in their functions and what they can do. You have land, sea and air units and coupled with the ability to change into a Dragon to help out a crucial time or go on a daring raid to destroy a key building is fun!    ....... For a while.It just becomes stale, at least in my opinion. Granted, I am not an extreme RTS player so maybe I don't have the grizzled veteran stripes that would see me through, but I have finished a few in my time. World in Conflict, a few C&C games, Starcraft 2, Dawn of War.. and similar games... so I feel qualified enough to say that the RTS element of Dragon Commander stops being fun and ends up repetitive and at times... a grind. Fighting so many similar battles, often on similar maps, repeating similar tactics over and over eventually erodes the fun for me and facing X amount more hours of it isn't something I relish. Most of the time selecting all your units and pointing them to the enemy base tends to work as a tactic, as long as you time it right.The strategy map is half decent, knowing where to spend your turn by turn income and when to commit your forces is crucial to success... and that part is engaging. No real complaints .. or specific praise about the map. It is clean, functional.. and works. So.. good!By far the best bit of the game however is playing Emperor. In between battles and troop deployments you will move around your command ship (a big airship powered by a demon) and speak with your generals, learn what makes them tick, settle disputes and do your best to people manage your commanders who are all very different and clearly have different ways of thinking and fighting. You'll also need to manage to needs of the people... in the form of approving or rejecting policies your council proposes.Things like a national health service, conscription, gay marriage and censorship of the media. The choices you make have direct influences on the war, impacting finances, morale and available troops.On top of that you also pick a princess to marry from one of the 5 races (I think) in the game, each have their own story arc, wants and needs and of course who you pick and what happens with them throughout the course of your game influence your standing with that particular race and how the others view you also.It is well voice acted throughout, the characters are well written and they are animated to be full of life and colour. It was a real pleasant surprise!I feel like I am just scratching the surface on this part of the game, but this facet of Dragon Commander is great... and for me..if they could of attached it to a more fulfilling game... like... well... I'm not sure.. .perhaps a fantasy kingdom manager in the mould of Anno 1404 or something? Rather than this repetitive RTS game... then I think this will have been a classic for me. Thumbs up ... because it isn't a bad game... however whether you'll fall in love with it or not... is difficult to say.			"

												What do you expect from this game? Because if you are looking for a good RTS and turn based gameplay, Divinity Dragon Commander isn't the game that's going to scratch that itch for you, even though it employs those mechanics. But if you are looking for a conceptually interesting game, with emphasis on story, character and choices, then I dare say that Divinity Dragon Commander might be worth checking out, if and only if, you are willing to be patient with it and accept the shortcomings of the action phases, meaning the RTS battles.Divinity Dragon Commander is divided in three parts of gameplay: story and political decisions, turn based Risk-like movement troops on a military map and real-time strategy confrontation during which you can control a dragon. The three phases of the game influence each other in a delightful way: the political decision you make have an impact on all the areas of the map, and the level of bonuses you get from them, depending on the faction to which each county belongs. For example, if you are popular with the elves, your elven controlled regions will grant you more money and will also be more easy to defend. At the same time, it will be harder for the enemy to hold on to those elvish districts. Obviously, should you be less popular, those bonus would become penalties, making the game actually very difficult, even in the RTS sequences of the game, where the number of recruits, and thus units you can build, is tied to your popularity. But on that point, it needs to be said that the whole game is pretty difficult if you don't know its workings. The learning curve is all over the place. The game doesn't explain the consequence of your political decisions and the nefarious effects of a popularity of zero percent with one or more factions. Worse, going against the wishes of the undead faction, which is blessed by the gods, actually gives you a penalty during automatic battle resolutions, which is bound to happen sooner or later since you can only manage one battle per turn personally. This battle penalty can go pretty high as I found out, up to -26% apparently. I wouldn't necessarily recommend that particular experience. The RTS phases are a lot easier if you compromise you political stance and try to accommodate most of the factions, at least some of the time.The problems during the battles do not only spring from what the game doesn't establish in mechanics, but also from balancing issues. At the start of the game, you can choose from three dragons, but the differences aren't obvious: the mage-like dragon has more health and better mobility but deals the least amount of damage, whereas the biggest, fastest dragon has the best damage output, but the less health and mobility. The starting skills of each dragon are also different, but since you can unlock every talent for every dragon, it's really a none issue. The problem is that the mage-dragon deals so little damage, that it takes ages to kill anything while the enemy has no problem pummelling that particular dragon to death. Sure, in multilayer, it might make a difference, but for the story campaign, I see no point in going down that road.Also, on the turn based map, it is possible to build local improvements which in turn grant you cards that you can play before a battle to improve your odds of winning, or granting temporary bonuses to counties. But, from all the dozens and dozens of different cards it is possible to get, very clearly the tavern, which grants you mercenaries, is the best way to go. All of a sudden, you can attack an enemy, one unit against ten, and then just summon a whole army of mercenaries to take care of things. Besides these balancing issues, there is also the fact that it is possible to carry over gold between acts. There are three acts in the game, and while you are limited in what you can take with you between act I and II, there is no limit between what it is possible to import to act III. While the game puts an emphasis on rushing down opponents, it is well worth waiting a dozen turns at the end of each act to maximise the treasure, the research trees and the cards, stacking up on mercenary ones. The worst part is, winning or, at least for me, enjoying the game, seems to require using these exploits to gain the upper hand against the IA and avoiding most of the dreadful RTS sequences.Because there is no way around it, those sequences aren't well made. That they are functional is about the only good thing I can say about them. The RTS aspects of it are rather simplistic, and the tactics are seldom more developed than surviving, building a large army and dumping it on the enemy. The fact that it is possible to play as a dragon during those phases is refreshing, and it is nice to fly over the battlefield, helping you troops and raining down fire on your enemies. But this makes it almost impossible to control you troops, managing your army, buildings, etc. So it is constantly necessary to switch back and forth between dragon and RTS controls.As a balancing issue, -again!-, the speed of the game is a huge problem. It is possible to determine how fast, or slow, the RTS portion of the game can run. This means that everything can happen either twice as fast, or only at fifty percent of the speed. Here is the kicker: the dragon you control isn't influence by the change in pace, meaning that he still moves and attacks at the same speed, regardless of the speed of the enemies. This is completely broken since it means that enemies can dish out twice as much damage to you on higher speed, but only fifty percent on the lowest speed, which makes it also much more easier to dodge. So turning the speed to “slowest” during the RTS section is almost a vital necessity.But if, on paper, one third of the game is worth rushing through, the rest of it must be that much better, to compensate, right? From the start, Divinity Dragon Commander pulled me in: the introduction sequence, and it's music, set a refreshing tone for me, as well as the first contact with the generals under your command. The personality, characterisation and style really shines through during those moment. It is the most polished part of the game and the effort shows. The characters feel almost larger than life, straight out of a play, going through individual arcs with their quirks and personal demons, down one path or another, depending on your guidance. The voice acting is just perfect, I couldn't even think of one thing to improve on in that regard. It hits every mark! The dialogue made me think, it made me laugh, it completely mesmerized me. There is so much personality here, even in the background of the scenes where you make decision (like the amazing skeletal barmaid). The opinion of the player is asked constantly over subject which are sometimes trivial and funny, or very serious. It is sad to only have two options as choices, no matter the subject, but it does make things more straightforward. Although, you would be surprised how often the obvious choice isn't always the right one. I liked it a lot, but I suppose it requires a certain interest in political issues, if only to catch the jokes, the nudges and the parodies represented here. I was also very surprised by some of the different issues you get, depending on what you decided earlier. Turning down the imp faction looking to build a giant bomb will result in them coming back with a super soldier project, whereas agreeing in the first place, will only ask more and more of you in the search for the “biggest and badest explosion ever”. Each faction (of which there are five), each general (four in this case) and each queen (again, four) has one of these quests with a lot of multiple branching.Still, although I enjoyed my time with Divinity Dragon Commander, I cannot justify its full price tag, for what content I liked amounted to not even half of what the game had to offer.

												As pumped as I was to get this game, I can't help but feel like I should have done more research.  This game looks incredible at a glance, combining real time strategy with third person shooting action with a dragon (not enough games let play as dragons like that IMO) and all this complimented by the political decisions you have to make between each match.  So much to do, and yet none of it is as deep or thought provoking as you may think.On the plus side of things, the graphics and the voice and conversations of this game are pretty good.  While some of the unit designs seem uninspired, all the characters aboard the Raven (the hub you go to between turns) all have intersting designs.  Futhermore, these characters you converse with have their own distinct personalities and are generally enjoyable to listen too.  The political banters these guys  get into often reflects current real world problems, and getting to have your say in them can be fun.  However, the decisions you make are always either ""yes"" or ""no"".  This may work for some things, but other times I didn't like the all or nothing approach this game presented to me.  Overall though, this was still my favorite part, as it was fun to see their reactions.  Unfortunately what you may consider to be the main part of the game, the RTS and turn based map sections are lacking.  On the map, too much comes down to sheer luck.  Whether it's what cards you get, which you can use to boost your advantage or cripple an enemy in some fashion, or just moving into the wrong place at the wrong time, there is just too much that can change in one turn.  Sure many strategy games are like this, but in this one it feels more like luck instead of skill.  In battle, the real time strategy elements are hardly even there.  It is difficult or sometimes even impossible to try to micro, and the macro only consists of taking over building plots and building one of a very limited number of buildings (only five different ones all things considered) and keeping them from being taken over.  It just feels like a tug-of-war.  The only fun thing is playing as the dragon, although I found that to be repetitive after a while as it was so much easier to sabatoge the enemy's attempts at expanding than it was to fight with my units as the designers probably hoped you would.Overall, this isn't a terrible game.  Though it has some good points, they aren't enough to overcome the badones.  I would certainly not recommend this at full price.  Even at 50% off, you may not get your money's worth, as much of the value of this game comes from playing it repeatedly and making different political decisions, but it's hard to go through all of those conversations a second time.  This game is worth a look ONLY if you are looking for a strategy game that tries some things different.  Otherwise, there isn't much here to warrant your attention.			"

												The single-player mode in Divinity: Dragon Commander sets up a decent plot about a being who can transform into a dragon who is disputing with its other, equally crazy siblings. The story portrayed through the cutscenes is certainly well told, but serves as more or less a justification to go from one map to the next.Though the tutorials don't do much to explain this, Divinity: Dragon Commander is a mix of boardgame-style territory control (a la Risk) and real-time strategy (RTS) battles. The majority of a ""match"" will have players moving pieces around a game board in an attempt to control and dominate as much of the map as possible. The biggest problem is that the tutorial doesn't even attempt to explain any of this.After watching the multitude of tutorial videos, it's easy to assume that the game is only an RTS game, as it doesn't touch on any of the mechanics associated with the boardgame portions of a match. When first confronted with the board, some tooltips are displayed to help explain things, but they are incredibly insufficient. The tutorials for the RTS elements are also insufficient, as is the case with just about every non-interactive tutorial. There is a ""Training Ground"" that allows players to screw around as they please, but it does little in the way of actively teaching anything.The boardgame portions of the game take place in turns and require a ""big picture"" type of thinking in order to play effectively. Two types of resources are up for grabs: gold and resource points. Occupying various areas on the map will add to the amount of resources gained per turn, the exact amount being displayed on the territory itself. When a battle occurs, the player has the option to choose a specific general, each with their own playstyle, to auto-simulate the battle and play the odds, or they can control the Dragon Commander and head into battle themselves.The battles play out like many other real-time strategy games, but with one twist: the player can take control of a jetpack dragon and partake in the battle themselves. Doing so is somewhat limited; there are a couple of minutes in the beginning of the match in which the dragon cannot be spawned (it takes resources, which you don’t yet have, to spawn the dragon), and there is a brief period after death in which the dragon cannot be spawned. The dragon has specific abilities at its disposal as well, each with its own separate cooldown. There are also three different dragons to choose from, each with their own abilities and playstyle.Playing as a dragon is like playing a third-person shooter; it's very action-oriented. When doing so, however, it is important not to forget about the troops on the ground. Battles will be fought in tandem, as the player commands the dragon in the sky while their troops march beneath them into battle. There are limited army commands while in dragon mode, so it is possible to command an army while simultaneously breathing fire on enemy scum. Mastering these army commands is a hugely effective way to get a leg up on an opponent, since it's incredibly easy to forget about a ground army while soaring through the air and toasting fools.As for the non-dragon RTS mechanics, battles consist of vying for resources called Recruits. Recruits are gained over time as long as the player has Recruitment Centers built on top of certain locations around the map. These locations are neutral in the beginning of the map, and need to be captured by having at least one unit nearby. The beginning of the match is incredibly important as players have limited units and must try to capture and hold as many build locations as possible, both for Recruitment Centers and unit-producing buildings.The RTS controls do feel a bit clunky when compared to the standards of the genre. Intermediate tactics like control groups can be utilized, but most units move way too slowly to micromanage effectively. In addition, the camera is constantly shifting position when going back and forth between RTS and dragon mode and it can be quite frustrating to constantly have to re-adjust the camera.The true highlight of the single-player campaign is what happens in between turns, aboard a ship called the Raven. This is where the diplomatic elements come into play, as a group of five diplomats will constantly bug the player with proposals and recommendations as to how to run a country. Each diplomat represents a specific race: Undead, Elves, Dwarves, Lizards, or Imps. Making certain decisions will alter how each race feels about the player, so balancing the favor of each race becomes quite the juggling act.The Raven is also where players will spend their research points. These points, accrued each turn, can be spent on new units and unit abilities or on new dragon abilities. Deciding where to spend research points is no easy feat, as doing so can drastically alter a playstyle. One player might want to spend heavily on their dragon, making each player-controlled battle that much easier, while someone else might want to focus on their army and let their AI generals auto-simulate the battles.It is, of course, also possible to take the battles online against honest-to-goodness humans. The Raven doesn't make an appearance in any multiplayer mode, since chances are people would spend forever in between turns, but its absence is made up by the presence of dragon-on-dragon battles. There are two game modes: Campaign and Skirmish, the latter of which is a single battle in the RTS-style of gameplay, without the boardgame map. The former is just like single-player but without the Raven.The dragon battles are the clear highlight of multiplayer. Battles are no longer instantly won once the player decides to command their dragon, because the enemy player can do the same thing and fight back. The strategy shifts dramatically when a player knows that a dragon can emerge at just about any moment. Anti-air units are way more valuable as most of them, when grouped up, can take out a dragon pretty quickly. The dogfights, er, dragonfights, that can happen in the air are intense and are a true test of a player's focus, as it's even easier to forget about a ground army when using skills and dodging.Each area and NPC looks unique and beautiful, both in terms of technical graphics power and character design. A pretty big issue for some players, though, is the lack of a colorblind mode, as the default colors of the single-player campaign are red and green. This issue persists on both the overworld map as well as mid-battle. During the battle, enemy units are labeled when far away from the camera with a red icon, but the icon goes away as they get closer for some strange reason, reverting back to the reliance on color differentiation.The voice work of Divinity: Dragon Commander deserves special mention. With so many different characters aboard the Raven, the voice acting was immediately a cause for concern for me. Luckily, each character performs well and it is a joy to talk to each and every one. Sure, no one character's voice actor stands out as particularly amazing, but the sheer virtue of not having a single character grate on the nerves is not to be understated.Divinity: Dragon Commander is a prime example of a game being bigger than the sum of its parts. The RTS elements are a bit rough, but at least it's possible to control a dragon with a freaking jetpack to blow stuff up, while the boardgame-esque territory map requires players to think of the big picture. Talking to the colorful cast of NPCs aboard the Raven in between turns in single-player was easily one of my favorite non-dragon parts of the game and really highlights the writing and wit that the Divinity series has come to be known for. The tutorial needs a lot of work and the game isn't very friendly to colorblind players, but Divinity: Dragon Commander will certainly unleash the dragon strategist in all of us.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is of a unique sort. It's one part Real-Time-Strategy, one part RISK, one part RPG, and one part action game. This all sounds like a recipe for a messy disaster does it not? In most other cases, it would be, however, Divinity: Dragon Commander manages to pull off a good chunk of it's intended goals and then some, to create one of the more unique experiences of the year. The story begins by declaring that you are the son of the now deceased king who once ruled over the land of Rivellon. Now it is your fate that you must now compete with your brothers and sisters for the empty throne. Roughly 50% of the game is spent on your ship talking to your advisers and upgrading yourself and your forces. This is the stronger of the two halves of the game because it is here that the excellent writing is put on display. There is a colorful cast of characters to interact with and there are a ton fun and interesting choices to make as a ruler that directly impact the Strategy portion of the game.The other 50% of your game time belongs to the Strategy side of the game. This half sadly, is the weaker younger brother to the RPG elements I mentioned earlier, but it is by no means bad. Most of your movements will be made on a RISK-style campaign map as you claim territory from your siblings. Here you can play various cards to help you or hinder your foes in the battles to come. It's a little shallow overall, but it is very snappy and it's all very well-presented.The RTS sections are fast-paced and entertaining to play for one major reason and one of this game's main selling points: The Dragon Form. At any point in the battle, provided you have a enough resources, you can transform into a dragon and take direct control of it to support your forces and rain death upon the enemy. This form is wildly entertaining and it does a good job of making you feel powerful. It almost makes you forget the lack of unit variety between the factions, as there is technically only one army in the game. However, in the quick and brutal multi-player, the introduction of player-controlled dragons really spices things up and can lead to some really interesting experiences. So overall, Divinity: Dragon Commander is a very unique experience. It is also a very good one, not perfect, but considering the ambition present in this project, it turned out very well for Larian Studios. It shows a lot of ambition in a genre that is otherwise starting to hit a period of stagnation, and that alone is to be commended.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is a pretty great mix of real-time straetgy, turn-based strategy, political simulation and action-packed third-person dragon fighting ^^You are playing as dragon commander and your task is to defeat your evil brothers and sisters and conquer Rivellon.""Raven"", your flagship, is your base of command from where you can access different rooms to plan your next steps.On said ship there are also ambassadors from different species (like elves, dwarfs, reptilians and the undead) and they will ask you every now and then to do a political decision, which also has a little impact on reputation, earned gold etc.Then, after you are done with talking to everyone and you want to start conquering, there is the world map, divided into several ""countries"" (ever played the board game ""Risk""? Then you know how it plays). Each of these ""countries"" can be conquered with your units and you can buy and build one of several buildings on it. Some give you more gold, some will grant you cards, which you can use to get extra units or other advantages in the combat.Once you bought your units, placed them, used your cards and you want to attack another country, then you will jump into real-time strategy part.The strategy part is rather simple. You have several fixed spots on the map, where you can build buildings on. First, you have to get your units there and wait a bit for them to capture them, only then you can build there.Over time, you gain points (i think they are called citizens) which you need in order to build your attack units and buildings.The one big diffenrece and fun thing here is, once you collected enough citizens, you can transform into a dragon, fly around in third person and attack the enemy, buff your units or debuff the enemy units.You are pretty powerful and can turn a seemingly lost battle into a victory, but you are not invincible.On your flagship you can buy new buffs, debuffs for your dragon, new units and upgrades for your units.It's a very well done mix, although it plays very simplistic and doesn't have the depth of other RTS games.The maps itself are also rather small and will repeat quite often.The characters are pretty well done, and also the political debates and decisions are quite fun. Most of the time they are split in half, wether they like a decision or not, so you can't please everyone always. But the impact of the decision isn't that big.Speaking of the political debates, the humor is quite good as well, the dialogues are fun and i found myself to have more interest in these, than in the rest of the game ^^Pretty early on, you are also given the choice to marry a woman from one of the species. The dialogues with them afterwards and the choices you make there are also pretty great and hilarious.The game itself is a great mix of different genres, which plays pretty good, although being rather simplistic, but still fun enough to entertain a lot, especially when you are soaring through the air as powerful dragon, crushing all those puny enemies ^^Can definitely recommend this to everyone even slightly interested in real-time strategy games. A very refreshing and unique game in my opinion, don't miss out.			"

												It's different, it's interesting, it's disappointing.Fighting as a dragon is about as awesome as you might expect, and takes longer to get tired than you might think, especially if you set yourself a good range of skills. You have limited army control in this mode, so can at least fight with a thrash of units under you, radiant in the healing, damage-boosting auras you emit.But you can basically forget trying to play the RTS as designed, because someone put this on top of a Starcraft-y set of units with lots of manually-triggered abilities. You might occasionally switch your artillery in and out of deployed mode, or tell your tanks to use their short-range sonic burst attack, but not much more unless you forego being a dragon. And then I have to ask why you are playing a game whose main defining feature is that you are a dragon.One reason possibly being for the challenge (and inevitable achievement). The dragon is basically like spawning with a Supreme Commander Experimental right at the start. You can assert almost total control of any one point on the map. It's rare for an RTS battle to last more than a few minutes, and if you lose it's because you just got overwhelmed by the AI's ability to multitask harder, or bit off such a ridiculously one-sided starting position that you got rushed while the dragon was in its first-minute cooldown.On the strategic layer, you can only fight personally once per turn, and the rest is up to autoresolves, possibly modified by generals and cards. There's some depth here, especially in picking which fight you want to be your certain win, but nothing to get ecstatic about. Units are almost too mobile, especially naval ones which loop around the map, for territorial control to mean much more than ""keep units on every tile"". An offensive force headed by your dragon self can steamroll forward so much more effectively than any other that there's limited utility to fighting on multiple fronts.The diplomatic side is basically brilliant. Characters are well-written and well-voiced, although the fact that every choice is binary is oft irritating; there's quite often no room for moderation or nuance. You probably won't want to put up with the actual *war* part of the game long enough to play it through enough times to see everything, and savescumming a bit just to see branches not taken is confounded by several turns' worth of delays between action and consequences. Turns padded by war.The ending is flat as a pancake, however. You capture the last key territory, everyone says well done in turn, title screen.And the multiplayer side? Ridiculously crippled. Pick from one of three predefined dragon loadouts (despite loadout-building being a key fun part of the singleplayer), four players per map tops, no AI dragons, only armies. (It's not much of a spoiler to get the disappointment out of the way and say that nothing of the sort shows up to peturb the mix in the campaign, either. There is no climactic final battle here, just another identikit skirmish.)Get it in a sale, enjoy the council going at each-other's throats, and divebombing down onto massed enemy forces to unleash a huge firestorm amongst them before swooping around to gather your own army and charging forward into the enemy base with a bellowing roar. The ambience is great. Just expect by the final chapter to be looking at the strategic map with a weary, tired eye that just wants to autoresolve but knows the Imperial Army will blow a 70% chance and get driven back, and occasionally wishing your conversations didn't feel so railroaded.

												Here is my review of the game:Pros:-Politics:This game has an extremely good politics system in place where you can make decisions that effect not only individuals but entire races as a whole. This phase is easily the best part of the game, it is well voice acted, well animated, and provides great enjoyment for most.Cons:-Map phase:The map phase is shallow to say the least, here you can play cards that improve empire related things, or build buildings that will allow you to improve income and recruit units or mercenaries. But that is all, there is nothing more here, no diplomacy, no trading, nothing that would make you want to spend time strategizing here.-Combat:This should be the most interesting part of the game, since this is the part where you get to be the dragon...for about 2-5 mins. Here are the problems with this phase:First the design choices, as in the way the units look, they are not only quite small(can't zoom in enough), but also look the same for all factions.Second, the speed of the combat is waaaaay too fast, if you want to play defensively, you are screwed, you want to build up bases, you are screwed. The only way to win is if you blob all over the enemy at the start of the battle in which case the battle ends rather quickly because if your draw it out, the enemy becomes too strong and usually you can no longer overwhelm them before you run out of resources, enjoy your 5 mins long battle without strategies and being the dragon for about 5 mins. This problem however also relates to being the dragon.Third, the dragon is strong at the beginning, but if you try and draw out the match to enjoy some base building, you will quickly find, that your dragon is becoming more and more useless as time passes on, since the enemy is improving their units all the time, they will take more hits and you will take less, in the end you will die extremely quickly, making becoming the dragon rather useless.Fourth, the units have way too many skills you can't micromanage on the same level as the ai, which can make some fights rather one sided.Fifth, and this is the largest problem with the combat by far. Mercenary cards. Why in the world would you even want to enter combat with such bad mechanics behind it when you can simply bypass it by spamming inns and mercenary cards and than using auto-combat? -The length of the skirmish matches:These only take anywhere from 25(min difficulty)-45(max difficulty) mins. I tested this by using only mercenary cards and lol i won all of my matches against highest difficulty ai in 45 mins max. This is a joke. Mercenary cards shouldn't be in the game or should be better balanced.-Story:What story? You mean the few cutscenes we get?The campaign can be completed in about 2-3 hours, which is extremely short for a game like this. The enemies are quite generic, have no personality, don't taunt you and pretty much act the same on the battlefield, or at least i haven't noticed that they did anything differently from eachother.To sum it up, the devs created a great politics mechanic in the game, unfortunately the game fails at the other parts, and for the title dragon commander, i was expecting to see more dragons or at least more often than about 2-5 mins in combat. I have the feeling that if they went with the original concept, instead of remaking the whole game halfway through in a single year, they could've achieved more, alas, it is not so.Do i recommend this game for the current price(40eur)? NOThis game is not worth 40 eur.But i do recommend you pick it up when it is on offer.The game is worth about 15-20 eur, carried by the politics and the multiplayer may give you a few hours of amusement.

												This title makes for an interesting mish-mash of genres. It doesn't succeed everywhere, but it makes a good attempt.While there isn't much depth in the strategy portion of the game, the RPG/Political part is well-written and is pretty interesting. You'll regularly be called to make political decisions that are often based on today's social and economic issues. You'll need to balance your own beliefs with keeping the majority of your subjects happy. Your generals, counsals, and potential queens also have their own distinctive personalities and are fun to interact with.The main redeeming feature of the strategy portion is the ability to take to the battlefield as a jetpack-wearing dragon. Yeah, it's about as awesome as it sounds. Being able to turn the tide of a battle by shifting into action game territory has proven to be a great boon for people like myself who normally struggle with RTS but love turned-based strategy.			"

												Larian's problem is that they're too unfocused and it makes them often lose sight of the project they're working on. They seem to get bored and then begin other projects to leave unfinished. Then some of those projects get mooshed into one game. I don't think they've made a fully realised game since the original Divinity.So, how does that apply here?First of all, let's consider that the original concept for this game was actually very different than what we ended up with. There's a lot of evidence to support this.1.) Their Kickstarter described a game devoted to dragons and aerial combat. It was to be an apology to those dragon fans who'd bought Divinity II for how badly they were screwed over and let down. Furthermore, the media (such as trailers and screenshots) released at the time depicted proper aerial combat, along with unique art assets for enemy forces, enemy flying bases, and flying base combat that never made it into the final game. It gave the idea of an aerial combat MOBA with dragons, which was a brilliantly original idea to be sure.2.) The concept art for the game shows dragon forms for the various characters who were kludged into your crew as generals. They were supposed to be leading their own forces, as the generals of the diplomats you're dealing with.3.) The AI behaves like a MOBA. It hangs around out in the middle of nowhere just to give you something to fight (jungling), and when it's not doing that it strictly follows preset paths in big blobs. This isn't even remotely like how an RTS AI is supposed to work, and it doesn't play like any RTS I've ever experienced. It definitely acts like a MOBA in which you were supposed to play a champion (dragon). Yet the end result of the switchover to RTS makes the dragon pointless (I'll come back to this later).Thus I believe at one point Larian were distracted from creating the game they wanted to make by starting a number of side projects. Such as the 'Risk clone,' the 'card game,' and 'diplomacy.' I've used quotations because it is to laugh to actually consider them to be such (I'll come back to that later, though).And each of these projects ended up grossly unfinished, with some having barely any work done on them at all.Of course, once Larian was done being distracted by experimental shinies, they realised that all of these ambitious projects could never be realised. This included the dragon aerial combat MOBA depicted in their Kickstarter. What to do? They didn't have the assets necessary to actually create their MOBA now, so they ham-fisted whatever they had together and called it done.Worse than that? They even lost sight of what they were actually making: A game about ruddy dragons! It's a game called 'Dragon Commander' where you don't ever see any dragons -- including your own!Yet this is what Larian is known for. Losing focus, lazily slapping together something, then merrily dropping it into the market hoping that people will be stupid enough to just buy it sight unseen. They did the exact same thing with Divinity II. THis is what they do.That, and they just make so many promises that they never, ever keep. How is their reputation not utterly destroyed by this point?Really, all they had to do was make an aerial combat game about dragons. Instead, they've ended up with what feels like a compilation of bad shareware/home computer games from the '90s, all slapped together into one package that they've very optimistically overpriced. And anyone who's played budget games from that era knows what I mean -- lazily made, unfinished, shallow, uninspired, aggravating, and borderline unplayable cash-ins. That's Larian to a tee, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. That's on me. I was stupid. Never again.You might think that's an unfair comparison, but let's look at what Dragon Commander actually is, shall we?You can be a diplomat! Hooray! ...except no.It's a shallow, binary, yes/no, choose your own adventure sort of affair. It lacks subtlety, nuance, and imagination. It's funny at times, but that's the only virtue it has. Instead of being able to posit your own ideas, instead of debating and politicking to change a proposed bill, you become the voting public embodied in one, tyrannical instance. I didn't want any of that. If you're going to offer me diplomacy, offer me diplomacy! What we got was tyranny.If you're looking for this sort of thing, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. Any Choose Your Own Adventure book does it better. Try Lone Wolf, or Fighting Fantasy, or even the entirely free Choice of Dragon, which is written much more eloquently and humorously than Dragon Commander could hope to be.Uninspired.You can play Risk! Woo! ...except no.It's a completely one-dimensional affair about the basic micromanagement of units and resources. There's no real strategy involved either beyond brute-forcing your way through the map. This isn't even Risk, it's too oversimplified and one-dimensional for that.Lazy.You can be a dragon! So awesome! ...except no.You have to micromanage everything so if you take your eyes off your units for a moment they're probably going to be doing something painfully stupid (thanks AI). And the enemy forces progress so quickly that they gain weapons and units that can quickly destroy your dragon whilst resisting any damage it could otherwise do, thus rendering the presence of the dragon completely redundant.Pointless.You can play a card game! Neato! ...except no.The cards don't really have much of an affect on anything. You can completely ignore them and still easily beat the game. They're almost entirely cosmetic, essentially only tickling your resources or units, hardly altering them in any meaningful way.Crap.You can play an RTS! Rad! ...except no.The only viable strategy is to create a lot of units and send them in one giant blob to your enemy's base, which results in an immediate victory as the AI is flummoxed by this tactic. I'd hardly call that strategy. Strategy involves... well, strategy!It feels like the enemy AI was expecting to have a dragon of its own protecting it, which is also suggested by skirmish mode where you pick a dragon type for your AI enemies but they never actually use it. I believe Larian has even admitted to dropping the ball on this one.So, ultimately...It's a pretty game, yes. But it's all style and absolutely no substance at all. When you play the game, it really does feel like a bad shareware compilation. It leaves an unpleasant aftertaste in your mouth. You'll feel entirely ripped off by the price they're rather optimistically asking for it.It's got the depth of toilet paper, and the general design ineptitude of a bad movie tie-in. It's not fun to play, unless your idea of fun is driving a nail into one of your eyeballs. Yes, at first, it'll wow you with its graphical flair, but that's all it has. And that's not worth the entry price. Not remotely. Dragon Commander is a game that looks good until you actually play it.I find myself wishing they'd stuck with the original idea, which was brilliantly unique and could've ended up being one of the best dragon games on the market. As it is, the amount of 'dragon' in Dragon Commander makes it entirely disingenuous to even call it such. It feels like false advertising to me. A bit of a con, if you will.If you're buying this because you're looking for a dragon game? Trust a fellow dragon fan -- save your money. I know that us dragon fans have been longing for a game for us, but this isn't it. This is just an effort to take advantage of us by selling us a shareware compilation disguised as a dragon game. That's the most uncool thing anyone could do, really. And I certainly won't be buying from Larian in the future. I've learned my lesson.			"

Divinity: Dragon Commander is mostly about politics. If you're looking for a good RTS game then stay away. Get something like Company of Heroes or Age of Empires instead.The campaign in the game is quite short. It took me 8 hours to finish my first playthrough on normal. The game does, however, have a lot of replay value. This is thanx to the politics system: It mostly adresses a lot of nowadays matters and you can choose what laws to pass and what to disgard. For an example: Legalise gay marriage, weed, let women vote etc etc. There are also 4 different prides you can choose to marry and demon offers you can choose...i know i'm gonna experiment with different choices in my 2nd and 3rd playthrough. I want to see how they all play out and what is the best way to get lots of approval from all races.You can be downright sexist, evil or whatever.The game has an excellent voice acting and this makes meddling with politics such a bliss. Each character is perfectly voice acted and this was the first thing that caught my attention in the game.The only con with this game is that the battles suck. They are mostly 5-10 minutes long and there's no strategy involved. You quickly realise that in order to win battles you just have to charge at the enemy base immediatly. If you try to build bases, gather armies then you'll just lose because the enemy gets stronger with every second and will eventually become unbeatable.Being a dragon won't help either. Your dragon will be overpowered in the first 2 minutes but gets super weak after that. You will only stay alive for a minute and then wait for respawn. That is why you have to charge at the enemies immediatly... - The strategy in the RTS battles is none existant and is a big dissapointment.That is why i auto resolved most of my matches. This is a game for people who like to make decisions and meddle with politics, not for the fans of RTS battles.If you're like me and want to see all different outcomes of the decisions you can make then the game is surely worth it's full price. If you, however, will only play through it once then you'll be highly dissapointed in the 6-9h campaign and should wait for at least a 50% discount. "

												I recommend this only with a big caveat: you'll like this game if you're willing to appreciate what it could have been, rather than what it really is. I found myself enjoying the game's core concepts enough that I could overlook a lot of the poor execution, but not everyone will have the same experience.First off, the bad. The RTS gameplay, which forms the bulk of the game's combat systems, is a mind-numbing clickfest of swarming units around. Everything you own dies almost instantly, to the point where it feels pointless to try to micromanage your units, or even use them wisely - it becomes about trying to get the largest horde and throw it at your enemy's weakest points. Playing across the Risk-like metamap can be a tedious slog if you're waiting around to build units, and auto-resolve usually loses you far more units than necessary. I gambled with a direct strike across the entire map to my enemy's capital in the final stage because I couldn't stand the thought of grinding away at his territory for another several dozen turns; under-prepared and outnumbered, I had to fight that last battle about 10 times before winning, but it still felt worth it to not have to play the metamap anymore.On the other hand, being able to transform into a dragon in the RTS battles is fun, especially since, after some practice, it becomes possible to win battles that are almost entirely in the enemy's favour by judicious dragon use (I easily won battles that the game's auto-resolve system gave me a 90%+ chance of losing). This ultimately ends up defeating the purpose of the RTS gameplay, though it's still pretty fun to play around with. One thing that annoyed me was the realization that the only reason the dragon is not totally invincible is because enemy projectiles will home in on you, forever, from across the entire map, which feels like a cheesy design solution.The story, politics, and RPG elements that occur between battles on the command ship are where the game really shines. The characters are surprisingly well voiced, the art style is excellent, and the storyline and dilemmas are quite compelling, both on their own as well as in terms of their impact on the game. It's sad to see how an excellent RPG/strategy hybrid is hiding in there, barred from becoming as good as it could be by mediocre RTS design. Another six months of polish and design work could have made a world of difference.			"

												(Updated due to lack of helpfulness)It is really hard to say and I mean it REALLY is, but this may just be my favorite game of all time and I have played a LOT of games in my time on this Earth. Divinity Dragon Commander delivers a game with a certain charm about it. (Steampnuk Fantasy anyone?)1. Let me start with the Music. It is simply Delicious!. It is real good and pleasent to listen to and also a great motivation in battle- least I thought so. I DID NOT buy the imperial edition for the golden jetpack and dragon and concept art, No, I got it for the frickin Delicious soundtrack. (It was only like $1 more for the imperial on a sale.) It was worth it, however it only included 11 soundtracks out of the 24 and it did not include my two most favorite songs. So if you want 13 more bombasticly awesome soundtracks from this game I hope you can do some .WEM file conversion!2. Graphics are so pretty the only thought that comes to my head is that one fish from spongebob screaming ""MY EYES!! MY EYES!!"" (if you dunno what spongebob is then I can do nothing but shed a tear for you.)3. Gameplay reminds me fondly of the Total War games but with like a fantasy twist!, but wait, whats that?? You can be in the battle yourself!? and as a frickin dragon!? Moving units on the map and taking over territory to expand your empire is a thriving desire burning inside me. Build Units, Earn Income, Obtain Research, and interestingly use strategy cards to put luck into your hands!4. Decision Making. Always a plus in my book and while you can't really tell entirely how your decisions are affecting the world around you it's more or less the thought of it and if you really believe they are. Think of it as kind of reading a book. You have to immerse yourself into it. Into your imagination. IMAGINATION. (Spongebob reference) This may be personal but making these choices based on your point of view personally may just reflect on who you are...PERSONALLY.5. The Story is long and good enough to keep my attention fully. It makes feel like I really want to be the best Emperor this world has ever seen. (I got to the point I valued my troops lives more then my dragon and would always take point and showering my units with Buffs and Regen to ensure thier survival and to put and end to a battle as quickly as possible.) More then anything though I loved how it made me feel like I really impacted millions of Fantasy Creatures lives as well as humans. That alone to me was worth fighting for.I end this review with this parting message: We All Have To Face Our Demons.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is partly an opportunity wasted. On one side is a rich strategic elements to consider, in an interesting setting, and chock full of original ideas. On the other hand though his simplistic gameplay during battles, poor game balancing in the individual, and the inability of developers to deepen certain inspired as the mechanical use of the cards or the Dragon in battle, lower the overall quality of the game to ""just as good"". Although a bit disappointed, we cannot not make compliments to Larian for originality, and hope they can exploit their talents equally distinctive projects in the future. The basics are there, and they look very solid.			"

												This was a hard one to say no to.  I really enjoyed the rts aspect at first.  Later, it becomes absoultely unfeasable as enemy units are all able to use their special abilities at the same time, while you have to manually do each one.  Well Sandman, I hear you saying, the meat of the game is in the political sim part!   Well I would have agreed with you at first if the decisions had not been ridiculous and stupid.  You are supposed to be a dragon emperor conquering the realm and slaughtering your enemies, but the game has you concerned with dealing with a gay general.  And here comes the worse part.  There almost never is a middle ground when looking at the various decisions.  With the gay thing, its either ""kill them because they hurt a gay person's feelings"" or ""I hate all gay people because they are gay"".  This also comes into play with women's rights.  All in all, it could have been a great game, but the stupid decisions and lackluster rts hold it back.5/10 Hit it once and quit it			"

+ Bold and somewhat successful mixture of action and strategies+ Well written dialogue and characters+ Voice acting+ Soundtrack- The main plot is dull and forgettable - The politcal affairs aren't as challenging as they might firstly seem- Strategy elements are too simple and crude- Some unbalance between unitsOwning every Larian develeoped game in steam I guess I can present myself a some sort of fan. I praise Divinity II: Dragon Knight Saga and Original Sin is IMO one of the best co-op titles in steam. Even so, Dragon Commander is difficult to like as it is also difficult to hate. It mixes so many different elements and genres together (more or less successfully) and was produced so harriedly that devs must have had some compromises. Majorly gameplay is quite much adapted from 'Total war' series combaining real-time - and turn-based strategy.The game puts player into the boots of Dragon Commander, a powerful dragonbreed, and on each turn on a world map player builds units and constructions and moves his armies to invade new areas. When player and enemy have units at the same area in the end of the turn the blood will spill. In these conflicts player deals with the enemy in real-time combat and gameplay reminds the popular rts -series. Optionally, commander can let the AI sort out the battle by paying a reward one of the generals who increase the precent of success or let the army in the location fight without support.Most of my playtime I spent on battlefields personally commanding troops and the rts gameplay has its pros and cons.Starting with the pros. There is various available land -, sea - and air units and each of them have certain special abilities. The resources are collected automatically by constructing settlements on predefined places, that add some hecticism forcing player to act quickly. The genuine feature is ability to assist your troops not just by commanding but to turning a dragon when gameplay transforms into third-person-shooter game. There is also various talents to choose from: some of them are attribute increasing buffs for your units but there is also some heavy weaponry which can blast dozens of enemies at once.And then to the cons. The biggest thing is the lack of maps, which begin inescapably to repeat themself before finishing the game. Secondly, battles are easy to win with most simple strategies and here is a typical scenario: Build units-take a defensive position if outnumbered-destroy enemy assault-build more units-take control of the nearest resource buildings-hire more units-take a defensive position-destroy the enemy assault-take all your units and march into their capital.I never felt couraged to use more sophisticated tactic because I never needed one. I didn't have any use for transport ships for an example. Among these conquests and war planning there is quite much to do and to decide in a political court also. The population of Rivellon's world is inhabited with 5 different species: Dwarves, Elfs, Imps, Lizards and Undead. As you might guess the values and preferences of these folk differ a lot from each other and it is impossible to please them all. The race which you are bowing may grant populations support on battles fought on their lands whereas the breed you are abandoning may degrace their support. Depending on case, the secondary effect of choice is how much money you make or how much units you can hire on each turn.Amusing thing is that you'll also earn a liberty to choose a wife between 4 exotic races - I chose undead Ophelia. Ehmm, I don't consider myself a necrophilic person - I did it for the empire. (lol)All these events and scandals happening outside of the battles are fun to follow. Some politcal crisis are brilliant improvising our own modern cases and the some decisions have impact how your generals relate to you as war goes by. However, dealing with all this politc jumbo is not as hard as I first imagined. I always had at least the 50% support of each race and all I needed to do was to be victoriuos in battlefields and to take a side of a majority in cases. The nightmares of crisises and political challenges faded away just too easily that partly ruined the good idea.  All in all Dragon Commander deserves good rating.  Dragon Commander is a sum of many compromises and might lose a part of its potential after promising start but on the other hand it has some wonderful moments. Engaging as a dragon for your troops' support in battles was something that you don't see everyday and it was always fun to watch and hear how others were reacting when undead wanted to legalize Necromatism for an example. On its full price I can't recommend it, but on sale a fan of light strategy should give it a try.			"

												Of all the games that I have played, the game that probably did the best at challenging my ethics was Divinity: Dragon Commander.  Admittedly, the gameplay is lackluster in both the strategy and combat phases; it was not long before I habitually skipped tactical battle for auto-resolution.  But where Divinity: Dragon Commander really shines is in the diplomacy phase – the phase of each turn where you take a step back from world conquest to deal with management of your empire through the enacting of laws and policies.  Your empire has racial factions, each with their own dominant political, social and religious sensibilities.  Sure, their representatives are largely caricatures of modern political stances, but they still manage to bring arguments to the table that push you to evaluate your choices.Every decision will have consequences – in the very least, they will alter how favorably each faction views you, and can have other (sometimes quite unexpected) impacts as well.  Displease the dwarves too often, and you might find your royal coffers running on empty.  Make the imps happy enough, and they’ll offer up the opportunity to gain a fantastic and horrible new bomb… if only you’ll allow them to mine in the one place where the mystical material they need can be found (despite, you know, the whole “sacred elven burial site” nonsense).  Divinity: Dragon Commander was surprisingly good at making me examine if and when I would embrace practicality or expediency over my personal sense of right and wrong. The diplomacy phase also includes dealing with your military generals, each of which bring their own personalities, problems and histories to the war room.  In addition, you will enjoy a diplomatic marriage that will bolster your approval rating, at least initially, with one of the races; but your wife adds an entirely new substory to navigate through, with multiple possible outcomes.  The diplomacy phase of this game is rich enough to not only play the game for, but to replay it until you have exhausted all the diplomatic possibilities.  And since maintaining high enough favor with a faction will open up surprising new avenues, there is a lot of possibilites to explore and enjoy.			"

												Waited ages for the price of this game to come down, been keeping my eye on it for months because it looked like a really great game. It's basically 3 mini games in one, you have the risk style battle map, the animated and voiced interactions with your retinue onboard your flagship, which is meant to serve as the political/diplomacy portion. And then ofcourse the actual meat and potatoes of the game, the RTS style gameplay.1)Strategy map.Way too simplistic, felt very empty and lacked purpose. AI moves were predictable. I don't like the card system either, for example there is a card to commit genocide in a region of your choice. It just feels all too easy, would of been better to have raider units, which you must create and then transport to the region. But no, you just plonk down a card and suddenly the job is done.2)Ship interactions (household and military retinue)Fully voiced and looks ok. But feels more like a slide show presentation sometimes, for example, you could be talking to one of your aids, then pick one of the limited dialog options and your aid will suddenly change stance or move location slighty instead of it being a seamless animation, it feels each bit was stiched together haphazardly.3)RTS battle gameProbably the bit I was looking forward to the most, and the bit that disapointed me the most. The UI is clunky and way too large, it obstructs a large part of the screen. The actual fights are super easy, once you get to grips with buildings and managing your recruits, it very quickly becomes a snore fest. And the novelty of being a dragon in battle wears off after the first 5 minutes when you come to realise that being a dragon just made the game even easier.It might be worth playing for the story, if you like that sort of thing. But if you're looking for a totalwar style game with dragons, then this is probably going to leave you with buyer's remorse. "

												Before this game I'd never played any of the other games in the franchise. I purchased this game simply for my love of RTS strategy and the insane(ly good) concept of dragon combat. So what does this game do right? There is an interesting research system integrated into the game, research is conducted through research points that you pick up per turn depending on the territories controlled and the buildings on those territories. The politics system is actually a lot of fun (though frustrating at times) and a large part of the game. Political decisions are made throughout the game knowingly or not.  For example if you build far many buildings in your controlled territories you can lose reputation with the elves (which are predictably nature orientated). Every turn or so you vote on some initiatives brought up by certain representatives and can lose or gain reputation points. At first you might think, so what? However, since each faction inhabits certain territories the amount of troops can build or the resources you gain per territory are highly dependent on how much that faction likes you. Additionally, also must manage your responses to your friendly generals and the princess you choose to “woo” as well. Dialogue options between these characters lead to some pretty significant outcomes during the game so it is wise to pay attention to the characters and faction personalities. Oh and by the way I can't really stress enough that each voiced character you come across has a unique personality that will develop over time with their own specific needs and wants. Dragon combat, how how I love you. During the normal RTS strategy portions you can become a dragon and blaze around the combat area using specific abilities and really punishing enemies that come against you. So what didn’t I like about this game? Combat can feel really messy without there being much strategy that just having ""more"" than the other opponent. Sure there are a ok sized amount of abilities for each class and each class has a counter class (or building) but it really feels under utilized. Combat on higher difficultly levels can be extremely punishing. Each territory can only draft so many troops before it is tapped out, this encourages you to expand into fresh territories. However if the enemy decides to attack a tapped out territory that doesn't have a large amount of troops stationed on it, there won't be much of a way to fight back. What kind of irked me as well is that no matter how many troops I had at the end of each act it seems that there is a standard set amount placed around the map when starting a new chapter.  This kind of took away from my sense of accomplishment when taking down an enemy and managing my armies. Finally, I felt the game drags a bit on the final act not really giving you much to do besides to slug it out with the final enemies until the end.  For me, this was kind of a unsatisfying conclusion and would have liked to see even more personally engaging missions involving your generals, allies, or princess.			"

												Pros:+Voice acting was well done+Music fits the game and is nicely throughout the game (i.e. in-game battle, ship, etc.)+Graphics are done well and no FPS drops+Becoming a dragon and ripping apart you enemies is an excellent feature+Political decisions that help you to an extent on the battlefield+A campaign giving some history of what Rivellon was prior of other titles (Divinity Original Sin, The Dragon Knight Saga, etc.)Cons:- The RTS combat (will go into detail)-No multiplayerLet’s start with the good. The game looks beautifully done and everything is smooth. I didn’t see a lot of anti-aliasing and I didn’t experience any stuttering.  The game is very colorful and isn’t dark or gloomy compared to its original titles (Beyond/Divine Divinity). I was running the game anywhere between 100-150 FPS at any given time – depending which room I was on the ship or in-game battle. The animation was fluid for the most part on their face when talking to the commander and you can see emotions emitting from their facial features. The Steampunk feeling for the game was done in a remarkable fashion. You knew you were playing a Steampunk game the moment you began the campaign – from units to generals to the ship you commanded from to the very foundation of the entire empire. Voice acting was done very nicely. I didn’t notice any blandness to their voices and emotions did crop up based on the political decisions that you made for a said general or country. The music was not out of place and it fit depending on if you went into combat, were on the ship inside the bar, or even at the menu. The ambient noises were done well; talking in the background, glass breaking, tinkering, etc. It just made the mood feel more live-like when inside the ship. The combat sounds were done nicely with no issues on voice commands. Political stage of this game has similarities that of real life events. We have countries that are of religion intent, those who believe nature is the answer, those who believe in a corporate unity, and those who believe they are better than the rest of the world. The choices are appointed to you that determine how a country/species of people will approve or disapprove of your choices. These choices can be anywhere from using machines over natural means or determining how a country treats their own people based on culture/traditional means. These decisions help you obtain extra units or stronger units when fighting within their own boundaries. You also have bickering between your generals. You have a rich, know-it-all, uptight sneer of a gentleman, a feminist who believes the world should be ran by women, a bi/lesbian who believes that her values aren’t wanted throughout the empire, and warlike, hot headed general that wants to have a three-way with both of the ladies, but despises anyone’s opinions and that his way is the only way. I won’t go further into details about who they are because that can be pertain to actual gameplay, but their appearances about them are well fit for who they are and how they are represented. There isn’t a lot of story/lore compared to their previous titles, but it gives you enough context to know how Rivellon began and how Dragon Knights came to exist in this in their world. There isn’t a level up system similar to other RPGs, but you do obtain upgrades by researching them that help out you (the dragon) or to obtain better units. Onwards to the cons and we’ll start with the combat. The combat is bland and I would compare it to supreme commander, but you can only build buildings at designated locations. You obtain resources through said located buildings, but you building freely similar to that of Age of Empires or StarCraft. The combat is a big zergfest. You build more units to counter their said units and you’ll win the game (most of the time). There isn’t a lot of tactical positioning since the AI just spams all sorts of units at you and you have to deal with the outcome. The combat felt limited most of the time because of these restrictions. You obtain cards throughout the campaign which help you obtain buffs to your units or debuffs to the enemy’s units. You also obtain cards that help you out (the dragon) so you can demolish your enemies. The feature that shines the most in the combat aspect of this title is the fact you can morph into a dragon and unleash pure annihilation to those who stand up against you. You gain passive abilities, auras, and abilities that can either heal units or demolish those that you fight again. Using a dragon in Third person (dragon) view was a nice touch and you can’t say no to a dragon that uses a jetpack. You also had generals that you could send out in your presence and have them auto-attack different locations. You could also give them cards to help them out in their battles against the enemies.  You also had the “Risk” phase or total war board type similarity. You would send unit pieces to different states and this would initiate combat and then pick yourself or your generals to go forth with the combat (personally or auto-attack). You also built buildings in every state that would give you more resources or help strengthen your forces. Now, onto multiplayer! Unfortunately, when I tried accessing multiplayer multiple times throughout my gaming session, I didn’t see any multiplayer games. So, I couldn’t test out to see how multiplayer is. Verdict:I would rate the game 7.5/10 only because the combat was the biggest lackluster in my opinion.			"

												Medium sized review! :)Bear in mind, this game is not for everyone. This piece of gem is a mixture of several elements thus if you are a person who dislikes a game bearing different features, this one is not for you.In Single Player, you have the obligatory option to steer your political life by making decisions. I will not engage in spoilers much, all you need to know is that representatives from species will present issues and will ask for you to take a side. There will always be pro and con arguments for these issues from all the other species. Depending on what you say on the matter (or you choose not to say anything and majority vote will pass) your popularity will change reflecting on how strong they felt about the issue. If you choose to displease them greatly then their support will fall greatly, while other species will appreciate you more. Later on it will not only be the representatives that present you issues but someone else too. The way you interact with this person and how you answer will also affect your popularity.Popularity is very important when looking at the war table. On the war table  you can see the map of the world and how each and every territory is under who's influence. Aside from the territory borders you can also see what they produce better (gold, population or technical points). Now, according to how popular you are, the resources change. If you are very popular with the imps for example and you are looking at an imp territory, then you can produce your machinery for a great discount. If you displease the imps, then it may occur that the units you want to buy become expensive. So, aside from making political decisions, you will have to think about what steps you make on the war table.Now for the battle. As you could read in other reviews, the fight system is a mixture of an RTS and flying with a dragon so I'm not gonna elaborate on that. Instead, I'll talk about the AI.When there is a conflic between two countries, you may choose to take part in the fight yourself or let one of your generals fight for you or let the numbers decide the outcome of the battle. The game will present you how much of chance you have winning the battle. If it is more than 80% then there is no need for you to battle of course but if you feel like it, this is very it gets fun.Now, when I first played this game, becoming a dragon was very OP. You just had to wait until the timer goes to 0 and have 20 recruits and you basically won; you turned into a dragon and burned everyone to crisp.However since then, there were updates, big ones. Now, if I turn into a dragon and march on with my super strong army, it is still not entirely enough! You need to come up with strategies and sometimes even split push because THE GAME ♥♥♥♥ING DOES THAT TOO. FINALLY the fight is not a boring buttonmash.A few days ago for example I thought I found a small group of weak troopers so I decided to burn them. My units were still back at the base and were still producing more so I was alone. The moment I struck down those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, the whole sky went on f*cking fire. The game AI actually KNEW I will bite the bait and it sent like 30 camoflaged (sp?) flying units and blasted me out of the f*cking world XDSo to sum up if you are up for a little change it's a good game (: The multiplayer is also fun, it is like playing a board game with dragons! :D I'd recommend buying it on a sale though as the original price is way too high!

												Risk + RTS + Waifu/Diplomacy Simulator. It also has some awesome music. Get dis game.Each of the 3 areas are somewhat simplified, though; The RTS portion doesn't have as much depth from say....pretty much any other RTS on the market. The Risk/Turn-Based portion is fairly simple. And the diplomacy pretty much boils down to binary choices (though they are interesting choices and is more than just good vs. evil). But all these pieces, together, make up something greater than the sum. It lends itself to somewhat of a Civ-like ""JUST ONE MORE TURN!"" addiction. Not to mention the story itself is shaped by your choices and goes into some interesting directions.			"

												This game tries to do too much, but that gives it a certain amount of charm. The RTS is pretty simple, and bum rushing is basically the only strategy you need. Being able to turn into a dragon adds the needed fun action you need to keep it interesting. The Risk-like stragey board is servicible. The star atraction here is interacting with the characters on your ship. Reminiscent of the adventure game ship stuff from Starcraft 2, except here Dragon Commander actually comes out on top. The choices you have have little impact on gameplay, but just getting the reactions from the characters is worth it. The writing and voice acting is all pretty good. I wish there was a little more to the campaign mode, but the weird variability with the wives provides some replayability. I reccomend this game if you're looking for some adventuregamey character stuff and aren't too bothered by shallow RTS gameplay.			"

												I recommend this only to the extent that you pay no more than $15 for it. This game has high production values and is very polished, but it is a very very short game. There just isn't enough content. I beat the single player campaign in 12 hours on my first try on normal. There are a couple game mechanics quirks that you can exploit to make the game a breeze once you learn them. There seems to be a push to have you play multiplayer but this isn't a popular enough game to really find others to play with. The RTS controls are mostly primitive, and dragon form doesn't really last long enough (and isn't really effective enough) compared with RTS controls to really be a big part. That said, I still give it a thumbs up because the dialogue is witty, the voice acting is well done, the world is refreshing, and there are innovations here that I enjoy. It just all ended too soon. I have a general rule - each dollar of a game should last me at least 1 hour, so a $40 game should give me at least 40 hrs of enjoyment to be worth the price. This game is therefore a ""thumbs up"" at about $10-15, but not a good value after that. I will try the custom maps and maybe change my review, but given that the best part of this game is not empire management and combat, but the characters and politics engine, it really is a better fit as a single player, story-driven game.

												This game is basically risk if politics and dragons were involved. lol.It's broken into 3 parts, where each part actually heavily effect the other 2.-King life: where you decide on policies, research technologies, and deal with your council as well as the members of your court.-Risk rip off: Build structures, recruit and deploy units, defend positions, and take over enemy territories.-Dragon based battles: When invading an enemy territory you can either send one of your generals or take control yourself(which is the better option if there's only 1 battle taking place that turn). When you take control yourself the game plays as an RTS where occasionally you pull out your dragon to get some real work done. This is unfortunately though the least compelling part of the game play._________________________________________________________________________So to why I like it,I recommend this game partially because of its genuinely good story line(which borders between serious and comical), but majorly because of how well it managed to mix the 3 phases of gameplay.For a quick example to leave you with.In king life, one of my council members suggested we employ a mandatory conscription. More of my council were in opposition and so as to not upset them(which has negative game play effects), I decided not to go ahead with the conscription. This however meant I didn't get the boost in solders the conscription would have supplied me and I was stuck on the defensive in the risk portion of the game. In combat, when I finally did advance into the closest enemy territory, the reduced number of troops had me working like a dog as the dragon.So basically the first time I had politics get in the way of the warfare, I realized they'd done a fine job with this game.

												This is an extremely difficult game to critique.Let me start with saying the game is fun, the game is very fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it and continue to enjoy it from time to time. Now, let me say as an avid fan of real time strategy the actual strategy part is nothin special, some would say abhorrant and I would almost agree with them. It IS a strategy game but an incredibly simple one, and not in a good way. There isn't much to it other than spam units and zerg rush capture points, which does involve strategy but in the same way a sandwich involves bread. Very simple, little depth, and not a huge amount of strategy.Alot of people don't care about the units they command, some people only play certain factions for the bonuses or the way they fight and so on. I, personally can't really enjoy a game unless I like the aethetics, so units in an RTS are a HUGE part for me and I probably just won't ever consider playing an entire faction just because I hate the way the units look. That said, I don't like the units in the game. I understand what they were going for, but it's weird and kind of dumb. Had what your entire army is assembled of been special units, I might be alright with it, but ALL OF YOUR UNITS ARE WALKERS. Every single one, and it's BORING. Really really really boring. The blimps and airships are fine, but ALL of the land units are so unbelievably dull and boring.Map design in this game is quite fun. Had this game been a bit strategic, it would be a classic. Bottlenecks, choke points, high ground, the works. While fights are typically decided by face smashing zergs together, over all battles are decided by who manipulates the map. Speaking of maps, there's a campaign map. And, yes I do like campaign maps. There's not a vast collection of campaign maps to choose from, but it's forgiveable. The Campaign map in Dragon Commader is actually quite good. It's design and style is fun and makes you feel like an emporer moving his pawns about the field. It's got some depth that doesn't leave much to be desired. Wassat? You said Dragons? You sayYou say you Dragons? Yes, you can be a Dragon. You wanna be a Dragon? Cause you can be a dragon.Wassat? You wanna know if it's fun?You're a Dragon.You fly around at hyperspeed and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up with fire and acid.What do you want me to say? You're a dragon. Yes, it is fun.This is all fun, but there's more. There's an almost Elder Scrolls, rpg social aspect to this game. There's a whole thing with you getting a princess and all kinds of♥♥♥♥♥♥and ♥♥♥♥ you I married the Dwarf you're jealous. That's what we call a run-on sentence. One of the things that's very enjoyable is the ability to make decisions within your Empire. This means that, on top of conquering other empires, you get to feel more like it's your empire slowly devouring the world. And these decisions make small, but sometimes noticeable changes to your empire. Yes, I allowed public nudity and for Elves to be industrially cremated for the purpose of Imp nukes to be mass produced.Should you buy it?Can you tell me another game that allows you to create a Elvish Holocaust for the sole purpose of producing Imp warheads to level entire cities while you, a dragon with a giant jetpack, swoops overhead melting everything with acid and brimstone?

Posted: June 7, 2016
												This game took alot of joy and pain when i played it.  let me explain quickly why you should get something else.1) the single player is too short with zero replay value2) the RTS parts of the game are basicly ended before you can use the dragon, or if you cant multi task you can esially loose when your in dragon form.3) the game is too repetative to really play for long periods of time even multiplayer.points explained1- with only 3 campaign fights in the game, and even on hard settings the AI is way too defensive and slow at building troops you can esially win with steamrolling.  battles can be auto or you can play them, but in the end I always ended up autoing them due to it was too slow and uninteresting.2- Dragon form takes about 2 mins before you can summon and the AI sends in units and you have to send units to fight them, so unless your starting units can fight and have at least a standstill you will loose before you can use your trump card and the selling point of the game.3- Seems like there are only a handfull of maps and they are all the same, a few lanes lead to bases that you fight for control its really just a summon as many units as you can and when you kill the enimies wave you push for 1 base then setup defense again.Multiplayer does add the enimies having dragons as well, but still just the same battles just one more aspect to them. I really loved the game when I started it,  the non battle antics of your fallowers are amazing.  as well as the well thought out princess paths.  Only down side is that it tends to be either slow or repetitive so once you play the game a few times you basic will only keep playing for achievements.  Also since the game was abandoned early after release many of the issues where never addresses, and no real DLC was released.  I love Divinity games, but this would have to be the black sheep of there releases by far.  So much potential waisted.			"

												The game itself isn't bad.  Though it can improve on a few areas.The good points are the characters, game decisions, the battle map and the story.For one all the characters are like a cross of Steam Punk with Fantacy.  I loved the Dwarven Ambassador with a wolf belt across his back with a gold pocket watch in his vest.  As well as the Lizard man who played a well educated gentleman, complete with a monicole and ego.  The Princess were all hot, even the Undead princess (don't judge me).  Each one came complete with a backstory to include elements for a story development.  These game choices did have an effect in the game, I will point that out.  The more a race liked you, then if you owened land with that race, they would support your war effort.  The War Map was like Total War meets Risk.  Ever spot of territory gave a bonus to gold, race, research and troop production.  The way the A.I. handles itself there is a level of strategy involved.The means of RTS were unique, the only resource were the population of the map.  Generated by a specific building type.  Plus to get the building to amass new troops (Infantry, Tanks, Naval, Airships) you capture a building plot then tell it to build that specific building.  The negative points however were things like the overal design of RTS combat, the dragon controls.The RTS element felt more like a zerg rush mixed with Rock, Paper, Sissors.  In the end I would just amass a huge army of varied types and let them flood into the enemy stronghold.Not too mention the designs of the troops were very poor, imo.  Nothing unique to stnd out.  Everything was Steam Punk themed, yet everything looked like it was made out of wood and 'magic'.  the only cool troop types were the blimps and the naval ships.The dragon controls took some getting use to.  Though as a Dragon, you can only fly and breath fire.  I was hoping for more abilities like going Godzilla on a base.  Or even just kicking around the enemy troops.  But you're restricted to flying and fire breath.  In summation, the game is not at all bad, it has possibilities to be improved upon.  But the story and game are relatively short.  I got the game and beat it in 3 days.  That's b/c I learned to farm gold and strategy cards.  It deserves a 3 out of 5, though in stead of a thumbs up I give it a side ways hand wave ""meh"".			"

												When I played through this game for the first time, I auto-battled everything on the easiest difficulty setting, never bothering with the dragon gameplay simply because that wasn't the reason I bought this game. I found out about this after going through some of Angry Joe's earlier reviews and this games story and choices are what appealed to me. The Dragon Commander to me wasn't the all-powerful god of the battlefield this game makes your player character out to be; instead he was an intimidating figure given the title of emperor far more concerned about building up his kingdom's political system and keeping as many people as possible happy. Many would say I wasn't playing the game right but trust me when I say that this game was quite simply one of the most enjoyable interactive story games I had played in a while and eventually when I get the chance, I'm looking forward to seeing what other outcomes for the characters there are within this intriguing package as it's almost two different games combined into a single experience.

												It's essentially single player only, as Multiplayer's completely dead, and there's no modding/custom maps or anything. Single player's pretty entertaining though. It's essentially a politics simulator that makes you choose between every single controversial issue you can think of, sprinkled with some drama (a waifu simulator). Oh and there's this part where you conquer the world. I guess there's also the RTS part, but you can pretty much skip it if you want (even though I guess it's meant to be half of the game). This is a beautiful game, decent sound track and entertaining story dragged down by what appears to be budget issues (a lot of the stuff that was meant to be in the game was cut). I recommend it for a playthrough or two, but that's about it. Shame, because this game had a lot of potential. Get it on sale if you want to get it, as €40 for 10 hours of campaign at most (I stalled to see more political choices basically) without multiplayer is even worse pricing than CoD at this point.

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is an interesting game.  It's part RTS, part empire sim, part card game, and all these mechanics play well together.  That being said, the game's core content seems to be the combat system which is engaging as the novelty of being a dragon with a jet pack doesn't fade quickly. The scenarios are rather unispired though and I found myself skipping many battles later in the game.  Aside from that, the only flaw I can say the game has is a far too heavy handed approach of introducing real world political topics into the game.  Issues such as same sex marriage, universal healthcare, etc, all show up in the game with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  There's some designer bias in these topics but, for the most part, each decision is given as having pros and cons.   Ultimately the decision-making at these junctures are a bit jarring from the fantasy aesthitic the rest of the game presents and I can't help but feel the game would be better off without, or with at least more fantasy inspired controversy.   All-in-all the game is great fun and beautiful to look at but mediocre combat scenarios and blatently obvious political topic insertions hold the game back.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander allows you to play in one of three ways, Campaign Mode, Custom Campaign, and Skirmish. You can select one of three dragons, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Visually the game looks both beautiful and amazing. It has a very modern look with great colors and attention to detail. Much like the total war series, Divinity: Dragon Commander uses a combination of Turn based strategy, and real-time strategy. Players can research abilities, talk to NPC's, and such, much like you would in an RPG. You then move on to the turn-based portion of play where you can select your units, move, construct, etc; Finally, when it comes to actual battles, you can use real-time strategy, or allow the battle to auto-resolve. As far as the story for Divinity: Dragon Commander, it takes place long before the other games in the series, making it a prequel. The story seems interesting as you must go to war to destroy demonic technology. The RPG portion of the game is static however, and does not allow you to move around in first person, which is a downer, because it looks fantastic. All in all it is an interesting game, combining a lot of different elements, with a decent story and beautiful visuals.			"

												The characters and voice acting are top notch.  Flying around with the dragon and roasting units is good fun too.  Unfortunately, the main game is not really that entertaining.  The units all have special abilities, but it's nigh impossible to micromanage them all and use them effectively (unless you're a computer).  Also the army and building management is really unusable in dragon mode so you either fight with the army or with the dragon.  After a while I got tired of the battle and just fought them all automatically just to get to the end.			"

												May be not a blockbuster, but a solid 7/10 game. There is some story (good looking, but not engaging enought to replay with different outcomes), some strategy (5/10 sadly) and (surprise!) some dragon flying (selling point here). Some parts could have been better, but a decent way to pass a weekend.			"

												Dragon Commander throws so many game styles and systems together that it is a little overwhelming at the start. It takes an hour or two to wrap ones head around it all. The balance of the game deteriorates the further you get into it as I found on my play-through on Normal difficulty.  It was still a very fun experience because you continuously master all of the systems and use them to utterly destroy your opponents.Everyone has been touting the game's characters and the political decisions you make based on their proposals. This is by far the best part of the game. Decision making is interesting because it often rewards you even if you thought there could have been severe detriments to your empire. Great writing and voice acting overall.The real time strategy (rts) portion of this game has a learning curve. If you have ever played an rts that relies on heavy hotkey usage like Starcraft, you should be able to master it very quickly. The best part of the rts is playing as the dragon and gaining advantages on the AI by using it to pick off units or obliterate groups with the end game abilities. There are a lot of unit abilities you can use to gain advantages as well. Two that I recommend are the warlock meteor and the trooper's spoils of war.The one main problem with the rts portion of the game is that if you have a greater than 60%+ chance to win, the battle boils down to selecting all of your units and attacking the enemy base right at the start. At that point I just started using the Auto-Resolve system whereby the Generals conduct battles automatically similar to the board game RISK. Unlike RISK, though, I've never had a significantly larger force lose because of dice rolls...Maps where you have 50% or less chance of winning actually take some strategy to beat, but the AI has flaws in its behavior that are exploitable, especially with the dragon. If you have less than 20% chance to win, then you might as well retreat and come back at a later turn.Overall it is a good thing that the game lets you skip useless or tedious battles.			"

												Fun turn based strategy game.  I enjoyed playing it when it didn’t crash. Fun characters and choices. Issues in game are similar to real life issues (ex: legalizing weed, gay marriage, eco-friendly issues, etc..) and you get to make whatever choice you want. You even get to choose a bride. Fun fun. However, the one big negative draw on the game is that during turns you can play only one battle regardless of how many are on the map. So if on a turn you invade 2 provinces and get invaded in 1, you have to choose which to play and hope the computer can take care of the other two. This sucks a lot because like most turn base strategies with RTS maps you do way better than the computer. So either you hope when the computer plays you way outnumber the other team so your percentage is up. You can also let a general help in one battle regardless of how many generals you have.  Even though I have 6 generals only 1 general gets to help in 1 battle and the other battles get no general at all. The other 5 generals just sit there I guess. This puts a kink in many strategies because you really have to prepare before you do a major offensive. Even though that was a long description, which I am sure doesn’t make sense, the game is still pretty fun. However, for me the crashing became too much and I didn’t finish it. I recommend the game if its super cheap. Other than that you could probably get a better game which is similar (minus being a dragon) for a better price.Pros- Customize the dragon you play (i.e. pick your spells)- Fun choices - Cute characters- Fun achievementsCons- Game crashes a lot- Can only play one battle even though the game may have several. - Overly simplistic battles (personal preference) "

												I'm fairly certain StarCraft 2 used some of the elements in this game to make it more appealing.I bought this game on sale thinking for the price it was seemed worth it. The RTS/first person action as well as the RPG elements in the game drew my attention this way. I got a lot more than a hybrid game. If someone is looking for a game to occupy their time with a ludicrous amount of content, this is it. The game layout is simple was done extremely well, which makes it easy to pick up and play.  You start off in a diplomacy room, with a bunch of different species with completely different opinions. There are many diplomats and generals that are on your main ship where you command who are there to offer advice. You can see other rooms such as your throne room (when you eventually choose a wife), research rooms, and diplomatic rooms. The dialogue itself in this game is top notch, but for some players it may be overbearing. Animations were done carefully and creatively. Some diplomats, while others were talking, would make gestures in the back. When dealing with the varying diplomatic races, you have to be careful in accepting certain laws. While some diplomats will side with the legislation, others will oppose it. Those races who oppose it, your diplomatic popularity among them will be effected due to the decision. These decisions (such as instating conscription) have direct effect on you strategy, or even your gold. Generals will also have their say and may need your intervention. On the Raven (or the mother ship), the player can decide which units to unlock (through research points) or spend those points to unlock special abilities for the dragon. Like the dragon, certain units have special abilities that can turn opponents into a lady bug (why they chose that I'm not sure). Cards play sometimes a vital part within the game. Some cards disturb opponent villages, while other cards will enable you to deploy more units within a battle. The battle RTS scheme mixed in with turns (on the main strategic map) makes the game unique. I wish other developers would look to expand their horizons in this fashion. They took it even further as to give you your own dragon to control while your units fight. After you tend to diplomatic situations, you go to the strategic map room (or the bridge). You can make or move units, as well as play strategic cards to help your struggle. If an enemy has an abundance of a certain unit, cards exist to inhibit movement of certain units. Other cards exist to boost your war party, or a boost to your economy. Once the turn is ended by the player, the computers make their moves and battles. The player observes as they plan their actions. When the battles are available, the player must choose whether to send (and pay) a general to command battle or run the war themselves. By the player choosing to fight here (the dragon commander), the player may not fight in another location as their general is left up to the task. Due to that, the games decisions can be a bit rough over time as you may run the risk of losing an area if you are not proper with your battle decisions. This is a exemplary feature in game. I find the game play overall to be a simplified version of an RTS, but none the less is fun. There are no real buildings to build in random locations, rather the building foundations are given on the map and the player needs to approach them in proximity to control it. Only by having control may a player build shortly after. Calling your Dragon into battle is cool but really requires someone to read the controls or you end up button mashing everything trying to call it in (F1-F3 buttons). I find there was a good balance put into battling, planning (on the main map), as well as the diplomatic side of what's going on on the ship. The game feels well balanced. The battles may lack for some, but others will enjoy the simplistic approach.The amount of visual effects in this game are astounding. Menu's you would find otherwise stagnant, always have something going on in the background. The characters themselves in game have awesome animations and everything from them to the environment was carefully drawn. There is no shortage of graphics here. Sounds are fulfilling and explosion sounds are varying. The dragon attack sounds may get annoying after playing a few times. Music was also extremely well done. I think when you get immersed into a game, you start feeling it's full effects when the music plays to it's tune.Overall I thought it was fun, not the best RTS out there, but gives players a different experience! If you support game diversity, and like RTS and sort of FPS mixed together, this may be for you. I would also recommend playing on easy first because damn can this game get hard. I would say that this should be a game on everyone's library (for a proper price of course :).For future DDC games, please incorporate the ability to control one of your units! When you die, you automatically jump to another unit! Also, having generals by your side is a neat feature, especially when it comes to assignment who to fight a battle. Perhaps add RPG elements so the generals are more dynamic in abilities than static. It would add another depth to the game. Also, try to get more people playing multiplayer! RATING : solid 8/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B- Overall  BScreenShots : The first thing you will see when starting campaignWhat is must feel like being the presidentAt the start of a new turn, you get a quick update of what is happening around Rivellon and your diplomatic popularityThere are no supply depots to up the unit limit, rather there is a set population you can only work withYou can bring in your dragon into battle and help your units by deploying specials to inhibit the enemiesA view of what a neutral foundation would look like (no dragon in this screenshot, only units)You can command your units and fight with your dragon simultaneouslyThe potential wives I get to pick from. Really makes one think how they come up with the character designsThe game does a really good job in mimicking real life headlinesOne of the Dwarven diplomats trying to put on his charmSome potential wives have different abilities they can contribute to your empireApparently, if you're going to party in Rivellon make sure it's with the elvesI really hope he means what he says "

												This game could have been far better. First time I was in a battle with my dragon I failed. Horribly.I wasn't given a chance to ease into combat. I was thrown into the combat situation and no explanation what stuff did. The game didn't show, explain or make me understand what was going on. I did enjoy the RPG elements. The goblin where I could upgrade units. The magician to upgrade the dragon. The council to make decisions and the politics. Where one commander didn't like you and changed his mind after a few battles. Stuff like that great. But other than that the game was not for me.I would have enjoyed to have a more strategic way of fighting. Would be cool if each zone needed to be taken over by creating a base rather than just killing off the enemies with some RNG mechanic. I didn't like the game much at all combat wise which is the main part of the game. Thus I won't recommend it. Flying the dragon was awesome, but everything else was not.If you like RNG (Random Number Generation) games, RPG ish and politics, maybe this game is for you.			"

												While I do love a good many things about this game, it has some rather glaring flaws. The look of this game is excellent, the characters are interesting, and the mixture of rpg and turn-based strategy elements blend nicely in many regards. That's where my compliments end.First off this game does not seem to have a pause button of any sort (Keyboard, game ui, nothing) when you are fighting the actual battles. The controls in dragon form are also rather weird in my opinion. Your dragon alos doesn't really play as big of a role in battle as one would thing. While it can help turn the tide in some cases, you are often better building regular units and dumping research into them instead of your dragon. I get this as a balance, but I expected something a bit more impressive considering it's one of the main focuses for the game.Sadly, the combat is also a bit boring after awhile. You see it less as a battle of two or more armies and more as a battle between blobs. Often your best bet is to just bull rush your enemy and kill his small initial force if possible or turtle until they can no longer rebuild units.  As a rts game, I have to say that is sucks. Which is sad since that makes up most of the game. If you can get past that, then feel free to try it.			"

												Overall: 3/5Verdict: Get it on sale if you do want it. Gameplay was average. Story was alright. Newspapers are a blast. Liked-Newspaper headlines were entertaining and hilarious-Varied characters-Oversimplified political choices and ramificationsDisliked-RTS part never felt fun to the point that I just turned it down to easy to get through those parts and get back to the story. -Oversimplified political choices and ramifications-No imp spousal choiceOverall, the story and interactions are fun. The gameplay to me was boring. The game has a mechanic that allows you to earn cards that can affect the world map and individual battles when used. You can gain them through story choices and by making certain buildings on your territory tiles. They were interesting at first but as the game went on I found the ones to affect the world map tiles of no particular use. As for the ones that can affect individual battles they were ok. I was either in way over my head or overwhelmed the enemy. Some battles where you are outnumbered can be equalized by the use of said cards but required me to actively oversee the battle. I'm not a fan of the capture this location on the map in order to choose what building to make mechanic. Never seemed right to me in any game. Seeing newspaper headlines after I made political choices was a downright hoot. The choices you have to make with the generals are passingly interesting as it affects the type of person the are/can become. For example there is a lizardman who believes his race are superior to every other and belittles everyone else. Your choices keep him that way or soften it. These type of choices also apply to your choice of spouse of which there are 5. Each are interesting in their own way but the undead choice has the most varied storyline. I wish there was a more indepth side story aspect that allowed me to play out more of these conversations better than, should X do this or this?  "

												Given all the different genres mashed up into this game: real time strategy, strategic board game, and conversation driven political sim, I was ready to forgive this game for each portion being weaker than any dedicated single genre title.Even then this game falls short. I got it on sale for $25 and still feel ripped off. $10 would be the max.The strategic board and RTS are shoddy and awful (again, I went into this not expecting it to be the next Starcraft). They wouldn't even be good as free flash games.So that leaves the conversational political sim. The political support you get for different decisions ends up not mattering. The support you get from each race only affects battle you manually resolve (maximum of one battle per turn) and even then it only affects your max army size which is never a limiting factor.So you're left with only reading the conversations for the dialog. This is probably the strongest area of the game, but not enough to justify the whole thing. The voice acting is uniformly excellent (surprising, giving how they skimped on the gameplay portions), and some of the characters are entertaining.But then the cracks start showing. All the political decisions are based on current political topics, but they don't even bother throwing on a layer of clever satire so it all comes off as preachy and break the immersion (would a general involved in a world wide war of genocide really care about coming out of the closet?). Heck, I'm a donating, card carrying member of the ACLU and even I found this game to be simplistic leftist preaching. Some the political views the game preaches are downright disturbing. The ""good"" path has you encouraging vigilante murder of people with backwards bigoted opinions, and eliminating due process fair trials for anyone accused of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It feels like the game was written by Tumblr users eager to shred the bill of rights in the name of a twisted form of social justice.In the end, the only redeeming aspects of the game are some of the conversations. I recommend you save your money and your time (the RTS and strategic gameplay is really really awful) and just go watch all the conversations up on Youtube.			"

												The thing about Divinity Dragon Commander is it NOT a bad game, it just isn't a very good one. Everything it does, it does mediocre. It has trouble finding a true audience because if you take each of it's elements, RTS, Turn-based Strategy Maps, Unit Upgrades, Dynamic Story Progression, Politics, etc. you can easily find a better game that outmatches this one in every aspect. The real downer is that this is the only game I know of of it's kind. You'd be hard pressed to find a game that combines all of these amazing elements into one game, it's just such a pity that they didn't put more effort into them because then it would be amazing.The Real-Time Strategy battles are very bland, the map, units, and buildings are not exciting to look at, and battles are just very uninteresting exchanges of little fireballs. The ""strategy"" element is virtually non-existent, it encourages Zerg tactics of just building fast and attacking fast. There's no sense of ""going your own pace"", the way the battles are set up, if you don't push hard early on you'll lose whatever tactical advantage you may have.Using your dragon avatar in battle is very novel, but unfortunately it stops as being just a novelty, it rarely impacts the battle in a significant enough way and as the game progresses it becomes more of a tool to prevent enemy dragons from wrecking your own troops rather than an advantage you have over your enemies.The political RPG aspect has some shine to it as each character is interesting, well animated, and has a real sense of personality and their own agenda. It however falls flat as you realize that most choices you make are between two arbitrary extremes that will please one side but not another, forcing you to make decisions more on which factions you want to appease than on your own personal agenda.Finally the Turn-based tactical map is also very bland and even less interesting to look at than the first Total War game (Shogun). You can do very little, limited to building a single thing per turn, and deciding which territory to move your troops between. It's not bad per se, but basically comes down to very basic chess, moving your units between where you need a defensive line and where you expect there to be an enemy vulnerability.All in all it's not a bad game but it's very middle of the road. I can't really reccomend it to anyone but I don't want to bash it because it did take a big risk in doing what it did, combining multiple elements into a single game idea, and I personally feel it could work well if each element was given more. As it stands, it's a great concept with bland uninspired execution, but is one I feel could be done well.If you must get it, I would suggest waiting until it's on sale.			"

												Tries to mash together several different gameplay styles, but ultimately all feel very shallow. The RTS part has little variety as all sides have mirrored units. As the dragon, too few of the skills are useful and it's difficult to utilize your units.For the strategy section, the luck of the cards you get has far too much influence. Hint: Have lots of Mercenary cards.  And for the political, you get to make 2D political choices (With moral brow-beating by the writers) with a diverse cast such as: The Sexual stereotypes! Obvious lesbian and the man-hater. The Religious stereotypes! Religion-hating scientist and♥♥♥♥♥♥condoning zealot. The Political stereotypes! The greedy capitalist who loves to tax himself and the high-horse liberal. And the Social stereotypes! Sheltered girl and business-only lawyer lady.

As for the combat, honestly I couldn't get my dragon to even fight properly, and aside from the dragon the combat feels really boring, this is no command and conquer, it's very thin on the ground, not many units and fairly repetitive.

												Time for another mini-review.This time Dragon Commander gets the ""honour"" of being reviewed, as usual it'll be split up between gameplay and game itself.So, for those that don't know the game at all, a quick summary: You're the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son of the previous king. Said king got murdered by his own sons and daughters because he became an incompetent, weak-willed wimp. Now the lands are tossed into civil war, and that's where you come in. The court mage tells you to ""go and conquer the world, good luck kid."" Oh, and he gives you an airship that houses a demon. The game itself revolves around three chapters that tell the tale of your success. In two of the three chapters you fight your sibs, and the final chapter is you versus the demon.The game itself plays around capturing territories in a way that kind of looks like a cross between Risk and Total-War series, in which you build/get armies and move them across the board. Combat is fought either via autoresolve or manual RTS-esque battles.Now, gameplay.Good points:Dilemmas: The dilemmas are easy to understand, are of import even today and all advisors give well fleshed out reasons as to why you should vote ""yay"" or ""nay"". In addition, managing people's opinions of you does pay off during battles!Autoresolve is pretty fair, your generals cost a bit and can only be used once a turn. Quite a neat feature and in this case it's wholly possible to fairly beat the game using only autoresolve!Research is important, can be tailored to play-style and holds a key role in winning.Cards. If you've ever played Risk you know that getting a good few cards can change the game. Here the cards hold a little bit of a different role, giving you in-battle bonusses, giving the enemy in-battle negatives, giving you extra soldiers for an easy autoresolve or build/destroy on the campaign map. You'll learn to love the cards.Bad points:Manually fought battles are zerg rushes. If you don't know what zerg rushes are? Shame on you. Still, don't expect much tactical play in manual games aside from perhaps going overboard with the dragon.AI is...disappointing.There has been quite some debate about chapter 3 being overly difficult or not, but allow me to say that chapter 2 can be exploited infinitely to end up with nigh-infinite gold and all research done, taking out a large chunk of difficulty.Dragon form. You can either exploit the living toodles out of it, or never end up using it at all. I personally used the dragon occasionally to heal big armies, but never found that I could not possibly win without using the dragon.(And I autoresolved a lot).Non-gameplay related.Good:Well-fleshed out story, laced with humorous interactions, plethora of diverging storylines and choices to be made. For fans of  Mass Effect-like choice options, rejoice!You get to pick a princess, what more is there to like? In all seriousness: Princess storylines are a matter of opinion, some love them but there are those that hate them too. I personally liked the storylines I've had, but it's up to you to judge in the end.Character interaction is well-thought, you'll probably come to care about at the least a few of the side characters, and with such a plethora of personalities there's bound to be someone you like.Bad:Dilemmas at times end up being a bit to complicated to just say ""Yay"" or ""Nay"" to, and at times are worded in a way that while you actually agree with the thought behind it, the way it's set up makes you disagree.Reputation with factions are going to be near-maxed regardless of initial choices, unless you literally take EVERY opportunity to disagree with one particular faction. During my first playthrough I found myself initially disagreeing with the undead a lot, but ended up with 80% approval with them by the end of chapter 2, even though I torpedo'd almost all of their proposals.It's a bit of a debatable point, as I personally disagree, but there are quite a few people that dislike some of the side character storylines. While I do not share their opinion, I feel that I'd be remiss if I were not to warn you that there ARE people that do not like said storylines, and you might end up being one of them.Personal verdict:I had a blast with this game, well worth what I paid for it.7.5 out of 10, and a recommendation for people that like a mix between a RPG and a tactical game.

												Even on sale this was a waste of money.DC is obivously geared toward the impacts (political/strategic) of your decisions.  Decisions that are most readily made through dialogue.  The dialogue is smooth and the voice acting is very well done, but the game seems to skimp on the unavoidable RTS function in order to emphasize the 'consequence of decision' mechanisms.  This makes the combat feel very casual and inconsequential.  Maybe this sounds like the game for you? Well..For better or for worse, I'm a gamer that thrives on story development, seeing the consequences of my decisions, affecting the game world, and thereby tailoring my experience as I desire.  So.. what am I complaining about?  I should love DC!  ..what I don't care for is a scripted experience that offers the illusion of choice.. Particularly when that type of functionality is the obvious focus of the title.  Unfortunately, this is about all that Dragon Commander offers.The problems that arise which require the use of the dialogue functions, the political issues offered up for consideration, and most importantly, the black and white decisions you are forced to choose between, (let me emphasize ""forced,""  as not making a decision is akin to selecting a predetermined default) all serve a political agenda.  This game is a kind of ""righting the wrongs"" of the world, setting the great (perceived) injustices of our time straight and then scolding/punishing the player who would dare to take an opposing point of view.. with dragons..In short;  if you're a large government minded, radical feminist, who moonlights as an LGBT advocate.  DC is for you.The rest of us are better off steering clear, there's just not much else going on here.			"

												I really wasn't expecting much out of this game considering I've played their RPG, but wow this game is great. This game combines RTS, Card Collecting, Risk/Civ type take over the world, some RPG elements, and a FANTASTIC political system all into one game. The RTS bit is not super complicated and does not require as much strategy as I would have liked, but that is not the best part of this game and is still enjoyable. The best part of the game is talking to the ambassadors of the races in your kingdom and making choices which makes some factions hate you and other love you. The amount of Dialouge and different ways the story can branch out is astonishing. If you like great story/fantastic voice acting and being able to destroy armies as a dragon with a jetpack, you will love this game.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is a fun cross between real-time strategy, turned based risk-style strategy, and fantasy role playing game. If you enjoy Warhammer 40K or Red Alert, the Total War series, the original Divinity games, or in short RPG or strategy games you should like it. It has exciting music, good character progression for the player and a great cast of varied characters, a setting which is part steampunk and part fantasy which the art team did well, fun punchy gameplay, and lots of decision making which affects the story (good but short). $50 dollars is probably overpriced unless you are really wealthy but at the $7.20 at the moment it's a bargain.

												You're a general who can turn into a dragon - how is this not amazing? Sadly by doing so in a fairly rubbish 'tactical' mini game that serves as a Zerg rush simulator and little else - which is positively criminal given how beautiful the strategic game can be and how utterly glorious the princesses and the councillors are. I just wish a little of the obvious love spent on them had been invested in the actual tactical side of things.			"

Don't come in looking for an in-depth experience in any of those, but for a neat, well-polished if on the simple combination of them all. I love the game, but I expected too much of it when I first bought it and that lead to disappointment.  Think of it as a neat side game to the main series that combines elements of multiple genres into a simple, well-polished package. If it's on sale, it's definitely worth the pickup.			"

If you think those units ruin the game for you, don't use them.I really enjoy the game and I certainly recommend it!			"

												Summary:+ The fantasy designs are pleasing to the eye and something I wish I could dive more into./  If you are looking for a good game to be your first RTS, you might want to consider something else.- The political system is pretty poor and almost uninspiring.So, let me state something really important up front: before playing this game I had never played Risk nor had I played any real-time strategy games with the closest thing being Advance Wars (which was a turn-based strategy,) but I had a love for politics at the time. And I've heard from another critic that this game is actually pretty easy, so I figured this might be a great ""baby's first real-time strategy game.""Oh no, it wasn't. Sadly, I don't think I can get into any real details as to why it was not a fun first RTS on the account that I'm not experienced in the genre. What I did get hung up a lot though is that I couldn't quite figure out what certain units beat other units. Sure, there was an optional tutorial I took, but it felt like I've missed a lot of stuff. And I have no clue about the Risk-like over world as I did better in a real game of Risk than with Dragon Commander. So if you are like me with no experience in RTS, I would advise something else.And then there is the politics. In case you haven't noticed, this is set in a fantasy world. You actually play as a character who can shapeshift between a human and a dragon (hence the name.) And the fantasy aspects are actually enjoyable with at least 6 various races, with a few going beyond the standard Tolkien races, and each having different quirks and interests such as the skeletons being very religious because it was the gods who brought them back to life and goblins having a love for inventing and discovering. So we have a world where we could have some pretty interesting view points on different subjects.But instead, we get stereotypes of different political stances. Going from left to right as they are at the table: a religious fundie, a liberal, a big business owner, a libertarian, and a scientist who seems to believe that the ends justify the means (okay, so the last one is a bit more interesting.) Now pick a political topic: you know where everyone stands and it is shallow. No one ever has an opinion that goes against their stereotype. The dwarf will never say, ""You know what, the brewery industry makes a lot of money, even in war, so I think we can shoulder a bit more taxation to help rebuild cities."" Nor will the elf state, ""This addictive substance is harmful to society and, while it goes against my belief of personal freedoms, I believe that it should be outlawed."" That's it. There's no upset, no one is quite unsure, and no one seems capable of admitting that their opponents do have a ground. This is a fantasy story with you actually playing as a dragon, and they have one of the most boring politics.And the cherry on top of the politics is that the responses never use any of the fantasy elements for something a bit more interesting. At no point does someone bring up the subject of doing something like providing berserk weapons or something. ""Oh they will help our fighters for sure."" ""But wait! The side effects are really harsh, we can't do this!"" Or maybe we should draft those who are magically inclined. ""Yes! They will make our standing army much better!"" ""No, we can't! It should be their choice to fight for us or not!"" I just made those two things up, but instead the game has you discussing about stuff like legalizing (fantasy) marijuana, national healthcare, and taxes. Even worse is the game seems to be unaware of the fantasy elements. No, liberal elf, I would not advise ignoring the talking skeleton who's best explanation of why he and his kind exists is because the gods have decided to give them a second chance at life. And I know the gods exists and can be angry because I have apparently crossed them off before. So if you want to legalize gay marriage, either explain why said skeletons are alive or pull out your religious documents and start debating the skeleton guy on his turf. Because you are talking to a dragon on a fly fortress, not some guy in a building painted all white.			"

												Unlike many other reviewers, I actually enjoyed the strategy aspects, though they still aren't as good as the (beautifully written) politics aspect. Are the two strategy aspects as difficult or deeply involving as other strategy games? Not once you figure out what you're doing (which you should figure out after a couple battles). But what the game does, it does well: The Risk-like segment is pretty easy once you learn how it works but can still hurt you badly if you try to ignore it. Figuring out what units work best with you straegies iis essential here.The RTS segment requires quick decisions and alot of tactical thinking (though it isn't as complex as other games) unless you either bring in a massive army from the Risk-stage or learn how to use the dragon. If you learn how to use the dragon well and upgrade him appropriately, he can wipe out small armies singlehandedly (but what could you expect from a dragon than to burn everything?).The politics stage is the best part. It is, again, beautifully written, and its light satire is not only believable for the world it's in, but also manages to be humorous at times.  However, my only complaint is also in this section: I rarely felt the effects of my decisions on the battlefield. The support aspect of it is very obvious (and painful) if you really♥♥♥♥♥♥off any of the races- since your support with a race (how much they like you) determines how many units you can deploy during an RTS battle in their territory,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a race off (30% or less support) will make those battles much harder. The other aspects of decisions, such as consequences that reduce your empire's income, I rarely felt- they are usually so easily counter-balanced during the Risk phase that I could usually undo the consequences of a decision by conquering 1 territory.This game's definately a 9/10 for me. It's not the most complex, involving, or challenging strategy game ever, but what it sets out to do, it does extremely well.Long live the Dragon!!!			"

												I purchased this game on sale for 6 dollars, but even so I cannot recommend it. I feel like this game doesn't know what it wants to be.The voice acting is great and really makes you think you're in a well written rpg. The strategy element is somewhat lacking, and the battles are quite similar from the early game even into the final stages of the game. Dragon Commander tried to tie in both RTS and RPG elements, but in doing so fell short of being a good RTS or a good RPG. For $40 this game should have been better. You can beat the main campaign in about 7 hours and feel no need to go back to it at all. I purchased it for $6 and still don't recommend it. I know that sounds harsh, but this game really let me down.Also.- The game will crash on you in battles. In order to fix this you must lower your settings to minimum even if your graphics card can run the game on max settings. Also, you must download the 2 files listed ont  he dev's discussion post. If you do these two things the game runs fine. I just don't like that I have a modern gaming PC and I need to do all of this extra stuff just to get the game to work. "

												Being a dragon in an RTS/RPG is really neat.  Graphics are good.  Stories and characters are enjoyable.  Not too cartoony/hokey either.  I like the handling of military and political issues.  Early on I find it difficult to manage gold wisely buying troops vs. having a reserve to pay your generals if you happen to need them.  I really enjoy the many mini-video clips to show you how different units and abilities works so you can better understand them before you invest in them.  That greatly reduces the trial & error aspect of skill trees of these kinds of games.The voice of demon Corvus (Alastair Parker) sounds very similar to The Mouth of Sauron (Don Messick) in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King movie.I do wish that homosexuality wasn't as significant of a political theme - I'm barely into Act 2 and already have had like 4 turns of NPC dialogs about the issue.  Political issues are understandably familiar so that you can get into it more easily. Realistically any political decision you make will thrill and anger a portion of your population.  Dealing with religious zealot Undead, hippy eco-communist Elves, greedy capitalist Dwarves, elitist Lizardmen, and ... (something I haven't quite figured out) Imps can wear you down if you just care about conquest and not governance.  Your decisions do affect bonus and penalties in the RTS part of the game.So far the only replayability of this game lies in different role-playing choices of your wife, different decisions on political issues, and different levels of cooperation with the demon Corvus.

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is a Real-Time strategy, turn based and third-person shooter. Larian Studios developed and published the game on the 6th August 2013.The game itself is unique in that it blends politics into your strategy. You can either play single player and skirmish on ten different maps for the classic RTS game or play on a board (much like Risk) where you move your units to conquer territories and gain resources. The turn-based strategy was very amusing because you could decide whether to fight in the battle yourself (dragon) or have one of your generals auto-resolve the fight. Each one giving a higher rate of success depending on the terrian and units used. But the biggest selling point in this game is the dragon, you can control three different dragons that has varies specialties such as melee, magic or a mix of both. The game does very well to give you a feeling of empowerment when you use the dragon, some of the late game abilities can turn into battles whether you rain fire or boost your troops with buffs.However, this game has it's flaws. One of which is the micro-management required to use both dragon and unit abilities. For example: Warlocks (the flying blimps) have several abilities and damage the enemy. While in dragon form, you're very limited to managing your soldiers. Either selecting troops in the area or all troops. This makes it difficult to then combine both unit abilities and your own.The game also has a beautiful narrative, characters and the political system and dialogue on this game really makes this game feel like an epic fantasy along with the OST used. Some choices you make politically can hinder or boost your performance in turn-based and real-time because of the support you have in the region.TL;DR Summery;Pros - 1. Fantastic Character development. Edmund for example was my favourite.2. Political system is very diverse, often challenging your morality vs strategic importance. 3. The OSD is very under-rated in this game, the OST does a great job of giving you the epic fantasy awe.4. Voice acting in this was outstanding, Corvus was a character that had a very chilling/demon-like voice.5. Mechanics of the game are fluent. The game allows you to research upgrades for your troops and dragon, very fun in particular in turn-based.6. The dragon adds amazing replayability value to your battles, giving you the sense of empowerment and fun as you rain down fire and brimstone.Cons - 1. Story falls short, with the maps being recycled in turn for bigger board maps.2. Micro-management between varies troops and your dragon offers difficult learning curve for new players.3. Troops are the same for all factions. No variety in troops often means you'll be spamming units for cannon fodder until you have enough resources to build high-tier troops. 4. The dragon brings balancing issues in multiplayer games, with some games lasting merely minutes from dragon rushing. 5. The RTS element of the game could use work with the same maps being played over again, the camera angle feels rigid and the dragon could use more fluent movement. Unable to fluently fly except for one direction makes it hard to dog-fight other dragons.For example: Using jet-pack thrusters can only mean you travel in one specific direction. You are unable to turn while using jet-pack thrusters made me feel very immobile while casting abilities and auto-attacks.Rating 7-8/10 Highly unique RTS game that blends both epic fantasy and politics with a refreshing sense of originality.

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is a difficult game to understand without playing. Most games these days fit very neatly into established genres--genres so well established that in many cases we know every there is to know about a game's mechanics and systems before we even start playing. Dragon Commander, however, is a different animal entirely.But to label Dragon Commander a hybrid-genre game is to do Dragon Commander a great disservice. While Dragon Commander is composed of elements drawn from a half-dozen or so different genres, it deftly synthesizes those elements to create something truly unique and utterly satisfying.  Imagine a fast-paced RTS game where battles unfold in minutes rather than hours, where maps are small and contained so that every single choke point matters, where how quickly you move and react to the battlefield matter just as much or more than your tactical insights. Where, at any point in the game, you can transform into a dragon and wreak havok on your enemies as though it were a 3rd-person flight combat game.Dragon Commander far from perfect. But, for all its flaws, it's one of the most deeply engaging and entertaining RTS games I've played in my life. The last RTS I found this engaging or innovative was probably Rise of Nations, way back when.			"

												I got this game for 10 dollars on sale and I'm glad I didn't spend more. it's not a BAD game, but it's not a good game. as a concept the game's intrigueing, combineing RTS with strategic turn based with some roleplayish elements too. unfortunatly this game doesn't do any of those particularly well. if you  want a RTS game with a stratigcic turn based campaign map, I reccomend going with the total war series or something instead. the RP aspects mostly involve playing politics, which could have been a lot of fun, but unfortunatly after the first choice (which related to conscription.  something many nations have debated during war time) the issues are transparently modern, you know it's rediculas when you're fighting a civil war for the future of the world entire, and the elves are trying to get you to legalize gay marriage. while the undead (who earlier had tried to convince you to marry a skelliton girl) are protesting because marriage is about pro-creation. the decisions re these issues are always pretty binary too. with no possiable idea of a sensable comprimise. the long and short of it is people who actually LIKE politics will find it overly simple and lacking nuiance. Long and short props to the devs for the unique and intreasting idea behind this game. but it just fell short of execution			"

												This is definately a game that's hard to correctly give judgement to, as it is practially three games in one; but here goes:(Spoilers ahead)The story itself, is fairly straight forward: You are a half-dragon, one of the heirs to the throne that has not gone insane. Your job is to unite the world under your banner, and oust your siblings. A good ol' Monarchy story. Nothing really unique, nothing really special. Only one real plot twist, and its not exactly a twist.The characters are fairly interesting, and truly fill in what they were set out to fill. There's a hardy, loud, angry, general. There's an arrogant to a fault general. There's a lesiban general, and there's a general who hates men. Each one truly does feel like each seperate, but I could not for the life of me connect to them. Each one is so far into their niche, that being that far into it IS the only way to connect to them. The choices you make (I believe three each) for them will give them bonus stats and somewhat change their character to a degree, but even beyond that, I still found myself hating all but one of them.The Politicans are also very well fit characters; you have the Religious Undead, The Nature Loving Elves, The Money Loving Dwarves, Logical Lizards, and Tinkering Imps. Each unique and each bring up propositions that connect to them...most of which I found myself voting downard. Several that were proposed would only benefit that race, and all the other's would disagree with them (Two for the Undead, One for the Elves, Three for the Dwarves, Two for the Lizards, and Three for the Imps). Several major choices (Equal pay for the sexes, gay marriage, etc.), aren't even presented, but can only have your word in them by talking to certain people who are in the areas (Bridge and Bar are the most). I think in total I only passed about four or five things presented, and ended up rejecting the rest.Defining the spouse is a little tricky as I have only completed one playthrough and therefore only had one wife. Therefore I feel as though I cannot truly review this, but I can say I feel the dialouge for the Lizard Spouse is far too short (Only was about three events).(Plot Twist Spoilers)Corvus (to me) was the only really interesting character, as being a giant demon head wired to the ship. I do plan on doing a quick replay (as I had skipped Corvus' options in case of moral drawbacks), to find out what he offers, but seeing how the game itself became fairly easy when he was revealed...I'm not expecting much.Now for the gameplayOne part is a Risk type map, and a VERY small part of it is the actual RTS.You can only take phyiscal control of one battle per turn, so unless you boil each turn to one fight (highly unlikely in chapter two), then you won't be playing a RTS, but rather an easy version of Risk. You can only use one general as well per turn, so even with the choice of four, you only get the option once. If you've already used your RTS turn, and a general; then you're left the the basic % chance of victory presented to you.The Risk map is very simple and rather easy, as all it litterally is is massing an army and take over each area per turn. There is no real strategy, as every fight (including the RTS), becomes a slugfest, that you will ended up winning most of the time.For the RTS battles, are fairly easy as well. Chances are the only real trouble you will have are the Capitol battles, and even then there are only three enemies you have to be careful of: Warlocks, Imp Fighters, and Anti-Air Missles (which your opponent will build in their main base 75% of the time). Even though the game warns you that as a dragon form you can't take on whole armies at once....but you really can. After obtaining about four certain skills you can whipe armies off the map and then fly off and solo a base. I found myself simple flying over an army, fearing it, using a pillar of flame to burn them, then Eye of Patriarch to remove another army. Any damage taken is removed with either the pillar of healing or the self heal spell.Despite all my gripings I did enjoy it, as it is visually appealing, and some of the characters lines did make me laugh. Obviously it had my attention enough to beat it and obtain all of the units and dragon abilities.All in all however, I do not recommend Divinity: Dragon Commander. Is it worth its $40 price tag? No. Worth it on sale however? Yes. Just make sure you have the space for it, because the visual appeal is most of what it has going for it.			"

You are limited to leading one combat per turn and the rest are based on majority of units attacking/defending by your generals. You get married and each wife has a unique storyline which is interesting, but I did not want to run throgh the global combat a second play through just for the wifes sake. $10-15 is the most I would recommend to pay.

												A very strange game, but a good one. It tries to be several things at once -- an action RPG, a turn-based strategy game, an RTS, an empire management simulator -- but while you'd think being a jack of all trades and master of none would be a bad thing, the multiple layers combine to become more than the sum of their parts and present a very compelling experience.It's also got a pretty strong story, gorgeous graphics, and a nice sense of humour that isn't too in your face.Plus, turning into a dragon and blasting the enemy's base into oblivion is pretty damn awesome.

												Bought it on the Steam Sale in Oct 2015. I think everyone ought to try this game. It's got so many interesting features, ranging from the Strategic Cards, Dragon Abilities, tech trees to diplomatic relations. Definitely worth trying.PROS1. Interesting GameIt is both familiar and refreshing to see the Dragon Commander's characters. The standard Tolkien lineup of human, dwarf, elf, dragon and undead lets you expect certain stereotypes of the races. However, the slight tweaks and nuances of the races do make the game more interesting. E.g. The technical Imps (instead of goblins), the religious Undead (instead of a holy Ecclesiarch) and the business-like Dwarves (instead of a helmet and pickaxe rune monger).2. Strategic Map and Combat MapKudos to Larian Studios. I love the Strategic Overview and the Combat Map. The difference between macro and micro is so distinct, yet the game plays so smoothly. On the Strategic Map, the little chess pieces that you load onto the transports are so beautiful.3. Character InteractionsToo few to count but it is pretty interesting to hear the conversations and complaints. 4. The RavenI love the command ship. So cool. I wish I could interact with some interesting parts of the ship. E.g. The main batteries / canons, buying a cloaking module for the ship, watching the crew have conversations and gossip.5. Interaction ChoicesI was hoping for a 4 choice table whenever a tough decision has to be made. It would be arranged in a square with 2 options on top and 2 options below. Some options might even be greyed out due to one not fulfilling certain conditions.6. Political IntrigueA bit more juicy please. So far, I get the very dry and stale decisions which can be decided with a ""flip-a-coin"" contest.7. Combat MapLove the scroll out view. Reminds me of Supreme Commander. Love not having to do Bob-the-BuilderCONS1. Jetpack DragonThere is a Chinese saying ""Drawing legs on a snake"". It is a proverb of two boys who competed to draw a snake. One was so good at art, he drew a complete snake in matter of seconds. However, in his arrogance, he added legs to the snake. This, of course, lost him the competition.2. Dragon CardsI do not like having to bind the Dragon Card Skill from the list of skills to the 0-9 keys, if there is excess space. It should be default. Imagine if you missed binding the key, you would have wasted a Dragon card for no reason.3. ShipsThere are some maps where you have 2 water bodies split by a land mass. This causes the reinforcements that you bring in to be stuck on the wrong side of the land mass, preventing you from hitting the enemy base. I think the name of the map might have been 2v2 Dragon Pass (I might be wrong on this). I know that naval units are hard to balance with the water body maps but I think you can solve it with water teleportation / Dragon transport.4. Campaign Act IIt is odd but I think that prolonging Act I is more beneficial to the player than cutting it short. If you end Act I too fast, you won't have enough research to bring over to Act II. Thus, it's actually beenficial to conquer the whole map in Act I and drag it on until you complete enough dragon/unit research.5. Combat MapThe view and orientation are horrible. The minimap and the orientation do not move in tandem. E.g. You move forward and the minimap moves right.6. Units It's kind of boring attacking the same units that you have. I can see that both sides have a 1. Trooper2. Grenadier3. Warlock4. Shaman5. Hunter6. Zeppelin7. Imp Fighter8. Transport9. Ironclad10. Dreadnaught11. Devastator12. Bombing Balloon13. ArmourMore asymmetry please. Add more unique units to the list? I was expecting each faction to add 13 unique units to each side, at the very least. That way, you would get 39 different units, not counting unique buildings. There's a defunct game called Naval Warfare that you could take the units from.7. No TutorialYou have to guess that you right click on the map in order to build units. You have to guess that it's a turn based game and you end your turn by clicking on the hourglass.8. Unintuitive KeysQ for Auto-attack? Why not A?SUGGESTIONS1. Racial Superweapons / SuperpowersFor example, if you became extremely friendly with the Imps, you could create a super Imp Air Fortress. If you became extremely friendly with the Elves, you could get use rare Land Magic of the Elves.2. Overcoming the Limitations of WaterScrew physics, you already have a jetpack dragon. Here's a list.a. Airship DreadnaughtsThey used to be limited by water, now they fly.b. Giant Air Transports for ShipsNow you can move ships from one water body to another, even across mountains. You could even use the Dragon.c. Ship TeleportationThe Hunter can already teleport. Why not teleport the ships? If this reduces the uniqueness of the Hunter, how about a whirlpool effect, just like Heroes of Might and Magic?3. Enemy GeneralsYou have 4. Maybe you can capture / convince more to your side?4. Arguments between the Diplomats and the GeneralsHow would that pan out?5. Unit BackstoryI know that this might sound strange but it helps to flesh out the story but engaging with a story character that signifies a certain unit. E.g. Admiral Stukov from Starcraft (Battlecruiser), Sarah Kerrigan from Starcraft (Ghost)6. Certain Major Strategic Locations for the CampaignEvery location on the strategic map is more or less the same, save for the Capital. Perhaps, Larian could include some areas where there are certain special buildings or quests? These maps would then have a special map designed just for campaign purposes. The current method of using a multiplayer map isn't as exciting.7. Co-Op CampaignThis game can be played with friends vs AI. Could you add that function in?8. Multiplayer AlliesAs far as I understand, there is no such option available. Each player takes their own position.			"

												Usually i write long and detailed reviews in games, but this time i will make an exception.There is just one thing i want to say.Control system in battle is awful. I mean not just awful, it is one of the worst i've ever seen in a game in my entire life.I enjoyed much the Divinity series and played them all (except Beyond Divinity, that's just miserable), but anyway i really wanted to play this chapter even if i'm not really an RTS player, but with this control system, no way.Sorry Larian, for me this time it's a thumb down. You can't mix the cotnrols of a shooter with an RTS play style like you did and pretend it works. It just doesn't.			"

												It's worth buying on sale if you are into politics games. It has interesting characters, good shake of funny lines here and there. Unfortunatelly not many of them are explored into greater depth, but they've got me intrigued and wanting for more.The map strategy part is kinda fun. But it's simple. And I would have prefered if it was the main combat part because: The RTS part is horrid and I am avoiding it every step of the game through auto-resolve. That whole part just doesn't fit with the rest and is obnoxious click-fest. But successfully ignoring it, I am indeed having lots of fun with this game.BUT!IT HAS A DRAGON WITH A JETPACK!			"

												So this game consist of 3 layer. 1) Real-time strategy battles2) 4X-y turn based global map 3) Stracraft2 style inter-mission pick-a-room-pick-a-person talky partThe RTS part is a subpar crap. Any strategy game with this bad battles would be doomed to die unnoticed. The strategic map is way more interesting in all aspects. This is the place where some actual strategy takes place. Yet still it is nothing to call home about. So why do I recommend this game? The talking part, seemingly least crucial one. Or it would be in any other game of this type. This game however put all the effort here and it shows. You will be rewarded with a rather wide cast of excellently written and voiced characters, with many little personal and even interpersonal stories wherein you take a part. You will also have to make many political decision on certain topic on which every race representative and often many of your enerals has opinion of their own. It helps it a great deal that this game takes itself very lightly so you are presented with many hilarious situations unlike anywhere else. I mean, you get to pick a wife. And she could be an undead skeleton. With bone cancer. Sold!			"

You have to manage your armies, research, and politics which both change how well you do in battle.  It's amazing and I highly recommend it.			"

												If you are unsure about this game, buy it. The game is excellent. Combines C&C Rts combat with cards system to use in and out of combat, and as a real story with character development. For me is a piece of art this game.9/10Not perfect because of some aspects of the RTS combat, like units design. Other than that is almost perfect.			"

												I learned about Divinity: Dragon Commander when I was talking to a friend about Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds. I loved that game, but it won't run on modern hardware. I really wanted a new game that combines a turn based strategic map and a real-time strategy. This has that. It also has political elements, and you can turn into a dragon. Plus, it's Steampunk, so I was 100% sold. So I loved the setup and the execution almost lives up to it. Because there are four different games in one, each version isn't as in-depth as it would be if that were the sole focus of the game. I really like the RTS game and the turn-based strategy helps with researching more units / upgrades, or getting cards to swing close fights. However, the actual strategy map is rather simplistic. I would have liked it if I could have more control over the starting setup for the RTS by building more buildings on the strategy map, for example. On a side note, there were some things cut from the final game due to deadlines, like more dragon customization (You still get to pick from one of three starting dragons.) more princesses, being able to play as a female dragon, etc. I really hope the game sold well enough to warrant a sequel, because I would love a more in-depth version of this game.That said, I recommend buying it.

												Unique game with mix of RTS, RPG, turn based conquest for territory and character interactions with cause and consequence. In RTS part of the game you control your army, capture important points on the battlefield that grant you bonuses and ability to produce units, and most importantly reign devastation from sky in your dragon form. Game has good visuals, great voice acting and humor, great character design and story. When time passes, characters really grow on you. Some may find it basic and simple, but it's not that easy if you don't know what you're doing on the battlefield.			"

												Everyone else is writing their weak♥♥♥♥♥reviews for games they nominated, and obviously I have to join in.My original canidate for the award of ""Best use of a farm animal"" was going to be Petz Horsez 2. There's many obvious reasons for that, if the name alone didn't give it away.But let's hop back a bit, back in time, and consider when dragons used to be farm bred pets for powerful wizards and sorcerers. Dragon Commander shoves you into the deep innerworkings of a dragon-commanded government, with all the intriciate meddlings and requirements of day to day excercises of power to diplomatic relations between other dragons. Your tasked with uniting the kingdom under your banner, with your huge dragon dong. A monumental task for those without dragon blood coursing their veins, but ho, you've got the one up on them now doncha.You take to the skies on an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥in' zepplin, accompanied by a large counsel of diplomats from the five races of the kingdoms, and also filled with your own generals to manage your armies and provide tactical warfare support, and let us of course not forget that you are provided with a mate OF YOUR CHOOSING from four of the available racial divisions. No, they may not be dragons, but they're hot enough to ignore the unfortunate circumstances. The archetypes they fill will provide you with warm fuzzy feelings within your cold, hard scales, and ensure that you will be a happy dragon in the near future when your succession of rule is complete. It's down to you to govern the land you conquer from the other dragons (who are also your siblings btw, how bout that for some political intrigue) and assert yourself as the one true dragon of the land. The world is your treasure hoard, and you'll protect it with all of your might. With a jetpack.Despite being capable of flying your engineers and magical wizard advisor said that just WASN'T, ENOUGH. You need that jetpack to soar even faster then predicted, and fireballs to be enchanted by leveling up your blood by sacrificing people and political decisions as well. There are even darker secrets to behold the deeper you go, and all the while you'll be blasting so much♥♥♥♥♥you won't know what to screw with your dragon dong. (now that I think about it, furries would like this)Dragons. They're the best.			"

												Greetings again.  I really want to like this game; it is composed of all my favorite things in an RTS:  Campaign, Hero Units, a conquest map and RPG elements.  It is just done so poorly it is impossible to really enjoy it.  I Started playing again today (I beat the campaign sometime ago) and unfortunately it is just as boring as I remember.RTS Fundamentals:  Base building is almost non-existing to anyone familiar with RTS mechanics, the base building itself isn’t bad actually.  Sometimes I want a more unit focused game or more of a ‘Brawler RTS’.  The bases are fairly simple, think of them as outposts on a map and having nearby units captures a plot that you can build a specific type of unit.  Not terrible as I said, but the issue is that the simplicity of the units make the game feel more like a Tower Defense and less like an RTS; units die and are built at speeds accentuating this style.  The maps are fairly linear feeling more like the lanes of (again) a Tower Defense.  Yes, there are sometimes side avenues but they are fairly obvious.   One thing I will say is that the controls handle well and have all the modern quality of life improvements needed.  Overall, the RTS function of this game is boring and nothing we haven’t seen before.RPG / Hero Unit:  This again, isn’t bad. You can research things (like in most RTS) either from building (in skirmish) or in the research screen (for campaign).  These upgrades are fun and enjoyable, especially on the campaign.  You also get to control ‘You’ which is actually a dragon and for the most part it isn’t bad, the issue is that the AI almost immediately auto attacks you and I felt that I really couldn’t provide more than hit and run attacks during big battles, and yes you do need to be involved in those big battles or they grind quickly to a halt with the before mentioned Tower Defense Style.Story / Campaign:  Not bad, they do a decent job at giving you interesting and well voiced characters, feeling similar to StarCraft 2 campaign but the culture, species and ships make you long for something that isn’t represented in the game itself, where are my undead units, dwarven units or anything that doesn’t feel like a robot marching along.  The campaign mechanics of conquest is kind of boring, eventually you end up just weighting a game so far in your favor that you steamroll any map before the enemy can build anything and the conquest style movements leave flanks open to having the same done to you, eventually it drags to a halt and you end up having to slowly build back up.  I eventually just started running around with a ‘kill team’ that increased my auto-chances to a foregone conclusion and found myself playing risk instead of an RTS.Overall, this game has everything I love in an RTS, but they forgot about the fundamentals and fun before the Developers starting adding the entire nuance.  I’d avoid it if were you, after attempting to replay the campaign I got an hour or two into and just said “No, I’d rather play a game I don’t like over playing a game I want to love.”  Maybe your experience will be different.

												The game is difficult to recommend, due to its really subpar RTS component (which is really 50% rock-paper-scissors, 50% zerg rush), but man the dragon component is really satisfying and overall the game has an enormous amount of character and flavour (politics and negotation was really fun). If that component was brushed up, this game would be just about perfect. I had a lot of fun with it, but I don't really see myself revisiting it very often. I'd recommend it only on the caveat that you're willing to overlook its glaring flaws in the RTS side of things, because they've done everything else exceptionally well.			"

Pros:+ Political system+ You can turn into a dragon+ Interesting plot+ Extensive romance subplots (multiple possible arcs for each princess)+ No but really, you can marry a skeleton, and its the absolute craziest romance plot ever+ Imps are great+ Entertaining characters, each of whom have interactions with the other charactersCons:- RTS combat is... bad.  Very very bad.- Dragon mode is simplistic; shoot fireballs at things until they go boom.- Exploitable overworld map structureOverall: Dragon Commander is a fun game, but it fails at being fun as a RTS game, which was its intended purpose.  The political system is meant to supplement the RTS, but ultimately ends up being more entertaining.  The overworld has plenty of exploitable loopholes that make cheese-winning the game easy.  However, the complex plot and the entertaining characters make the game fun, and there are enough vastly different story arcs for each princess that multiple playthroughs is a necessity.  Other reviews have said it, I'll say it too - Larian got confused about what they wanted to do, and made a visual novel/dating sim with some really lousy RTS thrown in.  But the plots are so good they actually make up for the game's shortcomings.Bottom Line: Probably not worth $40, but for all it's flaws, the game is still fun.  The RTS portion is awful, but the political and character plot arcs redeem the game and give it phenomenal replay value.  Buy the game on sale for the great story.			"

												This review contains of three parts:1. What game is it actually/what does it contain?2. How do I feel about certain parts of it?3. Summary.1. Divinity : Dragon CommanderThis game is an interesting mixture of turn-based strategy, RTS with a possibility of turning to TPP and continuing the fight, and to some degree a Empire builder. I will use few comparisions in order to describe it for newcommers. If You liked Total War series for the turn based strategy and the possibility to command Your troops on a RTS battlefield, but You found both parts a bit too complex this game may just fit Your taste. How is the RTS part handling? Well it can be compared to Warhammer 40K Dawn of War, but again in a more simplistic way. The places on which You build are not only limited but also fixed, and the whole game is basing on the land controll with one resource involved. The number of units avaiable is smaller and there are no fraction specyfic units. That doesn't mean that there is no micro/macro cntroll involved. In fact the 'rock-paper-scissors' mechanic seems fair enough and even the most low tech units remain usable in late-campagin matches thanks to their special abilities. Storyline? Hymmm. I can't say I did not sink into it, but it really is a rather linear story with one ending. Again I would compare it to the Witcher style of handling the storyline. You can do various things by anwsering many choices. There are no good anwsers as each option rewards ou with something and punishes You with a other one. But ultimately there are three acts, that lead the main storyline. You can either win the campagin or loose it. There is also a random campagin mode that takes out only one part of the story and gives You a chance of discovering personal plots and endings without the need to go through the same three maps again. Multiplayer. As it stands the UI is a bit lacking at the moment but still the matches give a lot of fun. With dragons fighting in the skies while micro managing their armies and macro managing the factories the RTS gets really interesting. 2. My personal opinion:Here I must add that I have a tendency of not finishing the games, campagins wtc. but I have not only finished this campagin but also restarted it immedietly afterwards. The gameplay may be similar, but the decisionmaking behind it with the rewards system and 'Wife and Generals stories' kept me interested. After second playthrough I got a bit tired of the same three maps and AI that was not challenging on the strategical side(the RTS battles on hard mode are a different story) and I switched to a random campagin. During that playthrough I actually know that I will probably play one more Story-mode campagin and probably some random-mode campagins. Now I am slowly turning to multiplayer. There is an additional AI level but I am more interested in the on-board campagins and RTS battles without dragons. I find dragon fights interesting and probably I will set up a camapagin with friends'n'dragoons soon. Yet the Research and card systems work well enough to support the strategical struggle and create a 'Each-battle-is-different' RTS expeirence. Shame though that strategical AI is often lacking and I can loose battles only when I go to (!) RTS mode or I hold myself back, so that I won't benefit from the 'snowball effect' so much. I must admit that I did not test the Insane AI since it is not in the sotry/random mode campagins. One of my firends  that is not good at strategy/RTS games, have also mantioned that for him this game is challenging and he needed few tries to pass the story campagin on easy - but he managed to do so in the end. I would make an assumption that thanks to the differences in AI difficulty levels and Dragon Form, this game may be playable for those who want more of the TPP action and decision making and are not so keen on the strategy part. On the contrary, the UI of the Multiplayer lobby is not all that great, even though it has a fair share of options. There are bugs like a mismatching subtitle for the voice of a character or a ever pressed 'scroll your cards right' button. Sometimes I learn about game mechanics the hard way, this game really could use more tooltips or a build-in manual. I also heard opinions that the RTS battles may last long and may have a stalemate nature(for more info check out TotalBiscuit on YT). I can only respond with: it is your decision about what techs you buy and your micro/macro skill during the battle that may cause that. And it's up to your next turn decisions to shift the balance once again. Yes, it may happen but You can always retreat'n'tech or micro more;] In the end I am satisfied with my purchase and I would like to support the developer more, by buying the Imperial edition and maybe some DLC. Yet it is not as easy as it sounds. Shame.Summary(28.11.2013r.):+RTS is playable without the dragons.+No 'Right or wrong' decisions in the Empire Builder game part.+Huge replayability - random campagin modes.+Multiplayer has many options and may be used to play a more traditional type of game.+Enjoyable end-game / multiplayer competitivness.+Most parts of the game are voluntary, You can pass on the decision making, dragon handling or the RTS parts if You want to.+The steam guide. Proper name: Manual.+Great, intuitive controls. They work in RTS and Dragon mode.+Nicely done in-game tutorials.+Victorian/Steampunk/Feundal/Fantasy realm. Sometimes serous sometimes funny.+The game does not fear to swear or touch very serious real life problems.+Patches that seem to be a response to community feedback occuring.+Enjoyable, unconventional soundtrack.+In game sounds.+System requirements.+RTS map balance.-/+Some strategy maps are tad unbalanced.-/+Every side has the same units and techs.-No AI dragons.-UI may be a bit lacking - in the multiplayer especially.-Not so easy to find players for multi outside the friends/community groups.-For a Strategy games player the Turn-based AI is not challenging on the hardest difficulty.-No political decisions / wife mechanics / general bonuses in multi.-Bugs are easy to spot(no serious ones noted), some crashes may occur.-Few multiplayer maps.-Too little RTS maps - they get repeated often in campagin.-More than one community spot. Sometimes it is hard to find information like ""How to upgrade your copy to Imperial edition"" or how to help the develepor improve the game or is He intending to patch and expand this title.-Not enough fluff/fan/fanpage resources - I am very serious about it.-No official manual.

												I am sorry to give this game a negative recommendation, it does have good elements, trouble is, its core is not good. The game has an interesting mix of RPG, turn-based strategy, RTS and combat. RPG elements are well done, characters are colourful and the issues discussed seem well presented and real. Unfortunately they are just a background to the conquest game. This is done in turns on a Risk-like map, unfortunately it has complexity close to Risk too... When you go into combat you get an RTS during which you can transform into a dragon to blast things away. Actually the dragon part is really, really fun, probably the best part of the game, sadly RTS part suffers from the same problems as the strategic map - it is really, really simplistic. That's understandable as parts of it you will spend as a dragon, but you can't win this way, ignoring the RTS combat and it is really bland... Dragon Commander has too much put together, some of these elements are really good, some really bad, trouble is, a game like this needs to get everything right to be really enjoyable.			"

												Looking at the ambition of this game no one could be faulted for fearing it to be a jack of all trades and master of none. However, that is not the case at all. The individual parts complement each other fantastically, and come together to form a diverse and engaging gameplay experience the like of which hasn't been seen in years, maybe decades.The characters in story mode deserve special mention -- they are more fleshed out and entertaining than in many highly rated RPGs. It's also suprising how well polished the game is despite the great variety of mechanics and modes present.Dragon Commander will make you laugh with its playful, but biting, treatment of political issues, it will make you clench your teeth and try to salvage the strategic situation after a hard-fought tactical loss, and it will give you the satisfaction of burning your enemies to cinder as a dragon.Now buy it. Buy two.			"

												I really hoped that this game would be fun, but nothing seemed to come together and it turned out to be really boring.  Strategically, it bases you in an airship where you make political and research decisions (think Starcraft II) and the campaign uses a Risk-type board to choose battles (almost an exact rip-off of Rise of Nations).  The 'political' decisions that you make influence your relationships with the races under your control, but the decisions are so heavy-handed, unrelated to what is going on and ridiculously unsuited to a fantasy world that this entire part of the game feels like it was thrown in after the game was completed.  The actual combat is among the most generic I've seen in a RTS game. Most battles against the computer are either fighting off the equivelent of a zerg rush for the entire battle, or the computer getting stuck and letting you roll over them.  My best guess is that they rushed the battle design and AI because the big selling point was being able to join the battles yourself as a dragon instead.  In actual implementation, the dragon is interesting a few times, but more often than not I felt it was actually an annoyance.  Controls aren't great, but at times it is overpowered to the extent that you can take on a whole army by yourself.  Overall, there are a vast number of better options available on Steam.			"

Product received for free
												Its very enjoyable game a great mix of RTS and RPG. I really like political choices u have to make and how they affect gameplay. Im not big fan of RTS but in this game im enjoying it very much. The dragon form in RTS battles is very clever invention and handy in dire situations. Story is predictable but still good enough to keep u interested.			"

												This is a good game. The RTS is fun, and gathring recruits (resources) to build units is handled well. The units themselves are quite nice. The turn-based part is cute, as all of the people working for you have things to say. There are Generals, Politicians, an Engineer, a gnarly old Wizard and eventually a Princess to marry. You get to make decisions that have far reaching repercussions. The graphics are nice and the music is also pretty good. The music changes from turn to turn. The story itself is neat. Most RTS just put you on a map and say 'go conquer'. In Dragon Commander the story is half the fun!I played on casual my first time through and it was a ton of fun. Flying the Dragon is neat. Pretty good game.			"

												so let me start this by saying i dont like stratagy games, but this is one of the greatest games i have played for a long time.first, let it be known that you have probably misinterprited the name to mean the lesser of the two images you get from it. you are not one who commands dragons, you ARE a dragon that commands. this game feels off compared to the previous divinity games. like either the old dev team is gone or they decided that they didnt want to make clunky rpgs and instead wanted to make a stratagy game that was pure awsome. first the story, your father was the emporer of all the land and has sevral children after bringing the world to peace, including you but you were not with his wife, you were with a dragoness lover of his and lived with her as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child. until one day your half brothers rose up and killed your father for the throne and now war over the kingdom. the court mage came to you, to give you an army to join the fight because you are the only one who was not involved in the murder so in his eyes you are the only one worthy of the throne, awsomness to follow.as an example of its greatness it has a morale choice system that has you make REAL morale choices. unlike most game that give you the choice of sing the children to sleep or burn down their house. there are five factions backing you and every now and then the come to you with a problem one would like solved. but this may upset the others, for example one that happens early is the elven ambasaror comes to you asking if he can make goverment healthcare for dwarfs (insert Obama joke here) who do very dangorus jobs that dont pay well, so if a miner looses his leg in a cave in now he cant feed his faimly. well if you do it... now the dwarfs dont like you... your wasting gold that should be used for the war effort to help people not involved in the war. not only that but now you take a pemenent penalty to all gold production in exchange for popularity with the people. almost every choice the game throws at you has real rewards and concequences like this.as for the combat itself. you earn points for having HQ buildings and use them to build troops, turrets, buildings and summoning your dragon. the troop system is really balanced, if you attack with only your strongest troop you will loose quickly because a balanced squad will work better than a bunch of tanks. also i have only played on normal but i notice the AI seems to be limited to one action at a time, to make it more like your fighting another person rather than an AI (might change at higher difficulty but its hard enough for me at normal.)oh and i promised you playing a dragon didnt i? oh i didnt not lie, at any time when you are controling battle and have 20 recrutment points you can press the R key and TRANSFORM you have one hundredpercent control of your flight and attacks, getting sevral abilites to help like sabatoging buildings, boosting your own troops and raining acid breath upon your foes. unfortunatly the coolest aspect is also where its weakpoint sits. when you transform the controls for your troops change due to now the mouse is used to aim and fire and the num keys are your dragon abilites. the problem is the controls change so radicly that its almost imposible to try to control them fully  when flying at their side. i have looked at the controls sevral times and still cant figure out how to do anything but select and move troops, even though i know you can select friendly buildings and build troops as a dragon.the last thing to talk about is the world itself, i have always hated generic fantasy and the fact that exists make me cry at night, but i love this world even though its very close to generic fantasy. its due to the fact that it takes the sterotypes of elfs and dwarfs and evolve them. dwarfs still have a scottish accent, love booze, and gold. but they dont look like dwarfs, every one is very well groomed, dressed in the fanciest silks and furs money can buy and indulge in every expensive habit available. they USE the gold, not hoard it.so lets go over this again, if you love stratagy, you will love this game, if you dont, you will love this game, if you hate fun then why are you on steam?... but you problably will like this game anyway. its a complete change from the other divinity games and as far as i can tell dont even take place in the same world and if you are a fan of it that might turn you off dragon commander, but if you can look at it like an elseworld story  then hopfuly you can look past it and give it a try, i put the value of this game at a full 60 bucks out of the charged 39.99			"

												This game is a mixed bag, but it's a good game over all.It can be broken down into 3 parts: Politics, RTS, and Risk-like Strategy game.The politics part is pretty straight forward. You make choices on touchy subjects and risk alienating some races while getting the support of others. The characters are really unique and the story lines that you can follow are very entertaining, and definitely one of the highlights of the games. All the characters are memorable and have amazing voice acting. And you get to pick a wife.Also during this part of the game is a chance to unlock upgrades for your dragon. The upgrades turn you from overpowered dragon that destroys everything into an invincible god that demolishes anything it looks at. It also has upgrades for your RTS units but who cares about those when you can destroy everything yourself.Politics: 9/10 The strategy part has your maneuvering your forces along a map as you try to defeat the enemy in a large scale campaign. You decide where to move, depending on what political infuences you have in the area and how your opponent advances, and which units to build with your limited resources. You also get cards which can give you an advantage in individual fights.Also for the less RTS-inclined, you can skip the battles and just get an outcome for each fight. This is nice if you absolutely hate the RTS part, but you learn not to do that when your dragon character is part of the fight since you can easily turn a 1% chance of victory into 100% since the dragon is overpowered.Each action counts and you have to think about where you have to send each squad. You'll quickly learn just how overpowered your dragon character is and will have to decide what the best place to send him is, more than any other factor.Strategy: 6/10The RTS part is the most disappointing part of the game. I know a lot of people are interested in this game because of it. but it doesn't live up to the expectations, at least not as an RTS.If you try to play this game like a proper RTS commanding your units, you will get destroyed every single time by the AI. It is extremely difficult to outplay the AI this way, and almost never works. However, once you understand how to use your dragon powers, you only need your units to capture each area. Your dragon will destroy everything every time. It is so broken in this mode, that you will stop sending commands to your units except to send them all the way to enemy's base, and you decimate all the enemy's units while they get there.This is the least interesting part of the game since it's completely unbalanced. That said, it's always fun to blow stuff up so it's still fun in it's own way. It's just not a good RTS.RTS:  6/10  (because you can blow stuff up as a dragon mostly)Overall the game is fun to play. I haven't had a chance to play it online since I mainly just wanted to play the campaign, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The story is not the most amazing thing ever, but the characters more than make up for it. I think this game tried to do too much and was therefore mediocre at everything. Perhaps for a future installation they'll fix the shortcomings and make an amazing game.Overall rating: 7/10This is the perfect game for anyone who likes dragons, blowing stuff up, and humourous characters.You will not like this game if you are looking for a serious, balanced RTS or strategy game.

												While the game doesn't have strong replayability value due to its low amount of unique mechanics, I can definitely say I had a blast playing it through the entire singleplayer campaign. The battles were fun to lead & satisfying to win, managing to destroy enemy troops as a dragon is fun as♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and the game's art design is wonderful. My main problem was the lack of difficulty here - the battles usually come down to who brings a larger amount of tougher units, which I think are a bit unbalanced too - despite having various abilities, it's clear that a slightly pricier battleship is gazillion times more powerful than the other, lighter ship. It's rather difficult to win fights unless you create a giant army and use that for combat. ""Dragon OP, plz nerf"", the enemies would say. I think the game would be better if at some point strong anti-dragon enemies were introduced. The game also features a card system - through the game you can get various cards that can help you in battle (boosting your units, damaging enemy units, mercenaries to fight for you), help your empire grow (boost to gold for one turn) or hurt the other empire (destroy his buildings).The cherry on top of this dragon commanding cake, for me, was the political system and stories of characters on board of the ship - the generals. First, the political system - a future emperor not only has to worry about leading his units, but he also has to think of the future of his nation. Representatives of five different races live on board of your ship and will hold meetings during which you have to agree  or disagree on some of their ideas, a lot of which are valid in modern times as well - things like taxation of the church or gay rights. All races have different opinions on the issues. The system isn't big at all (quite small, in fact), but I found the issues to be rather interesting and I enjoyed pondering about my choices as I tried to keep up good relations between all the races, especially Elves and Dwarves, who usually have opposite views of discussed problems. Even though I had three races on 30%-40% approval at some point, I have to say bringing them all the way up gets easier as you progress. Your rewards are small - maintaining high relations with a specific race makes it easier to lead battles on their grounds and as a treat you can gain (or lose) bonus gold, science, motivation.Characters of the four generals serving you, which I mentioned up above, are written well and I find all of them likable, even the character of a snobby lizard who definitely wasn't meant to be liked at all. Occasionally they will ask you for help regarding political issues or situations that may affect your relationship with them, with whole races or bring small advantages / disadvantages.While the game might not be worth picking it up for its full price, I can definitely recommend it whenever it's on sale.

												As a RTS/strategy/visual novel hybrid, It's basically three thematically related games grafted to each other.  What you get out of it seems like it's strongly influenced by how deeply you delve into the RTS section.  I found the singleplayer campaign is also a bit short at 9 hours, which, while taken at a veeery leasurely pace, also intentionally excluded most of the RTS battles that would have massively padded it).Visual Novel (Shipboard diplomacy sections)I suppose the first thing I should say is the game's politics are VERY 2014 American-centric.  Thinly veiled medical MJ, sexual orientation issues, and social justice themes abound.  I could almost 1:1 match the races to poltical factions in US poltics as seen from a cynical 20-something.  It's so blatent that it's almost immersion breaking.  At one point you will be required to choose a wife for your arranged marriage.  Each prospective bride has a mildly branching story arc that ends in one of two conclusions, and these are somewhat better written, although not by much,  The same goes for each of your four generals, General Dudebro, General Racist Snob, General Femanazi, and General Badgirl.  While the generals all start out varying shades of unlikable, their character arcs are not quite as hamfisted as the fantasy UN.  Voice acting is competent throughout though rarely standout.  Visual Novel sections are also where you buy your RTS upgrades.Strategy (World map sections)This is the part of the game I spent the most time with.  A region map is broken up into territories where you can station units.  Each territory can have a building on it, either a factory to produce units, a mine to increase its income, or one of the other structures to give you advantage cards.  In practice, I found the mines and taverns (they give you coupon cards for free, one-battle units) to be overwhelmingly the most useful.  Minor balance issues aside, it all looked and played very competently, if extremely easy on normal.  I lingered on act 1 and act 2 to see more visual novel development when the enemy was hopelessly outmanned and maneuvered and accidentily carried the per-turn advantages of money and research forward with no penalty.  Thus Act 3 was a steamroll that never faltered and was never close.  I think the biggest problems were that the AI wasn't aggressive enough.  It allowed me to almost without exception choose my battles and only fight when I had an overwhelming advantage.  Add to that copious mercenary cards from my many taverns, and I should have bumped the difficulty to hard at least.  I feel like there should have been a hand of cards limit to avoid stockpiling.  Real Time Strategy (Burninating all the people, in their thatched roof cottages!)It's odd that the heart of the game was almost completely optional!  When a territory is contested you are presented with the option to auto-resolve it or start a RTS battle.  Any general other than the Dragon Knight auto resolves, but if you choose youself as the general, you start battle.  Then starts a pretty conventional RTS.  Bases are only constructed on pre-designated locations and only by your infantry.  You have two resources, recruits and money.  Money is required for buildings and both are required for each unit contructed.  Summoning yourself (a large dragon with a jetpack) requires recruits (I jokingly suggest you eat them to transform).  While you are flying around as a dragon, you can't issue commands and your army will only follow preissued orders.  It's all very competently done, but I never got the feeling of being an unstoppable dragon.  Mostly you pick away at units until you soak up too much damage and have to flee without having accomplished much.  Wooh...Overall, it looks like the singleplayer campaign was barely more than an extended tutorial for multiplayer. If I can find a friend with it, I might even try my hand at multiplayer.  Still, I had fun with it and will probably play it again.   I just can't help but wish they had streamlined the VN parts or required RTS more forcefully.  As it is, the three gameplay modes don't really mesh all that well and prevent the game from being truly great.			"

												Holy balls, this was on my interest list for a while, but I wasn't willing to spend the 50 dollars for it. I bought it on Steam sale and I realized I should have bought this game a while ago. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of laughs. It's more of a RTS  Bioware game. You have RTS action at times but half the time you will be spending interacting with the characters in the game. 8/10 would recomend highly.			"

												This game is weird. It's a lot of fun if you stick with it though. The various game mechanics don't feel like they mesh together well at first, but it's a lot more simple than it seems. The RTS portion of the game feels cheaply done sadly, but it's worth playing for everything else. All the characters are really engaging, and it's a lot of fun to make all the political decisions. One recent decision I've had to make involved the lizard councilwoman proposing a ban on public breastfeeding. She argued that you don't see her pulling up her skirt and laying eggs in public.			"

												The game is split into 3 parts: story and political decisions while on the airship, a risk style strategy map, and optional RTS battles where you can order troops around or directly control your dragon (with jetpack) avatar.The RTS and strategy map parts are OK but not great. They both have a little bit of a learning curve but got really easy before the third and final campaign. The RTS battles are kind of fun at first but got old quickly, so I was autoresolving all the time near the end. Not that it mattered since I managed to win every important battle while rushing the enemy capitol and barely losing anything.The sheer creativity of the artwork and writing while on the airship more than make up for that though. I can't get enough of the crazy political interactions between the 5 races ambassadors and 4 generals. You can also pick a princess and each one has their own plot so there's some room for replayability as well.Overall though I just can't not love a game where I play a half human half dragon with a jetpack, the undead are religious conservatives, armor units quote Manowar and Sir Mixalot lyrics, and I could marry a skeleton princess that wears lipstick if I wanted to.

												The RTS turned based maps mixed with third-person flying and shooting in the actual battles is great.  The RPG style it has in choosing your abilities, attributes, faction popularity and story path are also great, giving ample replayability.  Wonderful graphics are pretty much everywhere except battles and the storyline is nice if you think you will enjoy being part human, part dragon commander of an army set to take over the land.  Overall, if you aren't into RTS games this may not be for you, but if you are a long time RTS fan then this is definately worth a try.			"

												In this game, you are a commander of a steampunk airship populated with undead, goblins, lizard people, humans and feminists.You are also a dragon with a jetpack.The RTS aspect of the game can be a bit lackluster here and there, but it is overall a very fun game since the dragon parts carry it very well.The meat and bone is in the politics though, every race has their own agenda, and they very rarely agree. And it is up to you to balance it all out so you can get their trust and friendship.Buy it. This game must be bought.			"

												A hodge podge of strategy games that feels oh so very right. I enjoy the way they mesh together, and nothing feels better than turning the tides of a RTS battle that you had only 1% chance to win by turning into a dragon with a jetpack, and leveling all the non anti-air units. The strategy elements aren't hard to figure out for anyone who's played any type of RTS, and is a great game to lose some time in.The politics of this game contribute by enhancing or hampering your controlled territories by the decisions you make, plus there are factions you can either appease or essentially treat like a tiny bug by crushing their hopes of ever being significant.All the characters are interesting, and you have the ability to marry someone from each of the factions, including a lizard, a dwarf, and skeleton. I never found myself wishing for different scenarios in the game outside of the ability of diplomacy which is my only real gripe with an otherwise fantastic game.			"

But this game features diplomacy, RPG gameplay, card gameplay, action gameplay and RTS gameplay. It´s just a unique awesome game. It combines these parts so well. Only the RTS gameplay is not that good, but despite this it makes a lot of fun. Also it is worth replaying and it has a great multiplayer.			"

												this game is an absolute GEM!plus it is surely in my top 10 games of the last decade. this game is not just an RTS. in fact, if you dislike traditional PC-RTS games you could still love Dragon Commander:the mix of RTS, a map of the whole world where you wage the full-scale civil war, the RPG talking elements including the ""make-decisions-for-your-empire"" choices, 3rd-person-dragon-action, a tiny bit of enomomy and research all blend together perfect. and not to forget the ultimate ""good-or-bad"" decisions that not only affect an empire but also the immediate people around you! The answers you give will influence how your wife will become. Or the ultimate personal hapiness of some of your generals.i kinda was reminded of the early sid meiers ""pirates!"" game  which blended so many different genres so well together. Dragon Commander does the same.and if you do not like one of those mentioned elements before, you always have options to ignore those you dont like! Dont like the story part? Then play the mode without story.Dont like researching? Just start a game and give yourself enough tech-points to unlock everything in the beginning.Dont like the RTS part? Then let the battles be fought by the AI. This ""autoresolve"" works great and very balanced in this game, which is quite unique. I found that the Campaign Map rules seem to work quite similar to the rules of the ""Axis and Allies"" or ""Conquest of Nerath"" board games, so you can get much joy out of them if you are a fan of such a thing without touching the RTS part at all.What makes this game great:one reason why the mix is working that perfectly is an intriguing story and some very funny writing for the characters. this funny writing also comes into play for the political choices. i really got immersed in the story, and this is also down to the fact with all the possibilities of marriages that you have.the replayability of this game is biiiig. normally i dont touch a game again nowadays.... i am too much a veteran for that, and being grown up takes its toll on gaming time and stuff, but after finishing the campaign here, i immediatly started a second one and i cant wait to this time be a bit more ""evil"", maybe even sacrifice my wife. i had it on my radar since release but now finally bought it and i am glad i did. i salute the developers!

												Political/TBS/RTS/RPG/3rd Person Flying Dragon Action Game... it's great. TLDR at the endthe game goes through 3 phases per ""turn"".Ship Phase: you can talk to your crew, make political decisions with your counselors, upgrade your troops and dragon formTBS Phase: overworld map where you can create and move units. when your units and enemy units end up in the same region the RTS phase will begin (can be auto-resolved)RTS Phase: very basic RTS battle. capture points, build units, attack. also you can become a dragon with a jetpack and fight alongside your troops (badass)the ship phase seems to be the most polished and visually impressive. it's also where all the story is told and where you will spend most of your time. your generals will go on various missions and will argue with each other and you will then have to step in to resolve. the political decisions you make with your counselors (who represent each race: elf, undead, dwarf, imp, and lizard people) have little impact on the rest of the game but it's so entertaining to listen to all of their views regardless. you also get married at one point. the voice acting throughout this phase is probably some of the best i've heard in any game. the TBS phase is solid, it plays out like a typical turn based board game. the RTS phase is a bit janky. it's super simple and seems ""unfinished"", HOWEVER, flying around as a dragon with a jetpack breathing down fire and acid on your enemies makes up for it's jankiness. this phase can also be auto-resolved if you really don't like it. TDLR: though it tries to be a lot of genres, it's an overall simple game where you play as a badass dragon with a jetpack. also the art style, voice acting, and writing in this game are absolutely amazing and worth a playthrough alone.

												Another amazing Game From Larian Studios. Although the graphics in the combat phase are a bit lacking, it is everything you should expect from the Divinity line of games. Easy learning curve, but hard play curve. Easy is Normal, Normal is Hard, and Hard is Hard.........er. Also, a beautiful mix of 4x, map control, and RTS elements. Even though the RTS elements are extremely basic, they should not be the make or break of this game. Every decision has positive and negative effects on the game. Want to specialize with a certain race, be prepared to have lower performance when battling on a corner of the map controlled by another. Want to generalize the races, that's fine too. Just don't expect too many advantages. All in all, it is a well rounded game that I feel is under appreciated because they did not focus on any one point to shine.			"

												Quite good.  This game isn't overly, thoroughly fleshed out in its three pillars of play: narrative, world strategy, and direct unit command.  Somehow, though, what they produced in each of these pillars is just enough to enjoy, particularly when the game presents them one by one every turn.The dialogue and story really surprised me.  Its premise is intriguing, and the developments are startling.  You'll receive jarring political proposals from left and right wing factions, discover a villain in hiding right under your nose, and settle matters between squabbling generals who don't immediately have your respect.  The personalities shone through brightly and the voice acting was sufficiently hammed up for what is essentially a fantasy soap opera.  But, as stated, not entirely fleshed out.  Reaching the conclusion of any story conflict, beyond some spoken words and the occassional shadow puppetry cutscene, is abrupt and unfulfilling.  It's a real shame for all the build up, so have your imaginations ready to fill in chapter epilogues.The world map isn't overly sophisticated.  Producing units and shuffling them about the board can be satisfying if you're quick thinking.  But if you get caught up pondering your next move, like my undeveloped strategic mind will often do, you wake up and realize you're staring at something that's mostly static, with hardly a thrilling flair when battles are won or lost.  More amusing is shoving units into battle knowing your odds are poor but selecting the option to directly control the battle.This phase of gameplay gives a view and functions similar to games like StarCraft, but more like Dawn of War.  Expect to manage control points for money, build units that move in real time, and eliminate the opponent's army or base.  The battle is determined by the number of units present on the strategy map that prompts this specfic battle, and this where you can turn the odds in your favor by using your dragon form.  Out of nowhere, you can materialize a dragon onto the screen and maneuver it like a character out of a third person shooter, controlling your position and height while breathing fire onto troops or activating spells to benefit allies or cripple enemies.  If you were caught off guard on the strategy map, expect to concentrate on using the dragon form very intently.  You may have to frantically fly about avoiding ground to air fire, scorching key units, and shielding your army.  All in all, not as developed as a true real time strategy game, but mixing these elements was really fun.Honestly, this game doesn't need a huge commitment to see the appeal and it was really great to get to see different genres interwoven together into something relatable for avid game players and manageable for interested players that might not be familiar with so many titles.

												NOTE: I played this game for it's campaign only - no online play.This game is a lot of fun! It mainly plays off quite similarly to a game of risk, and you may chose to engage your enemies and fight your army against them in RTS style. I opted to auto-resolve most fights, as I find it bothersome to use unit abilities whereas the CP players will constantly be using them against you. It's not too much of a bother though... As an example, if you do not adress the cloaked units attacking you (without being revealed when they begin attacking) they will cause an amount of havoc. There are ways to easily counter this by either revealing them by taking command of the Dragon or buffing your units to detect cloaked units, but it is a bother to have to deal with that nonetheless - especially fighting uphill battles.  On a whole I ended up skipping engaging in the RTS as I found a small annoyance. If you put a massive army on enemy territory to fight them by taken command of the army - NOT ALL OF YOUR ARMY WILL BE THERE. I thought I was going to spawn in with the map basically covered in my units, turns out I had a mass of transports in the bottom corner and hardly any land units WTH? Totally ruined an awesome moment I had been looking forward to. The ability to talk to your allies inbetween commanding your army was also very enjoyable - very much like SCII. The politics was sometimes boring, at other times engaging. A very nice touch in my opinion as it puts you in the position of being a bad leader to help the war effort or be a good leader and suffer in war. Balancing your decisions in favour of certain races becomes a bit troublesome especially when the undead are such extremists they disagree with everything good. The game can sometimes be unreallistically challenging but with a strong Navy and air support you can overcome most armies quite easily. I had trouble before I realized the value of a stong Navy, after that i had very little issues. By simply stopping Transports before they reach you - you can empty an army before it reaches you. With a combo of a fast moving Air force to back you up whenever you're outmatched your base can be almost inpenetrable as long as you're shutting down certain vantage points and keeping routes to you blocked. Overall 9 or possibly 9.5/10I thoroughly enjoyed this game and even moreso as I got it on 80% sale. Buy this game when on sale and play it - it's worth your money.			"

												This game is suprisingly fun for all the reasons you wouldn't expect.  The actual combat and RTS portion is pointless and stale to the point where I universally used auto-resolve.  However the story line is great, the politics system is inventive, and the game adds up to an amazing version of the board game Risk.  At a discounted price this game is a worthwhile buy, just as long as you aren't looking forward to the RTS part of it.			"

The story was decent and the plot engaging. The cast of characters was varied and intesting.  The voice acting was suitably cheesy, but a step up from what is often on offer from the smaller developers. The RTS section was a chore, and fairly poor in my opinion.For what it is currently going for I think the value proposition is not quite there.			"

												While I enjoy the premise of the game, it boils down to a ""rinse-and-repeat"" of strategy combat scenarios on repetitive maps quickly. The tactics never change, and the political system is not what it is advertised as being; that is, expansive and meaningful, and ends up feeling too awash to lend any depth to the gameplay. It may be worth your money if it goes on sale, but be warned that the game is a ""Jack-of-all-trades, master of none (RPG+Sim+RTS)"" at this point of writing.			"

												An otherwise outstanding game ruined for the lack of a pause button. A game of vivid characters, intriguing choices, and witty writing made frustrating and utterly unenjoyable as hours of strategy are reduced to my ability to click of stuff quickly due to a totally unbalanced Auto-calculate function on the battles making it impossible to play effictively without engaging in the idiotic RTS portion of this game. I won't waste another mintue on this game, I just wish I could get my money back.			"

												First and foremost: you are a DRAGON with a JETPACK. Let that sink in for a moment.This game is part political sim, part RTS, part action, and part Risk (tm) clone. It might not be the best at any one aspect due to the Jack-of-all-trades approach it takes, but the overall experience was good. Perhaps D:DC is not $40 worth of fun for some, but I'd certainly call it a good buy when on sale for ten or twenty bucks. I've played through the main storyline campaign three times alone. I just keep coming back for more. I even bought the whole Divinity collection when it went on sale, though I haven't played through those games yet.To summarize: Dragon. Jetpack. Fun.			"

												From the product description, you get a holy grail of turn-based strategy, RTS action, and interesting diplomacy options.  Oh, you get to ride a dragon in to battle, as well.  It's a nice try, but the components just don't work.  The strategic layer is dead simple, so forget any Civ-style (or even Total War-style) manuevering.  Whoever designed the RTS evidently either hasn't played one from the last decade, or seriously decided to kick it old-school: it's all rock-paper-scissors unit-smashing blobfests that actually expects you to micro when all you can really do is mash queue buttons and ctrl-a everyone into the fray.  So that leaves the dragon part, except that you should be microing your units instead, and the diplomacy, which has some interesting writing.  Even though the mechanics of DC are different, the game reminds me off another ""mash it together and hope it sticks"" game, Space Rangers.  Lots of promise on the surface, grey tasteless mush underneath.			"

												OMG was soll man da zu sagen. ICh würde sagen das ist einfach nur hammer geil.Der Anfang ist war ziemlich schwierig und man sollte sich wirklich alles durchlesen und anhören was das Tutoriel sagt. Als Außenseiter in diesem Spiel um den Thron müsst ihr euch erst mal beweisen, denn ein paar der Generäle eures Vaters sehen in dem Drachen-Halbblut zwar den einzig sinnvollen, weil nicht komplett durchgeknallten Erben, aber geleistet habt ihr noch nichts. Das lassen euch die nur auf den ersten Blick stereotyp wirkenden Figuren deutlich wissen, während ihr euch durch die Räume eures fliegenden Flaggschiffs klickt und mit ihnen sprecht. Nach einigen Erfolgen auf dem Schlachtfeld beginnt das soziale Gefüge an Bord und im wachsenden Reich noch deutlich komplizierter zu werden. Nicht nur, dass ihr vier eigenwillige Generäle unter euch habt, alle sechs generischen Fantasy-Rassen von Zwergen, über Elfen hin zu Untoten, Gnomen und Echsen schicken ihre Vertreter. Schließlich müssen sie ja mit euch als König leben, solltet ihr Erfolg haben und da kann es nie schaden, rechtzeitig ein paar Forderungen zu stellen. Hier beginnt Divinity: Dragon Commander extrem seltsam zu werden. Und extrem cool.Vom Mix Action,RPG und Strategie denkt man eigentlich wie sich das alles vertragen kann aber das gelinkt hier richtig gut.Kurz und bündig sag ich nur :  Divinity: Dragon Commander ist mein neues Lieblingsspiel und kann wirklich mit meinen anderen 2 lieblingsspielen Warband und Skyrim mithalten und das auch in der Grafik			"

												Incredibly dull. The game makes very little attempt to explain itself and seems to be very trial and error. There are some good characters, but there are some infuriating characters that ruin the experience (one the characters insults you as soon as she meets you, then gets upset when you don't do the things she wants you to).There appears to be some resource cap for the player (but not the AI), regardless of whether you're attacking or defending, so eventually the AI can just wear you down. I might be missing something here, but the game is not really interesting enough to warrant a read through a strategy guide. I set the game to easy mode so I could just blow through it, but the game decided to change the difficulty back. It's like it's trying to get me to stop playing.All the units look like brown splodges with coloured spots on them to let you know who they belong to. Age of Empires I is easier to micro-manage.It's all style and no substance.			"

												I really, REALLY enjoyed this game. I'm a huge fan of the Divinity universe overall, so when I heard about this I had to pick it up and try it. Obviously, the Divinity game world's strongest genre is RPG, so it was interesting to hear of a RPG/Strategy hybrid set in one of my favorite RPG universes. I also love strategy games, and I love making political decisions in games...so I tried this.Some people say they were disappointed, and although I guess I can see what they were disappointed in (the game touches upon so many aspects of a few great genres, so it doesn't delve too deep into any of them), this game is a hybrid of sorts, and is very interesting to boot, so I expected this. As a huge strategy fan, I wasn't expecting this game to blow AoE II out of the water, so I wasn't disappointed. This game delivered exactly what I wanted it to. The strategy aspects aren't greatly complex, though the game has a naturally harder difficulty due to its action-oriented AI (it DOES have four difficulties, though, for those looking for a more casual playthrough). Best of all, because you are the dragon commander, you are able to spawn as a dragon (you also get access to lots of special abilities and upgrades!) and follow your troops into battle to help them take over the map, which is awesome. I really don't have to explain why. :)The game is really into getting you involved in political decisions where you decide everything from whether or not to allow gay marriage, to allowing the church to charge civilians for ""forgiveness,"" to sacrificing worker safety in order to create outlandish war machines. You have a team of councillors that all chime in to help you decide, and each councillor represents a race that you can either make happy or unhappy with your decisions. This affects what type of bonuses and benefits you get that either help or hinder your troops on the strategy map. Basically, this game has quite a few little pieces to it that all work together very well, in my opinion. I immensely enjoyed speaking to my councillors and getting to know all of the interesting characters I was introduced to (it was arguably my favorite part). And as is a Divinity staple, the dialogue in this game is top notch, so it is always a joy to read, and the voice acting is also incredible.Part strategy, part card game, part politically charged RPG, Divinity: Dragon Commander is a fantastic game with high replay value for the storyline decisions alone, if nothing else. I am so glad I bought this game and experienced its highly original concept for myself. I highly recommend it!Edit 4/29/2016: I've noticed that an abnormal percentage of people have marked this review as unhelpful. As I always try my best to cover all aspects of a game in a review to be helpful to potential consumers, I would appreciate any comments on my review letting me know the information I've left out, or any questions you have about the game which my review left unanswered. I will update the review as applicable. Thank you!			"

												Russian and EnglishИтак про игру. Перед нами необычная смесь жанров RTS и RPG. Большая часть игры от RTS - завоевание территорий и иследование технологий. Однако самое прекрасное в ней не это, а диалоги с генералами, королевой (вашей женой) и Ваши политические решения. Фактически эта составляющая сделала Dragon Commander ни на что не похожей игрой, которая однозначно заслуживает внимания игроков. Ко всему этому добавьте великолепный сюжет, прекрасную музыку и хороший звуковой ряд и эта игра не оставит вас равнодушными.В игре есть и баги - в основном графические, но не критичные - однако иногда игра может и выбросить из-за них - так что сохраняемся почаще. И ещё одно - сейвы не переходят в Steam cloud.P.S. Для любителей именно RPG составляющей - просто понизьте сложность до минимума и не спешите завершать игру, пропускайте ходы и дожидайтесь сюрпризов в виде диалогов с советниками и генералами.И покажите всему миру кто вы: распущенный ханжа и тиран, который будет пресмыкатся перед политиканами - или же справедливый полководец и мудрый Владыка, способный на невероятные подвиги даже если все против.So about game. We have unusual mix of RTS and RPG jenre. Most of the game is RTS - conquering of territories and researching of technologies.However the best part not in that but in dialogues with generals, queen (your wife) and Your political decisions. This part made Dragon Commander as unic game that don't looks like any type of games that we know. Add to this it's magnificent story, excellent music and good sounds - all this make this game unforgettable fr you.But still game has few bugs with graphics - they are not critical but sometimes may crash game - so save often. Plus saves didn't store in Steam cloud.So in general - this game is worth to buy. Buy it and you won't regret. P.S. For those who like RPG part - just set difficulty to ""very easy"" and try to not end game fast, spend lots of moves and wait for surprises as dialogues with advisors and generals.Show the world who you really are: dissipated hypocrite and tyran, which reptile in front of politics - or rightful commander and wise Overlord, able to do incredible deeds even all are against you.

												The game starts out really interesting and stays that way until you realize that none of your decisions matter at all. There are lots of fundamental poltical problems to deal with, armies to lead and battles to wage, but no matter the decision results of the political field are miniscule, you can hire more troops endlessly and battles are big clusterfucs that are annoying and the AI is dumb as a boot.The ending seemed really rushed.

												An interesting blend of an RTS game, bioware style dialogue choices, and RPG skill allocation with grand strategy map.Sounds good.  But the RTS side of the game is really weak and pretty shallow, controlling the dragon is fun but makes the game totally un balanced as you can dominate with it.The dialogue part of the game suffers from heavy hot topic current politics that neither add value to the game, relate to what you are doing or the story, and are just not fun.  Kinda ruined it that i had to deal with gay marriage for a majority of the game.  So many fun and relevant topics that could have made me choose where to attack were ignored for this?Has potential but the political aspects not relating to the game, and the weak RTS aspect...i wouldnt recommend the game unless heavily discounted.

The game also has political actions have benefits or consequences. Some of the commanders (Ok one in particular) pisses me off though, but don't let that ruin the fun.

The world of rivellon looks really beautiful especially from above, as does the council, the raven, your advisors.The music is also a very strong part, the melodies stick with you and put you in the mood.the characters, scenario and background, are great and well designed. The one exception is not enough to bother.The gameplay ranges, from tabletop strategy to rts to action, and its lovely.I recommend this game to anyone, and though i finished it i know i will play it again. The only thing i  was left wanting from this awesome game now that i finished it is MOAR-moar dragons, moar wives, moar councillors and glory! (and that buttefly dragon we never got to see.) Methinks its expansion time. Once more, thank you for making this game. You have made a follower from me.Do i recommend this? A thousand times yes.			"

												For a game that boasts being a RTS game, it has abysmal gameplay and visuals when you are in the RTS part of the game. Which is a major part of the game. Being a Dragon in the RTS missions is largely a deathwish. The RTS missions require you to spam units non-stop, with no real build order, since you can build all units at the start.I do not recommend this game for anyone. It was a utter waste of money.

												**SpoilerishSo...good game with a bit of an agenda. This may/may not bother some people....my opinions (key word is ""opinion"") on the game is below:Pros:-Good mix of strategy/RPG/RTS gameplay (there are even cards you can use to give yourself bonuses).-Cool characters, interesting enough story...characters react to your choices.-Graphics are good, unit-types are interesting and can be upgraded to do different things.Cons:-Can be buggy sometimes which is slighty annoying.-Not much of a guide on what to do, throws you into a mess of gameplay that can have a steep learning curve (some may like this).-Modern day controversy doesn't always mix well with the fantasy setting.I'll expand on that last point some. First off this game gets a thumbs up because it is simply a good game, just fun to play and all around enjoyable. However I felt that the constant modern political overtones regularly took away from the feel and setting. Sometimes it seems like after every battle you return to your ship only to be asked about government healthcare, medicinal herb usage, imp euthanasia, or gay marriage for the elves. These sorts of issues are pretty consistent as you play and regardless of what your political opinions might be you will most likely find yourself distracted by planet earth issues as you are fighting to unite the people of the fantasy world of DC. Now this will be pretty appealing to some people, how this game incorporates real-life issues into the game and makes you see how they affect fantasy races. It is a pretty cool and interesting experiment they are doing here. For me though it just doesn't always work, when I play games like this I want to detach myself from these controversies. I suppose I'd feel it was more appropriate encountering these types of issues in a game setting that we as humans can relate to and are familiar with. Maybe in something like Sims or Gone Home, which also deals with gay issues. I will admit that I do like seeing the outcome of my decisions, I only wish the decisions I was making were more relevant to their world than ours. Religion is portrayed, perhaps expectedly, pretty poorly (the only religious voice is an undead representative...subtle symbolism of some kind?) and his advice is often so fargone and unresonable that you would have to be completely insane to take it under serious consideration (the lesbian undead artist needs to have all her work destroyed, kill all the heathens, etc, etc..). The (stereo)typical arguments are all here too (""rich people are evil""....""gay-marriage means people will be having sex with sheep next"") and sometimes I felt like I was watching people arguing on Fox News/CNN rather than playing a game. Ultimately a cool idea by the devs but a very distracting one from the overall experience, still a good game though if you peel away those layers.			"

												I am not familiar with any of the other games in the divinity franchise, but this entry under that line of games is very fun. To put it shortly it is a game consisting of 3 different elements. A boardgame as the likes of RISK where you manage and build troops and try to take over the whole board by conquering your enemies capitals. You can also use cards that give you advantages, like prevent certain types of units from moving, lets you build a structure for free or grants you additional units. You can either auto-resolve the fights if you want. if you decide to auto-reoslve the battle you will see a small animation depicting which units are being destroyed but you can also do the battling yourself, which leads to the next portion of the game.If you decide to go to the battle yourself you will be taken to the RTS section of the game, which works similar to traditional RTS's in most regards, albeit it is bit more simple than some of the more complicated RTS games out there. You see, you can't really build freely, since each map has a certain amount of building sites on which you can build various structures, again, the structures lack a bit of variety, as there is only a few structures to choose from (3 ground unit factories, a naval factory, a aerial factory, a recruitment citadel which basically will work as your resource harvester and 3 types of turrets). However, the fun comes from acually being able to jump into the battlefield yourself as a dragon donning a jetpack. There are 3 of which you can choose from, a support type, an offensive tanky type and a middle ground from these two. I have played most of my time as the support type, so most of the time I would jump into the battle when I was making a big push into the enemy base and heal and buff my troops while they did most of the damage. It is very fun to fight as a dragon with a jetpack mind you, and totally badass as well, the controls work nicely and the animations look good for the most part. I think this would be a good time to mention the music, which I find to be fantastic. It is very epic and energetic to get you in the right mood to swoop in with your dragon and take down the enemy and when you are on the boardgame section or in your ship the music is nice and funky.Which leads to the 3rd section of the game. The political part or decision making. Once you finish the RTS part, you will be greeted with a newspaper that will more often than not make fun of our last political decision, which is always quite a bit of fun, because no matter what they will always make fun of you. Then you get to be a part of making some large or smaller scale decisions about your empire, or to be empire, like what you will legalize or abolish. You have 5 different races in the game, each with their own diplomatic representative who will either like or dislike your final decisions, not favoring a specific race is a good idea, since the more a race likes you, the easier it is to take over and defend areas that are populated by them. And if a particular race hates you it is going to be tougher to defend an area that is mostly populated by that race as you will have a shortage on recruits there. As many others have mentioned you will get to decide upon very modern problems, some of which are still discussed today or were decided upon a few years ago. This part is a lot of fun, since you get to talk to the races representatives who have very distinct and colorful personalities, which makes this part arguably the most fun. Indeed the voice acting and character models are all very well made. The lip syncing is awesome, making the characters feel much more alive. Unlike in most other RTS's where you do your unit upgrades on the field, here you do that during this this phase, when you are in your ship. Here you get to spend your tech points to upgrade your troops and your dragon with various attributes and abilities, although, sometimes it feels like some of the units may have a bit too many abilities, since I can't keep up with that level of micromanagement as I already have my set of dragon abilities to take care of. It is really a great game, a ame I wouldn't have regretted putting down the 40 euros in on its release date. It is a shame that there isn't anyone playing the multiplayer anymore though, so I really cannot say what the multiplayer feels like, oh well, maybe someday.			"

												A shallow, unimpressive game with nice visuals. The RTS component is complete garbage, zerg-rush, zerg-rush, hope you setup and are good with hot-keys.  If you are, it's boring, simplistic, and utterly predictable.  If you aren't, it's frustrating.  If you actually like any kind of strategy in your Real-Time Strategy games, this isn't the game for you.The ""Strategy"" component of the game, between the battles is very light.  It's fairly shallow, but tries to hide this behind manditory ""psuedo-RPG"" interactions where you get to be alternately insulted and sucked up to by the people supposedly on your side.  The writing for the story and dialog is weak, the characters never change or remember anything you've done in the past except as a numerical percentage that adds bonuses/penalties in in the RTS mode.The visuals and voice acting are very good, but those are not enough to save the game from itself.  Personally, I found the game incredibly boring.			"

												Well, the RTS, by all accounts, is rather lacking. I wouldn't know, becuase i spent the whole game on casual and watched my devasters wreck the enemys♥♥♥♥♥♥while they occasaionally farted out a trooper to get instanta killed. But i can imagine that the lack of variety and bullrushing being the best option, and the dragon being op as all♥♥♥♥♥♥ might annoy some RTS people. Also, i'm annoyed that i couldn't land and start ripping♥♥♥♥♥♥up, and could only fire fireballs and acid balls like a fancy plane. Also we never actually see any of the enemies defeated we just fight them and win like any other battle. But ♥♥♥♥ all that, the political bits in between RTS battles are ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. Hilarious charecters, interesting events, hard descisions, did i say hilarious charecters? Yorick in particular was the coolest undead i've ever met. Also the...a....Entity you meet the second act....♥♥♥♥ing hell i swear that voice acting will haunt my nightmares. Wait till he giggles. Oh god. So if you like RTS, idk, you might enjoy this. For everyone else, ♥♥♥♥ing buy it, its brilliant.			"

												This game impressed me. In the beginning I thought it was just some low budget Starcraft with dragons, but it ended up being so much more! It takes a little warming up to, but once you get to know the characters and see how beautifully crafted the story is, it is a difficult game to put down. The game is short but strong. It knows exactly what it is and is amazing in everything it sets out to do. I've never taken the time to write a steam review before but this game surprised me so much I felt like spreading the good word. This game is absolutely worth your time.			"

												Decent execution at campaign, good tactical aspect, but real time strategy part isn't too good. It is about time management and micro-management, plus a bit of mastering of the geography. More about speed and multi tasking than anything related to strategy. Can be difficult, as CPU can multitask better obviously and I imagine it can be frustrating with human opponents in multiplayer. Graphics are ok, but once again they suck in the real time aspect. Most time is spent there, so I'd give game 5/10, and that's being generous. For me it probably would be actually 6/10 if they just removed the real time combat aspect entirely and left the % one on tactical (qick battle system). Fighting manually is just a huuuge chore and not fun.			"

												Worth picking up during a sale.I've enjoyed playing this game so far. The game does a lot: there's RTS, flying and fighting as a dragon, strategy map planning, researching, political decisions, and appeasing your wife and generals.  Admitedly, a lot of these features could have been expanded upon/fine tuned but the product as it stands is not a bad one and I don't regret my purchase.			"

												I'll keep this short. This game tries a lot of things at once. It tries to be a turn-based grand strategy, it tries to be an RTS, it tries to be a political RPG. One of these is merely average, one is decent, one is glorious. Merely average are RTS battles. While the addition of being a dragon, the rest of it is a basic spamfest of cheap units in huge quantities. It does require tactics, but most fights work in the ways of rock-paper-scissors, so it ends up in making a blob of compositions and throwing it at the enemy. If you make a good use of the Dragon, the battle will be over in a few minutes, but because AI can control multiple things at once (army, capturing buildings, abilities) and production, you'll get outspammed eventually and the battle will drag on. However, you can only enter one RTS battle each turn. My biggest issue with the (singleplayer) RTS component is that when you bring a huge army to a battle, you start with only a fraction of it, while your enemy starts with every units. An easy win become a very hard battle where you are outnumbered 10 to 1.Decent is the grand strategy component. It's quite simple, but it's competent and works well. The layout of maps makes you use strategies and calculate your moves carefully. I found it very enjoyable. What is weird is that you have 4 generals, but you can use them only once per turn, even though you use only one of them. Where do the other 3 run off to?However the RPG and politics are where the game excels. You can visit your ship and go to various parts of it, and talk to characters and crewmen, much like in Starcraft 2. And there is not a single uninteresting or 2D character. Same with political decisions brought to you by the council of 5 races. Each decision doesn't have a black or white answer, and each councilor makes sense when explaining his position on the issue. Strangely enough, the Lizards are the most liberal and open-minded. However, my issue here is that all decisions are absolute. There is no way to find a middle ground. For example, one of the decisions was to create a republic instead of monarchy, and while I wanted to do it, other councilors made convincing arguments how the population is just not ready and educated enough. Someone wanted me to fire half my male officers and replace them with women, and I couldn't invite women to the ranks, I could only fire these guys or tell that person to back off. However, this is a minor issue. Long story short. Dragon Commander was a highly enjoyable title. It has issues, quite a few, but overall, it's a very good game that has amazing amounts of character. There is much more depth than I descirbed. The design is awesome as well, steampunk-ish combined with technosorcerery. You don't see that often.			"

												Once again Larian Studios hits the mark with their new fresh RPG/RTS hybrid title, Divinity: Dragon Commander. Dragon Commander gives players an amusing, entertaining, and full of content gaming experience where as the Dragon Commander one must conquer a broken realm via the methods of force and politics. Strategic battles are visually gorgeous (and quite entertaining!), but under developed - similiar to actual Dragon gameplay. Players are equipped with a vast selection of upgrades fit for the Dragon and various other units, but be warned: research is developed slowly, and one must be cautious of what he invests in. Income for research is obtained via the strategic map, from victories in combat and in counsel. Dragon Commander boasts another aspect of gameplay - politics. Onboard the Command Vessel you will find a variety of finely detailed and voiced characters, from generals to politicians and yes, even princesses, each with a different outlook on near everything that you do. You will be hard pressed to appease each and every character (if that is at all possible). You will at times be approached for various bills to be passed, such as conscription, or the legalization of some belief, drug, etc... but what may sound like a grand idea could very well turn out to be a double edged sword, and down plummets your gold income, research, or reputation. Dragon Commander's mesh of game types is strongest in it's role playing elements, it's political machinations. There lies the essential element to Dragon Commander, the diverse characters and incredible vocals - the fantastic script and subtle humour. Larian Studios did not disappoint, and again brought Kirill Pokrovsky onboard once more for a breathtaking soundtrack, one that truly sets the mood. Dragon Commander is a blast to play, and is one of the most worthwhile games of the year! I highly recommend this modern masterpiece!			"

												I wanted to recommend this game, really did, but I can't just give it a blanket recommendation, though for certain people out there this might be the game for them, but it's not for everyone.The game is a mix of Strategy, RTS and Dragon flight/combat and I'm not sure that any one part is that great.  All of the are good/okay, but if you are looking for a good RTS there are better, if you want a good strategy(4x) game there are again other options.  And the Dragon flight/combat isn't all that great either, still satisfying, but it got stale somewhat quickly for me.I'm going to focus on the single player because after finishing it I didn't really have the desire to try multiplayer, as some minor spoilers ahead.For me there was just a lot of annoyances that just didn't make it as enjoyable as I was hoping it was going to be.  For starters the difficulty caught me by surprise.  When I first started playing I tried it on normal, this was a mistake for me.  I'm not a good RTS/4x TBS player at the best of times and the way this game starts (enemy has a ton of territory and units, you have nothing) did not help matters.  After getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me I gave it another shot on a lower setting (Casual makes the Dragon flying/combat part of the game incredibly satisfying).As an extension to the last point, starting the game at a big deficit isn't a bad idea and can work but the biggest problem for me was that it happens 3 times.  You start the story at a deficit and then get huge only to finish the first map/story arc and move into the second phase and start from nothing again against an enemy that holds a ton of units/territory.  It was silly enough to happen one time BUT THEN it happens AGAIN after the second map/story arc.  The third time you start with a few more territories/unit, but again you are at a huge deficit, it's okay that the game starts out that way, but to do it two more times feels lazy.Another thing was that I got hit with more than a few crashes.  But the biggest one for me was that I had finished the second arc of the game/story(With frequent saves along the way), started out the third arc and then saved/quit for the night.  When I hit the continue button, it was like I had never did any of it, all my saves gone.  I tried all the saves and found one auto save that thankfully brought me back to my most recent progress.Lastly, in the story arc you are given series of moral choices by your council.  While I enjoyed them for the most part, they didn't exactly add anything for me.  Maybe in the harder difficulties a -3 gold/+2% luck would mean a lot but for the lower difficulties it didn't really matter.  So I could easily juggle the choices and ended with all 5 factions at around 90% or above favorable making the choices feel more about math than the morals involved.  I would have liked to see the choices mean more, even at lower difficulties, maybe with revolts in territories or additional units joining or something, but for me I just seen it as a background thing and added a light fun/humorous touch to the campaign.  Also the Wife choosing thing felt unfinished.  Picked wife, had two or three conversations and nothing ever happened after that, no side quests, no challenges she put forth, just hung out in her room and said had another boring/straight forward case before her.  The generals were a nice though and added some flavor to the story, but for the most part on the lower difficulties I ignored them entirely, why would I want them commanding the army when I get to fly around as a Dragon?  Or why give up gold when I can click on the Imperial Army tab to auto finish the battle when it's at 100% or close to 100%?I think the game is an all-around good game, but if I give it my own recommendation I'd say no, because I didn't have much fun playing it.  It started out quite fun, but reusing the same mechanic and other frustrations kind of took their toll on the fun I was having.			"

												It is rare enough to see games where you make choices that matter, but it is even more rare to have role-playing choices bleed consequences into the strategic layer in an actual strategy game.Will you support state healthcare? Will you blow up a dam to save wildlife? Do you support gay marriages? How you answer these questions will affect your territories in very concrete ways, such as number of available recruits, number of simultaneously deployable units, territory income, fortification efficacy, and more. Each territory will also respond differently to your choices due to having different races in them, and it is not possible to have good approval rating with all races at once.Unlike many other games which are full of meaningless choices, in this game you are constantly making choices that are not only hard in the role-playing sense, but also hard because you have to balance their effects on the TBS campaign. The overall story might not be so complex, but it is full of opportunities for role-playing and then seeing their effects on your realm. The campaign can also be played on a variety of different maps in different settings to suit your preferences, with the choice-making mechanics intact. All of the dialogues are fully voiced.It is unfortunate that the RTS portion of the game is rather bad, but you can opt-out of it with very little penalty, if any. The game probably would've done better if it focused its efforts wholly on the TBS campaign.			"

												I wasn't sure what to expect from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised.The game is a mix of turn based and real time strategy. There's a strategic map with territories to capture and resources to manage, and each turn the player earns resources that they can use to purchase new units and tech. The units can be moved around the strategic map to claim territory, and when a battle breaks out, the player is taken to an RTS map to play out the battle, with their initial position being stronger or weaker depending on a number of factors, like the units they had present on the strategic map, their approval among the population of the region, and how long they've held the territory (if defending). The player is also able to earn (or buy) a selection of 'cards' that can be played on territories or before battles to swing the odds in their favor - things like hiring mercenaries for the duration of the battle, imposing penalties on enemy units, buffing their own units, or causing effects on the strategic map like altered population or extra gold earned.The single player campaign features 3 chapters, each consisting of a separate strategic map to conquer, but in addition, the player is frequently brought matters of state to address, or approached about the personal affairs of the generals in their army or other crewmembers of The Raven, an airship from the player commands. While I generally find this sort of thing to be rather tedious in similar games, I actually enjoyed it quite a bit in Dragon Commander. The issues are interesting and varied, and have consequences regardless of what side the player takes, so there doesn't feel like there's a clear 'right' and 'wrong' side to take in any issue. The characters have personality and it's quite easy to start caring about them - I'd say the character development is better than most RTS / TBS games.The real gimmick (from which the game derives its name) is that during the RTS battles, the player is able to transform into a dragon and fly around the battlefield killing things or assisting their own units. Research points can be spent (during the strategic phase) to gain additional abilities for your dragon form, such as massive fireballs, damage reducing shields, or stealth detection. Since, as a dragon, the player can fly very quickly around the map and generally rain death upon most units, it ends up playing a much more active role than the 'commander' unit in most RTS games (Supreme Commander, for instance), and it's quite satisfying to tear around the battlefield dishing out destruction. Otherwise completely unwinnable battles can be won by deploying some of the potent dragon abilities at key points.Overall, Dragon Commander is a fun game with a few gimmicks to set it apart from otherwise similar titles, and if you're a fan of RTS / TBS games, it's worth picking up.

												The music is amazing. The storyline and political intrigue are fascinating. All of this will fade into a bitter, crusted memory, however, once you realize just how utterly ramshackle the balancing is, how precognizant you'll need to be to devise a workable strategy and how massively unfair the battles can get, even after you figure out how to slow the game down enough to actually strategize during the real-time sections. And you will need to go into those, or you'll literally have no chance of winning -which, incidentally, is the same chance you'll often have even if you do fight the battle in real-time, only with a heaping helping of frustration on top. Then if you survive long enough to summon yourself -that's odd, isn't it? Having to wait for yourself to arrive!- ...Then you'll realize that if you breathe too much fire, as in enough to actually dent half the units in the game, then you'll overheat and have to cool down. So in short, this game is a terrible, atrocious waste of a magnificent OST and a choice-studded storyline; more than anything, it makes one wish the devs had had at least some clue as to how one creates fun gameplay.

												Was totally worth the 75% off sale. I'm glad to have gotten this origional game with some many options. Each character has a unique personality that makes it feel all more real or truely RPG like. Not many games go that in depth any more to make characters stand out with an actual own attitude and minds' perspective. Gameplays pretty great, unique, and eventful. Multiplayer makes the game better and even has ranked that pairs you with same level players. IDK what the Imperial Edition comes with but non the less $11 something was worth it I wouldn't pay more than $20 though on the Imperial Edition or $15 for Normal Edition less I knew more bought what Imperial has to offer maybe...$16, 60% right now worth it but for me personally I'm way cheap and only buy most games 75% off anyways...so if you got $ it's worth the fun then again or you could go buy Dragon Age so...well; I highly recommend it, there is NOTHING like it as far as real time strategies go  and it has quite a unique style to it!

The world of rivellon looks really beautiful especially from above, as does the council, the raven, your advisors.The music is also a very strong part, the melodies stick with you and put you in the mood.the characters, scenario and background, are great and well designed. The one exception is not enough to bother.The gameplay ranges, from tabletop strategy to rts to action, and its lovely.I recommend this game to anyone, and though i finished it i know i will play it again. The only thing i  was left wanting from this awesome game now that i finished it is MOAR-moar dragons, moar wives, moar councillors and glory! (and that buttefly dragon we never got to see.) Methinks its expansion time. Once more, thank you for making this game. You have made a follower from me.Do i recommend this? A thousand times yes.			"

												this was supposed to be a total war-like game with an rpg twist but went quite wrong.the only pros here are graphics and the general idea of commending your troops as a dragon while fighting the enemies.consthe strategy map is way too simple, there's no building or social managment involved at all and units management is clunky and rather uninteresting, there's is a card system which should bring you advantages/disadvantages but they reveal to be quite unrelevant especially later in the game.the rts part resembles the strategy one, very simple, no different factions to choose from, very low unit type count, just a few maps to play on, you'll end up basically repeating the same battle over and over again. dragon controls and ui design it's ok but it's almost impossible to avoid anemy attacks.the rpg section it's useless. they used it to bring on the story, the characters are good but there's no point in interacting with them; they'll ask you to decide on various aspect of your empire's politics (stuff like gay marriage, criminal deportation, military politc etc...) which will earn you their favour or their antipaty, but with minimal impact on the game itself.so it's a game with potential but it's too simple to be interesting to play			"

												Overview: Worth getting when on sale - solid 7/10. Brave mix of genres and gameplay styles, has a certain charm to it. If you're looking for a solid RTS, look elsewhere.  If you can overlook the underdeveloped (but still serviceable and fun enough) RTS part of the game, then you'll find a refreshing mix of ""RTS + Panzer Dragoon + Risk + Crusader Kings + Fox News + Tumblr + Japanese dating sim where you marry a skeleton or a lizard princess"" to quote another reviewer. Campaign took me 20 hours on normal, and I'd happily play it through again on a harder difficulty if my steam library backlog wasn't so mighty. Replayability is good due to different choices you can make as emperor / different princesses to marry / different tactics to use. Has it's problems, but no more than a lot of other games I've sunk countless hours into. Haven't played multiplayer so can't comment on it. Good:- OK story, decent characters who have decent voice acting (rarer than you'd think)- Good research/upgrade system for troops and dragon powers- Fun dragon combat- Game components work well together- Nice colourful visual style (subjective to a degree I guess)Bad:- Weak RTS component- Poor tutorial system (there's good guide on steam you may want to check out, among others)- A few balance issues, but not game-breaking- Campaign ending is underwhelming (though the fun is in the journey, no?)In the end, the goods outweigh the bads, and the bads don't prevent you from having a fun experience with the game.Personal tips:- Change the game speed to 'slowest', this helps A LOT for RTS battles- During RTS battles, rotate the camera so it's facing North and keep it that way, this makes the mini-map more usable and navigating the map a lot easier.- Don't forget to use your dragon form, it's fun! Watch out though, you can get ripped apart fast by anti-air if you don't avoid them or dodge well.- Read a guide or two, a lot of things aren't really explained well or at all.			"

												**SpoilerishSo...good game with a bit of an agenda. This may/may not bother some people....my opinions (key word is ""opinion"") on the game is below:Pros:-Good mix of strategy/RPG/RTS gameplay (there are even cards you can use to give yourself bonuses).-Cool characters, interesting enough story...characters react to your choices.-Graphics are good, unit-types are interesting and can be upgraded to do different things.Cons:-Can be buggy sometimes which is slighty annoying.-Not much of a guide on what to do, throws you into a mess of gameplay that can have a steep learning curve (some may like this).-Modern day controversy doesn't always mix well with the fantasy setting.I'll expand on that last point some. First off this game gets a thumbs up because it is simply a good game, just fun to play and all around enjoyable. However I felt that the constant modern political overtones regularly took away from the feel and setting. Sometimes it seems like after every battle you return to your ship only to be asked about government healthcare, medicinal herb usage, imp euthanasia, or gay marriage for the elves. These sorts of issues are pretty consistent as you play and regardless of what your political opinions might be you will most likely find yourself distracted by planet earth issues as you are fighting to unite the people of the fantasy world of DC. Now this will be pretty appealing to some people, how this game incorporates real-life issues into the game and makes you see how they affect fantasy races. It is a pretty cool and interesting experiment they are doing here. For me though it just doesn't always work, when I play games like this I want to detach myself from these controversies. I suppose I'd feel it was more appropriate encountering these types of issues in a game setting that we as humans can relate to and are familiar with. Maybe in something like Sims or Gone Home, which also deals with gay issues. I will admit that I do like seeing the outcome of my decisions, I only wish the decisions I was making were more relevant to their world than ours. Religion is portrayed, perhaps expectedly, pretty poorly (the only religious voice is an undead representative...subtle symbolism of some kind?) and his advice is often so fargone and unresonable that you would have to be completely insane to take it under serious consideration (the lesbian undead artist needs to have all her work destroyed, kill all the heathens, etc, etc..). The (stereo)typical arguments are all here too (""rich people are evil""....""gay-marriage means people will be having sex with sheep next"") and sometimes I felt like I was watching people arguing on Fox News/CNN rather than playing a game. Ultimately a cool idea by the devs but a very distracting one from the overall experience, still a good game though if you peel away those layers.			"

												It is rare enough to see games where you make choices that matter, but it is even more rare to have role-playing choices bleed consequences into the strategic layer in an actual strategy game.Will you support state healthcare? Will you blow up a dam to save wildlife? Do you support gay marriages? How you answer these questions will affect your territories in very concrete ways, such as number of available recruits, number of simultaneously deployable units, territory income, fortification efficacy, and more. Each territory will also respond differently to your choices due to having different races in them, and it is not possible to have good approval rating with all races at once.Unlike many other games which are full of meaningless choices, in this game you are constantly making choices that are not only hard in the role-playing sense, but also hard because you have to balance their effects on the TBS campaign. The overall story might not be so complex, but it is full of opportunities for role-playing and then seeing their effects on your realm. The campaign can also be played on a variety of different maps in different settings to suit your preferences, with the choice-making mechanics intact. All of the dialogues are fully voiced.It is unfortunate that the RTS portion of the game is rather bad, but you can opt-out of it with very little penalty, if any. The game probably would've done better if it focused its efforts wholly on the TBS campaign.			"

												It's an odd blend of game genres, and I'm not sure how many people it will honestly appeal to, because I'm sure most people will either find turn-based strategy and dialogue trees boring or the hectic third-person bullet-dodging RTS too frantic, but for anyone who likes being jerked between slow and fast, this is a game with a decent variety of game on offer.Unfortunately, like many ""kitchen sink genre"" games, the strength of the game has to come from its collective whole, because its individual components don't quite stand up on their own.  The turn-based strategy game is clunky and board game-y without any of the more free-wheeling rules that make actual strategy board games more interesting.  You buy troops and mash them into other units to claim land you use to buy more troops or research points to unlock more troops you can buy.  You can go into RTS mode to win one battle per turn that would otherwise be hopeless, because the turn strategy game is raw dice rolls with what existing units you had on the map, while, once in RTS mode, your constructed units swiftly outnumber whatever units you had on the board game section, rendering being outnumbered by anything but the most ludicrous margins a minor temporary inconvenience.The ""political decisions"" part of the game is like playing through South Park parodies of different political groups, but without any jokes, and being told to take them all seriously because you need them all to like you.  They're paper-thin cardboard cutouts of different interests with zero charm, and some of the voice acting is terrible.  I'm convinced whoever wrote the man-hating Catherine's dialogue was a man who hasn't spoken to a real woman in at least 10 years, because she both goes on endlessly about how inferior men are, but then also makes a constant stream of biggus dickus jokes while doing it.  NO ACTUAL WOMAN WOULD EVER TALK ABOUT HOW ""SWOLLEN"" A ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; MEN ARE WHILE INSULTING THEM. It's like Wizardchan wrote the character just to talk about ""how dumb feminazis are, amirite?"" The imp (amoral scientists) ambassador has lines expressing disgust or rage or sorrow, but can't manage any tone other than a sedated mirth.  The undead (religious) factions talk about how mercy or compassion are the sole providence of the gods, and how caring about your subjects or trying to better your realm is a sin, basically making religion always evil all the time.  These are the most egregious cases, but generally, the game wants you to hate all its characters equally besides maybe the upgrade characters, which in turn means you have little investment in any of it.  It's terrible, because it deals with real, serious issues, but then ham-acts the setups and consequences so badly and basically demands you go for stat benefits, not your own moral compass.Your political choices rarely have the sorts of impact you'd expect other than who likes or dislikes you, and it seems these choices are geared mostly towards just making sure you keep everyone mostly on-board with you, because you suffer combat penalties (including ""support"" penalties that deny the ability to build units) conquering new territory if you enraged the race that dwells in those territories.Also, humans apparently don't exist anywhere but on your ship, because they don't hold any land.The RTS section has barely over a dozen units, your bases are built on pre-defined locations, even turrets, no worker units exist, and buildings have no upgrades or tiers. (This is so strategic mode units matter more - all units available from the start of battle.) It lacks some features from games like Supreme Commander that I really miss when I'm in dragon mode, like the ability to simply tell my factories to just keep producing specific units in a specific proportion forever, instead of having to keep popping out of dragon mode to babysit my factory because I worked through the build queue.  The tech tree makes this worse, early-game.  The air and sea units unlock later than ground units, so for a while, your only air unit is the zepplin support unit, then an interceptor unit who can only be used to shoot down other interceptors and zepplins, (which can be shot down just fine by the ground units,) and only in the mid-late game, when bombers exist, does controlling the skies actually start mattering.  The ability to fly down onto the gamefield would make some sense as a way to entice players who traditionally aren't RTS playres if and only if you really could win without worrying about the RTS components so much, but that's rather deliberately not the case.  The RTS portions of the game lack the previously-mentioned scriptability of a game like Supreme Commander, forcing micromanagement babysitting that mean that you wind up having to constantly dodge missiles, shoot at enemies, drop buffs on allies, order troop movements, keep an eye out for enemy flanking attacks or cloaked enemies, and babysit factory build queues all at the same time, and it's massively overwhelming.  You ultimately have no way of controlling your army from dragon mode except by hitting the ""select all"" button and generally mashing them all into one big mob that you clumsily lob at the enemy while trying to support as best you can manage.  I frequently find myself with no clue exactly how many of my units I even have left while trying to stand my ground against ceaseless waves of enemy forces.  Simply not using dragon mode, on the other hand, is generally not an option.  It's just way too overpowered not to use it, especially early-game against things like troopers, which your dragon can easily shred with impunity.  Whereas shaman support units have a shield that can block 50% of damage, your dragon can drop one that lasts longer, blocks 75% of damage, and has a cooldown short enough that you can drop it on two units.  In fact, if you just buff your own troops, they're basically invincible between a shield buff reducing damage, a buff that makes them shoot faster, a buff that ups damage, a buff that makes them move faster, a passive buff that gives regeneration to every friendly nearby, and to top it all off, a skill that turns your fireballs into healing bolts that you can use to basically ensure none of your units ever drop below max health for more than a fraction of a second.  On the other hand, if you're in dragon mode, all the active abilities of units like shamans and warlocks tend to be wastes of research points, because you can't activate them in dragon mode, and would be far too busy to individually select specific units even if you had the button to do so.  Also, the dragon is surprisingly fragile against concentrated anti-air defenses like a half-dozen ironclads, and you can easily wind up in a situation where you have utterly lost control of the sea in such situations.  The end result is that battle becomes a confusing brawl where you frequently drop out of strategic situational awareness to focus upon personal conflict, only to dart back out to try to reassess what just happened while you were away. (Oh, look, a transport dropped off some troops in that minor side-base and captured it, now you have to take it back!) It makes for slippery gameplay where you never quite feel in control, and are mostly just trying to tread water, keeping an eye on everything you need to be aware of, using all your powers as they cool down, even while you're unquestionably winning.  And this is single player... Add in another player who's also a dragon and can duel you on even terms, and you have a recipe for completely ignoring the rest of the battle.The result is a giant chaotic mess, but it can certainly be an amusing chaotic mess.  I just wish it featured more tools to actually help players, like AI settings that let you tell units to use special abilities on their own.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is a real-time strategy game for people who generally don't enjoy (or, like me, are simply not very good at) RTS games.  Conscious of criticisms that D:DC lacks certain features or innovations appurtenant to the RTS genre (read: ""It's not Starcraft, uuggghh""), I gave this a go and have thus far found the game varied, delightful, and eminently playable.At its core, D:DC features three different games rolled into one.  The first is the core RTS game, wherein you fly a great big dragon with a jetpack while occasionally micromanaging troops.  The game permits letting the dragon carry a battle, because frankly I've won battles where my dudes otherwise got overrun.  I'm certain hardcore RTS gamers would balk at this as a crutch, but for a far more casual player like myself I count it as a feature.  Flying a dragon around helicopter-d*icking enemy units is just awesome, and it allows me enjoy a game that I would otherwise find needlessly frustrating.The second game is the ""Risk"" element, which is a grand strategy overland map that tracks conquests and strategic movements.  On this map, the player manages income, research, and movement of troops over the map.  With adequate planning and maneuvering, you can let your NPC generals auto-resolve battles with a probability slider indicating the likelihood of success.  Alternately, you can take a skirmish into the RTS game, which is especially helpful for swinging unlikely battles to your favor by way of your dragon stomping all over enemy units.  The game is usually won or lost on this portion of the game, though I suppose players who are generally good at RTS games will quickly master the strategic map.The third game is a political simulator.  As an upstart monarch, it is necessary to occasionally tend to civic matters.  The player's decisions on a wide variety of issues, from trade policy and conscription to women's suffrage and gay marriage.  Your decisions affect the allegiances of constituent races, which are loosely analogous to real-life political interest groups.  The elves are leftist environmentalists.  The dwarves are laissez-faire capitalists.  The lizardfolk are libertarian republicans.  The imps are mad scientists and sociopaths.  And the undead are religious conservatives.  One can either balance issues in order to keep everyone relatively happy, or forsake certain interest groups in favor of others.In all the game is varied, fluid, and fun.  I picked this up on sale, and in retrospect this is a game that I would have paid full price for at launch.  I can definitely see myself playing the heck out of Divinity: Dragon Commander in the days to come.			"

												Everything except the combat in this game is really nice. I actually like the strategic game board more than most other games I've played, and the dialogue and characters all have voice acting and at least some amount of characterization, which is pretty nice.The actually battles, which unfortunetly are a large part of the game, have a user interface ad overall setup that is frankly unpleasant to deal with and not fun at all. Here are a brief list of the pros:-The dragon transformation works well and playing in dragon form is pretty fun. The transition between normal rts mode and dragon mode is mostly seamless. Given that this is a major differentiator between this and other games I do have to give some props.-The unit effects are pretty nice. General graphics are good.The cons (mostly interface related):-Scrolling is a pain, because the map orientation doesn't change with the camera rotation. You can't use the minimap because up becomes down, sideways, and every direction in between, and it is almost impossible to keep track of what else is going on when units that look like they are coming from below your base are actually up and to the left.-The above minimap issues make it very difficult to form strategies and think about what is going on, because unit and base positions are so difficult to keep in mind.-Units that are moving towards enemies will not fight back unless explicitly told to. This is actually pretty common among strategy games, and it wouldn't be a problem except that there is no obvious visual indicator to say that a unit is attacking or just moving near an enemy. It is possible to lose whole armies because you clicked near an enemy instead of on them. Attack moving is a partial solution, but unit attack ranges are so long that parts of your army can get caught attacking non-critical targets on the way to a fight.-Unit movement is slow and feels clumsy. I guess it is more ""realistic,"" but not my cup of tea.-Controlling your units in dragon form becomes even more difficult. With certain hotkeys it is possible to control your nearby units, but it feels really clumsy and there are no visual indicators to tell when units are moving or not. It is difficult to check on your units in dragon form because your camera is restrained to your moving first person view.-Probably the worst part of the dragon form controls is that you cannot produce new units while in dragon form. You are forced to either create long queues of units to make (which you often don't have the resources for) or switch between being a dragon and scrolling back to your base to issue more commands (using the mouse because the minimap is impossible).-Somewhat minor, but the hotkeys are a little strange. Q is the attack hotkey, not A, etc.-Obviously the AI has none of these problems. This creates frustrating situations where the AI is attacking on two or more fronts and you can't even issue commands to your units because the controls are so clumsy.All these may seem minor but they really build up. It's a shame because the game is almost really good, but it just isn't fun because of all the issues in the actual implementation. I might try to play the game a little more, try to figure out the controls and see if that helps any, but I doubt it. It doesn't feel like the commitment will be worth it when there are simply more fun games out there.			"

												I can't fathom how this game is reviewed so well. Maybe they didn't play longer than 5 hours? This game stops being fun before you finish a single campaign. It's a lot of fun to fly your dragon around during fights, sure. But you quickly realize the game is...Blitz a checkpoint, bombard with dragon. Move on to next checkpoint. This is battles. That's it. No reason to strategize whatsoever.The world map is basically Risk.The voice acting is good. The plot is pretty basic, but good enough. Your choices are pretty shallow but that's cool.I MIGHT buy it for $5, but I'm not sure.			"

												This game has a beautifully rendered command ship interface and pretty detailed political choices. The game is stacked against you if you do not choose what is currently considered the liberal agenda. The combat interface and RTS element is really underdeveloped and becomes a big grind by the end. Of the wives available to choose, I believe only one of them has a really well developed and fleshed out story-line. This game was overall enjoyable, but it clearly has a blatant political agenda, which made it less enjoyable overall, especially since it was very in your face. Game makers, like artists, will realize in the end it is more timeless and universally enjoyable when they don't bog down with preaching about nature, labor unions, breastfeeding in public, and women's rights, etc. I play a game to get away from politics and other nastiness.

												The previews of this game made it seem quite complex with many different angles going on...  but I didn't see that.  I saw a very linear game .. where the dragon powers and the politics were more ""fluff"" than actual game affecting.   Full Disclosure - I lost repeatedly - even on the easy difficulty.   There wasn't a tutorial that took you step by step through the RTS component - so even with a 96% chance of success - you lose the battle.  I ended up getting armies to fight for me automatically so the success / failure became a numbers game after awhile .. but I found you just couldn't expand territory quick enough to build an economy .. and the computer player overwhealms you quickly again and again.So yeah - I can't recommend this game.  I want games to be fun and relaxing - not frustrating.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is NOT a typical game – it takes elements from many different gameplay styles and mixes them together to create a unique gameplay experience. The well written characters and the political decisions feel like an RPG, but the map screen is more reminiscent of Risk. Then, the actual battles are fought in a real-time format, like Red Alert or Warcraft. The developers tried to stick 3 very different styles and unite them with the main character – a dragon with a jetpack.  The basic plot of the game is that the Emperor has died, and his children are in a civil war over who gets to rule the empire. The player controls the “black sheep” sibling – whose mother happened to be a dragon. Honestly, this isn’t the most exciting or original plot – “The main story of Dragon Commander is simple and doesn't really break away from your standard ""noble hero saves the day"" trope”. However, the other characters are far more interesting than the main story – first you have your generals, who include a gruff “solve all problems with violence” military man, a snobby upper-class stuck up lizardman, and a woman who used to be the Queen of a matriarchal society and shows distain for all males. Unsurprisingly, these generals don’t get along, and it’s up to the player to unite them.But the most entertaining part of the game comes from the political decisions. There are five councilmen representing each of the five races in your empire, and every decision you make effects their opinion about you. For example: the dwarf council representative proposes that the law exempting the church from taxes be repealed. The undead council representative, who is extremely religious is strongly opposed to this proposal. The player can also run into surprisingly modern issues, like copyrights, women in the military,  or gay marriage. The laws will also affect how your empire runs – passing those church taxes will increase your income, granting women equal pay increases your expenses and so on. I often felt like a real politician making the decisions, and rejected proposals I actually favor in real life either because they were too unpopular, or because they would be too expensive.However, this component of the game has one major flaw – every choice the player can make is either “yes” or “no” with no stops in between.  At one point, the player is offered a bribe to allow a murderer (who *happens* to be a member of a wealthy and high-ranking family) to go free. One of your generals (who is linked to the victims) asks permission to assassinate the murderer. The player’s only choices are “Accept the bribe and let the killer go free” or “give permission for the assassination mission”.There are two other main aspects to the game, because you need to continue fighting the war while all this is going on. Basically, you can build and move units on a map screen, in a manner not unlike Risk. This phase of the game is decently designed, and the player can also spend gold to build structures in their lands such as a gold mine to increase income, or a war factory to produce units. However, the cards come up at complete random (the player can invest in buildings to increase the quantity of cards, but not the quality) and range from near-useless to game-breaking. For example – I can draw a card that gives a bonus trooper (the weakest unit) to the next battle, and lose every battle because the AI opponent drew a card that gives 5 bonus juggernauts (the strongest unit).In addition, while the various effects of your policies are in effect, “luck” outshines them all. Luck gives a bonus or penalty to every battle, and there is no way to know what decisions will affect luck without looking them up or having played the game before.Finally, there’s the actual battles themselves. While they can be resolved on the world map automatically with the odds favoring the stronger side (or who has better cards), the player can also choose to command the troops themselves.  This sends the game into the real-time strategy component, where the most playtime is spent. But basically, you'll usually just build tons of units and throw them all at the enemy. The real time battles are more often than not dull, drawn out exercises in futility as the winner is often known before 2 minutes have passed, despite the fact that most battles last at least 10 to 15 minutes. It doesn't help that the AI opponent is generally a complete moron, repeating the same tactics over and over (regardless of whether they actually worked before) but the big problem is the lack of super-weapons, creative units, or in-battle dialog most real-time strategy games offer. I feel “sub-par” would be more accurate.  There is one upside to these battles however: the player can transform into a dragon.Using any dragon abilities the player has researched, the dragon can breathe fire on the enemy, but also curse them, heal nearby friendly units, and use the jetpack as a speed boost while flying. Surprisingly, the dragon isn’t overpowered despite the fact that the opponent lacks this ability, because anti-air units have a high priority among the AI. But even the upside has its own downside: controlling the normal units while playing as the dragon is awkward to do, and most players simply transform back before giving orders.Overall, Divinity: Dragon Commander is a decent game, though not really with its asking price of $40 – it can be finished in under 10 hours. Many players attempt to become so good at the ‘risk’ portion that they can skip the battles entirly and enjoy the politics. I -DO- recommend getting this game, but don't pay full price. "

												Suprisingly good.I expected a spam fest.What i got was a game that is like a good book.You read it once and never look at it again.While this game has multiplayer and skirmish the real fun is in the story line.It is your stander background:You the iligitment child of the recently killed king and must now ensure your rule by beating the snot out of your legitement batshit crazy brothers and sisters.Yet there is where the cliche ends.The rts part of this game is the least interesting one.I enjoy my time about the revan(your flagship) where you make politcal decisions that has consequencesEverything from your forced marriage(yes you are forced into marriage, not the otherway around)To the mathers of court to how you threat your employees is a mather of action and consequence.It gives the game replay value.There are some minnor complaince ofcourse.Rts is shallow(just above spamm fest really)The Cards you get can make or break you.And just like real life politic's there is no right answer.I was playing as a liberial(i think)My interest where about the little man.This made me populair with the hippy's....sorry i mean elves.But hated with the undead and dwarves.Atleast the dwarves i can agree with from time to time as they are capatalists.But the undead are religous zelaots.They make christains look reasonable in compairasion.Then you got your race over overhyped psycho engineers(imps)And lizards with a superiority complex, who accauly have the best idea for the most time.Ofcourse if you want to be an slaver of a leader that you can do to.Just agree with the undead on everything.

												The combat of this game was repetive and unispired. Story mode was bland, and very tropey. Despite the fact that I was greeted with Alastair Parker imediately welcoming me to this suposed rich game of politics and nuance, even he could not save it, and my love for him wore thin as he gave a less than stellar performance. Seriously, this man never stopped shouting.Decisions have no complex outcomes besides approval ratings, and by the time I reached the marraige scene I was so bored of the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥plot and dull gameplay that I couldn't continue.

												This is actually the very first time I've felt compelled to write a review on Steam. And I'll keep it as brief as my experience with the game.I really did have high hoped for this one. It's been sitting in my Steam library for quite a while now.I was essentially saving it for a weekend when I had the time to really sink my teeth into something enjoyable.An RTS with RPG elements and an interesting pantheon of characters -- what could go wrong?Well...It sis not take me more than 45 minutes to figuure out that this was not one of those strategy games I played and loved growing up - Command & Conquer, Warcraft etc. The learning curve is immensly steep and the user interface is down-right ugly -- as are most of the units. No - this is not in any way a full review. This is more of a gut-reaction. And my gut needs a generous helping of Pepto Bismol after this rotten treat.			"

												First the good.1)This is a pretty interesting RTS. The end.2) I bought it on sale and only paid a bit over $5Now the bad.1)For a game called Dragon Commander the ""dragon"" play seems mostly like an afterthought. You are basically just an airborne hovering turret that can cast buffs and debuffs on units. This is admittedly part of what makes the RTS side interesting but a dragon flight simulator this is not. No dog fights, no barrel rolls. Most of the game can be played without ever becoming a dragon.2) The political and social side of this game is PAINFULL if you are anything other than a liberal progressive. There is no balance to the gameplay here and the developers biases bleed all over this aspect of the game. As a free-market libertarian the only time I didn't♥♥♥♥♥♥everyone off was with my support of gay rights. At the very least there should be an option to disable this aspect of the game and play it as a pure RTS.I have a love hate relationship with this game. When I am on the strategic map or in combat I love it. When I'm on the Raven I hate it. Over all though I cannot recommend this game as I can't see myself enduring too many more hours of ideological pedagogy from the uber-left. Too bad this game has real promise in the RTS department.

												  The game is amazing, the story is good, the characters and the dialogues are amazing. However the only stupid part about this game is the fact that all of your decisions dont matter, and its easy to win over the hearts of any woman when you are already somebody.  I wish there was more content and interaction but the game just ends abruptly and nothing matters. I wish they used the same story telling mechanics and expand on it, i was hoping for several DLC expansions for the content, but this game leaves you in the mud after it ends, althought this game has the potential to reach masterpiece, it feels incomplete and unsatisfying, they failed on the finishing touches and poor icing on the cake. If its cheap i suggest you buy it, but expect some dissapointments.   Overall the game is fantastic in terms of animations,voices,graphics and gameplay done better than even some triple A titles, astonishing production quality. However you will feel empty when the game ends wishing there was more when there is none. Sadly i doubt even if you buy the game, there would be any more Dragon Commander sequels or content.			"

												Divinity is a mix of many genres,Card games, RTS,RPG,Simulation....etc.While i do feel it does a passing job with the gameplay, The story is the real reason to play this game. Thruout the game you must make many political and personal decisions. Such as outlawing a certain practice or picking a bride to marry. These decisions have a effect on how you are recieved by the politicians, but can also alter public support, gold or research per turn etc.. This is by far the best part of the game is seeing how your choices effect those around you.The game is worth several playthrus to see all the different ways you can approach a problem.. However the game is fairly short once you know how to milk the system with Mercenary cards. but the deep characters and superb voice acting bring a ton of depth to the world and will make you want to keep playing a few more turns to see what choice will be put before you next.

Posted: April 16, 2014
												I'm going to have to go with an 8/10 on this one. I have a mixed opinion on the many elements that Dragon Commander offered me. Some I liked while others I didn't. Let me start from the beginning. You are thrust into a world that is being ravaged by war. Due to certain circumstances, it is up to you to stop that war and then begin an entirely new empire. The enemies that you're supposed to defeat don't really have much background to them, only having their names said in a cutscene and also giving a reason why they would be considered crazy. The way you fight in the war is done by viewing into a world map where you summon your soldiers, invade other countries, build different types of buildings that have their own bonuses that helps out whoever is control of that country. You also have the ability to use cards that have their own effects to them on those individual countries. For example, you can increase the income of gold in the capital of your country for a certain amount of turns so that you can produce more troops. Or, you can decrease the population to the enemy faction's capital to a certain percent. There are many more as well so I did like the variety that I was given. It let me strategize my moves better for when I decided to take a country from my enemy. Now, when you do invade a country and that country is already inhabited by the soldiers of your enemy, you are given the option to fight it yourself, or autoresolve the battle by having one of the four generals that join you along the way and the imperial army. Using the imperial army is free but it offers no bonus to your chance to win while the generals each specialize in commanding different types of troops, the chances of winning varying on who you choose. If you command the battle yourself, you're put into a level with your troops already at one base and your enemy across from you in another. You use recruits to build different war factories that range from naval, aerial, ground, and heavy combat troops. You're able to move individual troops to go to an unclaimed build spot so that you can use it to make more troops or increase your recruitment speed. The enemy will do the same and it's a battle for dominance until you either kill all of their soldiers and take their headquarters or they do that to you. One really cool part during this combat that the game is rather famous for is that the player can directly enter the battle.As a dragon. With a jetpack. With this mechanic, players can help out their troops if things aren't going so well during the battle. I thought that a very creative idea by the developers. Because... who doesn't like killing enemies as a dragon that is equipped with a jetpack? The downside to this, however, is that I actually rarely needed to help out my troops. I'm not much of an RTS gamer but even I was able to figure out the way to win every single battle in this game. Spam your troops and swarm compounds. That's really all you can do in these battles. Coupled with how similar the levels are that you fight in, some even looking exactly the same, I didn't really feel a satisfaction to winning. I was never really on the end of my ropes and biting my nails, wondering how I was going to win. I literally just stared at the screen and clicked my mouse to produce more troops. Oh, another thing about the battles is that the camera isn't all too great. Whenever I was up against one of the ""invisible"" walls in the level, the camera wouldn't let me control it and I wasn't able to get the proper angle I wanted to get. I didn't really like that so it made me have to stay away from those boundaries, even if my troops were fighting against the enemy near one. Alright, I think I covered that part of the game enough. Let's move on to the other side. The side of where you're thrust into politics and everyone looks to you to decide on whether a certain policy is allowed or not. You deal with the different races in the world, the dwarves, the elves, the lizards, the imps, and the undead. You read that right. Undead. Each race has their own beliefs and how they think the world should run and they propose many different policies to you, all of them similar to issues that have been brought up or are being brought up in real life. Like, the legalization of their version of weed, or allowing government healthcare. I don't really like politics or politicians in general but it was a really interesting aspect in the game because of how different it was. I also liked how everyone was different and had their own charms to them, even if I didn't agree with their policies at all. And you did all of this inside a ship that was called the Raven. The overall design was aesthetically pleasing to me. There were various NPC's doing there own duties as you switched to the differnent rooms. I wished there was a free roam so that I could explore it more thoroughly, but I was still satisfied with what I was given. While doing this, you can access the world map, where you plan your moves in the war, talk to your generals who are also interesting with their own personalites and views. At some points, their are issues that they also have to deal with and ask you to give them permission to go deal with them. Some have consequences that you can choose to have them be tried for or to get them off scott free. It's really up to you. As it should be. Okay then, now I think I should tell my complaints that I haven't already stated. The tutorial isn't very good. As I said, I'm not much of an RTS gamer, so I've rarely played them. So it took me a while in order to figure everything out before I could do them properly. I wasn't told how to control my troops while in dragon form so I would have to jump from mode to mode to make sure they weren't dying while I was off doing my dragon thing. Then I experienced a glitch in the game where the meter that told me when my next unit would be ready did not end and that unit wasn't produced, leaving me with just the ones I had at the beginning of the battle. It happened to me once but I thought I should let that be known anyway. Also, the enemy variety isn't very diverse. All of the troops are the exact same as yours. No other countries have their own unique units that you have to fight, which I thought would've been a pretty interesting thing to have. These things don't change my opinion of the game or how much fun I had with it but I don't think it did a really good job introducing me to the RTS style. All in all, Dragon Commander is a good game. Depending on whether you want to put up with the various downsides to the rather lackluster RTS sequences is up to you. But, you will definitely enjoy getting to run an empire that is made around the policies you instate.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander boasts impeccable writing, characters, and visuals. The dialogue in this game is so incredible, that it warrants a playthrough in itself. The many comments that your crew makes regarding your political decisions really adds a depth of layer to the individual characters - to the point where some of these characters mirror actual political figures in our own world. It seriously is some of the best writing in a game that I have encountered. With that said, Divinity: Dragon Commander is not a flawless game. The RTS portion is lackluster and uninspiring, which is shame since that's where the majority of the gameplay will take place. Instead of building a base, like you would in traditional RTS games, you simply capture platforms that can be used to build a certain type of building. The units that you manufacture from these buildings are uninteresting and are just there to support you as you fight in your dragon form. I personally found the number of active abilities on your dragon to be disappointing. There was an opportunity to bring in some real interesting abilities, but what is there is quite basic. Luckily, Larian put in an auto-resolve feature so you can quickly brush through the battles to hear the witty banter on your ship. All in all, buy Divinity: Dragon Commander for the dialogue and story. Do not buy it if you are expecting a great RTS game.			"

												Got this game as part of a massive Humble Bundle. Came with RPG creators and three other Divinity games along with a slew of other things. For the price of mere cents possibly, this game is great. I loved the visual aspects of the game and I loved the Risk stlye maneuverings and the RTS elements. Not to mention the dragon combat, though difficult to fully master, was excellent. The political manuervering in this game, though easy to appease everyone if you play your cards right, was thought through. I really enjoyed all the decisions and the relations to current event. I mean, elven dope, Dwarven Soda, and genetic testing? I had a good laugh while deciding which route to take in the game.THe bad? Well, Once you bought enough units and unlocked the best units in the game, the RTS element is completely skipable. I was able to buy ten juggernaughts, a few air balloons and a slew of other units, transport them around to wherever I wanted, usually an enemy capital, and just make myself at home. Other than that, this game is a great time killer and really fun to play.RTS: 10/10Dragon Combat: 10/10Maps and Grafics: 8/10Overall: 9/10			"

												Well, this one won't be an easy one....First of all I should say that I've had some preformance issues, despite playing on my high-end gaming pc. This is probablu due to the game not being able to handle my frequent abuse of the ""dodge"" command (right mouse-button) or too long uses of the jetpack boost (space).Then onto the game itself.As this is a political-strategy/RTS game (you will have your fair share of both), it needs to be reviewd as such.Sadly, the RTS part is not as polished and well done as one would hope of a game that titles itself as an RTS. Sure, it is great fun to fly around in your dragon form (yes, it's RTS + TPS-elements) and just f*ck up your enemies, but there are preformance issues (listed above, that only occur in the RTS-moments), as well as a quite unbalanced fighting mechanic. Yes, there are many different types of troops to choose from, that each counter another and so on, but once you get to the point where you can manufacture ""Juggernauts"", the game becomes easy enough for a infant on drugs to win any battle.So, how come I still recommend this one?Despite the RTS parts being not-completely-satisfying at times, what keeps this game floating is the political system.Undead, Elves, Dwarfs, Lizards and Imps all want to have their say in your daily doings, wanting to shape your future empire into the best possible one for their own race. Your chioces will either gain you good or bad standing with each of theese races, which in turn alter your possibility to recruit soilders in different areas where different races live.This system of politics is done well enough to take focus away from the flawed RTS battles and give you loads of fun toying with the councillors' dilemmas.Because let's all face it, we all want to do make that one choice that makes 4 out of 5 races hate you because, well, for the sheer hell of it!

												    Divinity: Dragon Commander makes an attempt to mix action, RTS, RPG, and a politics, and does somethings brillinatly right and others horribly wrong.  Your father, the Emperor of Rivellon, has been murdered, and his kingdom is split between the children that tried to usurp his throne. It is now up to the illigitimate child, of both dragon and man, to defeat the children, unite the lands, and claim the throne.    The story it's self is quite well-written and humorous, mixing serious matters and a light-hearted undertone. The political part is by far the most excellent part of the game, forcing you to hear your advisors side, as well as forging your own opinion. This also parodies current world matters, such as gay marriage, women rights, arranged marraige and so on.The action comes into play when in the middle of a battle, you can turn the tide by switching into a dragon, The RPG elements allow custimization of your dragon as well as its abilities, and your own armies and bonuses to them.    However the most under developed part is the RTS part, very close to the StarCraft style. The game encourages ""Zerg Rush"" style gameplay because otherwise your battles will last forever and never end, and will mostly end in a lack of workers to make more units. In conclusion Dragon Commander could be so much more, by immensely improving on it's RTS elements, and eliminating the ""Zerg Rush"" need to win.    If you like Board Games, RTS, Political simulators, or even action games, I encourage you to try it. If your not good at RTS, just let the computer do it for you. You won't regret it. "

												It has a very indepth story, so indepth that the entire game could have been just the story. The hostile takeover system was done increadibly well although dragon combat could have been done a bit better has I found my self winning in 100% chances of faliure. But other wise I would recommend this game completely.			"

												This game is an excellent combination of Turn Based Strategy, with elements similar to the board game Risk, and Real Time Strategy like AOE, Starcraft or any of those countless other similar games. However, there is one big difference. In Divinity, you also have the option of ""popping in"" and assisting your troops on the ground as a Dragon. After you get the hang of knowing when you should transform or not, the game gets pretty cool and the blend of gameplay styles proves to be very satisfying. The only thing I would change is maybe customizable Dragons and a level editor/maker.			"

												RPG, strategy, RTS, and dragons! This game combined a lot of elements that I love into a game I couldn't wait to buy, one of the few I've ever preordered. I quite enjoyed Larian's Divinity II and thus had faith that they'd do well with this game as well, and they lived up to expectations. Once you finish the campaign you can make a custom one that avoids the cutscenes and seperate acts, making for a lot of replayability so you can explore the many political decisions set before you. The strategic overview is simple but funtions quite well, the units on said overview map coming with you into the RTS battles in contested territories. The RTS component itself is much simpler than most as it comprises a single resource, recruits, that is shared amoung all the players. Controlling more Citadels means you get a larger portion of this pool, and should a battle exhaust this resource it comes down to who can manage what they got from the pool better. Of course my personal favourite part of the game is entering the battle yourself as a dragon, and if played well you can significantly change the flow of battle, often strong enough to strafe around and destroy smaller groups of units. You have limited RTS control in dragon form however, and may have to exit dragon mode to execute further commands, though transitioning back and forth is quite fluid.			"

												Despite its silly name, the game isn't all that bad. The RTS stuff needs a bit of work, as does the battle field animation, but if you are like me, you'll soon find yourself playing the game entirely for the stuff off the battlefield, where you, the Emperor, have to make political choices to determine the way your future Empire will be run. For some reason this involves a Goblins wishing to conduct genetic experiments on the womb and a rather loose Elf Princess (who never puts out) wanting to LOVE.			"

There are five races in this world lisards, imps, elves, dorfes and undead, will you favor one and anger the rest will you allow gay marriage and build environment friendly war maschines it's up to you to decide, but be aware your choices effect you strategy. For example if you want to defent a providence of elves you might have possitive or negative strategy bonus from it depending on whether or not the elves like you making your every decision count . The strategic part is also hanled well first you have a turned based map where you buy and move your units and counqer the providences of you enemies.Each providen's bring's you some of research points and money, research points can be used to unlock new units and upgrade the ones you have as well use to gein new abilities for you dragon form to use on the battlefield wille money can be use to buy unit's from your factory or new buildings for your providences , you can build an observatory or a mine to get more of each however you can only have one building in each area so you must be carefull .

												This game is one hell of a science project. The question of ""What if you mashed together a RTS, Risk, a card game, chatting with your friends on your flying ship a-la Mass Effect, political commentary, and turning into a giant firebreathing dragon all into one game"" is explored, and to a certain extent, succeeds. The dialogue is well written, and there are some interesting characters I would have loved to see in a more focused game. You'll meet a snobby lizardman with a monocle, chat about allowing gay marriage in your kingdom with a talking religious skeleton, and can even marry a talking skeleton. All of this takes place on your floating steampunk ship, powered by a living demon. This is the area of the game I feel excels, and why I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a zany fantasy story. Once you get to the Overworld map, in which you and your rivals play a turn-based style risk game, you start to realize that the game's lack of focus has left some mechanics lacking. You'll move your squads of troops to points and try to dominate the entire map, gathering resources from tiles on the map. You'll also have cards (yes, there's also a card game) that you can play to turn the edge in your favour. But wait, there's more! If you and your rivals meet on the same tile, you'll have to battle. You can sim this out (Which I ended up doing as much as possible), or go into the most flawed piece of the game, the RTS. The RTS portion is standard fare, you'll have to capture points on the map to construct buildings on them. Resource gathering is automatic, and micromanagement is limited to building troops and buildings, and using their respective abilities. This is probably for the best, because at any time, you can TURN INTO A DRAGON, essentially turning the game into Panzer Dragoon as you lay waste to the enemy. This is a unique power that only the player can use in single player, making battles slightly one sided. The controls and balance and generic look of all the units make the RTS portion difficult to swallow. RTS games, generally, do not mesh well with other genres, and I believe the game is at it's weakest when you are forced to this. I switched it to Easy mode halfway through so I could just stomp through and get back to the character dialogue. There's alot of issues with this mashup that make it hard to recommend it to everyone. But if you're willing to endure sub-par gameplay in order to get to some great character interaction and story, then you may just want to give this one a try.			"

												The game is so shallow it's painfull. So braod it doesn't deliver on any of the things it promisses.The RTS part: - AI is so bad it's useless- UI is counter intuitive- It is hard to tell the different units and their abilities- Units need micromanagement though they die long before being usefull- the pathfinding is dreadfull- Turrets are useless- The recruit system is completelly broken once you topple the recruits on your side the AI goes on ""do nothing stance"" - There is little you CAN do to recover once you go below a limit of recruits - there are little to no strategies- The Dragon is useless, the only part where the dragon could be usefull is the beginning but at that point you don't have it.The Turn Based map conquest:- The UI is completelly broken and unintuitivelly and it makes no sense either.- You can produce very little units though when you're in RTS mode you can spawn many many more- There are problems with point and click??!?!?! How can that be a problem in a 2013 title????- You are in a flying fortress but it can't move? What's that all about?- Building units, buildings is stupid and makes no sense - statuses are hard to getThe action part - the Dragon riding- You have very little controll of what is happening on the ground- Any anti air instantly puts you out of your misery- Your fire power is the same as one of a soldiers but you can fly and shoot a bit faster- You have no damage plus against anything - you'd expect a Dragon to instill fear or destroy buildings fast-something, no you get some cards you can play which give you some advantages but they are somehow still useless.- Manuverability and ui is broken here too...The politics - just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, even the latest Mass Effect has ten factors more depth then this, plus it is prety pointless too..This game is built much along the lines of aquanox mixed with a nonsense RTS... if you want a good game with depth, story, action AQUANOX 2: REVELATION is a few times better and a decade older...This game is pure nonsensical, the fact that the Dragon is useful only as a support unit??? Really ??? It is a damn DRAGON! It should be the spear head, the epic unit... but it is nothing more then a weak support unit.My advice steer clear of this mess, want a good RPG with depth and action get the 10 years older Aquanox2 want a more modern one get Mass Effect, want an RTS get Star Craft, want turn based get a heroes game. This game could have been a classic it fails at every single thing it tries.Just BAD! This game is unfinished, unpolished... just avoid at all cost!			"

The campaign strategy and RTS elements are quite simple but enjoyable nonetheless.The highlight is without a doubt role-playing an Emperor in a fascinating and hilarious steampunk fantasy world. The dialogue is well written and the voice acting is terrific. The choices you confront can be pretty tough and interesting.

												While I do recommend this game, it's very hard to recommend. In reality, I'd suggest it on a whim, while warning that it really should be bought when it's on sale... Or free...The gameplay is interesting, though a bit annoying at times. The political simulation bit, involving marriage of princesses and keeping relations high with various races is interesting. Yet at the same time it's time consuming and provides very little to the actual strategy and flow of the rest of the game.The combat is nice, flows very easily when you are in the Dragon Commander role. Flying through the sky, blowing up every little thing that gets into your path is always nice. The controls for it are simple, and work very well. On the other hand, the real time strategy part is lacking. Once you get a steamroll going, your opponent can't stop you. Likewise, the computer/other player can do the same to you. If you lack a strong army to start the round off with, then you will get dominated.The cards add useful effects, but are a bit limited in variety. Mostly they add units, make units cheaper, or sabatoge the enemy.The graphics are very nice, very lifelike with the animations. But not enough to keep you distracted from the annoying aspects of the game.All in all, I give it a 3/5. It's not great, but it isn't horrible. Buy it at your own risk.			"

The problem is your dragon is incredibly powerful, and you can just fireball everything to death very quickly. luckily it's countered by you only being able to participate in one battle per turn. It's a good one, I'd say it's worth at least 25 dollars, get it if it's on sale. It doesn't hold back when it comes to politics either, so be prepaired to get some pretty dificult decisions.			"

												A hidden gem of a game, especially if you enjoy role-playing from a leadership and strategy perspective. The world and cast is very colourful and genuinely engaging. The campaign strategy and RTS elements are quite simple but enjoyable nonetheless.The highlight is without a doubt role-playing an Emperor in a fascinating and hilarious steampunk fantasy world. The dialogue is well written and the voice acting is terrific. The choices you confront can be pretty tough and interesting. In future I would love to see an even more in-depth version of just the ""emperor simulator"", or a game focussing on just that aspect with even more detail.			"

												While I do recommend this game, it's very hard to recommend. In reality, I'd suggest it on a whim, while warning that it really should be bought when it's on sale... Or free...The gameplay is interesting, though a bit annoying at times. The political simulation bit, involving marriage of princesses and keeping relations high with various races is interesting. Yet at the same time it's time consuming and provides very little to the actual strategy and flow of the rest of the game.The combat is nice, flows very easily when you are in the Dragon Commander role. Flying through the sky, blowing up every little thing that gets into your path is always nice. The controls for it are simple, and work very well. On the other hand, the real time strategy part is lacking. Once you get a steamroll going, your opponent can't stop you. Likewise, the computer/other player can do the same to you. If you lack a strong army to start the round off with, then you will get dominated.The cards add useful effects, but are a bit limited in variety. Mostly they add units, make units cheaper, or sabatoge the enemy.The graphics are very nice, very lifelike with the animations. But not enough to keep you distracted from the annoying aspects of the game.All in all, I give it a 3/5. It's not great, but it isn't horrible. Buy it at your own risk.			"

												3.8 hours is likely not enough to accurately judge the quality of this game.Unfortunately, it's all I could stomach after 3 attempts.Everything I encountered in the game is interconnected in an interesting way - The board game map influences your economy and the RTS battles, the political decisions affect the board game map, etcIt's interesting, but I am not a fan of empire building board games (I loathe settlers of catan) so it's flat for me.If you dig strategic board games, it looks like this game has a lot of depth you'll love.For me, none of the parts are entertaining enough to suffer through the whole board gamey-feel.

												It is an RTS, also tactic turn based strategy, adventure, and dragon flying action simulator all in one. It may seem weird at first, but slowly you will really get into the world and story of the game and will like it. The overall story might not be one of the best, but conversing with characters and revealing their personal stories is interesting, interacting with diplomats from other nation, deciding new decrees, trying to please your wife (who is either elf, dwarf, lizard or undead) is just topping of the game. Then you get into RTS battle and everything changes, it is fast paced and not that you are ordering dozens of troops around, you also fly around as almighty dragon spewing your fiery rage on enemies. Oh yeah.			"

												This game is just awful. There is no rythm or reason to the fight mechanics. The enemy just heads to your main base and done. Combat is rather dull and boring and the game is to heavily focused on your part as dragon to take over the combat. The others aspects of the game ( troop development, politics and generals) are a good part of the game but at the same time, it boils down to the fighting mech and that♥♥♥♥♥♥is awful. 5/10Edit: The story writting is really good and it has a really good premises behind it with the dialouge from the characters make it more indepth but the politics just ruin the game for me. It completely takes you out of the games by forcing you to choice a certain (which are from the current mordern political time) and has ZERO impact on the actual game, you only lose 5% with that faction( I lost 4% luck from the undead and have no clue how luck is involed in the game!!)  and that is it. If Larian wanted to make this a political simulator, then they should have just done that. By them forcing the player to choice every other turn is just daunting and redundant and it takes away from the actual game which is a RTS!!!!			"

												Excellent game in so many respects. The political sections, the voice acting, the feeling of being the illegitimate child of an emperor.But the RTS sections are weak and you might find that you don't really want to play them at all. It's too fiddly to select units on the fly and therefore the special attacks become useless. I also found that utilising my dragon attacks without dying was a chore -- the game didn't seem to accept that I was clicking on the ground when I told it to.I also lost a battle for a capital simply because I couldn't get rid of my tens of transports that I'd used to bring my forces -- in fact I think that having all the transports seemed to get rid of my other forces from the map. I had tens of expensive air units that simply were not in the battle. I tried to move the transports away from the battle (with the island it took place on so crammed that In the end I just autoresolved. This was a ""100% you will win"" battle rendered unwinnable by the mass of useless transports on the battle map. Ridiculous.			"

												This game was such a mixed bag for me.  I loved the role playing elements where you go about the ship learning the stories of the wonderfully varied characters.  Your generals and advisers all have their unique slants on things, but the politics just keep sliding into left wing versus right wing issues.  The lack of a third option in most of the policy decisions got a bit old, though this gets evened out with the range of topics.The map/Risk portion of the game starts out managable enough.  But once you clear the first map, the second one pops up cluttered with a free for all that I could barely keep up with.Then there is the real time strategy portion.  It doesn't take long before each level just feels like the same old slog.  The object is essentially to build up your zerg rush to beat the opponent's zerg rush.  Constantly having clusters of units makes it difficult to keep everything sorted.  A little extra zoom would have gone a long way to keep the units from feeling small and hard to pick out from each other.  Stockpiling resources was another issue.  Once an area's entire population has been recruited, both player's unspent resources start to dwindle away.  This is particularly bothersome when you reach the population cap for your units.  After that it's a long, slow road to starve out your opponent before throwing your whole army into the fray.  I have yet to play a single map where I could bag a quick, decisive win.  In fact, with a computer constantly attacking my territories, I kept having to play the same two or three boring maps over and over again with overall progress left at a crawl.As for playing as a dragon, it's a nice mechanic to break up the RTS tedium.  It's just too bad that your army requires too much micro-management to really let you go nuts.The makers of this title got it mostly right with the RPG elements, but they really could have upped the RTS game.

												Before anything I would have to recommend this game. Here's why: The story elements to this are masterful and I felt like everything I did in the end added some kind of meaning to the people around me and how they responded with some more than comical lines slipping their way in.Now here's some little things about it that rubbed me wrong at first. For one the strategy map at first confused the hell out of me and took me off guard, for people whom have ever played RISK such as myself I actually liked it and felt it was a nice change from most typical maps you see in most strategy games. I must critize the combat though in RTS, it's not only unfair most of the time with the AI merely rushing you at every oppurtunity but also the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t odds you have to fight against with them clearly obtaining unfair advantages even in later game play, I never seem to feel like I have the upper hand going into it unless the odds are overwhelming this caused me to dread the RTS element the jetpack was actually a lot of fun but that doesn't save it from being a definate negative element as the other factors lead me to automatically reslove most of the time. But high praise for the story and the way it progress though for those willing to risk a (kind of?) spoiler the ending is BULLS**T I felt ripped off with the ending. The journey there however. Stunning. I just felt that end kind of left me wanting, but honestly that doesn't really detract from it. I would easily recommend this.			"

You play as a half-dragon who needs to defeat his crazed siblings and restore order to the land of Rivellon.Combat works as a sort of mini-RTS with the twist of being able to join the battle in dragon-form.In addition to the war, you must also deal with politics, which will affect several aspects of the war depending on your decisions.

												The RTS battles might not be very deep and it is a bit too easy to just tear through battles using the dragon form. But what makes it simple is also what makes it accessible and somewhat charming. Although it is quite possible to find yourself in a battle in which the opponent has the clear upper hand, due to the maneuvering of units on the tactical map before battle. In these fights you need to a little bit tactical and know when and where to strike with your dragon.What sells this game though, is not so much the battles, but the social political interactions you'll make between fights. The story is not very deep, but the characters are so endearing that they make up for it. The voice acting is stellar in 95% of the cases and the writing very witty and often clever. I basically play this game for the sake of the characters. And because I'm quite fond of the Divinity universe.			"

So braod it doesn't deliver on any of the things it promisses.The RTS part: - AI is so bad it's useless- UI is counter intuitive- It is hard to tell the different units and their abilities- Units need micromanagement though they die long before being usefull- the pathfinding is dreadfull- Turrets are useless- The recruit system is completelly broken once you topple the recruits on your side the AI goes on ""do nothing stance"" - There is little you CAN do to recover once you go below a limit of recruits - there are little to no strategies- The Dragon is useless, the only part where the dragon could be usefull is the beginning but at that point you don't have it.The Turn Based map conquest:- The UI is completelly broken and unintuitivelly and it makes no sense either.- You can produce very little units though when you're in RTS mode you can spawn many many more- There are problems with point and click??!?!?! How can that be a problem in a 2013 title????- You are in a flying fortress but it can't move? What's that all about?- Building units, buildings is stupid and makes no sense - statuses are hard to getThe action part - the Dragon riding- You have very little controll of what is happening on the ground- Any anti air instantly puts you out of your misery- Your fire power is the same as one of a soldiers but you can fly and shoot a bit faster- You have no damage plus against anything - you'd expect a Dragon to instill fear or destroy buildings fast-something, no you get some cards you can play which give you some advantages but they are somehow still useless.- Manuverability and ui is broken here too...The politics - just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, even the latest Mass Effect has ten factors more depth then this, plus it is prety pointless too..This game is built much along the lines of aquanox mixed with a nonsense RTS... if you want a good game with depth, story, action AQUANOX 2: REVELATION is a few times better and a decade older...This game is pure nonsensical, the fact that the Dragon is useful only as a support unit??? Really ??? It is a damn DRAGON! It should be the spear head, the epic unit... but it is nothing more then a weak support unit.My advice steer clear of this mess, want a good RPG with depth and action get the 10 years older Aquanox2 want a more modern one get Mass Effect, want an RTS get Star Craft, want turn based get a heroes game. This game could have been a classic it fails at every single thing it tries.Just BAD! This game is unfinished, unpolished... just avoid at all cost!			"

												This is a fun RTS game with an interesting twist. You are a dragon with a jetpack. If you aren't sold already I don't know what the hell will sell you. Being a dragon is great fun and the strategy is alright but not that difficult. Another interesting thing is the fact that it's a RPG where you make decisions that influence your empire. It's an interesting system but it lacks too much depth. Overall great game that's fun to play but the RPG and strategy elements are lacking.			"

												Divinity series always likes to get my attention one way or another but when I sit down to eat at the dinner table it only serves boiled radishes and gravy. At that point in time I remove myself from said table and promptly exit the premises reminding myself never to be duped again.So as I am eating the radishes that is Dragon Commander I find I am served with actual food, graham crackers. Dragon commander has a pretty interesting way of mixing empire managment, a card game, RTS, 3rd person (DRAGON) combat and some simplistic relationship building between your queen and generals. All of it is solid, except the RTS that's terrible and not just because I don't do RTS...it's bad.Overall it's a well rounded experience though replayability isn't that great unless you have other player dragons to torch..but eh...what can you say.3 out of 5 Chiliwigs			"

												While I do have a few gripes with Dragon Commander, I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a blast.  Fantastic voice acting, meaningful moral choices that...actually aren't totally black and white, and an interesting bit of RTS and table top strategy, with a Dragon wearing a jetpack mixed in for good measure, make this a mess that shouldn't work...but it does.  IT DOES WORK!  This game is glorious for any fans of strategy.My major gripes are with the rather blah main story, you'll get most of your story fix from just interacting with your crew and friends than the ""plot"" as it were, some moral choices and characters that ARE as stupid and pointless as they seem, a lack of differentiation between the hero and enemy on the field of battle, and generally being a pain to actually get going...it took me three days to make it work on my laptop.That being said, once this game gets rolling, it is supremely fun.  I've found myself thinking ""Just five more minutes"" on this until I've spent an hour longer than I wanted to playing.  Highly recommended, in spite of my gripes.			"

												While the RTS/RISK elements are fun at first, it gets tiring after a while. The political sim parts really got stuck in my craw. You are supposed to be the Emperor-apparent, slaughtering your way to your rightful place and aided by a competent, dutiful Cabinet. Instead, you are a little ♥♥♥♥♥ being insulted and hamstrung at every turn by petty, horribly-written advisors and generals. Nearly all the issues that you are to deal with is political garbage brought in directly from Tumblr and the like. It's a horrible political Party survey masquerading as a game.Considering the massive amount of cut content, and where they were planning to go during development before they decided to let this game be released♥♥♥♥♥♥up, this game could have really been something. All this game is, summed up, is a missed opportunity.			"

												The concept has a lot of potential and the campaign modes is fun to play with. However, the RTS side of the game is really lacking, and relies on the player buying everything they can, as fast as they can. You can opt to avoid the RTS side of the game, but then the whole point of difference of the game, which is, of course, playing as a dragon, is gone. Quite an overpriced game given this, and so I wouldn't reccomend buying it. I got it as a part of the Humble Bundle, so I can say that I didn't ~lose~ anything by playing the game.			"

												This game is amazing. Its beautiful, interesting, political, and a strange mix of several types of game. Its everything I could ever want!But it is too damn difficult. I turned it down to casual mode and still got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me. You'd better approach this game with an ""attack attack attack!"" mindset, because otherwise it'll cave your freaking skull in. I conquered an entire map, save for one providence, then sent everything I had at the last territory. He (the AI) proceeded to fend me off with 2/3 the number of units, pulled upgrade cards, and wiped out everything I had. Next turn, he sent guys in every direction and took back 2/3 of the world map, took my capital, and overthrew all the progress I'd made.The game does NOT hold your hand when introducing new concepts like the RTS portion, it does NOT tell you that games can turn on a dime, and it does NOT let you know that numbers mean nothing. ""strong against"" and ""weak against"" rule the entire game in a rock-paper-scissors fashion, so don't get too attached to any certain type of unit. Also, how does one become a dragon and fight, as advertised? It doesn't tell you, just drops you into a battle. Goodluck!In short:It needs tutorials.The easy mode needs to be EASY.""Attack-attack-attack"" is the ONLY way to winEven the first map will ♥♥♥♥ing destroy you if you idle for one or two turns.Superior numbers mean NOTHING.Its gorgeous! Its interesting! I want to love it so much, I do!But its ♥♥♥♥ing terrible when it gets going! Avoid it! "

												This game comes as close to my idea of a dream game as possible: You are a ruler with the responsibility to unite the land against your foes, all the while managing your army and dealing with your military and diplomatic staff.Military desicions are made from a world map à la risk, and all your political and diplomatic interactions will occur aboard your flagship 'The Raven', which contains a vast secret. Your political standings and the opinions and behaviors of your generals react to the decisions you make, which in turn reflect on the battlefield, whether it be increased favor from the gods, or a high popular opinion with the common people of the lands.

While it has succeeded at creating a decent storyline, dialogue and characters; the other major part of the game, the strategical bits, are mediocre and feel half-arsed. The strategy map is like risk, but far worse. The tactical bit is just a zerg rush of units with you sometimes morphing into the dragon to dump some overpowered♥♥♥♥♥kicking into the fray.If you're looking for strategy, look elsewhere.

												Eventually got around to completing the campaign after having it in my gamelist for over a year.Now I can say it's pretty dull and feels like an unfinished game. Lacks all kinds of meaty bits to make it worth buying. The political descisions are just boring. All they do is give a slight buff to certain areas like money, tech or approval. I prefer my choices on potentially world changing decisions to impact more than numbers on a spreadsheet.A large portion of the characters are impossible to like since they go out of their way to make sure you understand you can't do anything right no matter what you choose. Halfway through the second chapter I stopped caring who I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off since they are all forgettable. They aren't there to enhance the immersion, the story, or the gameplay. They're just there to yell at you when you choose option A over option B or visa versa, makes no difference in the long run.			"

												0/10Do NOT under any circumstance get this game. It is beyond badly designed. You will start out owning 1 country with only enough resources for a few( like 3) combat units. Your opponent will start off with 6 countries and every time without fail (it's even in the map they show on their first video) the enemy will grab one of the only two neutral countries you are able to grab at the beginning of the game. So it will have 7 countries with the army that those countries can provide and then the AI will not hesitate to take your capital and make you lose the game (with its very first turn, that is how close the enemy is WHEN YOU START THE GAME) with all 24 of it's units to your meager 3. I restarted the campaign 4 times to see if I was just unlucky. Nope every single time I was SWARMED with so many enemy units it was literally impossible to keep up. You only produce about 6 gold per turn to buy units while your opponent gets 30+.Utterly bad concept for game designers. There should be several buffer zones between you and the opponent until you can figure out what is what. The RTS portion of the game is utter garbage, it will consist of who can button mash the most units faster than the other. No it will not tell you what the hell each building is or what your resources are it will just throw you into a skirmish and give you a crash course on what the hell each building is or does (and not explain why each building is important and which ones you need to build to counter your opponent or how many resources each one costs or how you can capture the stupid little land plots OR tell you which building produces which unit). There is absolutely 0 time for you to get used to the game mechanics because the AI will just bum rush you with every unit it can spawn. There is 0 tactical skill needes it's literally A click and whoever spawns the most units wins. It's so dumb plus the ""advantage"" you have with your dragon is poultry. It takes 4-5 shots to kill even one unit and they will make hundreds of them. Do NOT get this game you won't get farther than a few turns.			"

												While I love the concept of Dragon Commander, the game is obviously rushed and the writing is the most cliche thing I've ever read.The game play is passable. A nice mashup of total war and dawn of war, but after that? It all goes down hill.The characters are almost universally 2 dimensional. Once you've spoken to them once or twice, you know immediately how they'll react to any given situation without even having to talk to them. They're purly defined by their sterotypes. The bigotted lizard is always bigotted, the sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ general is always a sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the icequeen manhating general is always an icequeen manhater and that's the only thing that ♥♥♥♥ing defines her decisions. It's infuriating. The two most believable characters from the 1st chapter are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥vixen' general, and the Imp Ambassador. While both are probably meant to come off as 'lol random!' they actually come off as believable because they have reasons for their beliefs and decisions that are above and beyond simple sterotypes. I mean, come on. A character has to be VERY badly written when the mad scientist character and the token wildcat female party member are less formulaic than said character is.Also the stuff in anachronystic. A lot of the political decisions make NO sense in context. There's a world war going on. While some of these decisions would make sense when you own more than one country, or even more than one province, when you're just trying to get a foot hold, making a call on gay marriage, for example, is simply not what people are going to be concerned with, at least not on the highest levels of government. Your ambassadors are going to be more worried about the impacts of war on their populations, refugee populations, criminal♥♥♥♥♥♥ Getting the FOUNDATION of your new empire running would take precedence. Establishing public order, getting laws established, all of those things.Finally, the game shows some obviously lazy programming, art, and UI managment. THe game resets the difficulty to normal between games rather than switching it, so you need to check on the difficulty every time you reopen Dragon Commander. The Undead are literally skeleton textures pasted onto humanoid body skeltons and polygons, so that you have bones and jaws moving as if they were made of flesh and muscle, not solid calcified bone.I -really- wanted to like Divinity: Dragon Commander. It was SUCH a cool concept. But it failed so badly in execution on the small things, such as writing and art, that I'm having a hard time suspending my disbelief. Every time the dwarf acts like a neo-con ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over incredibly stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥during a time of ♥♥♥♥ing war, every time the undead is an intollerant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, every time the elf is a hippie even when it would probably cost the lives of his own dudes. All of it just takes me out of the experience.They also could have used a more robust system of imperial politicing. Allowing us to have multiple choices, accepting proposals in part or in full, or even tacking on things to it. Making compromises and settling the thing fully. Not just a simple yay-nay system, with all of the decisions inevitably being 'are you liberal or conservative!'What if I don't want to deport convicts? What if I want to send them to Imp war foundries to help the war effort? What if I want to have limited conscription or at the very least incentivise joining the war effort rather than just ripping people out of their houses and homes?There was so much potential in Dragon Commander. And it feels wasted on this subpar, rushed game.			"

Sure it starts out by letting you win the first act damn near flawlessly but then once you get to act 2 the ""kids gloves"" come off and the AI goes from mildly challenging to more or less point blank grinning at me and saying: ""I can win on any given turn but I""m programed to wait for x number of turns before I do."" from turn 1. That's not stratagy, that's forcing the player to either rush in or make deals with corvos over and over to even have a remote chance of winning before the x number of turns is up.

												So Close, but no cigar,There are aspects of this game that look really good and inviting replayability and but unfortunately the majority of the game drags this down more then a little bit. Units have to be everywhere and it's a mess.  The research and units are lack luster. The ""Auto-Resolve combat"" is a joke. You get 3 commanders and can only use one of the 3? And the combat, this is where it really sucker punches you and where I drew the line after having to do it for the upteenth time because it's one of the core parts of the game. First thing is that you have a few units that you start with followed by a mad rush to the recuritment centers and usually within the first 2 minutes. The units aren't interesting. They don't look cool or have fun abilities.  Enmasse seemed the best way to use them anyways. It kind of feels like a half finished total conversion mod inplanted in a game.But wait, you're a dragon! With......a jetpack. That right there kinda angered me. You're supposed to be this huge majestic dragon in the sky breathing fire on everyone and instead it's almost a comical unit. The Dragon is powerful enough but not overly powerful. His abilities are cool but you felt like this annoying random air unit that went everywhere then some commander.I don't know, I wanted to love this game. I love dragons, I love RTS but going through boring combat/strategic phase over and over again to get a chance to advance the politics. I played 12 hours, paid 10 dollars. I'd say stay away if I were you.			"

												Awsome game, The concept of being a dragon and actually governing a country is amazing. Only flaw I could see is in the RTS portion, no matter what you do there is no way to control the dragon and units at once, so unless you are really possitive that you men will make it through the fight try to set them in base when you go dragon mode. Other than that its truely is good and I give it a 9.5/10 (.5 off because it wasn't perfect)			"

												Fantastically entertaining blend of strategy and political RPG. The writing and voice acting went way above my expectations, easily AAA quality. Most people will find the dialogue excessively wordy, but it's pretty rare to ever hear that comment about a game. Dialogue choices do impact the game, and I made multiple save points so that I could go back and explore the other outcomes. The game very frequently forces you to make the best choice out of several bad choices, and tries to really punch you in the morals at every opportunity. It leans heavily on real-world allegory, and reminds me a lot like being in a commanding role on Deep Space 9 or Babylon 5, but in a fantasy/steampunk setting.The rest of the game is fairly standard turn-based overmap strategy, and real-time tactical combat. The overmap game is very simple, although you'll feel burned by some of the ""rules"" in your first playthrough - the map expands and resets your assets, which can leave you in awkward positions at the start of the next story phase. The tactical combat is generic, however the dragon-mode spices things up. I found myself frustrated at all the limitations on the dragon game mechanics, especially since it's one of the most unique (and heavily advertised) features of the game.Overall I recommend the game to any RTS, RPG, or moral dilemma fan. This game has left me dreaming of a perfect world where the Divinity RPG/story components are married with the solid strategy of a game like StarCraft II.			"

												What can I tell about this game... This is RTS that is great in everything except for RTS batteles themselves. It has dozens of great characters, lots of good humor and awesome style (sereously, just look at how awesome map is, with it's animated detailes and wooden figures, representing units), but lacks in it's RTS component. I'm not telling that it's horribly bad, RTS battles were really exiting at first with turning into dragon stuff and all, but I quickly got borerd of them and started to use autoresolve as frequently as possible, because AI can't present even a little challange, after you get hang of things, more or less (and I played on hard difficulty btw). Yes, RTS has some depth to it, but you won't need most of units and their abilities against AI. Online play is a totaly different thing. With real opponent you can have more than one fun battle and even play a full compain. Yes, and bugs, lots of bugs.Despite  those minuses, I still think thats it's a great game and will recommend it to anybody who won't be scared with concept of RTS-RPG-TBS hybrid. Where else you can decide to allow or not having citizen giant bears for pets, marry an udead princess and turn into a dragon and fly into the sunset? But here's my advice: put diffuculty settings to casual and enjoy great story. And if you want RTS, don't look for it in solo compain, go straight online, or better try another game, seriously.			"

												This is a game where you get to pick your favourite wife and make political decisions. The dialogue is clever and the characters are fun. The political decisions are interesting and there are multiple branching paths. Beyond that, there isn't very much to say. It's quite fun to play, even if at the end of the day the good parts amount to what is essentially a VN with many choices.PS: This game is supposed to be an RTS too but the RTS part sucks and it is better to auto-resolve the battles so you can get back to your fun charactersPPS: You get to play as a dragon with a jetpack in the RTS parts though and that's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing cool			"

												Another RTS that fails to shine, the gameplay is lacking but thats not what people like Dragon Commander for people like it for the politics and diplomacy (also the waifus, dont forget about them waifus).The gameplay is somewat like risk  you use troops to control a overworld, putting a troop in a land that has no enemys protecting it becomes yours/theirs  In the battlefield you have a varity of different unit types to fight with (standard Light, Heavy, Air and Sea) which some are better aganist different types some are better vs air some better vs heavy. You do not build bases rather have a troop capture it then build one of 5 buildings ( One for Light, heavy etc) creating units is fast with it being five seconds at most to create a unit. The main ponit of dragon commander (and downfall) is the dragon mode you can take in battle allowing you to turn into a dragon with skills to use on the enemy, instead of building a balanced army of troops and using tactics you instead Ram all troops you have into the enemys and turn into a dragon to push. Every battle turns into a wait game to use dragon mode then attack and unless the enemy has a huge amount of counter air you will auto win within the first attack. [Side Note: While dragon form breaks the RTS element you still get to ♥♥♥♥ING BE A DRAGON AND NOT A WYRM OR SOME♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRAGON POWERS]Now the non RTS part is the more intresting part of the game and shows the writing of the game, you do your best to appease the NPCS making desiscions that affect your campain (like reduced cost of hiring units for the rest of the campain at the cost of max population in your army). Now about the waifu/love instrest there are four different ones each with there own questlines and have different endings depending on choices you make that will also affect the campain.The game does come with skirimish mode but I would rather play another RTS for a better experaince, replayablity is mainly on the choice side of things.Overall rating would be 7/10  from a team that is used to RPG's the game shine's on the writing it lacks the main ponit of the genre the strategy. I would also recommend only getting this on sale  I dont recommend full price.			"

												This game is defintelty in my favorite games.The combination between strategy, politic and STR is a really good idea and really well done. I have a lot of fun playing the game and it's really nice to play it with other players too.So there are 3 big features in the game.The politic part in the solo where you make choices as chief. It is really interesting for the impact it can have on your army and the world and for the fun it has too. Sometimes the politics ask you very strange or useless things and they are fighting each other to make you choose their decision. This parti is very well written and the story very nice.The strategy map turn based. Interesting part too. The maps are really beautiful and it can be very strategic. There is a card system too where you can use some cards to build buildings on the map, decrease the price of the units in a place, or even mercenary cards to help you in a fight you are disadvantaged. The map , the strategy, and the cards make it really nice and interesting.The RTS. The maps are nice, the different units and capacity too and the fights are really fun. Being able to help your unit by changing in dragon in real time is so good. But I find it a little fast and not always well balanced.To conclude this game is a pearl. You have to play it and have fun with it . Yes all the part are not always well balanced and the RTS is not the best RTS, the strategy map the best strategy map etc... BUT all this combined make this game one of the best game i've played. Judging the game only with one aspect ( like a lot of people do with the rts part ) is bad i think because the game is not only a RTS. The RTS is a part of the game, like the strategy or the politics and it's their combinaison who make this game so good. This is an independant studio so they haven't millions it's why every parti is nice and fun but would need some enhancement.Play It :D			"

												Having played Divinity II - Ego Draconis, I was thrilled to see they had created another game. Game is very fun, with the best part being the political choices and impact they will have. You also have to chose a wife, with the choices being quite funny (But holding a big political impact) The battles are awesome, and if you are getting tired of them you can always have your imperial army or one of your generals battle for you. (For a cost) Having beaten the game, I just wish the campaign was a wee bit longer. All in all, great game. Would give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars. The only gripes I had with the game is that research points become useless fairly quickly (You can max out almost everything before you even hit the second map) and a lot of the dragon abilities seem useless. I would of enjoyed it more if I could of spent research points on existing skills to make them a bit stronger. A idea, have the dragon skills start off weaker. Then allow you to slowly upgrade them in exchange for research points. Think I ended the game with over 450 research points I couldn't do anything with.Haven't tried the multiplayer yet, waiting for a few friends to pick up the game. (Hint hint)			"

												Awesome game, a new take on the RTS genre. It plays well, with minor bugs, but has the potensial for many hours of awesome gameplay and replayability. I would recommend this for the RTS nerd that wants a little extra to bring in the mix. It's more simplistic in the main RTS part of the game (reminds me of the CnC series in a way) and mixes it with both turnbased terretory expansion (ala Total war series) and a 3rd person shooter within the main battle. And on top of that is a very interesting RPG element that makes awesome choises with different outcomes. The AI would be awesome if it was a little better balanced, for new players can easly plow through both easy and normal, but once you start on hard, it quickly become way to hard, and all AI target you, rather then each other.This game is very cool to show of, and the multiplayer shows the true potential of it. tons of fun, and a great intro to something that might become an Multiplayer classic.would like to see more map variety, and factions. other than that it hits a solid 9/10 for me.

												I love this game. having said that its not the best game on the market, and I wouldnt recomend spending the $40 on the game when its being sold at full price. Dragon Comander combines political decisions and large scale conquest. a decision you make in your throne room can have huge effects on the battle field whether its making units absurdly cheap or making the inhabitants of a cretian country give you less aid. often I found my self in a situation where i could make a decision i agreed with and would offend one of the five races or one that would gain me support even though i disagreed with it. And I like being put in that kind of situation, it really brings the game to life.			"

												Divinity: Dating Sim is a far better description for this game, because you don't do a lot of commanding. 6.5/10As someone who plays RTS's relatively frequently, Divinity comes up short outside of the campaign map. There's a ton of units to choose from, all with well-animated steampunk flavor, but many of them are locked by out-of-map research options. I quickly realized that the first 2-3 units can do almost all the work I ever needed, and that was boring.And that's really the problem with DDC. the core RTS fighting is just booooooorrrrriiiiiing. I think at some point the developers realized this, as they seem to have spent quite a bit of development time coming up with ways for me to avoid the boring top-down play. Hence they have the 'dragon' mechanic, allowing you to turn into a dragon with a jetpack(cool idea I guess), and an MMO-esque hotbar of powers to roast enemies with, as well as allowing your generals to auto-resolve the combat for you, giving you a % boost depending on their particular skills to the outcome.But even that gets old quick. The RTS play is your standard(ugh, I hate that this is standard now) click specific spots to build from a radial tree of buildings(ala LOTR's RTS, etc. So no starcraft base building). I -do- like the 'population' mechanic, in that both sides have an upper number to how many units can ever be built in a single match(and once you run out, no more units can be built) Though it did help me find the boring, but incredibly effective style of 'sit in my base as a dragon, roast enemies until the timer goes down, rinse, repeat' that allowed me to defeat any army the enemy threw at me as long as I managed my resources even half decently, up to and including enemy capitals with significantly larger starting forces then my own. There's no time limit that I can see while being a dragon other than being defeated and well, you're a hyper-powerful dragon. Using a few units as bait you can divebomb enemies essentially at will, since their AI doesn't have very good threat detection.The game really shines in the parts of it that have nothing to do with combat. Every Dragon Commander gets to make policy among your advisors, generals, and general hanger-ons. The characters are larger then life and incredibly hammy in terms of writing, but it works for the sparking super-steampunk atmosphere the game cultivates. Prissy elves that demand you rever nature and gay rights, Dwarves that are all about money and booze, hper-religious undead, scientific, war-hungry Imps and socialistic, upper-crust lizardfolk  all vie for your attention and favor, which supposedly changes how certain territories produce gold and research for your in-combat gameplay. Unfortunately, it didn't really seem to do much other then I lost out on a gold piece or two, and with how easy the combat was I didn't miss it at all.There isn't ANY option to play a female commander, which is a let down, so if you're into playing a pretty empress you'll be sorely dissappointed. This is surprisingly bizarre not just because we've come to expect options for faceless main character customization before(the only character model you as emperor even have is a giant, scaled monster after all), but because the game makes constant attempts to have you influence policy for gender equality(for or against). You can't even make the argument that only a male heir can become the emperor, since in the campaign itself your 'sisters' are also attemptingto take the throne, so clearly that isn't a barrier for rule.You also get to choose a 'princess' to marry from the other races(Wierdly, your advisor declares you'll be a racist for choosing a human mate, despite being a half dragon. Probably because there's no human politician you get a bonus to, since humans oddly have no bearing on the civilian happiness-index, yet appear everywhere on your ship and were the species where the last emperor came from). Despite my sadness at them not allowing you to choose an Imp princess(they're really the best faction IMO- science and pragmatic explosions are fun, and having sex with an undead animated skeleton is apparently more ok for the Devs then a tiny pink goblin), I found the princess options rather fun, since only one of them really even cares about you as anything other than a money-sink or political tool. This starts a dating-sim esque setting that pops up over the course of the campaign, which I honestly found myself way more interested in, to the point I started auto-resolving every fight and skipping turns to keep going.All in all I found DDC a sub-par RTS, but a hilariously over-written political dating sim. I think if they ever make a sequel, axing the combat in favor of making choices for your generals to hand out would be far more enjoyable, since the combat just sucks all fun out of the campaign, even when auto-resolving, since it wastes time I could have been making social decisions over things like gay rights, animal control, and government scholarships. Since none of the good/bad writing makes it over into the campaign map, it also sucks the flavor out of the game as well. If you like RTS play, skip this title, ut if you like quirky storylines and don't mind the lack of a female main character option, it's worth it on sale.			"

												I have never heard of the Divinity series before but after this game, I believe I'm going to try my hand out on more of them. I just bought the Divinity Anthology and I am currently waiting for it to come in the mail. Divinity: Dragon Commander was enjoyable. This is the first time I've ever seen a strategy game like this. It has included all of my faviorte elements of games I enjoyed today, such as Mass Effect, Risk, the Total War series, and put them together into one big pot. The RTS battles were a bit difficult though, even on casual. With the enemy troops constantly zerg rushing, camera controls being awful, and with not the best computer out there, I found the RTS battles extremely difficult, so I avoided them during the campaign part of the game. The controls in RTS will probably take some time getting use to, especially for new players playing RTS games for the first time. Just using the turtorial alone to get a feel of the game isn't enough, you'll need to pratice a bit with skirmish battles., that and the tutorial is very lacking. I wish they included much more useful tips in it.Playing as a dragon with a jet pack is really fun in the RTS battles, my only complaint is how difficult it is to handle your troops and micro manage as a dragon. Not to mention selecting them is a bit difficult. I died quite a few times when I attempting to get the hang of things. The dragon can be a life savor though if you're inexperience. Overall, I enjoyed the Risk like board in the campaign mode, and I really enjoyed the politics and how it affected your army, gold, and troop morale. I attempted to play the game as a good character and it was difficult having to pick the higher road when in return you had to sacrifice resources. Sometimes, the high road can hit you badly with its outcomes. This is perhaps the first time I've seen a stratagey game with rpg elements, I really enjoyed the different characters and their personalities. It's important to interact with your generals as much as you can, seeing as finishing their stories will improve your chances on the battle field. I didn't realize unil the end of Act II that your actions can affect the personality changes in your generals, and that there is more than one ending for them, and the princessess that you can marry which makes the replay value in this game high, seeing as the choices you make can lead to different outcomes. With the Imperial pack, there is a chart/diagram that can show you the different outcomes for each character, not to mention some behind the scene stuff, concept rp, and a dlc.I highly recommend this game for others; this is something refreshing in the strategy genre. There were a few things that I had quirks about, like the rewarding for zerg rushing, how insanely powerful your dragon can become when maxed out and control issues, but overall, I believe the good parts of the game out weigh the bad part. I wouldn't give it a ten out of ten, but it's a lovely game to have in your library. Hopefully, the other Divinity games will be too. For certain, I'll have to make a guide and indepth review for this game in the future.			"

												An interesting take on strategy based games with both RTS segments and tabletop territory capture and troops movements. You also get to discuss politics with your Generals with realworld topics about war, racism, sexism, religion and more. Eveyone has their own opinion and you get to decide either by doing what you think is ""right"" or by playing the politics game and manipulation your alliances.It's pretty profund in some aspects but sadly, at the time i first played it, the RTS part of the game suffered from a lack of polish as base building and capturing was tedious and pointless when you only needed to spam your fireballs around the map and be agile. Units do have strengths and weaknesses but ultinately, it's not really a question of strategy but if you participate actively as a dragon or not.Still fun though.			"

												This game is 3 games roled into one. Base building RTS, Grand stratagy and a Ruling style sim. The latter 2 are functional and enjoyable, especially the charicter interactions and dialogue. Your actions in that area matter and has a colourful and unique setting. The RTS element is lacking, unit spamming and grinding, but the dragon combat is fun and makes a change from the norm. In short this game needs a bigger, better longer developed successor to be a complete package, but given how good the other 2 main elements are I have to reccomend this as a unique gaming experience and and an original idea in practise.

												Dragon Commander is a relatively sub-par RTS with some elements of Risk. Its most notable aspect are the political side of the game, in which you must decide on issues presented by ambassadors for each race. Most Choices simply adjust a few statistics for the RTS/Risk section of the game, and have very little story relevence. Not quite worth the regular price, but when on sale it may be worth some interest.			"

												One of my favorite PC games of all time. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes large battles and making decisions that shake the fabric of the world you play in. The final level isn't the best but I found tons of replay value in this game due to the sheer number of ways the world can unfold. Also you're a dragon with a jetpack!!! How much cooler can you get?!?!?			"

												Dragon Commander is a relatively sub-par RTS with some elements of Risk. Its most notable aspect are the political side of the game, in which you must decide on issues presented by ambassadors for each race. Most Choices simply adjust a few statistics for the RTS/Risk section of the game, and have very little story relevence. Not quite worth the regular price, but when on sale it may be worth some interest.			"

												First of, I have to say this is one of the most fun RTS games I've played since Starcraft. It does have its flaws, like later in the game you become too strong as a dragon and using your dragon in combat feels way too uneven for your opponent. But that aside, the RTS aspect, and the fact you CAN join the battle yourself rather than commanding fleets of mobs, creatures and machines is very mind-gripping, and you'll be addicted very quick. The story, on the other hand, while being very interesting and making you feel like you're a true part of it, has it's giggles as well. Quite worth the dosh, I'd definitely recommend it.Also, you can marry an elf chick. +1(Or a dead chick who is just bones...if that's your sort of thing...)			"

The game: Divinity: Dragon Commander is a blend of different genres – Realtime strategy (RTS), Turn Based Strategy (TBS) and 3rd (Dragon)Person Shooter:3 different dragons to choose from, representing different styles of play	1)Turn based political and tactical game with a 2)RTS part between rounds that has a 3) 3rd Person shooter built into it ^.^	Yeah, that’s what it is really , don´t look so confused ! 	Your decision in the story/campaign mode influence the course of the game (to a point) and also give you different positive or negative effects for the battles and the global war effort	Research in different areas like dragon powers, units or buildings is possible	Converse with your Generals to plan the next move in the war effort.    Try to manage relations with different factions that inhabit the lands you are waging your war FirstLook at Dragon Commander on my twitch channel[www.twitch.tv]Larian studios put a lot of effort in to make a game that is not only a RPG but also a turn-based game and has FPS parts. We get a solid RTS game with a twist. You can transform and fly as dragon into the enemy armies and breathe fire down the enemies steam-punky robot necks. The dragon steering in the RTS part takes getting used to while speeding with your winged killing machine through the enemies base. But after that – it is pure fun, and also nicely balanced. The AI is reacting nicely to the use of dragon powers by the player and can apply different tactics accordingly. 3 different game styles in one game demand some more concentration and ability to absorb information than I am used to though. The gameplay consists of turns in which you converse with your different generals. These generals offer some dialogue options and insight into their tactical opinions. The generals are fully voiced and that is very well done. Furthermore you plan your moves on the strategy map, where you decide which enemy territory to attack or which neutral island you want to conquer next. This is also where you build one specific building per territory and use most of you commander skills (represented by game cards). If you choose to invade / move to a country that is occupied by an enemy, you will have a battle before your next strategy turn. (That would be the RTS part) Furthermore you have to manage relations with the different factions of people living in the lands you wage war in. Those are also fully voiced, very well done representatives of some well known fantasy world inhabiting races.Look and feel and sound: Visually the game is good-looking  except maybe for the RTS part which seems a bit clunky. The Camera controls need to be mastered and you need quite a bit of orientation to actually know where you are after speeding through the battlefield as a dragon. Some of the dragons abilities sound a bit flat and could have used more “ooommph” but that is maybe just me needing more feedback from those abilities to enjoy them to the fullest. Captains Orders: If you can enjoy an experiment and don´t expect the RTS part of the game to be on par with, for example, Starcraft you are in for a treat. I found the game very entertaining and well worth a second look after my first mission. Especially the ”dragon-regent-simulator”, basically a turn based mix of Roleplaying and Empire management is very well done! Verdict: (Introducing the new 3-Tier rating system “Treasure/Cargo/Over board”)Divinity Dragon Commander is Cargo – Kept for further shenanigans! Check my TwitchChannel[www.twitch.tv] for streams of dragoncommander and other games.			"

												I am a big fan of the divinity series.I liked the story of this one.Political and decisions are awesome too.But rts command is not so good. It is only about - capture asap and spam the enemy with units, assisting them here and there with your dragon.To be honest these battles were the worst experience in this game. I would be much happier without these.Still other positive sides such as graphic, soundtrack, political system and huge replayability allow me to recommend this game without any doubt. "

												Dragon Commander is a decent game. Not perfect in any sense. Here is the good and the bad:The good:Playing in dragon form is pretty fun. Flying around the battlefield, destroying tanks and other units gives me no end of pleasure.  The steam-punk vibe and uniformed gameplay is enjoyable. The bad: There isn't enough tech/abilities for the length of the game - I maxed out all of my abilities and tech in the first part of the campain. When I got to the next chapter, I had nothing to do with my research points and I kept just getting more. The balance isn't perfect - it takes way too long to beat the game at the rate you do things, not that I mind a long and heartfelt battle, but I was having nothing new to do when I got into the second act.These are a few of the things I saw, could go into more but won't :) The baseline? The game is fun in the fact you get to play a mighty dragon and as a stragety game it isn't terrible, but don't spend the full amount on the game. Wait till its on sale till you buy it.			"

												This game has a lot to offer, fresh ideas mix RPG, RTS, Turn Based (only on Strategic view) and some conquest mode like 4X games, but not so much, the graphics for character is astonishing, only on Strategic view, but when we played the RTS gameplay, it really not so amazing, the map just reguler, not so epic, the unit not so much beatiful, doesn't have a lot of variety, althougt they have  different race such as undead, dwarf, elf and lizard folks, but unfortunetly the unit in RTS gameplay all looks the same, infact it's the same, they just made a different unit for land, sea and air, but that's it, no variety in term off race, you can summon Dragon (3 type of Dragon), in Multiplayer this game is fun, but only for a while, and than you'll get bored, the story is not bad, if only the Developer added a lot of variety of unit in differents race, building, etc than this game will be as good as they say.

												Graphics are good, writing is good, gameplay is absolutely horrid.Tried to play the game's RTS mode, there was no tutorial on how to control anything, but found building units in the RTS mode is slow, while the enemy can just conintue pumping them out at a pretty fast rate.I was then told to play it like Risk by leaving battles up to chance, which didn't work either as the enemy will relentlessly attack your captured countries, quickly outnumbering you as they drain whatever few units you're actually able to build.After several attempts to win a 31% chance battle for my captial, I gave up.I give this game a 4/10 for how many times I was forced to reload after rolling bad RNGIf you're EXTREMELY paitent with the RNG, I think you can enjoy this game, but I simply could not.

												So, you like games like Civilization, Total War, or Age of Empires?  End of story, at least give Dragon Commander a try, it has an amusing blend of RPG which reminded me of Star Craft, but allows you to fight toe to toe with your enemy while also managing an entire field of combat.  It's hard to get used to, with the fast paced RTS battles, but it is easily possible to get used to.  I would not pass up at least looking at this game if you're a strategy gamer.			"

												I've been playing this game for a few hours(Without sound mind you, as the files apparently only just figured out they were missing), and yet I was still enjoying it quite a bit. While it's a little bit easy to just turn into a dragon and melt your opponent's entire army, it still feels fun. The controls remain responsive enough, and the steampunk era clothing and technology tickles me in all the right places.However, this is still a very rough cut game. It's strategy is to just have more units for the most part, and the AI is quickly outsmarted by the smallest amount of micro. You can win battles you should be assured to lose just by moving damaged units back, as the AI will either stop firing to try and kill that unit still, thus advancing into your entire army, or give up on the target, which allows you to essentially laugh off any unfavorable engagement with the right clicking.I am, however, a little bit discouraged by the way some of the things are phrased in the campaign.Political choices are a plain black and white, and the Dwarves always end up on the losing side of minority when it comes to decision making, leaving you to try and keep them all around 40%, or to just ruin one race's political standing entirely, without hope for recompense. I feel as if there should have been a few more options that 'Yay' or 'Nay' to some of these choices, and more information given to the player. The races do each play a delightfully radical faction each, and do seem to personify their races quite well, I never thought I'd see the day where I'd actually think of a beardless dwarf as a dwarf, but it happened. The radicalism in diplomats can be offsetting though, I'm not quite sure how they get away with talking to you after you make a decision they dont enjoy either, as it's quite treasonous talk, but it does give a good idea to if they enjoyed or didn't enjoy your decision.Is it worth the money though? Maybe.If the game goes on sale, feel free to purchase away, at it's full price though, show caution, as this game could use a good year more in development to be as polished as I wish it was. Granted it would result in a much larger game to have further choices and the like, but I think it'd be just that much more deliciously unique then. If you enjoyed the choice system of Fable 3's second half though, feel free to purchase away immediately however, as it's more of that, but in a RTS.			"

												Dull, lifeless, and boring all sum up this failed attempt to be a part of the Divinity series. Its about as simple as checkers, and about as fun as a clicker game (If you even choose the option to participate in combat....which you dont have to...ever...)Stopped playing when it became a dispute about where people should be able to stick their♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really felt like most of the subject matter in this game was crowbared in at the last minute or something. I honestly didnt expect a Dwarf to be calling an Elf a Poof and a QUeer and the Elf to only retaliate that same sex marrage should be a thing in return...so yeah. The story, as far as I can tell, is absoloute♥♥♥♥♥♥Would I play it again? Not on your life.On a side note, I also couldnt help but notice every single review about this game avoids the fact its boring and you dont actually do anything in it except the ocasional thumbs up or thumbs down decision based on whos politics you want to follow. Im guessing the massive amount of ""Oh we spent money on this pile of dog sh!t so we have to keep telling ourselves its a great game"" syndrome is applicable here. Or maybe its the ""OMFGZORZ A DRAGON!"" virus that pre-teens and furries have the AIDS for. Either way it stands, this game is a terrible shoddy remix of better games and attempts at a turn based/real time strats and it failed to even come close to the older, lesser mentioned RTS / Non-RTS that are out there.As you can see by my library, I have quite a few games, most of which are FPS or Strat games. I even own all but the latest Divinity game from the series, and have enjoyed the other Divinity games very much. But this pile of donkey sh!t is an iPhone game.			"

												This game attempts to fuse three different styles of gameplay (RTS, TPS, Strategy) and they do a terrible job of every single one of those. The game also throws you into battle with hardly any advice or instruction on how to play, not to mention the overwhelming amount of micro and macro management right from the get-go. I don't often write reviews, and they're usually about four words. This game, however, did the especially terrible job.			"

												First of all let me say i was reluctand to buy this game because of the price tag but it seems i was wrong this game is far from perfect but its very good a solid purchase.As you may have heard the game splits into three sections one political simulation the second one a Risk strategy map and the last is the rts battles.I will start from worst to best,the worst part is the rts section the battles play too fast (believe me when i say this im an rts vet)couple this with the lack of a proper tutorial and a difficult unit management and you have a mess fortunately the game has auto resolve feature you select your generals to represent you in the battles.Risk style map lets you play good ol Risk with a new addition cards,cards can bolster your forces for the upcoming battles sabotage the movement of your enemies double your recources for a short while etc.Then you have buildings with strategic advantages more gold more cards per turn you need to think in this mode your enemies are smart and they gonna try get your undefended territories so you need to think a step ahead.The political simulation part  is where the game shines the most you are an emperor and you need to rule your empire its not an easy task you have to make choices such as homosexual couple marriage,tax the church,draft peasants etc your decisions will affect your standing with the races such as elves dwarves lizards imps undead but wait there's more every good emperor needs a wife to carry your offsprings and all that so you can choose one of the four princesses each with a completely different personality and carry out her wishes submit her to your will or even sacrifice her more power.RTS Score:5Risk map:7Political simulation:10Overall Score:8			"

												Also known as Political Simulator 2013.Divinity: Dragon Commander places you in the role of well, as the name applies, a Dragon Commander in charge of an army (duh)!The game is divided into several parts, much like the Strategy games of today. The first phase involves you walking around your command ship, talking to various politicians, your generals and the adorable little imp to research upgrades for your army. After talking to them, you head on the battle phase of the game. This is where you're thrown into a map for you to manage your armies, which country builds what unit or structure, the movement of your armies and the activation of player cards (which gives you a slight advantage in combat).Combat is much like Star Wars: Empire at War -- You start off with a bunch of units, keep sending them to their deaths to try to achieve victory and call in more reinforcements when needed. Reinforcements are based on the amount of population you have in that particular area where the fighting is. Your fight is over the sea? Too bad, you'll have to make do with your current fleet and can expect no reinforcements for that fight.  The most interesting part about this is that you can morph into a Dragon as and when you want to join the battle, throwing fireballs down at people, healing your own armies or just to fly around being silly. You might find it overpowered in the first few levels. However, do expect to get shot down within a few seconds by a barrage of missiles should you try and charge the enemy army head on in dragon form later on in the levels.Of course, you can opt for the lazy option of clicking ""auto-resolve"" battle. The outcome of the battle is determined by the amount of troops you have and the general leading them. Quite more than often, I find myself clicking on that button just because I want to know more about the story than actual fighting. Besides fighting, you can settle down with some tea and biscuits with the various politicans, arguing over petty things like nudity being banned. I mean, who the heck cares when there's a flippin' war going on? Nope. Politicans will be politicians and thus will keep pestering you for your decisions. Your decisions WILL have an impact on the combat of the game, be it increased gold or having a certain race support you when fighting in their land. What I'll remember about this game would definately be the character voice acting. Quite often, I find myself listening to the long essays that several characters have to say. Music isn't half bad either--catchy, upbeat and pretty fun to listen to when you're commanding armies in the heat of battle.   Dragon Commander shines in it's aspect of story-telling and character developement. However, if you're looking for a solid RTS fight--this isn't the game for you. Overall however, Divinity: Dragon Commander is definately worth the pick up for it's price. And hey! It's on sale as I write this. So yes, it's definately worth the money.			"

												This is one of the many games that tried to be a strategy game and a shooter and edingt up being bad at both. - Other than most of those games, it can be fun for a fiew battles and even has a good difficulty for pros and beginners.- The Camapain is a conquest mode that is filled with some interesting characters that build up your councils. Every now and than you have to solve ther issues or make politics between the battles. At first i really loved that, there are a few very distinct characters and the voice actors did a brilliant job. But there is a big issue in that:- THIS GAME IS PUSHING AN AGENDA: In the way the characters act and present their oppinions as well as in the Issues that are presented is a very clear undertone of regressive left feminism. i don't talk about the advocacy of womens rights feminists. I talk about that free speach hating mob, that denies facts and spread out lies like all man are sexist, all whites are racists and die 'killallwhiteman thing.- To be clear the games gives you everytime the option to choose otherwise, but the presentations makes it very clear what ""should be"" the right choice.Hopefully dragons will be flying free in the future and not being missused for toxic agendas.

												Horrible map and strategy if you compare to say Civ 5.  The political decisions are sooooo stereotypical and bland.  The RNG for quick resolving battles either completely broken or it is meant to unfairly cheat to cover up the utterly dumb AI.  The demon-thing is straight ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (I never used him or sacrificed to him ever and he somehow is suddenly powerful enemy despite being told by the game that he was in a powerful spell).  The generals are again, pure stereotypes of a radical feminist, macho man, stuck up prick, and confused lesbian.   Overall this game can be best described as game that tried some interesting things but fails miserably and when it doesnt it lacks any sort of depth.  Maybe buy it for $5 max.			"

												Massively annoying game.On the strategic level, the enemy starts off in control of all territories and, despite the story of many conflicting siblings, as a unified oponent.  Enemy has the resources to throw overwhelming numbers of troops into the fight each turn right from the start of the game.On the tactical level, when manually managing a fight, the enemy is almost perfectly efficient.  The AI is able to direct many groups of units simultaneously to accomplish different objectives, while at the same time managing troop construction and resources across the map.  The player, on the other hand, can only be in one place at a time, doing one thing at a time, and attempting to keep up with the AI in terms of capturing buildings and resources is impossible, by the time you have selected a unit, moved the camera across the map to the first thing you want to capture, moved the camera back and selected another unit, the enemy has placed troops on three sites.The only possible way to win a battle at any level is to steamroll the AI with vast numbers and/or overwhelmingly superior units.  Unfortunately, the AI starts off the game better equipped to do this than the player.			"

												This game is dysfunctional, don't buy it. The RTS has gamebreaking bug renders the game not-playable. And you can't save mid game. All RTS games have save option, but this hybrid of bull♥♥♥♥♥♥has not, somebody was high while doing the hole redneck style.Please find the link here http://larian.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=474590The bug aside, even if the game works, this game still sucks, there is no fun in it. Only a freak of a gamer enjoy all three gameplays in one single game. Beside, the interface is not self-explaintory The tutorial does little to explain the tatics, sim and real time strategy gameplay.In the Realt time strategy, the unit available work with rock paper scissors logic, much like in age of empire II. But the graphic and the gameplay mechanic makes it very uninteresting to track what your foe is producing to attack you. The whole experience is like learning to write musics without singing and playing an instrument. DON""T BE FOOLED BY THE FIRST PERSON DRAGON CONTROL in PIC, it plays very little role in the whole game. AND once you have it summoned in the game, you lose control of all your other units - unlike control mechanism in Warcraft 3 where you can control the hero unit AND all other unit at the same time. If you enjoy tatics, but don't like RTS, this sucks. If you like RTS, but can't do tatics, this game is a false promise. If you think that dragon is cool to look at, let it be clear that it's a porn actress which used to be a hairy man to straight men audioences - the hole is unfertily fake of digging and the boobs don't squirt milk. Don't buy this, unless you want to be screwed in mind and wallet.			"

												Great mix of RTS and RPG. The voice acting is excellent with believable well written stories. During your journey you get  to play emperor and decide on political issues such as women's rights, science vs. religion, private sector subsidies, gay rights etc. but it is all done quite tastefully and not preachily. You can totally be a bigot if you like and the game doesn't really punish you, you just walk a different path. Which brings me to another point - replayability. You will want to see all the possible options in conversations - that's how enjoyable they are.Oh - and you get to be a dragon too.			"

												I would not recommend this game for anyone who has a basic understanding of sociopolitical issues or that are easy to offend. The choices a player must make in this game during the ""Adviser"" cut scenes are way out of line in my opinion. One has to wonder what the developers were trying to accomplish by putting in dialogue that attempts to bring awareness to particular ""classes"" of people. There was no need to do so, and in my opinion it ruined this game. If Valve would allow me to remove it from my game inventory I would. Maybe I can convince them to let me pay for the privilege....

												To put it bluntly, the actual RTS gameplay is painfully mediocre. It's pretty neat the first few battles as you command your troops while phasing in and out of Dragon form. However, I find the experience to be rather clunky. I am no RTS aficionado but even to me it was rather simplistic and mostly involved sending your entire army to attack move to the enemy base. Despite this, the game is simply fantastic in literally every other way. I eventually just auto-resolved the rest of my battles which helped me transition to where the game shines, its choices. You feel as if you are a true commander, chatting with your generals and helping them resolve differences in order to fight more effectively. You also have to dance politically. As future emperor you must deal with 5 different races, each with their own unique and potentially problematic ideologies. There is no ""right"" choice when dealing with these hard matters, it truly is just ""your"" choice. It was interesting to see how my political decisions affecting the army and my townspeople, giving them various buffs and debuffs as the campaign progressed.The graphics are generally good and the game's length is just average. My first run through took me about eight hours as it became substantially easier to win as the game progresses. However, with the many possible paths you could take, it certainly is worth another run.It is a rather unique game  that's main weakness is just in the RTS gameplay. Nevertheless, for its merits alone it deserves a place in my Hall of Fame			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is, in the only possible way to say it, a satirical real-time strategy game with smaller role-playing elements. The game starts strong with teaching you the very basics of the game in a controlled, easy enviroment, before tossing you over the rails into a sea of the craziest happenings. The major aspect of the game is played in a style akin to Risk, with large pools of troops being moved around a world map to capture zones and ultimately the goal of taking control over the whole globe. When two armies clash in a single zone, that's when you get to actually play the RTS aspect. Warning though, the type of RTS that comes with D:DC is displaced by the fact you control yourself as a DRAGON. Yep, you heard me.While the above goes on, you get to deal with a council of representives of the multiple races in the Divinity world. You'll get polled for all sorts of controversial topics, with its open arguments from the liberal and conservative side of your table. Throw in a political marrige with a wife having her own problems, a wizard who's screwing around inside a demon's mind, and a rather cheery goblin who loves to create weapons of mass distruction for you leaves this game as one that doesn't take itself to seriously. And if doesn't take itself too seriously, why should you? Just keep back, play the game, and enjoy the laughs.			"

It is decisions, that being whether to institute a policy or not, giving advise/permission to your generals and wife that really keep you engaged to this game and do a damn fine job of it! :DI got this game for £10 on a sale, (definitely worth it, no doubt), wheras having played it for myself I would have definitely not regretted spending the full £30 - £35, still way worth it :D			"

												Talk about challenging, fun and addictive, this game has all 3 in abundance. While giving you full control over an army while in RTS battle mode being able to turn into a dragon and turn the tide of combat at almost any given moment (minus restrictions) makes it all the sweeter. While if you want to just command an army and have generals fight your battles you can do that too. The choices pressed upon you to decide the fate of your land lends a heavy hand to your decisions that affect the races of the vast lands in your empire, some may like what you do while others are disgusted. The learning curve can be a bit harsh but once you adjust this game pulls you in to the war tearing your world apart. I thoroughly enjoy this and recommend it to all!			"

												Honestly, I can't recommend it. It looks good on paper, combining RTS, Strategic and Political Sim elements into one whole. You will simply find out, however, that the political decisions are very shallow and do not carry any weight, that the RTS mode is very simple and spammish and that the only acceptable thing is the Strategic Risk-like map play. 1/3 of elements does not save the game, however. Some other reviewers are also right when saying that there is a clear bias as to which decisions the game devs thought you were supposed to take - i.e Banning gun-use, allowing gay marriage and going vegie gives you more in-game benefits than the opposite choices.The aesthetic is also nice, the voice acting the same, but those elements alone do not save the game as a whole. The only good thing about the game for me is the fact I got it on a 66% sale.			"

It's not a super game (like Galactic Civilizations or Civilization 5) but it is surprisingly refreshing.Dragon Commander has pretty impressive graphics, it has a ""side game"" of politics, intrigue and antics where nothing much is decided but you can have a little fun, it has the strategic level ""risk type"" game where you have slightly more control than you'd expect and it has the RTS part of the battles where the dragon reigns supreme and the rest is kinda more like fodder.I can see myself coming back to this game from time to time.

The combat controls, although a tough initial chalenge to master when swapping from over head tactical to 3rd person dragon mode, works well with practice.Definitly recommend playing your first run through on easy to get the hang of the controls before going for a full game on normal. However this is a fun game with rewarding choices and awesome characters that you actually care about through out the ship stage. Also many tough decisions, often times you will have to chose between what you think is right, and what will make people happy. Really enjoyed this one and would reccomend it to anyone who likes RTS games.8/10 for its blend of games types, that merge so well togeather			"

												This game is fun, though it has some flaws and issues. The main problem being you need a mouse, as some of the RTS combat involves commands require ""Scroll Wheel"" ""Middle Button,"" Etc. Not too big a problem for laptop players as these are somewhat unneeded overall, but do limit how well you can see the battlefield at any one time. Another is short playing time. I have reached the final chapter after 8 hours of playing. Not bad, but some of it seemed rushed, especially after I spent an hour or two figuring out the game mechanics (the tutortial is limited to the RTS section, not the rest of the gameplay such as diplomacy, army building, etc.)The game is enjoyable, with semi-diplomacy mechanics, some interesting choices for how to interact with your advisors, wife, and generals, and the fact you get to blow up steam punk war-machines as a dragon wearing a jetpack. Solid 8/10, definately worth it for some, but others might wait for a deal to purchase.			"

The RTS side is actually really simple, no base building just unit commanding. I'm still awful at it but you can just morph into a dragon and wreck people while your units distract them so it all works out in the end. Mix that with Crusader Kings/EU3 esque events and trap cards and you get what this game is all about.			"

												This game is the epitome of mixing RPG-style choices with Campaign board strategy AND traditional strategy gameplay. The choices that you make in the RPG sections, the upgrades you go with, the land that you take, everything factors into how the game will play out. Will you be a misogynyst and say that women don't get paid the same as men, thus being richer BUT at the same time losing morale, or have equal pay, increasing morale but lowering your money amount? This game is fun, and the RPG decisions are variations of real world issues that are hot-button topics, watching the scenes play out is fun.The game is a good value at $20.00 as well because it is definitely worth multiple playthroughs, not only for the decisions you have to make, but there are 5 different queens to choose from!Check it out, you wont regret it.

So I'm already sick of this game, all I wanted was a Starfox/Dragon Rider game, where I get to fly around killing stuff as a dragon while my army moves itself, and I can merely take over command temperarily. I just wanted it to be more like a REAL war.

												It's a hybrid RTS/Civ/Risk strategy game where between turns you wander around your base listening to ambassadors cry and beg for you to support their proposals.It's a simplistic RTS.  It's a simplistic strategy game.  But you get to fly around the maps as a dragon with a jetpack on and help your troops, which really makes up for all of it.Also it's disturbingly entertaining hearing the ambassadors and your generals reactions when you support or deny them.  And someone is always denouncing your hilariously no matter what you do.			"

												I don't write reviews often but this game is simply fun. It basically takes a very simple RTS style game and blends it in with Drakenguard style combat. the storyline has been a ton of fun. Memorable NPCs, a Risk style world map in which you can used turn gained income to have pre-deployed troops. research too make your dragon and troops better while unlocking new troops. It's main unique aspect is that it takes aspects of a variety of games in different categories and blends them together. Definitely worth your money, especially if you catch it on a steam sale like I did.			"

												Have you ever mixed  bunch of sodas together in an attempt to make something unique and good tasting? For strategy games thats what Divinty: Dragon Commander is. It's quite ambitious in how it brings together concepts that you've probably seen in other games, separately. It takes some of Risk, some Starcraft 2, some Mass Effect and adds a jetpack wearing dragon to the mix to make a memorable gem that balances out serious and comedic moments as you go from blasting enemies on the battlefield to discussing whether or to legalize a certain plant for medical purposes, this and many other political issues in the game are downright parodies of the issues in present day politics, almost making the game an unintentional period piece of our current day and age. The RTS portion can be a little lackluster, but the ability to jump in in the form of a jetpack wearing dragon to fight alongside our forces to tip the scales makes it cooler, and for those who dont want to deal with that and enjoy the admittedly more fun empire running segments it can be auto resolved in a manner similar to the Total War series, with your chances of victory being boosted by paying your general and your various cards. At the end of the day it is a jack of all trades, master of none but the gestalt ends up being greater than the sum of the parts making th experience memorable and makes you want to play the campaign again and again to see how differently things can go and to interact with the very amusing characters in the empire running segments. For strategy fans its worth a buy, for those new to the genre it would be a good gateway to some of the bigger franchises.			"

It's definately different and strives to be an interesting departure from the usual genre staples.  It does have some interesting design and style as well; I really liked the ""Steampunk"" look of the game.  Worth trying out?

												This is a mixed bag.  There are three main parts, there is the RTS, Battling as a dragon, and ruling an empire.  The part that was the most fun and enjoyable was ruling an empire, dealing with politics, making decisions.  The least fun was the RTS, which just ended up bing who can spam out the best units the fastest and were always the same.  On top of that, the enemy AI cheats and gangs up on you unless you spam units from the map early.  Fighting as a dragon is enjoyable, but again, very repetitive.Honestly, I loved the political rulling part and wish they would do a patch so I could play that and cut out the battle/rts part.  It was the later that just made me stop playing, even though I really want to finish the story and go back and marry different princesses.			"

												Awesome game! Unique politics, unlike any other game I've played. Great RTS battles, becoming a dragon can really change the tides of battle. You can even command your army WHILE you are a dragon, which is awesome. I was skeptical before I bought this, but it proved to be everything I wished for and more! The map expansion an conquest is well made. If you enjoy conquering territories through battle, changing the world through policies, political relations and laws, leading massive armies into battle and becoming a bad♥♥♥♥♥dragon to really join in the fight; then this is the game for you! 10/10 in my book! Really phenominal game! Unlike any other!			"

												I was surprised to find this title in a Humble Bundle. And after seeing the full price on this, I wouldn't have bought it for that price.All in all though this is a Good Game. It's not a super game (like Galactic Civilizations or Civilization 5) but it is surprisingly refreshing.Dragon Commander has pretty impressive graphics, it has a ""side game"" of politics, intrigue and antics where nothing much is decided but you can have a little fun, it has the strategic level ""risk type"" game where you have slightly more control than you'd expect and it has the RTS part of the battles where the dragon reigns supreme and the rest is kinda more like fodder.I can see myself coming back to this game from time to time. It's entertaining and sometimes a bit of a challenge.			"

												Remember Age of Mythology? Yeah, it's been that long since there's been an RTS game of such quality. Divinity: Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite RTS game. Combine this with a huge Risk-like Grand Strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a DRAGON, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, I do like the complicated RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode. This can work out really well, but the power in Dragon Commander's RTS mode lies not in its complexity. More like its simplicity. In total, there are but 13 units that can be created, balancing each other out quite reasonably, and each having the possibility of being upgraded thrice. One main resource, a population cap, building sites and some natural obstacles. Although this may sound quite basic (which it is), the actual gameplay proves to be very interesting and many different strategies apply. Plus, the Dragon is a massive gamechanger. Dragon mode can either save your life or ruin it because of improper microing while being one. 3 Dragons with their own abilities fight for the additional variety. Not only does the simply epic Dragon mode, a USP that's been praised to the heavens, contribute to the most valuable aspects of the game; the strategy mode (which is basically RISK combined with cards and special abilities) and especially the single player campaign also make this game as epic as it is. In single player, not only do you have to fight your enemies in strategy mode as well as RTS mode, but the entire storyline around Dragon Commander demands that you will take on the right to make important political, moral and economical decisions that have direct impact on gameplay factors such as research, currency, abilities, luck, popularity etc. There are always races disagreeing with you. After all, being the emperor of a world housing undead, elves, imps, dwarves and lizards is bound to cause conflicts that will always have adverse and beneficial effects at the same time. Now it is up to you to keep the balance right. Give it a try, it's not as easy as you may think.In conclusion, I'd say that Dragon Commander is a surprisingly effective game regarding gameplay and mechanics, sadly quite underpopulated on multiplayer ends. Narrative-wise, the game is very immersive and allows for quite the suspension of disbelief. The characters in singleplayer (like our ultimate posh friend general Edmund) as well as the models and environment in the entire game look astonishing for its genre. Not that much lag issues in multiplayer, and if there are people online it's quite fun to challenge each other. With a blend of RTS and TBS/Grand Strategy, and the addition of your personal touch of Dragon, invoking challenging and innovative strategy gameplay, I'd most definitely say it is worth acquiring this game. It is expensive, I give you that, but it's most certainly not a disappointment. In fact, it's quite the gem.			"

												A very fun and enjoyable game, full of allusions to modern political issues. each race represents a political group in modern society. Undead - Pious believers, Elves - Environmental Nature lovers, Dwarves - Capitalist entrepeneurs, Lizards - Rational but SJW people in favor of a republic, Gnomes - Crazy scientists.

												This game tries to do to many things, and doesn't do any of them that well.  The RTS aspect is weak due to having to control your dragon form while commanding troops (which is overly swarm-tactic simplistic).  If the troops were on auto pilot while you commanded the dragon, I would like the game a lot more.The empire building risk-like part of the game, which I normally love in games, is boring and heavily favors your enemies.The story and politics of the world seems amazing, which was the part I was the most excited about.  The gameplay was so bad though that I didn't want to spend the time to finish it.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is a great game. I absolutley loved each moment I had with the game. Even when I was being beaten back harshly by the AI on my attempt to start the game on the hardest difficulty, it brought a smile to my face to know that a game is attempting to be challenging nowadays. Thus, please note: This game is hard at the beginning. You start off with two territories, a few armies, and face an enemy that has much more resouces and territory than you do. All the while, you have to juggle the political field with counselors that present problems, choose a wife, and manage your generals. There's also a neat bit where you have to balance gaining resources with losing most of your population. There are three main aspects to the game: Risk, RTS, and Diplomacy.RiskThis game does a fantastic turn-based war map, on par with the old-fashioned Risk board game. It's literally presented as a board game, as you move unit pieces around a map on the bridge of your ship. Everything seems balanced here, as different units constitute different percentages of winning. Assigning generals to the battle will help the battle's odds, but the true varying factor is, indeed, you.RTSYes, you can personally oversee each battle on your own. In the battle, you switch back and forth from commanding your armies to turning into a dragon and fighting them yourself. A timer begins each map (which is rather annoying), in which you must build up the largest force possible to counter the enemy until you can intervene and help your troops on the ground. The RTS feels SOOOO much like Starcraft 2, and fans will probably like it as much as I did. I did not feel that the dragon controls were awkard, and easily commanded my armies as a dragon. Of course, once the battle is done, you must return to the ships, where you are expected to be a diplomat.DiplomacyAfter each battle, matters arise on your ship. Whether one of your generals is fighting for feminism, gay rights, or censorship, you must attend and solve the situation. After that, counselors from Elves, Imps, Undead, Dwarves, and Lizards will constantly fight over issues such as weapon restrictions, violent media, and religious worship. After that, YOU GET TO CHOOSE A WIFE. EACH ONE IS INTERESTING! JUST DON'T CHOOSE THE LIZARD WIFE! Each wife brings forth unique quests and storylines, which further enhance the depth of the universe. One battles with family matters, another with the traditions of her people, and another experiments with ethics and medicine. It's all very interesting and a joy.ConclusionDivinity: Dragon Commander is a great game that has fantastic RTS, Diplomacy, and War-Map gameplay. The only complaint that I have about it is how unequal the counselors are. Every choice seems to be everyone vs. the undead and dwarves. Therefore, if you are conservitave, this game will villify you on 3/5 races. This game actually seems like a great advertisment for liberal beliefs. However, I still loved it, and didn't take it too seriously. 9/10			"

												A mix of leading armies and ruling a nation, all while being a shape shifting dragon. Sounds fun, right?Well, it is, at times. The political aspect of the game is quite fun. Your advisors present an issue, like gay marriage, environmental protection, yada yada yada, and you decide who of the two advisors to side with. The gameplay benefits of either choice are nice, but never too gamebreaking, so you can basically pick whatever the hell you want, which make the whole aspect quite enjoyable. The whole ruling aspects takes place aboard your demon ship, and that’s where you will meet all of the supporting cast. The characters are quite fun to interact with, and I ended quite fond of them, especially some of the romance choices. But the battle aspect… In every map, you start with a simple Base vs Base scenario, expand to take other bases, start making armies to overwhelm the enemy, the usual. You also can shapeshift into a dragon to fight yourself. While fun, managing both the base and your army in that form is atrocious (I never managed anything more than a simple “Spawn more units and attack move  Here”, but that might just be me), and you quickly learn large enemy armies will instantly shoot you out of the sky. So you end up either sticking to the back of your army, casting buffs, or flying around to harass enemy buildings. Dragon mode perhaps gains depth in Dragon vs Dragon battles, but those are Multiplayer only, and never appear in the campaign. The battle system also gets horribly broken. The amount of units you can produce each map is limited, and that goes both for you and the enemy. This forces you to play smart – or abuse the system, horribly. You see, there is a flying unit called the Zeppelin, which DOUBLEs the range of all units under it. There is also a long range artillery ship, that absolutely demolishes everything it fires at. And, once under a Zeppelin, it also outranges every single unit and tower in the game. I have won every harder map by simply producing 5 of those and putting them under a Zeppelin, slowly withering away the PCs unit reserves. It was quite depressing. I did experiment with different strategies, but the army tends to be so annoying to manage, every time I was starting to get low on reserves I always ended up falling back to the unkillable artillery combo. Besides sometimes it was the only way. The reason for that is basically because the creator decided to phone it in at the end. The campaign has a reasonable progression in the first two acts, with obvious enemies of clear motivation (if horribly underdeveloped. Signs of potential boss battles are all around the place, but you never get any). But once you get to act three, the game reuses all the old maps and the enemies get a ridiculous buff, which I think was the developers idea of difficulty spike.All in all, the political aspect was so fun I actually played the campaign twice, but the battle system is so atrocious I cannot recommend this game unless on massive sale, and even then, it’s not the best of picks.

												I had fun with the game, but it's very short! (3 maps)Therefor, I would never pay more then 20€ for this game. I bought this in the humble bundle for cheap, so it was worth it.The fun aspect in the game is that it's strategy (like a risk game), but also on the battle field RTS (Red alert), and action, as you can go fight yourself with the dragon during the RTS game.Also the choices you make influence your further game. (RPG element)Great game, just way too short...But if you can get it cheap, GET IT!			"

												I am a big fan of the story, conversations, and decisions. But when it comes to RTS gameplay it is insanely basic and doesnt offer much in terms of gameplay. I wouldnt reccomend this as the story gets you invested but when the gameplay kicks in it immediately takes you out of it.			"

												An excellent combination of rts, rpg, and turn-based strategy games. Political choices and personal interactions influence the wider world, leaving behind a legacy from your character. Auto-resolve allows you to delegate the responsibilities of battle to your army, or to your extremely skilled generals. Alternatively, you may lead your forces personally in one battle per round, inspiring and protecting your troops, demoralizing and demolishing your enemies, all in your resplendent draconic glory.Politics allows you to gain greater advantages in your territories, while giving an idea of what actual political decisions are like, as someone will always dislike you for the decision you make.While the game could also be called an rpg for the storyline that centers on your character, roleplay takes a backseat to  battle and expansion. However, for what the game is, the roleplay is nicely done, allowing you to flesh out your character's likes, dislikes, and opinions through political decisions and character interactions. The relationships between you and your spouse can be particularly rewarding.All in all, this isn't a game for players expecting a hardcore version of any of the genres it's composed of, but an excellent choice for anyone who enjoys a variety in their games...and those with fantasies of ruling a vast empire with an iron fist.

												Greatest incarnation of Risk ever!Do not let the screenshots fool you. The RTS battles you will soon auto-resolve because what the game really is about is solving funny political strives between the 5 races and influence the fate of your generals and your hopefully loving wife. (Every decision has influence on your standing with each races which influences the amount of reinforcements you get in defense battles in their lands)Oh there is that strategy map minigame that you will play from time to time but what will you tell the Elves if they want to forbid Imps from having families bigger than 5 members and will you stop the undead in their religion driven rampage againts the sculptures of a lesbian artist?10/10 would order my general to take responsibility for that bombed undead kindergarden again.

												Really cool concept. The RTS part is just awful. Maps and battle in general are poorly thought out. You can auto resolve any/all battles, but if you can't stand the RTS section but don't want it to be just a numbers game you must pay to use commanders. This is a huge design flaw if you're not playing battles. The biggest problem is where you start each chapter. Unless you've saved cards, gold or research points at the end of each chapter you can expect to get creamed. So hopefully you like having to start new games because they didn't explain what was about to happen. This part needs to get a major update. "

												A game that combines a politics simulator, a strategy game and a Real-Time strategy element into it, but manages to do a great deal on all 3 aspects. The politics simulator is essentially a really good visual novel, where you make decisions to advance your storyline and impact your statistics, while the strategy game is one of the best forms of risk I've seen. The RTS section can be avoided, but I recomend people to give it a try just for the feel, despite it feeling a little laggy.Kudos to the developers for putting in so many aspects of the game that all affect each other, making a greater game out of it.

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is an RTS/RPG hybrid game developed by Larian studios, the fellows who created Divine Divinity and Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga before going on to create the well received Divinity: Original Sin.At heart, Dragon Commander is an RTS game - you gather resources, make buildings, build units, and go roll over your enemy's stuff.The game may appear simple, but Larian studios decided to add a lot of risky mechanics to spice up their game. This RTS throws in a twist, one loyal to the game's name: playing as the Dragon Commander, you have the ability to drop onto the battle field personally, flying around the battle field in third person and raining down fire on your opponents. This is possibly one of the only RTS games where you have the ability to summon a super unit you control so directly.The execution of the Dragon Commander mechanic is mixed. It's an unfathomably cool idea, and having access to the dragon makes for a very fun 'super' button to push. On the other hand, actually commanding your army is more difficult in this stage - making army selections can't be done with the mouse anymore and casting unit spells becomes a bit of a headache, never mind selecting buildings and creating units out of them. Another side effect is, since the Dragon is partially controlled by the WASD keys, units will not have spells or fuctions bound to those 4 keys, making it less comfortable for those RTS players who like playing with a 'grid' setup (where abilities are hotkeyed according to where they are on the menu).As a pure RTS, the game is weak. The maps do not have wide varieties of objectives, the units are awkward to control, and the mini-map doesn't do much to help navigate. All units supposedly have strengths over others, but there are some which are clearly universaly better than others. One bonus though: free camera control, including the ability to zoom, turn, and even look upwards, a rarity in RTS games!However, despite the RTS portion of the game being weak, there is an added element which adds depth when playing the story mode: the RPG/political side of the game. Earning favor with races means that any time you hold an RTS battle in a country primarily populated with that race you will have a higher maximum army count, as well as more production from that country when you win. It is very possible that if you fail to ever compromise with a race's demands you will enter fights with a max army size a fraction of your opponent's, upon which your only hope of winning the fight is to rush them. The fact that the roleplay element of the game affects the gameplay element is a very tasteful touch which helps put importance to the political debacles presented.Sure, the politics side of the game is not executed in the best way possible and some of the decisions you are presented are obviously better than others, but it's still interesting. You are often presented with decisions such as whether you want to install a public healthcare system, tax the church system, add regulations to limit freedom of the press, etc. Most of the decisions are very tongue-in-cheek versions of current real life issues, and the choices made affect resources and gameplay. Interestingly enough, most of the more 'good' choices end up making the game harder, so compromising with the councillors you do not like is sometimes a necessity in order to have reasonable approval ratings in regions where fights are likely to occur. There are dozens upon dozens of choices to make, decisions branch out into relevant new choices, the characters have a wide variety of personalities, the voice acting is believable, and there is an enormous amount of dialogue that will simply not be seen in a single playthrough. This is all completely optional: everything can be skipped, clicked through, or ignored to get back to the RTS portion, though I wish more games had these kinds of options.All in all, the game is a bit of a power fantasy - except unlike games which turn you into a super-powered being who can screw the lives of evey person in sight (GTA, AC, TES, etc), you get the added perk of being able to screw with the lives of every person out of sight too, and they can't do a thing about it because you're the Dragon Commander/Emperor with incendiary respiration. However, despite having so many glitches and design flaws, and despite the game's concept precluding it from being taken seriously by RTS enthusiasts, at the end of the day the game is just fun. It does a lot of things that no other game of its kind has tried, and though it has not done it in the best way possible, it's the kind of game that makes one hope for a more polished and refined second attempt. As a serious game it has failed, but as a fun romp it has succeeded.I mean come on, Dragon on the battle field. For all the game's flaws, it's hard to say no to that.			"

												I found the 'Overworld' gameplay fun; Management of armies and map control is fairly similar to the Total-War series and the politics and character interactions were somewhat interesting. The backstory was alright; a little quirky and mildly amusing as most stories by Larian Studios tend to be.The RTS portion of the game was a bit lacking and felt a bit non-sensical overall, though I'm no RTS expert so I won't delve too deep into that. Apart from a few practice attempts in the RTS mode, I played through the entirety of the game in the 'Overworld' mode which is thankfully possible, atleast on the lower-middle difficulties.5/10 Recommended because I like Larian and am somewhat familiar with their games, would suggest purchasing on sale if you're not a huge fan of the genre or unfamiliar with the company.

												Dragon Commander is an interesting mishmash of several game genres, all mixed together to make an awesome game. It's one part turn-based strategy, one part real-time strategy, and one part role-playing game. Though each section is generally weaker than other games dedicated to that genre, Dragon Commander is greater than the sum of it's parts, and for the most part, it succeeds.The strategy map is invocative of Risk or Total War, but even simpler. Create units in your war factories, move them to enemy territory, go to the RTS map. You can also build gold mines to make more money (Important), academies to make more science, taverns for mercernary cards, and other buildings. On this map, you can use cards to grant yourself an advantage, be it sabotaging enemy units or territories, or boosting your own. The ones I've found most useful are mercernary cards: free units for one battle. Comes in handy when the AI sneaks up on you, or you need that extra edge. You don't have to fight every battle that comes your way; in fact, you can't. You can only go to the RTS map once a turn. Other battles are resolved by autoresolving, but you can nominate a general to lead your troops for one battle a turn. Science is a bit of a dead weight later on, and it's easy to max out, especially if you stall. It's not too complex, but not overly simple.That leads into the weakest part of the game: the RTS segment. Now, I'm far from an expert on RTS games, but the segment simply falls short. Micromanaging your units, which is crucial in the late game, is damn near impossible, and is when you're in dragon mode. They all generally look the same, so good luck picking them out of a crowd. As for dragon mode, it's the best part of the segment, though not without it's faults. It's impossible to micromanage your units in the mode, since you can't target them directly. The AI never suffers from this; they're extremely competant at micro, even on the easier settings. The AI isn't too bright, even on the harder modes. They really do just spam the counter of your current army, and later on, figure out spamming Warlocks is the best way to go. The RTS segment, in the end, is just average. Which is a far cry from what I expected.The game's strength, however, is in it's RPG segment. During your stay on the Raven, you can talk to your generals, councilors, and even get a waifu of your own. All of these characters have their own story, and your decisions in them can help you on the strategy map. Overall, the voice acting is superb, the characterization is enjoyable, and the dialogue is well-written. Though it is written quite strangly sometimes, as if it's meant to be read, not spoken. But I think that adds to the game's charm, I mean, this is fantasy, after all. The addition of a choice of a wife (It's an arranged marriage, so you have to pick one) is a nice novelty, though I wish their stories lasted a bit longer. Would've helped with the characterization. Even in the ending, you can't talk to your wife, which really threw me for a loop. In-story, she's out looking for a place for your castle, but I get the feeling they didn't have enough time to implement scenes for them. They didn't have enough time for an imp princess, after all. But the more important part of this is the throne room, where you decide Yea or Nay to your councilors' proposals. They introduced modern politics into a fantasy game, and did it well. You'll be deciding government health care, democracy, gay marriage, everything. Even the less important issues, like nudism. Each of the five races represent a stance in the political spectrum, from the reactionary undead to the libertine elves. Each case is well-represented, and they pulled it off very well. The only problem is that everything is binary; you either say yes or no. Though it's better than good or evil, I would've liked to seen some third choices. Regardless, I love the RPG segment the most. In fact, if they want to make a spinoff where it's nothing but the RPG segment, improved and expanded, I'd buy it day of release!In the end, Dragon Commander is a great game, though with it's flaws. I highly recommend it, even to someone skeptical. Buy it, try it, you won't be disappointed.			"

It is decisions, that being whether to institute a policy or not, giving advise/permission to your generals and wife that really keep you engaged to this game and do a damn fine job of it! :DI got this game for £10 on a sale, (definitely worth it, no doubt), wheras having played it for myself I would have definitely not regretted spending the full £30 - £35, still way worth it :D			"

												A very nice effort from Larian which would have been even better if they'd just spent a bit more time on making the parts fit together. I love the blend of RTS/TBS with dragon combat and political chat'em'up. The RTS segments feel like a dumbed-down version of Supreme Commander - it looks like whoever has the most units wins at first, but it's entirely possible to beat terrible odds using clever tactics and some units (Juggernauts) are massively overpowered, which lets you exploit the mechanics to great effect. Dragon combat is satisfying without being so effective as to completely dominate every battle. Unfortunately the AI is prone to abusing the cheap spellcaster units and there is no effective counter. I had to auto-resolve some battles where my army was superior on paper, because I could not win otherwise.This brings me to the greatest single weakness of the game - the way battles are resolved on the strategy map. You can only personally manage one battle per turn, which is fair - that's what your generals are for. But then, despite having four of them, you can only use one per turn. Are the rest of them drunk at the bar, or what? Furthermore, the effect of using a general is paying a flat fee for a slightly increased chance-to-win, nothing else. They don't gain levels, their dialogue doesn't change and there's no risk of them dying if they fail. Essentially, all four generals could have been replaced, strategy-wise, with a once-per-turn bonus of 10-20%. A terrible waste of an otherwise very promising feature.This would not have been so bad if auto-resolve (when neither you nor a general is available) was anywhere close to realistic, but it doesn't take the actual map or unit composition into consideration at all. Units with NO anti-air capability will have a non-zero chance of defeating flyers, ships may greatly influence the outcome of auto-resolve whereas the actual map is laid out so that you can't use ships offensively. In effect, auto-resolve ends up being used when you have no choice because you're out of battles for that turn, or to get out of having to deal with broken mechanics (like mass spellcasters).Continuing with the strategy part of the game, I love the board game setup with the cards to make things a bit more unpredictable, but it's unfortunately *much* too easy. Playing on Normal (I shudder to think what Casual mode is like!) I was easily able to build up such a strong economy in chapter two that by the finale, I was maxed out on research and could simply buy enough units to steamroll the enemy throughout. The AI never attacks you where you don't expect and will often willfully engage in battles it has <10% chance of winning, wasting units. It must sound like I'm not recommending this game but I actually greatly enjoyed most of the RTS battles, the population mechanic (where you can only build so many units in a match) and the fixed building sites make for more dynamic and fast-paced gameplay than most RTS:es, turtling it out in your base is simply not an option although it may be a viable short-term strategy. The maps are well-designed and the visuals are good. Nice bright colors make your units stand out in the detailed terrain, and when zooming out the units are represented by simple icons (another thing that is brilliant, and reminds me of SupCom). Adding to the enjoyment is the part in-between battles, where you manage the politics of your empire. The dialogues are humorous, the characters quirky and interesting - it's always a treat to find out what they're going to suggest. Weighing your personal views against what would be the most strategically sound decision for your empire makes for a different type of challenge - I am sure many players will already have a principled stand on an issue like women's rights, but what do you do when giving both sexes the same pay will put a significant strain on your war economy? For the record, I ended up playing liberal/capitalist, meaning I sided with the elves and dwarves most of the time, made the feminists happy-ish and I still ended up with approval over 75% with everyone. So there you go.You'll notice I've spent almost none of this review talking about the story. That's because there really isn't one. You will see bits of one in barely-animated cutscenes and you can listen to some dreary exposition from Maxos the Wizard if you so desire, but it's laid on paper-thin and has nothing to do with gameplay. In fact - it seems to have been written completely separate from the game itself! At one point, Maxos tells you in horror that the powerful demon he had been using to power your flagship has broken free. Yet the ship is still running just fine and the demon's still down there, business as usual! Another time, you're asked whether you want to start allowing women to serve in your army. But at that point you already have TWO female generals and some of your combat vehicles are very obviously piloted by women! Best to simply ignore the story completely unless you want to be bothered by contradictions.In summary, I recommend this game if you are in the mood for heaps of casual RTS action with a sprinkle of very enjoyable dragon combat and some political intrigue to keep things interesting. If you prefer your RTS complex and your story deep, look elsewhere. For the 17 hours it took me to play through, I consider my money well spent.			"

What is wrong with this game?-RTS sections are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥poor-Enemy leaders are nothing more than names(Should have had more development)-The map for the turn based strategy sections is pretty boring-It is EXTREMELY short in my opinion(I auto-resolved a lot of the RTS battles but it was because again ""RTS sections are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥poor"")And after all this, what is left?One of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever experienced!The diplomacy element that most turned based strategies games isn't focused on your enemies. Everyone is a warmonger in this game. The focus is put onto leaders for different races! Often between the combat sections, you will meet in a sort conference room with leaders from each race and they will all give there opinions on different topics that reference real life issues. It's the most fun being in a position of power and choosing who to support and who not to support and seeing the consequences with the different races having different opinions about you. And all the characters you meet are so well developed and entertaining. This includes your generals, the race leaders, your potential brides(Ophelia!~<3), and a few general crew members(Pretty sure just a wizard and your mechanic)So if you're like me, prefering characters over gameplay, this is a must have for you!

												Overall, it is a fun, if flawed, game. Where the game shines is in its political mechanics. As the dragon commander, you make decisions that shape your empire and the personalities of your generals. Every character is well written and has excellent voice acting. The combat, unfortunately, is a bit half baked. It just isn't all that unique and suffers from some poor design decisions. You can't build a base freely, and micro managing your units is fiddly. I found myself autoresolving most of the battles because I simply got bored with the combat. With all that said, I still recommend the game. The decision making mechanics are fun to role play with and the voice acting is so well done it raises the game above its poor rts components.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is a great game. I absolutley loved each moment I had with the game. Even when I was being beaten back harshly by the AI on my attempt to start the game on the hardest difficulty, it brought a smile to my face to know that a game is attempting to be challenging nowadays. Thus, please note: This game is hard at the beginning. You start off with two territories, a few armies, and face an enemy that has much more resouces and territory than you do. All the while, you have to juggle the political field with counselors that present problems, choose a wife, and manage your generals. There's also a neat bit where you have to balance gaining resources with losing most of your population. There are three main aspects to the game: Risk, RTS, and Diplomacy.RiskThis game does a fantastic turn-based war map, on par with the old-fashioned Risk board game. It's literally presented as a board game, as you move unit pieces around a map on the bridge of your ship. Everything seems balanced here, as different units constitute different percentages of winning. Assigning generals to the battle will help the battle's odds, but the true varying factor is, indeed, you.RTSYes, you can personally oversee each battle on your own. In the battle, you switch back and forth from commanding your armies to turning into a dragon and fighting them yourself. A timer begins each map (which is rather annoying), in which you must build up the largest force possible to counter the enemy until you can intervene and help your troops on the ground. The RTS feels SOOOO much like Starcraft 2, and fans will probably like it as much as I did. I did not feel that the dragon controls were awkard, and easily commanded my armies as a dragon. Of course, once the battle is done, you must return to the ships, where you are expected to be a diplomat.DiplomacyAfter each battle, matters arise on your ship. Whether one of your generals is fighting for feminism, gay rights, or censorship, you must attend and solve the situation. After that, counselors from Elves, Imps, Undead, Dwarves, and Lizards will constantly fight over issues such as weapon restrictions, violent media, and religious worship. After that, YOU GET TO CHOOSE A WIFE. EACH ONE IS INTERESTING! JUST DON'T CHOOSE THE LIZARD WIFE! Each wife brings forth unique quests and storylines, which further enhance the depth of the universe. One battles with family matters, another with the traditions of her people, and another experiments with ethics and medicine. It's all very interesting and a joy.ConclusionDivinity: Dragon Commander is a great game that has fantastic RTS, Diplomacy, and War-Map gameplay. The only complaint that I have about it is how unequal the counselors are. Every choice seems to be everyone vs. the undead and dwarves. Therefore, if you are conservitave, this game will villify you on 3/5 races. This game actually seems like a great advertisment for liberal beliefs. However, I still loved it, and didn't take it too seriously. 9/10			"

												A mix of leading armies and ruling a nation, all while being a shape shifting dragon. Sounds fun, right?Well, it is, at times. The political aspect of the game is quite fun. Your advisors present an issue, like gay marriage, environmental protection, yada yada yada, and you decide who of the two advisors to side with. The gameplay benefits of either choice are nice, but never too gamebreaking, so you can basically pick whatever the hell you want, which make the whole aspect quite enjoyable. The whole ruling aspects takes place aboard your demon ship, and that’s where you will meet all of the supporting cast. The characters are quite fun to interact with, and I ended quite fond of them, especially some of the romance choices. But the battle aspect… In every map, you start with a simple Base vs Base scenario, expand to take other bases, start making armies to overwhelm the enemy, the usual. You also can shapeshift into a dragon to fight yourself. While fun, managing both the base and your army in that form is atrocious (I never managed anything more than a simple “Spawn more units and attack move  Here”, but that might just be me), and you quickly learn large enemy armies will instantly shoot you out of the sky. So you end up either sticking to the back of your army, casting buffs, or flying around to harass enemy buildings. Dragon mode perhaps gains depth in Dragon vs Dragon battles, but those are Multiplayer only, and never appear in the campaign. The battle system also gets horribly broken. The amount of units you can produce each map is limited, and that goes both for you and the enemy. This forces you to play smart – or abuse the system, horribly. You see, there is a flying unit called the Zeppelin, which DOUBLEs the range of all units under it. There is also a long range artillery ship, that absolutely demolishes everything it fires at. And, once under a Zeppelin, it also outranges every single unit and tower in the game. I have won every harder map by simply producing 5 of those and putting them under a Zeppelin, slowly withering away the PCs unit reserves. It was quite depressing. I did experiment with different strategies, but the army tends to be so annoying to manage, every time I was starting to get low on reserves I always ended up falling back to the unkillable artillery combo. Besides sometimes it was the only way. The reason for that is basically because the creator decided to phone it in at the end. The campaign has a reasonable progression in the first two acts, with obvious enemies of clear motivation (if horribly underdeveloped. Signs of potential boss battles are all around the place, but you never get any). But once you get to act three, the game reuses all the old maps and the enemies get a ridiculous buff, which I think was the developers idea of difficulty spike.All in all, the political aspect was so fun I actually played the campaign twice, but the battle system is so atrocious I cannot recommend this game unless on massive sale, and even then, it’s not the best of picks.

												This is a wierd mix between an RTS, a Risk-style board game, and a political RPG. The latter two of those 3 things work great, but the RTS both generic and pretty ""eh"". I played through almost the entire campaign using the Auto-Resolve function to skip the RTS sections, and I will say the AR actually works pretty well. Play this for the board game part and the political decision-making part, not the RTS part.			"

												Everyone hates you but follows you regardless. Tactical map made me laugh, doesn't tell you what to do, then tells you ""oh, you know you could have done stuff right?"" when you end your turn. Then comes the combat..... Well.... just mash out troops and send them to their doom, which also seems to be the AI tactics too... Overall, the 38 minutes i spent playing this game were wasted and I can never get them back. So much potential, so much dissapointment.			"

												This game is quite fun and the gameplay is solid; my only complaint is that while incorporating many game styles (RTS, turn based conquest, and choose your own adventure dialog) it feels slightly shallow. The RTS aspect of the game is very fun, and the ability of turning into a dragon to lead your armies gives the battles a lot of playablity allowing you to switch constantly between a traditional RTS style or more or of a MOBA style. The RTS mechanics of the game are pretty simple however compared to something like Starcraft with battle being over control nodes for bases, and around 15 units which both the player and AI use; so I don't expect this is a game you could pour hundreds of hours into the multiplier before getting bored. The turn based part of the game plays very much like a game of risk where conquest can be won though a RTS battle, so again it's simple but still effective. Everything else in the game plays out in dialog on your battleship with your generals, advisers and a princess  and they all have great personalities (you either love them or hate, but you care) so it keeps the dialog interesting and offers a lot of choices to keep multiple play through fresh. I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and while it has some shortcomings I would definitely recommend trying this game out, it is better then the sum of all it's parts.			"

												If you were to describe this game with the ""A meets B"" method, the list would get incredibly long; there is a fair chance you'd run out of letters. It draws inspiration from many genres and mixes them into a remarkably sapid blend. Strategy map with Risk-like figurines representing units, managing the empire's internal affairs with a bunch of crazy councillors, commanding and conquering on a real-time tactical map, smiting foes as a dragon in third-person combat, playing cards which give you advantage or undermine the enemies' efforts, all seasoned with marvelous music and splendid steampunk setting... Yet nothing feels out of place nor included forcibly. And in just how many games you can play as a dragon with a jetpack?			"

												You are a dragon with an army, an airship, and the latest in cutting-edge gnomish steampunk rocket pack technology strapped to your scaly back. Go nuts.A compelling combination of Risk-style turn-based strategy, traditional realtime strategy, and story-driven political simulator, Larian Studios crafted this chimera of an idea into a quirky but ultimately impressive game. While the RTS elements are a little light, what really sold this game for me is the dynamic, well-written NPCs that the eponymous Dragon Commander interacts with in between trips to the battle map. Your airship is visually gorgeous, the AI is relatively challenging, and there's even online multiplayer, provided that's your cup of tea.Pros:  -- Excelent writing and dialogue. (I can't stress this enough; it's the best I've ever seen in a game.)  -- Awesome environmental art.  -- Solid AI.  -- Very reasonably priced.  -- You're a dragon.Cons:  -- RTS element is a little underdeveloped.  -- Some players may have issues with the political decisions presented to them. If you're not a hardcore crazy conservative, you shouldn't have a problem, though.(Note: A significant portion of my playtime for this game was in the pre-release beta that was offered through Steam.)

												Dragon Commander is an interesting mishmash of several game genres, all mixed together to make an awesome game. It's one part turn-based strategy, one part real-time strategy, and one part role-playing game. Though each section is generally weaker than other games dedicated to that genre, Dragon Commander is greater than the sum of it's parts, and for the most part, it succeeds.The strategy map is invocative of Risk or Total War, but even simpler. Create units in your war factories, move them to enemy territory, go to the RTS map. You can also build gold mines to make more money (Important), academies to make more science, taverns for mercernary cards, and other buildings. On this map, you can use cards to grant yourself an advantage, be it sabotaging enemy units or territories, or boosting your own. The ones I've found most useful are mercernary cards: free units for one battle. Comes in handy when the AI sneaks up on you, or you need that extra edge. You don't have to fight every battle that comes your way; in fact, you can't. You can only go to the RTS map once a turn. Other battles are resolved by autoresolving, but you can nominate a general to lead your troops for one battle a turn. Science is a bit of a dead weight later on, and it's easy to max out, especially if you stall. It's not too complex, but not overly simple.That leads into the weakest part of the game: the RTS segment. Now, I'm far from an expert on RTS games, but the segment simply falls short. Micromanaging your units, which is crucial in the late game, is damn near impossible, and is when you're in dragon mode. They all generally look the same, so good luck picking them out of a crowd. As for dragon mode, it's the best part of the segment, though not without it's faults. It's impossible to micromanage your units in the mode, since you can't target them directly. The AI never suffers from this; they're extremely competant at micro, even on the easier settings. The AI isn't too bright, even on the harder modes. They really do just spam the counter of your current army, and later on, figure out spamming Warlocks is the best way to go. The RTS segment, in the end, is just average. Which is a far cry from what I expected.The game's strength, however, is in it's RPG segment. During your stay on the Raven, you can talk to your generals, councilors, and even get a waifu of your own. All of these characters have their own story, and your decisions in them can help you on the strategy map. Overall, the voice acting is superb, the characterization is enjoyable, and the dialogue is well-written. Though it is written quite strangly sometimes, as if it's meant to be read, not spoken. But I think that adds to the game's charm, I mean, this is fantasy, after all. The addition of a choice of a wife (It's an arranged marriage, so you have to pick one) is a nice novelty, though I wish their stories lasted a bit longer. Would've helped with the characterization. Even in the ending, you can't talk to your wife, which really threw me for a loop. In-story, she's out looking for a place for your castle, but I get the feeling they didn't have enough time to implement scenes for them. They didn't have enough time for an imp princess, after all. But the more important part of this is the throne room, where you decide Yea or Nay to your councilors' proposals. They introduced modern politics into a fantasy game, and did it well. You'll be deciding government health care, democracy, gay marriage, everything. Even the less important issues, like nudism. Each of the five races represent a stance in the political spectrum, from the reactionary undead to the libertine elves. Each case is well-represented, and they pulled it off very well. The only problem is that everything is binary; you either say yes or no. Though it's better than good or evil, I would've liked to seen some third choices. Regardless, I love the RPG segment the most. In fact, if they want to make a spinoff where it's nothing but the RPG segment, improved and expanded, I'd buy it day of release!In the end, Dragon Commander is a great game, though with it's flaws. I highly recommend it, even to someone skeptical. Buy it, try it, you won't be disappointed.			"

												It's a hybrid RTS/Civ/Risk strategy game where between turns you wander around your base listening to ambassadors cry and beg for you to support their proposals.It's a simplistic RTS.  It's a simplistic strategy game.  But you get to fly around the maps as a dragon with a jetpack on and help your troops, which really makes up for all of it.Also it's disturbingly entertaining hearing the ambassadors and your generals reactions when you support or deny them.  And someone is always denouncing your hilariously no matter what you do.			"

												This game is fun, though it has some flaws and issues. The main problem being you need a mouse, as some of the RTS combat involves commands require ""Scroll Wheel"" ""Middle Button,"" Etc. Not too big a problem for laptop players as these are somewhat unneeded overall, but do limit how well you can see the battlefield at any one time. Another is short playing time. I have reached the final chapter after 8 hours of playing. Not bad, but some of it seemed rushed, especially after I spent an hour or two figuring out the game mechanics (the tutortial is limited to the RTS section, not the rest of the gameplay such as diplomacy, army building, etc.)The game is enjoyable, with semi-diplomacy mechanics, some interesting choices for how to interact with your advisors, wife, and generals, and the fact you get to blow up steam punk war-machines as a dragon wearing a jetpack. Solid 8/10, definately worth it for some, but others might wait for a deal to purchase.			"

												I was surprised to find this title in a Humble Bundle. And after seeing the full price on this, I wouldn't have bought it for that price.All in all though this is a Good Game. It's not a super game (like Galactic Civilizations or Civilization 5) but it is surprisingly refreshing.Dragon Commander has pretty impressive graphics, it has a ""side game"" of politics, intrigue and antics where nothing much is decided but you can have a little fun, it has the strategic level ""risk type"" game where you have slightly more control than you'd expect and it has the RTS part of the battles where the dragon reigns supreme and the rest is kinda more like fodder.I can see myself coming back to this game from time to time. It's entertaining and sometimes a bit of a challenge.			"

												Okay, so...a Dragon that has a jet pack that breaks the sound barrier in less than a second.  That should be enough for a person to purchase this game.  Oh it also helps that this game is brilliantly written, wonderfully voice acted also helps.  Deal with political issues that we are trying to figure out in this fantasy wrold such as; Gay marragie, and government halthcare and much, much more. Add some RTS elements (even though it feels a bit repeatative) and you got your self a fun game that should have been given more attention that it did.  I would give it a 9/10.			"

												I love this game! Such a wonderful little mash up of genres. It doesn't excel at any one of it's genres, but it does them all well enough to make every moment enjoyable. The characters are all loveable, the acting and presentation is top notch, and it just feels like Larian poured their heart and soul into this little gem. Not for everyone, but the perfect game for a select few.			"

												This game is fun, though it has some flaws and issues. The main problem being you need a mouse, as some of the RTS combat involves commands require ""Scroll Wheel"" ""Middle Button,"" Etc. Not too big a problem for laptop players as these are somewhat unneeded overall, but do limit how well you can see the battlefield at any one time. Another is short playing time. I have reached the final chapter after 8 hours of playing. Not bad, but some of it seemed rushed, especially after I spent an hour or two figuring out the game mechanics (the tutortial is limited to the RTS section, not the rest of the gameplay such as diplomacy, army building, etc.)The game is enjoyable, with semi-diplomacy mechanics, some interesting choices for how to interact with your advisors, wife, and generals, and the fact you get to blow up steam punk war-machines as a dragon wearing a jetpack. Solid 8/10, definately worth it for some, but others might wait for a deal to purchase.			"

It is decisions, that being whether to institute a policy or not, giving advise/permission to your generals and wife that really keep you engaged to this game and do a damn fine job of it! :DI got this game for £10 on a sale, (definitely worth it, no doubt), wheras having played it for myself I would have definitely not regretted spending the full £30 - £35, still way worth it :D			"

												Have you ever mixed  bunch of sodas together in an attempt to make something unique and good tasting? For strategy games thats what Divinty: Dragon Commander is. It's quite ambitious in how it brings together concepts that you've probably seen in other games, separately. It takes some of Risk, some Starcraft 2, some Mass Effect and adds a jetpack wearing dragon to the mix to make a memorable gem that balances out serious and comedic moments as you go from blasting enemies on the battlefield to discussing whether or to legalize a certain plant for medical purposes, this and many other political issues in the game are downright parodies of the issues in present day politics, almost making the game an unintentional period piece of our current day and age. The RTS portion can be a little lackluster, but the ability to jump in in the form of a jetpack wearing dragon to fight alongside our forces to tip the scales makes it cooler, and for those who dont want to deal with that and enjoy the admittedly more fun empire running segments it can be auto resolved in a manner similar to the Total War series, with your chances of victory being boosted by paying your general and your various cards. At the end of the day it is a jack of all trades, master of none but the gestalt ends up being greater than the sum of the parts making th experience memorable and makes you want to play the campaign again and again to see how differently things can go and to interact with the very amusing characters in the empire running segments. For strategy fans its worth a buy, for those new to the genre it would be a good gateway to some of the bigger franchises.			"

												The game is divided into three main sections: The RPG section - Aboard the ship, after every turn, you are going to have conversations with your generals and ministers to decide the fate of millions, having an impact over the strategy map and also make researchs to improve your units and your dragon form; The Strategy section - World map view of the regions, the races, population, gold and research points, your units and strategic buildings. Thats where you'll move your troops and play your cards to try to conquer a region; The RTS section - After you move your troops to attack or if you have to defend, you can choose to play cards and let the battle auto resolve with the help of one of your generals or you can choose to go into battle yourself and that is where you can turn into a dragon to help your units.   Unfortunately the RTS section is a bit messy and stiffy. This section is really fast paced, there is no fog of war, the camera controls are bad, the maps are small and you are quite limited to what you can do. You have to capture predetermined points on the map to start getting recruits and to build factories. There is a limited number of recruit that you can gather and wins the player who manages to maintain a greater number of units built. The dragon is cool, but it is too weak and dies very fast. The RTS section is the one I disliked the most. I found it quite boring and a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ so I turned the difficult to casual to focus on the section I really liked, the RPG one. Too bad you are still forced play the RTS sections as you can use auto resolve only once per turn. The turn based strategy map and the card sistems are not something out of the ordinary and the strenght is on the RPG sections, with great characters and choices that have real consequences on the theather of war.   I think that with this game the developers tried to fire at too many directions, with a weak third person shooter (as a dragon), a bad RTS, a ok turn based strategy and card systems and a good RPG wraped up with a great sound track and pretty graphics into a average game. So, if it is on sale why the ♥♥♥♥ not?			"

												This game is absolutely wonderful. It's strongest points are by far story, music, character, political simulation, and turn based strategy. The real time strategy element of it can be...quite vexing and overwhelming at times. The A.I. seems almost relentless, and can easily overwhelm you, not to mention employ a multitude of battlefield control spells that certain units employ quite easier than a human player (unless you're just a pro at the whole RTS scene). If you don't care for the RTS aspect, or the third person dragon action combat on the RTS plain, you can always choose to auto-resolve, relying heavily on your turn based map tactics to win the day. All in all though, this game is 10/10. Loads of different political choices to make as they come before you, things to research, etc. I love this game so much!			"

												From the Reviews about this game I went in not really expecting much but the idea  of being a general and turning into a dragon to pound armies drew me in. First off......everyone who is upset over the interface of the military and not having a easy button....I fight battles with only a 10% success rate on the estimater and still make the enemy pound sand. The game is really great based on the fact you cant just play the dragon part or the army part and win battles all the time but have to hot swap back and forth...sometimes in mid battle and plug up the holes or destroy a particular part of the enemy army. AA rapes the the dragon but your army rapes the AA....same goes for air to ground troops.....they bang up your army until a dragon sweeps in and eats them alive while your army deals with the ground troops.

												Do you enjoy Risk? That would be the question I’d ask, for those inquiring about this game.The nitty gritty of Dragon Commander, is that it’s a videogame implementation of a risk-type strategy boardgame, in a paperback fantasy setting, with solid characters and dialog, and an optional RTS mode. Whew, that sure was a sentence.While the overarching story is something you’d find in a Dragon Lance novel, your generals and councilors will be engaged in CYOA-style stories that develop the land of Rivellon, and your role within it. There’s incredible polish in everything from voice acting, animation, and visual design. As it’s not “Fire Emblem” long, nor “Fire Emblem” hard, I found myself stalling my forces, just so I could engage in more political decisions / view more character moments. So, I mentioned an RTS mode, earlier. Outside of deploying units on the map and essentially rolling the dice- risk-style, you can personally lead one battle, per turn, as a dragon. It plays as a fairly difficult RTS. I didn’t have fun with it, but I tend to be quite poor at RTS’s. It’s thankfully completely optional in beating the game, and probably best used as a way to change an unlikely battle’s odds. I kept wishing I could pause and direct orders.I will say that it’s RTS implementation is pretty novel. It’s kinda like Brutal Legend, in of that you can engage the world directly as a unit, in the midst of managing soldiers. All in all, I would definitely recommend Divinity: Dragon Commander for a long weekend.			"

If the troops were on auto pilot while you commanded the dragon, I would like the game a lot more.The empire building risk-like part of the game, which I normally love in games, is boring and heavily favors your enemies.The story and politics of the world seems amazing, which was the part I was the most excited about.

												Frankly I feel a bit ripped off, the parts on the ship are fun and the characters are nicely rendered. But the RTS element is just plain awful. So much so that I wish I could auto battle every fight. The RTS controls are so clunky that choosing your troops while in dragon mode would probably require a third hand. The RTS graphic are near prehistoric and belong on the PS1. If the game was only composed of the things inside the ship I would have been much happier, the voice acting and charater design were top notch. However as it stands it's a primitive, below average RTS wrapped in pretty RPG robes. I disinstalled after 2 hours of gameplay, life is too short.			"

												This game is very much a game of two sides. Unfortunutely, one side is pretty awful. The game is divided into the story driven, non combat based and relationship building aspect; and then the RTS combat and risk map like world view. I have to say, I honestly really like the non combat stuff. The characters are fun, they are a poke at the stereotypes of today whilst offering a little bit of comedic social commentry. The characters are great, the dilemas you get are great and they even have a point to them, as each desicsion you make has consequences for resource aquirement, combat and other things.Where it falls flat on its face is the RTS combat. By christ it sucks. Its entire concept is basically built around zerg rushing and turtling your forces. very little stratigic combat involved here. Yeah, being a dragon is kinda a cool twist but it takes away from being an RTS and it turns it into a click fest action game. Tries to do too much, whilst also doing almost nothing. Saddening really. On the plus side, once you get your generals you can shelve off battles to them. Though, you can only use any general once per turn, as in once you use a general on any battle that turn you may use no other generals. Why? I dont understand.All in all, I would only recommend it to players who can really get immersed into the non combat stuff. If you are looking for an incredible RTS experience, you will not find it here. However, personally I think the non combat aspects outway the combat.			"

												A very nice effort from Larian which would have been even better if they'd just spent a bit more time on making the parts fit together. I love the blend of RTS/TBS with dragon combat and political chat'em'up. The RTS segments feel like a dumbed-down version of Supreme Commander - it looks like whoever has the most units wins at first, but it's entirely possible to beat terrible odds using clever tactics and some units (Juggernauts) are massively overpowered, which lets you exploit the mechanics to great effect. Dragon combat is satisfying without being so effective as to completely dominate every battle. Unfortunately the AI is prone to abusing the cheap spellcaster units and there is no effective counter. I had to auto-resolve some battles where my army was superior on paper, because I could not win otherwise.This brings me to the greatest single weakness of the game - the way battles are resolved on the strategy map. You can only personally manage one battle per turn, which is fair - that's what your generals are for. But then, despite having four of them, you can only use one per turn. Are the rest of them drunk at the bar, or what? Furthermore, the effect of using a general is paying a flat fee for a slightly increased chance-to-win, nothing else. They don't gain levels, their dialogue doesn't change and there's no risk of them dying if they fail. Essentially, all four generals could have been replaced, strategy-wise, with a once-per-turn bonus of 10-20%. A terrible waste of an otherwise very promising feature.This would not have been so bad if auto-resolve (when neither you nor a general is available) was anywhere close to realistic, but it doesn't take the actual map or unit composition into consideration at all. Units with NO anti-air capability will have a non-zero chance of defeating flyers, ships may greatly influence the outcome of auto-resolve whereas the actual map is laid out so that you can't use ships offensively. In effect, auto-resolve ends up being used when you have no choice because you're out of battles for that turn, or to get out of having to deal with broken mechanics (like mass spellcasters).Continuing with the strategy part of the game, I love the board game setup with the cards to make things a bit more unpredictable, but it's unfortunately *much* too easy. Playing on Normal (I shudder to think what Casual mode is like!) I was easily able to build up such a strong economy in chapter two that by the finale, I was maxed out on research and could simply buy enough units to steamroll the enemy throughout. The AI never attacks you where you don't expect and will often willfully engage in battles it has <10% chance of winning, wasting units. It must sound like I'm not recommending this game but I actually greatly enjoyed most of the RTS battles, the population mechanic (where you can only build so many units in a match) and the fixed building sites make for more dynamic and fast-paced gameplay than most RTS:es, turtling it out in your base is simply not an option although it may be a viable short-term strategy. The maps are well-designed and the visuals are good. Nice bright colors make your units stand out in the detailed terrain, and when zooming out the units are represented by simple icons (another thing that is brilliant, and reminds me of SupCom). Adding to the enjoyment is the part in-between battles, where you manage the politics of your empire. The dialogues are humorous, the characters quirky and interesting - it's always a treat to find out what they're going to suggest. Weighing your personal views against what would be the most strategically sound decision for your empire makes for a different type of challenge - I am sure many players will already have a principled stand on an issue like women's rights, but what do you do when giving both sexes the same pay will put a significant strain on your war economy? For the record, I ended up playing liberal/capitalist, meaning I sided with the elves and dwarves most of the time, made the feminists happy-ish and I still ended up with approval over 75% with everyone. So there you go.You'll notice I've spent almost none of this review talking about the story. That's because there really isn't one. You will see bits of one in barely-animated cutscenes and you can listen to some dreary exposition from Maxos the Wizard if you so desire, but it's laid on paper-thin and has nothing to do with gameplay. In fact - it seems to have been written completely separate from the game itself! At one point, Maxos tells you in horror that the powerful demon he had been using to power your flagship has broken free. Yet the ship is still running just fine and the demon's still down there, business as usual! Another time, you're asked whether you want to start allowing women to serve in your army. But at that point you already have TWO female generals and some of your combat vehicles are very obviously piloted by women! Best to simply ignore the story completely unless you want to be bothered by contradictions.In summary, I recommend this game if you are in the mood for heaps of casual RTS action with a sprinkle of very enjoyable dragon combat and some political intrigue to keep things interesting. If you prefer your RTS complex and your story deep, look elsewhere. For the 17 hours it took me to play through, I consider my money well spent.			"

												This is steam punk *with* substance (for a change). My only nitpick is that the RTS battles are a little clunky, so I let my generals do the fighting (sim the battles), but for me that felt truer to the spirit of the game which has you playing as the commander/would-be emperor making strategic decisions --as you would. Very good music and graphics, interesting characters that are very nicely voice acted, lots of imperial duties to see to including affairs of state (creating laws, etc.), allocating funds for technologies, social functions, and so on. High re-playability.			"

												A very entertaining game to play.Ever play a RTS and wish you could just be the massive, neigh-unkillabnle monster to wreck it all? Well, here's your chance.In the midst of battle you can transform into a mighty dragon and just lay waste to your enemies.Or heartily buff your allies and watch over your armies as they overwhelm the enemy with ease.True, the RTS is a bit dodgy at times, difficult at best to control, with its fair share of issue - but it helps blend and interesting action sequence between the Turn-Based planning stages.The diplomacy system in the game is by far one of the more enjoyable ones I've encountered. A bit random, but fun - you'll never know which topic is up next. As you gain - or loose - favor with a faction it ends up helping or hindering your own conquest tasks at hand with the fighting. underlying polocies intertwine with how well your strategy auto-resolves with generals act out, or how well you can build or defend a battlefield. It mixes well in the gameply to open up a host of opportunities and a vast array of replayability as you can shape and reform how you rebuild an empire from ruins.The diplomacy and actions intertwine with your generals and how they learn their skills. But its all relative. Fighting boils down to a basic turn-based build up to a RTS brawl of sorts. Its fun, entertaining and well worth the run. Or two, I've still got other routes I could have gone, different choices to make and see how well it can play out in the end...			"

												To put it bluntly, the actual RTS gameplay is painfully mediocre. It's pretty neat the first few battles as you command your troops while phasing in and out of Dragon form. However, I find the experience to be rather clunky. I am no RTS aficionado but even to me it was rather simplistic and mostly involved sending your entire army to attack move to the enemy base. Despite this, the game is simply fantastic in literally every other way. I eventually just auto-resolved the rest of my battles which helped me transition to where the game shines, its choices. You feel as if you are a true commander, chatting with your generals and helping them resolve differences in order to fight more effectively. You also have to dance politically. As future emperor you must deal with 5 different races, each with their own unique and potentially problematic ideologies. There is no ""right"" choice when dealing with these hard matters, it truly is just ""your"" choice. It was interesting to see how my political decisions affecting the army and my townspeople, giving them various buffs and debuffs as the campaign progressed.The graphics are generally good and the game's length is just average. My first run through took me about eight hours as it became substantially easier to win as the game progresses. However, with the many possible paths you could take, it certainly is worth another run.It is a rather unique game  that's main weakness is just in the RTS gameplay. Nevertheless, for its merits alone it deserves a place in my Hall of Fame			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander is, in the only possible way to say it, a satirical real-time strategy game with smaller role-playing elements. The game starts strong with teaching you the very basics of the game in a controlled, easy enviroment, before tossing you over the rails into a sea of the craziest happenings. The major aspect of the game is played in a style akin to Risk, with large pools of troops being moved around a world map to capture zones and ultimately the goal of taking control over the whole globe. When two armies clash in a single zone, that's when you get to actually play the RTS aspect. Warning though, the type of RTS that comes with D:DC is displaced by the fact you control yourself as a DRAGON. Yep, you heard me.While the above goes on, you get to deal with a council of representives of the multiple races in the Divinity world. You'll get polled for all sorts of controversial topics, with its open arguments from the liberal and conservative side of your table. Throw in a political marrige with a wife having her own problems, a wizard who's screwing around inside a demon's mind, and a rather cheery goblin who loves to create weapons of mass distruction for you leaves this game as one that doesn't take itself to seriously. And if doesn't take itself too seriously, why should you? Just keep back, play the game, and enjoy the laughs.			"

												I got my♥♥♥♥♥♥handed to me in the story... and on my wedding day of all days! So I sold my peoples souls to a demon in echange for 2 iowa-class battleships.... which were promptly obliterated by the horde of imps. Would've sold my wife too but i figured it was way too late I had nothing but my capital and her left so might aswell atleast keep her.This games is awesome though. honestly I am unsure wether it's the RTS-battles or the way the campaign map is handled but something is up here, though iI'm not sure exactly what it is. The political part of the game however is excellent though, the issues that come up are fun, and some really make you question what your position on the issues are if you play with a moral compass as I did the first game.My only complaint in that respect is how it kind of feels rushed, and even detached from the war entirely. Like why am I dealing with a genocide that happened in a town that is not under my control? Why do I have any power ofver the society of the Undead, Imps, or Dwarves when none of their provinces are under my control?I feel the political aspect is not perfect, but for the first game of this kind (Atleast that I've seen) it is wonderfully refreshing.From the little references and jokes yelled by your soldiers during battles, to the dark humor, to the rampant homosexuality, high as a kite elves, sociopathic Imps, encouraged necrOphelia. this game is pretty good and I whole heartedly recommend it. It is worth playing, and I plan on playing it again after a couple days break.On a side-note:I do sense a tad bit of prejudice against the religious side though. while between the five races  their seems to be attempts at both balance and degrees when you go to the religious side... it just seems to only be one degree of religion. I think the Elves are supposed to tbe the moderate-religious, and the Lizards the moderate-athiest (maybe Agnostic?). but the only one who really plays the role well is the Lizards, and the elves seem to just let that role drop off completely. but that's just a personal observation, you may see something different.Either way. 8.5/10 I could not be happier with it. but I would suggest buying it on sale. $40 may be just a little steep for the title, but it may not be for you. I personally think anything below $30 is a ""must-git deal"" as they say back home.			"

												That is a pretty unusual idea.I don't even know what genre is this game, because I'd say that there are several genres involved as you play this game. Your ship, for example, is played as sort of an RPG. You talk with people, level up stuff, purchase new tech and units. Then, there is a part of the game (Planning stage), that is played similar to ""Risk"". You have your global map and you move your units from one sector to another. Defend your territory, advance into enemy territory, etc. Once you finish your turn and the battle begins, the game is played like a classic RTS. You capture zones, build constructions like barracks, turrets, etc. You get units and press onward to crush your enemy. But the interesting thing is that you can switch into your dragon form and take control over the battlefield directly, switching the game mode into sort of an action game. So... I guess this game have a little bit of everything? Oh... Almost forgot: There are also politics, influence, cards you can play to add a certain effect for something and tons and tons of stuff the devs put into this game. It's pretty detailed, it runs smoothly, I did not seen any bugs at all and it is fun to play. If you are into ""Divinity"" series, fantasy and steampunk, you should try it.8/10.			"

												This game is quite fun and the gameplay is solid; my only complaint is that while incorporating many game styles (RTS, turn based conquest, and choose your own adventure dialog) it feels slightly shallow. The RTS aspect of the game is very fun, and the ability of turning into a dragon to lead your armies gives the battles a lot of playablity allowing you to switch constantly between a traditional RTS style or more or of a MOBA style. The RTS mechanics of the game are pretty simple however compared to something like Starcraft with battle being over control nodes for bases, and around 15 units which both the player and AI use; so I don't expect this is a game you could pour hundreds of hours into the multiplier before getting bored. The turn based part of the game plays very much like a game of risk where conquest can be won though a RTS battle, so again it's simple but still effective. Everything else in the game plays out in dialog on your battleship with your generals, advisers and a princess  and they all have great personalities (you either love them or hate, but you care) so it keeps the dialog interesting and offers a lot of choices to keep multiple play through fresh. I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and while it has some shortcomings I would definitely recommend trying this game out, it is better then the sum of all it's parts.			"

												This game try's to do everything, and fails at all of it. The RTS is clumsy escpecially when you mix in dragon combat, with the AI's ability changing from being god like to village idiot. The grand tactics part is restrictive and dull, placing asinine restrictions on unit production/behavior. The Diplomatic sections is reaking of false dichotomies, giving you only 2 choices for many of the decisions that are more complex and could be handled better, not to mention the heavy handed agenda pushing from the writers. While a few of the characters are ""interesting"" they are also abrasive and 2 dimensional.To put it simply do NOT buy this game. You could save up to $80, $40 from the cost of the game and another $40 from not having to buy the copious amounts of acetametaphin you will have to take from the massive migraine this game will give you.

												This game is like Civilazation, only that you are a dragon that is trying to rebuild its empire. you have to make political descisons which effect how much money things cost in each nation. You also have to build armies and can change the tide in battle by becoming the dragon and helping your army. All and all amazing game with all of these conepts. Play it smart.			"

												Not the best rts ever made but one of the most intresting. The gameplay dosen't does not feel well rounded the rts ascpect isnt the best it servicable at best.The tbs is the same way but where the game shins is its diplomacy. You get to solve problems for your growing empire either by upvoting or down voting bills or side quest for your generals or queen. This really fleshes out the enitre world and makes you care about what you are fighting for. Its dedffinatly a gamw you should check out if your a fan of rts games. also you get a to play as a dragon with a jet pack A DRAGON WITH A JET PACK!!!!!			"

												Buy this game on sale for 85% off, even though it is worth the $45.00 Imperial Edition price. This game is so good I've bought it for other people when there was no excuse to give them a gift. I cannot give you a more greed orientated positive review. This game is your favorite candy bar only the size of a yardstick: The only thing bad about it is that you're eventually able to finish it. Which means it was too short and you've had too much of a good thing. This is three games in one, Risk, a FPS Warcraft (not WOW) and a (choose your own political ending) virtual novel. If Robert Greene's ""The 48 Laws of Power/The 33 Strategies of War"" and Frank Herbert ""God Emperor of Dune"" had a ten year old child hosting a D&D/Concordia game, this would be that game. It has everything a mostly silent regicidal megalomaniac could ask for; Politics, global war and an immortal silver tounged soul-eating daemon. The game itself is impossible at first; flying/fighting and micromanaging armies ect. Then playable once you understand the creative limitation/singular strategy of the AI. Then becomes laughably boaring once you realize how to farm cheat cards at the end of the first session and auto resolve with overwhelming advantages ad infinitum nauseum. All options are fine since you can choose how you want to play. Especially if you desire a story mode to see all choices and outcomes - AKA where the real interesting interactions are. One of the best games I've ever played. For a video review on this game see Angry Joe's ""Dragon Commander Angry Review"" on youtube.			"

												Do you enjoy Risk? That would be the question I’d ask, for those inquiring about this game.The nitty gritty of Dragon Commander, is that it’s a videogame implementation of a risk-type strategy boardgame, in a paperback fantasy setting, with solid characters and dialog, and an optional RTS mode. Whew, that sure was a sentence.While the overarching story is something you’d find in a Dragon Lance novel, your generals and councilors will be engaged in CYOA-style stories that develop the land of Rivellon, and your role within it. There’s incredible polish in everything from voice acting, animation, and visual design. As it’s not “Fire Emblem” long, nor “Fire Emblem” hard, I found myself stalling my forces, just so I could engage in more political decisions / view more character moments. So, I mentioned an RTS mode, earlier. Outside of deploying units on the map and essentially rolling the dice- risk-style, you can personally lead one battle, per turn, as a dragon. It plays as a fairly difficult RTS. I didn’t have fun with it, but I tend to be quite poor at RTS’s. It’s thankfully completely optional in beating the game, and probably best used as a way to change an unlikely battle’s odds. I kept wishing I could pause and direct orders.I will say that it’s RTS implementation is pretty novel. It’s kinda like Brutal Legend, in of that you can engage the world directly as a unit, in the midst of managing soldiers. All in all, I would definitely recommend Divinity: Dragon Commander for a long weekend.			"

												From the Reviews about this game I went in not really expecting much but the idea  of being a general and turning into a dragon to pound armies drew me in. First off......everyone who is upset over the interface of the military and not having a easy button....I fight battles with only a 10% success rate on the estimater and still make the enemy pound sand. The game is really great based on the fact you cant just play the dragon part or the army part and win battles all the time but have to hot swap back and forth...sometimes in mid battle and plug up the holes or destroy a particular part of the enemy army. AA rapes the the dragon but your army rapes the AA....same goes for air to ground troops.....they bang up your army until a dragon sweeps in and eats them alive while your army deals with the ground troops. If you are looking for a game that challenges you to interact heavily in the battles then this is the game			"

												Well this was a bit different!  I've played lots of rts games from Dune 2 onwards, (can't claim to be the 'ultimate' rts player sadly as I never played Herzog Zwei) and I was pleasantly suprised by the mix of role playing elements and action.  I've seen a few games that tried to shoe horn in action elements into an rts before (Dogs of War aprings to mind) but this one, with the overhead view from the Dragon is the best mix so far.  I think the strongest feature is the fact that the dragon usage is optional, you can play it as a straight RTS if you want to or get stuck in to the combat.  It is also the only game I've ever played that lets me make wider social decisions such as allowing gay marriage or introducing  forced conscription, and really forced me to balance my own moral sensibilities with trying to appease my councillors.  The bottom line, you can't please everyone, in the game on in life, but this game certainly pleased me.			"

												""Let me tell you right off the bat, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥..."" Not everyone likes you, half breed, you will have to prove yourself as commander. rofl, how can you not like this game? The dialogue is colorful and amusing and the characters are loveable; the added layers of depth to them really go a long way for immersion. What will my crew say next, will Henry ever be comrades with ""syphilis incarnate"" Edmund? Meanwhile, Catherine is furious about gender inequality on board your ship and Oberon won't stop being an annoying little bish elf. There are plenty of diplomatic choices your Councillors will seek your advice, same for your Generals. Your choice will have an entertaining impact to say the least.What I didn't like much was the combat. The RTS combat itself is so disappointing after a handful of times I ended up using auto-resolve. The units are ok but the enemy AI is pathetic that going into Dragon mode does not even save the day. Don't even bother.I love the overall game experience, especially, the macro, diplomacy, and character interactions - really pulls you in. I actually got this free for KickStarting ""Divinity: Original Sin"". Definite recommendation.			"

												Figure I'd get around to reviewing this one. Going to be short, as I'm lazy.Pros: - Dealing with the council members and the things they want to vote on is fantastically done. All of them are just straight fun to interact with. Much of their legislation parodies real world issues, and the writing overall is engaging. Often I'd make choices based on personal beliefs just as much as I would when considering possible boons in-game. - Choosing and later interacting with your wife (and subsequent wives if you... are a bad person) is incredibly well-done and exceptionally interesting. - In general, all characters are interesting and fun to interact with.Cons:- The Combat is horrible. There's just no other way to put it, it's atrocious. Eventually you get so powerful it goes from being horrible to horrible and absurdly easy.- Everything else.In closing, you won't get much playtime out of this game, but if you skip over the battles and focus on the interactions you'll get the value of your money and then some. Provided you get it on sale. Anything less than 10$, or the 5.99$ it is now, is worth it if you're okay with buying it just for the character interactions. "

												this game suffers from a horrific lack of ""auto-cast."" pretty simple. loads of units have individual powers which are very advantageous, but lets face it, we got this game so we could fly around the battle field as a dragon and kill stuff. that's not conducive to the kind of mico management you need to make best use of said abilities. as it is the game is frustratingly difficult on medium. I wanted to give a positive review as i like the things larian studios has been doing lately, i love the story and strategic elements to this game, the tactical portion needs work. until they fix some of the mechanics i'd say wait for a really low sale.

												Frankly I feel a bit ripped off, the parts on the ship are fun and the characters are nicely rendered. But the RTS element is just plain awful. So much so that I wish I could auto battle every fight. The RTS controls are so clunky that choosing your troops while in dragon mode would probably require a third hand. The RTS graphic are near prehistoric and belong on the PS1. If the game was only composed of the things inside the ship I would have been much happier, the voice acting and charater design were top notch. However as it stands it's a primitive, below average RTS wrapped in pretty RPG robes. I disinstalled after 2 hours of gameplay, life is too short.			"

												This game mixes many different game types into one epic package. It has three main game types, A risk-like board game, an RTS/third person shooter game, and a political simulator. The battle board will be familiar to anyone who has played risk. The player moves units turn based and can choose to join a battle to aid the troops. This part is well executed and integrates well with the ability to upgrade and research new units.When in a battle the RTS gameplay takes over. The controls take a little getting used to in the rts mode. The ability to transform into a dragon and change the tide of the battle is what really sets this game apart. It is so unique and refreshing and it give a whole new responsibility for the player to use skills.The political simulator is decent. It is lacking in some depth, but what it is lacking is easily made up in the rest of the game. The choices are yes and no and are somewhat predictable. However juggling the outcomes and viewpoints of the races was very fun in my opinion.If you follow the story line, it is easy to stay interested. The gameplay can get a little repetitive though. Luckily there are things that can keep it interesting such as the strategy cards. Overall I would give this game an 8/10 because it is so unique and refreshing to use your brain to follow the different possible outcomes.			"

												This game deserves a lot of praise. The mixture of RPG elements on-board an RTS style game works very well. The UI doesn't feel over encumbered, without limiting your control over the game. Tutorials are short, sweet and easy to get the hang of. The ability to control your army while offering it assistance as the titler Dragon Commander is a great feature. His Third Person Gameplay doesn't feel tacked on in any way either, it feels like a proper solid element in it's own right.On top of that all of that, the management of the factions ambassadors gives even more depth. There is a large amount of varied, interesting characters to meet, greet and discuss with on your command ship. They don't feel forced, and can sometimes be a joy to interact with. I get a lot of pleasure having a large battle, then coming back to sort out a trade agreement or some such with the ambassadors only adds to my enjoyment.I'd highly recommend this to anyone fond of Management/RTS games. However, if you want to play it mainly for the Dragon, Management or the pure RTS Gameplay, you have to take into account that each is only a part of this game. You will have to do all three; manage your Empire, as well as your army, upgrades and your Dragon form. The last thing I will say is; if you want this game I have another suggestion. Buy the boxed version new! I bought it when it first came out, cheaper then any digital download version I saw. The box itself is a very nicely put together thing with a lot of detail, no slap dash cheap boxing. The main thing about it though is the box copy comes with both Steam and GOG versions of the game. The Disk is the steam version, but there is also a Redeem code for a full digital version of the game for GOG. I gave it to a friend as a gift, perhaps you could too?			"

												Well this was a bit different!  I've played lots of rts games from Dune 2 onwards, (can't claim to be the 'ultimate' rts player sadly as I never played Herzog Zwei) and I was pleasantly suprised by the mix of role playing elements and action.  I've seen a few games that tried to shoe horn in action elements into an rts before (Dogs of War aprings to mind) but this one, with the overhead view from the Dragon is the best mix so far.  I think the strongest feature is the fact that the dragon usage is optional, you can play it as a straight RTS if you want to or get stuck in to the combat.  It is also the only game I've ever played that lets me make wider social decisions such as allowing gay marriage or introducing  forced conscription, and really forced me to balance my own moral sensibilities with trying to appease my councillors.  The bottom line, you can't please everyone, in the game on in life, but this game certainly pleased me.			"

												Larian does it again with this amazing and deep mashup of classic strategy genres. You take some turn-based & real-time strategy, add in strategy cards, throw in a bunch of hot-button political issues, and mix in some excellent third-person action gameplay and you get Divinity: Dragon Commander. 7/10.

												I got my♥♥♥♥♥♥handed to me in the story... and on my wedding day of all days! So I sold my peoples souls to a demon in echange for 2 iowa-class battleships.... which were promptly obliterated by the horde of imps. Would've sold my wife too but i figured it was way too late I had nothing but my capital and her left so might aswell atleast keep her.This games is awesome though. honestly I am unsure wether it's the RTS-battles or the way the campaign map is handled but something is up here, though iI'm not sure exactly what it is. The political part of the game however is excellent though, the issues that come up are fun, and some really make you question what your position on the issues are if you play with a moral compass as I did the first game.My only complaint in that respect is how it kind of feels rushed, and even detached from the war entirely. Like why am I dealing with a genocide that happened in a town that is not under my control? Why do I have any power ofver the society of the Undead, Imps, or Dwarves when none of their provinces are under my control?I feel the political aspect is not perfect, but for the first game of this kind (Atleast that I've seen) it is wonderfully refreshing.From the little references and jokes yelled by your soldiers during battles, to the dark humor, to the rampant homosexuality, high as a kite elves, sociopathic Imps, encouraged necrOphelia. this game is pretty good and I whole heartedly recommend it. It is worth playing, and I plan on playing it again after a couple days break.On a side-note:I do sense a tad bit of prejudice against the religious side though. while between the five races  their seems to be attempts at both balance and degrees when you go to the religious side... it just seems to only be one degree of religion. I think the Elves are supposed to tbe the moderate-religious, and the Lizards the moderate-athiest (maybe Agnostic?). but the only one who really plays the role well is the Lizards, and the elves seem to just let that role drop off completely. but that's just a personal observation, you may see something different.Either way. 8.5/10 I could not be happier with it. but I would suggest buying it on sale. $40 may be just a little steep for the title, but it may not be for you. I personally think anything below $30 is a ""must-git deal"" as they say back home.			"

												Divinity: Dragon Commander has the feel of one of those bargain bin games you pick up on a whim for 10 dollars and expect it to entertain you for an afternoon. The more you play, the more you see just the amount of sheer love and hard work that went into this wonderful gem of a game that I would call one of my favorite games of the last few years. Dragons are so satisfying to use (although it can trivialize battles a great deal, but then again you are a dragon with a jetpack.) The unit themselves have their own unique flavors and playstyles that make it easy to overlook how few there actually are. Politics are a great way to break up time amongst the Raven, and your side character array is made up of a merry cast that grow on you as you spend time with them and hear their problems.There are some cons to all these of course, mainly the way the AI handles campaigns and some policies. This game favors blitzing through battles and campaigns. Failure to do so will often lead to the enemy getting too strong that not even your overpowered Dragon can handle them. Campaign wise, if you stamp out the enemy too quickly, they may fall into a rut of not counter attacking back and accepting their fate.  If you take too long, you may find yourself hopelessly outclassed against an overwhelming array of troops at their forces versus your village militia. Politics, while fun, suffer from a YES or NO system that can cause you to end up with neither choices feeling satisfying, while a more grey area could have been more of a benefit.Overall, I give this game a 8.5/10 (in normal, non gaming journalism scoring system). This is indeed a great experience that is extremely lovely and rad, but it has small design choices that bring down the experience ever so slightly. That being said, I am now a major fan of Larian and Divinity due to this game and do not regret the 3 purchases I have made towards this game. Dragon Commander is a diamond that deserves a special spot on the shelves where you can look upon it fondly for the true classic it is.			"

												I was concerned getting this game when if first launched because of the RTS aspect. Having played and enjoyed all other divinity games, I knew it would be good- just I would struggle with RTS. The game is phenomenal. I've gone through several play throughs just to enjoy the story. I've been successful to varying degrees in RTS (hard as well). I still am not good at RTS, but learning shortcuts and critical dragon powers easily compensates in some cases. The stories are fun and well thought out. A blast to play.I HIGHLY recommend this.			"

												Definitely a worthy game to play. Funny enough the map view and planning where your units are to be placed in anticipation of the enemy move was what really sucked me in - I spent ages making sure I could get the best outcome.Definitely replay value here too, if not for the map conquest aspect then the myriad of different political outcomes, which too gave you pause on whether to approve or veto something - never knowing what kind twist would come back to bite you on the♥♥♥♥♥♥later. Graphically, I really like it. Some of the maps do get re-used in combat and I ran into a spate of the same map for a little bit due to the area I was fighting over, but the character detail as well as the dialogue led to some amusing screenshots of ""you can't say that♥♥♥♥♥♥"" and a few lulz. When you DO get tired of combat, remember - stack your units to overwhelming odds and just let the Imperial army NPC fight and win for you, or otherwise commission your generals so they can possibly get a skillup out of it. Some turns you will just do idle moves to progress further in story because you want to find out what happens next... and that's okay.  "

												""Let me tell you right off the bat, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥..."" Not everyone likes you, half breed, you will have to prove yourself as commander. rofl, how can you not like this game? The dialogue is colorful and amusing and the characters are loveable; the added layers of depth to them really go a long way for immersion. What will my crew say next, will Henry ever be comrades with ""syphilis incarnate"" Edmund? Meanwhile, Catherine is furious about gender inequality on board your ship and Oberon won't stop being an annoying little bish elf. There are plenty of diplomatic choices your Councillors will seek your advice, same for your Generals. Your choice will have an entertaining impact to say the least.What I didn't like much was the combat. The RTS combat itself is so disappointing after a handful of times I ended up using auto-resolve. The units are ok but the enemy AI is pathetic that going into Dragon mode does not even save the day. Don't even bother.I love the overall game experience, especially, the macro, diplomacy, and character interactions - really pulls you in. I actually got this free for KickStarting ""Divinity: Original Sin"". Definite recommendation.			"

												Figure I'd get around to reviewing this one. Going to be short, as I'm lazy.Pros: - Dealing with the council members and the things they want to vote on is fantastically done. All of them are just straight fun to interact with. Much of their legislation parodies real world issues, and the writing overall is engaging. Often I'd make choices based on personal beliefs just as much as I would when considering possible boons in-game. - Choosing and later interacting with your wife (and subsequent wives if you... are a bad person) is incredibly well-done and exceptionally interesting. - In general, all characters are interesting and fun to interact with.Cons:- The Combat is horrible. There's just no other way to put it, it's atrocious. Eventually you get so powerful it goes from being horrible to horrible and absurdly easy.- Everything else.In closing, you won't get much playtime out of this game, but if you skip over the battles and focus on the interactions you'll get the value of your money and then some. Provided you get it on sale. Anything less than 10$, or the 5.99$ it is now, is worth it if you're okay with buying it just for the character interactions. "

												My two favorite types of games are RPGs and Strategy games, so you can imagine how much Divinity: Dragon Commander appeals to me specifically. However, even despite this bias, I feel that some people have been a bit unfair to the game. Many have criticized the RTS sections for being either bland or easily exploitable, which is fair to an extent, but in my opinion, does NOT bring the rest of the game down at all. At worst, at least for me anyway, it was just a neutral activity which helped immerse me in the fantastically built game world by presenting me with an up close look at my conquests. And although it took me a bit of time to work out which difficulty was best for me, once I began to stick to normal difficulty I found the turn based strategy sections to be both engaging and difficult, and the RTS sections just beatable enough that they never became frustrating. In my opinion, if you're like me and you are a fan of both RPGs and strategy games, there is no reason not to pick this game up.			"

												This game try's to do everything, and fails at all of it. The RTS is clumsy escpecially when you mix in dragon combat, with the AI's ability changing from being god like to village idiot. The grand tactics part is restrictive and dull, placing asinine restrictions on unit production/behavior. The Diplomatic sections is reaking of false dichotomies, giving you only 2 choices for many of the decisions that are more complex and could be handled better, not to mention the heavy handed agenda pushing from the writers. While a few of the characters are ""interesting"" they are also abrasive and 2 dimensional.To put it simply do NOT buy this game. You could save up to $80, $40 from the cost of the game and another $40 from not having to buy the copious amounts of acetametaphin you will have to take from the massive migraine this game will give you.

												Buy this game on sale for 85% off, even though it is worth the $45.00 Imperial Edition price. This game is so good I've bought it for other people when there was no excuse to give them a gift. I cannot give you a more greed orientated positive review. This game is your favorite candy bar only the size of a yardstick: The only thing bad about it is that you're eventually able to finish it. Which means it was too short and you've had too much of a good thing. This is three games in one, Risk, a FPS Warcraft (not WOW) and a (choose your own political ending) virtual novel. If Robert Greene's ""The 48 Laws of Power/The 33 Strategies of War"" and Frank Herbert ""God Emperor of Dune"" had a ten year old child hosting a D&D/Concordia game, this would be that game. It has everything a mostly silent regicidal megalomaniac could ask for; Politics, global war and an immortal silver tounged soul-eating daemon. The game itself is impossible at first; flying/fighting and micromanaging armies ect. Then playable once you understand the creative limitation/singular strategy of the AI. Then becomes laughably boaring once you realize how to farm cheat cards at the end of the first session and auto resolve with overwhelming advantages ad infinitum nauseum. All options are fine since you can choose how you want to play. Especially if you desire a story mode to see all choices and outcomes - AKA where the real interesting interactions are. One of the best games I've ever played. For a video review on this game see Angry Joe's ""Dragon Commander Angry Review"" on youtube.			"

												Where to start... First, lets talk about the concept and setting of this game. Being set in a fantasy realm, where technolgy and magic are blended together into a neat Steampunk-like setting. I must admit, it's very appealing.The gameplay itself, when fighting the enemies, and waging war, seems to split itself between turn based combat, and RTS. Admittedly it's a bit dull, and also rather repetitive, shifting between outright easy and relaxing, to stressfully hard, with no warning between the two. Some might find that appealing, but I honestly don't. HOWEVER, if things go badly for you, you can also jump into the battle yourself, as you are a giant fire-breathing dragon who also is wearing a jetpack. Yes. You are a dragon. With wings, with a jetpack. Very appealing.Outside of the combat, you take on the role of deciding how the empire should be run in terms of law, certain economical factors, racism, ect. To be honest, I think this was my favorite part of the game, as your morals in the real world don't necessarily work the same in a fantasy world.Here's a good example. In the real world, I believe religious stories should not be part of teaching, my reasons being my own. However, in this game, it made sense to have such stories taught, due to the fantastical nature of the world in which the characters lived. Remember, dragon with jetpack. You would need that kind of teaching.And as an added little bonus, for once in a game, the undead are not considered evil, or even dark and potentially bad. They are simply just people. A little overtly pious, but people none the less. This is the first game to do that for me, which may be small, but it's a bug plus.All in all, it's a fun game. Maybe nothing that'll last the test of time, but still a game worth playing.			"

												Best Game in History. Combines my favorite game style and themes all in one. Risk style map strategy, Political Decisions that actually matter, marriage, RTS battles handled by you or your generals, and lets not forget the most important detail..You turn into a flippin dragon and roast your enemy to ashes! Also offers good challenge level, not too easy, yet not too hard. What are you waiting for?! BUY IT!			"

												Following on from the excellent RPG ""Ego Draconis"" (get it if you haven't), this is a change of direction for the Divinity bulldozer, and probably a disappointment for anyone (like me) who enjoyed the RPGs.  Takes a bit of reorientation to pick this one up, and if set to easy/casual mode it's just a walkover.  Some difficulties with certain mice using the centre button/wheel as this just doesn't click in.  Otherwise an interesting strategy game, whose continuing appeal is in the voice-overs.  A great many games like this out there, and while this is a good game, hard to see it has anything above any of the rest.  And there really are a lot of them if you look!			"

												I'd still recommend it and I say it is still enjoyable but just be warned the game does feel like an incomplete game.The battle gets repetitive VERY fast. And though the story elements are very nice there are not much replay one can get out  of it. The main thing that offers replayability (I know that is not a real word... yet) is the whole choices on make with your wife.Still, the game is nice despite feeling incomplete. Not really worth paying the full price. Sale price? Not that bad really if you want a relatively less common game elements. A real shame it feels so incomplete. Had so much potential.			"

												Bad bad bad bad.There is no strategy in this real time strategy game.  As an RTS, its an unfeasable zerg rush simulator.  If you take the time to build your base, you will lose.  If you focus on capturing the map, you will lose.  The only strategy is to rush your enemy before it gets some semblance of a foothold.On that note, the enemy can trigger all their abilities at once, while yours have to be done manually, invididually.  The enemy can use all of their buildings, command their troops, and use their abilities all at the same time, making things more onesided as time goes on.If you have the bright idea to bring out your dragon, you will quickly be demolished.  You don't do nearly enough damage, and being a dragon in battle is more of a hinderence than a help.  One you can't leave being in dragon form unless you get yourself killed, so you might even get the pleasure of watching your base get destroyed while you struggle to control your units and buildings from above.Apparently the RPG aspect of the game is either great or abysmal depending on who you ask.  The reviews suggest it between a waifu simulator and a radical tumblr propaganda piece, but you have to get past the rest of the game, which frankly, isn't worth the time or effort, to find out.Don't buy it unless its on sale.  A steep sale. Like... christmas 80% off sale.			"

												Figure I'd get around to reviewing this one. Going to be short, as I'm lazy.Pros: - Dealing with the council members and the things they want to vote on is fantastically done. All of them are just straight fun to interact with. Much of their legislation parodies real world issues, and the writing overall is engaging. Often I'd make choices based on personal beliefs just as much as I would when considering possible boons in-game. - Choosing and later interacting with your wife (and subsequent wives if you... are a bad person) is incredibly well-done and exceptionally interesting. - In general, all characters are interesting and fun to interact with.Cons:- The Combat is horrible. There's just no other way to put it, it's atrocious. Eventually you get so powerful it goes from being horrible to horrible and absurdly easy.- Everything else.In closing, you won't get much playtime out of this game, but if you skip over the battles and focus on the interactions you'll get the value of your money and then some. Provided you get it on sale. Anything less than 10$, or the 5.99$ it is now, is worth it if you're okay with buying it just for the character interactions. "

												My two favorite types of games are RPGs and Strategy games, so you can imagine how much Divinity: Dragon Commander appeals to me specifically. However, even despite this bias, I feel that some people have been a bit unfair to the game. Many have criticized the RTS sections for being either bland or easily exploitable, which is fair to an extent, but in my opinion, does NOT bring the rest of the game down at all. At worst, at least for me anyway, it was just a neutral activity which helped immerse me in the fantastically built game world by presenting me with an up close look at my conquests. And although it took me a bit of time to work out which difficulty was best for me, once I began to stick to normal difficulty I found the turn based strategy sections to be both engaging and difficult, and the RTS sections just beatable enough that they never became frustrating. In my opinion, if you're like me and you are a fan of both RPGs and strategy games, there is no reason not to pick this game up.			"

												This realm of imps, lizardmen, and walking skeletons coincidentally happens to grapple with all of the same political soundbyte issues of 21st human civilization! The devs really want you to know that, so you'll spend a fair amount of time learning that elves like to smoke the green stuff and dwarves detest universal healthcare. Fortunately it doesn't ruin the game's immersion... because it's really not that immersive to begin with. No small number of mistakes in ability descriptions and other in-game text, to boot.Your generals will do a roll-of-the-dice job at resolving battles for you, so on the Risk-style map your options are to either amass a force that even in the most inept hands could still overpower the enemy and let an AI general take care of the battle for you, or invade with a laughably underpowered force but control the army yourself, RTS-style. If you can stay alive for the first 2 minutes of battle, you'll then be able to transform into a dragon and with even a modicum of FPS-skill obliterate the entire enemy force.The RTS depth is kiddie pool. Spam unit construction and send them all in a big blob at the enemy base. If they aren't able to take care of it on their own, again, you're a dragon in the sky, raining down AOE death on the AI's clumsily clumped units. When they finally get respectable anti-air units around Chapter 2, you'll have to disengage occasionally and invest in the dragon skills that give better health and HP regen, but ultimately, it just doesn't feel like this game reaches satisfying enough heights to justify the sheer number of times you're going to have to go through the ""Build a factory"", ""Spam units"", ""Select all units and mass attack on enemy base"", ""Support them from the skies"" routine. That glimmer of fun from the first few battles quickly fades into monotony. Cut all that out in favor of the auto-resolve AI generals, and all you're left with is modified Risk interspersed with obnoxious inflamatory topics of debate in the throne room.The Pros? Those first few flights as a dragon, singlehandedly nullifying the enemy's army investment. Quality voice acting. A fresh take on RTS controls--learning how to manage the hotkeys while also flying and fighting is a new experience. Princesses!			"

												This game try's to do everything, and fails at all of it. The RTS is clumsy escpecially when you mix in dragon combat, with the AI's ability changing from being god like to village idiot. The grand tactics part is restrictive and dull, placing asinine restrictions on unit production/behavior. The Diplomatic sections is reaking of false dichotomies, giving you only 2 choices for many of the decisions that are more complex and could be handled better, not to mention the heavy handed agenda pushing from the writers. While a few of the characters are ""interesting"" they are also abrasive and 2 dimensional.To put it simply do NOT buy this game. You could save up to $80, $40 from the cost of the game and another $40 from not having to buy the copious amounts of acetametaphin you will have to take from the massive migraine this game will give you.

												Well this was a bit different!  I've played lots of rts games from Dune 2 onwards, (can't claim to be the 'ultimate' rts player sadly as I never played Herzog Zwei) and I was pleasantly suprised by the mix of role playing elements and action.  I've seen a few games that tried to shoe horn in action elements into an rts before (Dogs of War aprings to mind) but this one, with the overhead view from the Dragon is the best mix so far.  I think the strongest feature is the fact that the dragon usage is optional, you can play it as a straight RTS if you want to or get stuck in to the combat.  It is also the only game I've ever played that lets me make wider social decisions such as allowing gay marriage or introducing  forced conscription, and really forced me to balance my own moral sensibilities with trying to appease my councillors.  The bottom line, you can't please everyone, in the game on in life, but this game certainly pleased me.			"

												Buy this game on sale for 85% off, even though it is worth the $45.00 Imperial Edition price. This game is so good I've bought it for other people when there was no excuse to give them a gift. I cannot give you a more greed orientated positive review. This game is your favorite candy bar only the size of a yardstick: The only thing bad about it is that you're eventually able to finish it. Which means it was too short and you've had too much of a good thing. This is three games in one, Risk, a FPS Warcraft (not WOW) and a (choose your own political ending) virtual novel. If Robert Greene's ""The 48 Laws of Power/The 33 Strategies of War"" and Frank Herbert ""God Emperor of Dune"" had a ten year old child hosting a D&D/Concordia game, this would be that game. It has everything a mostly silent regicidal megalomaniac could ask for; Politics, global war and an immortal silver tounged soul-eating daemon. The game itself is impossible at first; flying/fighting and micromanaging armies ect. Then playable once you understand the creative limitation/singular strategy of the AI. Then becomes laughably boaring once you realize how to farm cheat cards at the end of the first session and auto resolve with overwhelming advantages ad infinitum nauseum. All options are fine since you can choose how you want to play. Especially if you desire a story mode to see all choices and outcomes - AKA where the real interesting interactions are. One of the best games I've ever played. For a video review on this game see Angry Joe's ""Dragon Commander Angry Review"" on youtube.			"

												Dragon commander is an excellent game. Where it simplifies it does so in deference to added complexeties in other regions.All troops are the same, all factions are effectively equivalent. Research adds a bit of differential between factions, but that's it.Otherwise there's a nice political subgame with options for making broad imperial decisions the ramifications of which have an effect on gameplay, and intereactions with a characterized crew/cabinet.Much of the game can be played simply auto-resolving battles and your generals come in handy for just that (though their wages are insane). Each turn you can take control of a RTS battle and take to the skies as your dragon. Various upgrades for your dragon can make it a game changing leader, a strike bomber, a support healer, or a mix therein. This game is slick, it's pretty, it's the best execution of this kind of gimmick since Sacrifice. Multiplayer will add a great deal to its replayability if you can get some friends to play with.You're likely to get 15 odd very pleasant hours out of this game and then if you're like me you're likely to come back to it to see other princesses etc. (P.S. No gendering options are present. You are male and you are afforded chattel princesses.)Also the music is just great, if a smidge repetetive. I found it good enough to tolerate that repetition readily.8/10			"
