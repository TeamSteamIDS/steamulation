												This could have been interesting. Idea is there, but graphics are bad and max resolution only 1024x768 which is too weak. Don't put youre money on this, ther's a lot of other choices on Steam.			"

												A pretty fun puzzle game. The kind that's easy to learn and yet keeps going good.  The art for the scenes is fun too.			"

												Max resolution capped at 1024x768, which is lazy. If there's one thing you could've done before you put it on a distribution platform like Steam...Handling felt clunky. I think having a huge portion of my screen taken up by the tools frustrated me. Idea seemed kind of cute, but i'm not really captured by it. The puzzling is quite simple at a glance, which clearly gets more complicated but i'm not sure it's a game anyone would spend more than an hour playing. It just reeks of smart phone/tablet market with little care for PC. Music was decent enough, fitted the theme well.			"

												Original idea, charming art style and fun to play. Works for me on Windows 7 64-bit. Only 1024x768 and 800x600 resolutions are available but using a 1680x1050 monitor, I didn't think this made it look too bad, the cartoon style graphics work well. At first I was annoyed by the camera not tracking the ""jelly train"" but there's a button to toggle this on/off, so not an issue.Reminded me a little of vintage Crash Bandicoot on PlaystationGet it in Humble's German Edition bundle, June 2014.

												This is what I call a game! Fun to play, an awesome graphics, a great atmosphere and simple to control. Your goal is to get a little jelly (or pudding) riding on a rollercoaster car from an entrance to the exit. But watch out! There are plenty of monsters that are trying to scare the little jelly out of his mind! While your car is constantly moving you can manipulate tracks, scare away monsters and place some traps to stop them. The game offers four worlds each containing 12 levels. The difficulty is of great variability from the first easy straight-forward relaxing world to the last one full of complicated and long tracks. All levels are fun and they never get too frustrating but once you finished them there is no replay value (you can collect the vip coupon in every level but you'll probably collect them in the first run). Overall The Great Jitters is entertaining little game with only one bigger drawback being it's short length.Pros:-Great cartoon graphics and animations-Spooky haunted house sound desing-Fun to playCons:-A little bit short-The game would greatly benefit from a widescreen resolution (max resolution is 1024x768, but 1280x720 would be ideal so you can see more of the level)-Can get slightly repetitive in the last few levels			"

												Boring crappy game. Resolution doesn't go past 1024 (hello mobile game). Also the gameplay is simple, boring and repetitive. You literally just switch junctions at a few parts of a predesigned course to get your guy to the end. It is just a bunch of trial and error with basically no fun to be had, unless you enjoy clicking 3 buttons on the screen the whole game with your mouse. 4/10.			"

												BE WARNEDThis game is unplayable.  I posted to Desura my problem.  I emailed the Devs, no response.  I posted here and tried the two solutions that eventually worked for people. My setup is a 3770k with win 7 64, pretty much.   And this thing does not work.  I would refund it but i got the key somewhere, bundled or through groupees.I hope the devs don't make anymore steam games.To me, this is a scam game.			"

												I bought this game expecting a plucky pudding protaganist. What I got instead was a bowl of LIES, with a side of Jello. This game may have began development as a true pudding game, but it eventually joined the much larger jello genre pioneered by Bill Cosby. I have not felt this betrayed by something I love since I burned my foot in my toaster.			"

YouTube™ Video: The Great Jitters: Pudding Panic - let's play & first impressions 

			Views: 91		

			This is my first impressions of The Great Jitters: Pudding Panic by Kunst-Stoff GmbH. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam.		

I played The Great Jitters: Pudding Panic for almost 40 minutes in order to get a first impressions.The game looks good for what it is. Reminds me of the Donkey Kong games which also had carts on rails and stuff like that.You change the destination of the jelly (it’s not a pudding dammit!) protagonist by manipulating the tracks. You can activate special abilities to neutralize monsters. You have to get the jelly to the end.It’s fun and easy to get the hang of. It becomes more challenging and complex. It helps to out your actions.Probably worth the $6.99 full price.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			"

												Cons: First start is in 320x240 res, and then running in windowed is pretty much mandatory. 1024x768 is so 2001. Then again, maybe this game actually is from jolly ol' 2001? I don't know!Pros: Fun enough realtime puzzling involving a ... pudding ...			"

												Pudding Panic is a game of simple ambitions, that doesn't even try to disguise its mobile origins. Neither is an issue, though, as the game is executed very well - simple but atmospheric visuals and audio, properly transformed controls, and levels that make you stop and think, but not too hard. And if you don't feel like thinking your way through a level, eliminating the baddies, there's always the option to rush forward - if you're quick enough with the mouse.It's a charming, cheerful little game, which I can wholeheartedly recommend - it offers 3-4 hours of casual fun.
