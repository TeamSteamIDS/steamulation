Early Access Review
								I bought Interplanetary on an impulse, because it was on sale and i wanted to play a new game with my friends.I didn't expect much from it, but it turns out to be a really good game!Even though it's an early release, the game is well balanced and looks and feels like a full release.Have yet to encounter any serious issues (had a little lag in a single player game, but that is to be expected with those amounts of calculations).Singleplayer is okay, the AI are a decent challenge. But where the game really excells, is in the multiplayer.Play with at least three people and watch the chaos unfold. Pacts are made, truces broken and backs are stabbed.The only recommendations i would make to the developers:- Add more research; the skill tree is largely resource boosters. Perhaps some more unlockable buildings or weapons?- Different difficulties for AI- The ability to set teams before launching a game- More variety in buildings would be nice too, and perhaps the option to upgrade/specialize a cityThe points mentioned are not essential to have in this game! All of them would, however, make the game better (in my opinion).Conclusion:8/10, this game has a lot of potential! "

								A review isn't ethically possible until the game officially launches, but so far I'm having a great time with it.  The game shows a lot of promise and is well worth a look. It has all of the ingredients for a potentially outstanding game. My son and I especially like the hotseat option...check out video #3 below to see what I mean.  :)Preview:  http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/interplanetary-preview/Gameplay Videos:

								I played the game during the alpha, and it is quite fun. Granted, if you are looking for fast paced action this might not be the game for you. However, if you enjoy turn-based strategy games that require some thinking, planning, and a a dash of luck, then Interplanetary is well worth a look, especially for the price.I wrote up an in-depth hands-on of Interplanetary during the alpha test in case anyone is looking for more info about the game:http://www.deathbybeta.com/articles/interplanetary-alpha-hands-on/ "

												I've been following this game since late 2013 when I got it, and since then it has turned out to be one of the best $5 I spent. Granted, that was on sale when it was in beta, so it's increased to 15, with a good sale going probably from 10-12, but the game is still a very good, if not an amazing buy. Pros (As of May 13, 2015. Initial release):+No issues with large lobbies anymore. Large lobbies are supported and quite awesome.+Cool graphics. You can see every shot with very little FPS drop.+From what my friends and I have tried and tested, the game seems decently balanced, from early rushes to late game turtle. +Full, 26 piece tech tree that ensures that you can't simply rush in one direction without feeling the loss in other sectors. For example, if you singlemindedly rush lasers, you won't be able to build any defenses to counter the railguns that someone else built for half the cost and time.+n-body physics on the main game map. Now I get it, a game about firing weapons through outer space better have a good physics engine, but this game is just awesome. Every massive (e.g. not weapons) body in the game exerts a force on projectiles, to the point where a gas giant that's behind your planet will mess up your firing arcs pointing in front of you. It can be frustrating, but its the best part and main attraction of the game.+Non-instantaneous projectiles mean that you have to do some aiming at your target rather than just pointing your guns at them.+Different level AI. Given that I haven't tried too many of them out, but still they offer training before you hit the scary players out there.+Intuitive building mechanics. Everything makes sense pretty much instantly. You have two resources, balance them.+Customizable lobbies. No more are games confined to 5 cities and 100000 minerals, but these are now modifiable for custom gaming. These, along with other things (like what weapons can be built, what size planets are, etc.), are nearly fully variable! This includes making games private so that only your friends can join.+Turn timers. This was important, because people could sit in a game, raging, and never passing their turn. That would cause the game to stall out, but now with turn timers, that happens no more! Eat it, sore losers.Neutrals:Turn timer only goes up to three minutes, which isn't enough in the late game.Music is very good, but it is on loop and there isn't too much variety (About 8ish minutes of it, I THINK), but you can mute it and play your own in the background.One game has a length of anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on how slow the starts are and how long it takes to get lucky with damage distributions.Cons:-Has two decently sized bugs. One freezes the turn permanently if everyone in the game has passed except one. If that one person leaves the game instead of ending his turn, the game bugs out, sadly. The other is minor and easily fixable if you hit enough random buttons: the missile lock is funky. If you don't click on a target planet fast enough you screen looses its UI and you have to hit escape to go to the pause menu. When you come back, everything is fixed.-Not a huge community. Before the game was fully released (i.e. beta) there was a very small community which could barely field a few pick-up games a day. Today there were lobbies open at all times though. Seems the release has breathed new life here. -Game incorporates randomness in play affecting areas. Everyone's population and science increase at slightly different rates, meaning that you can never quite have the same opener/information on all players. On turn 10 of one game, a certain tech may be 1 turn research, where in another game it is 2 turns. Not huge, but for the hardcore people like myself, this can, in theory, hurt a few games in a hundred.-Learning curve exists. While a pro to some people due to it's depth and skill based gaming, this means that you WILL lose your first game against random players. Hopefully you will be talking in chat the whole way with more experienced players who can teach you the ropes, but maybe not. -Slight runaway leader scenario. The player with the better economy on turn ten will also have a better econ on turn 20, and 30 and 40... If you try and build a ton of railguns or lasers to hit the guy who is shooting you every turn with 10+, you are going to lose the war. If you try and fight fire with fire, you are going to get burned. Sadly, this is the most intuitive way to go about playing, and some people might call certain strategies unbalanced as a result.-+-All in all, if you like not-casual-but-not-super-competitive games about space, and/or artillery, and/or resource management, then this game could be for you. It certainly was for me. It is 100% worth the $11.99 on sale, and it's almost surely worth the $15 normal price. It's been a fun 80 hours, and I put in about 8 a week.(Buy this game.)(Do it.)			"

												***This review was written using a Press key provided by the Developer for review purposes***Interplanetary is a turn-based strategy game set in Space that is currently available through Steam Early Access. In Interplanetary you wage war against AI or human players across an entire solar system which is randomly generated each time you play so you'll never play the same game twice.A word of warning, if you want this game purely for a singleplayer experience I'd suggest holding out on it but if you're looking for a great multiplayer strategy experience you have found it.+The graphics are quite nice and even when you zoom in very close to the planets they look great+Nice visual effects when enemy planets or your own planet gets hit by enemy fire+The game has fantastic projectile physics but I'll come back to physics later+Thanks to the turn-based nature of the game you can really take your time with choosing what to build and where to attack to maximise your power+Despite the tutorial being several intimidating pages of text explaining core mechanics this game is relatively simple to understand and once you have a basic understanding of it you'll quickly improve and figure out how everything works+Buildings can be upgraded to improve them in a way which suits the building, for example extra damage for railguns, and each building can only have two upgrades which prevents AI and players alike from developing overpowered buildings+The resource management is very simple in Interplanetary and there are only two resources in the game so you often have to make simple but difficult decisions regarding what to build next+Trying to figure out the right trajectory for your attacks is incredibly challenging but also a whole load of fun though I did feel that it was too difficult at times especially when firing across the solar system with other planets in your way as the game gives you no indication of their speed so you have to guess where they'll be to avoid entering their gravitational fields+Even at this relatively early stage in development the tech tree is already quite good and it contains boosts to material, power etc. as well as the expected unlockable buildings+Even just loading up an empty game and shooting at nearby planets is fun+Good variety of weapons+The game's calculations take place impressively quickly-AI are overpowered and have no levels of difficulty. In my time playing this against AI I never once saw them miss a shot and as far as I can tell they also build much faster than you can, as I was struggling to build a second weapon I was already being bombarded by three weapons-Of course it is in Early Access and allowances should be made but it isn't overly realistic. First off not all of the planets orbit in the same direction. Secondly, and this is me perhaps being a little too critical, the type of planets you'll find in a solar system often don't match what should be found where they are orbiting, for example Earth-like planets orbiting very close to suns and barren Mars-like planets in outer orbits towards the edge of the solar system-There aren't many people playing this game so if you don't have friends who own it or you can't play local multiplayer you might struggle to find any matches-The defensive buildings in the game are almost entirely useless, particularly against AI-You can't save your progressWorth a mention:-The predicted paths that the game provides when you are choosing trajectories become entirely incorrect as soon as your weapon firesVerdict:8Despite the lack of a good AI this game is a fantastic strategy game and can be enjoyed in more than just the usual ways, I'd strongly recommend getting this to play with friends.El K.

												War.  War never changes.Strap in and put on your helmet, soldier, 'cause Irreverend Opinions is taking a shot at Interplanetary!---The BlurbInterplanetary is a three-dimensional artillery tactical game of war between planets.  Players (or AI) control a planet, directing research and construction, and then aiming various cannons, missiles, lasers, and superweapons at their opposing cities and infrastructure, having to work around the gravitational pull and orbital drift of their opponents.The GoodThe simplicity that Interplanetary depicts their controls cannot be overstated.   The various screens give you access to all that you need at that level; construction shows you what you can build (and whether you can afford it), weapons show you 'targeting lines' to display what the expected shot path is, according to gravity and such.No number-crunching beyond ""do I have enough power to shoot this laser"" is needed, and even then, graphical displays demonstrate things for you.For a Unity-based game, the physics engine incorporated by Interplanetary is robust and bug-free.  Kinetic shots follow paths dictated by velocity and planetary mass, meaning you have to factor these into the shot like a space-age game of 8-ball.Intelligencia is a factor in the game, expressed as simplified ""intel"" and ""counterintel"" pointers that require their own individual building types to generate.  Simply enough, higher intel than enemy counterintel means you can see their buildings and cities, and you cannot see their constructions if they have higher counterintel than your intel.The tech tree is likewise streamlined, giving some small room for options in early to middle game, focusing on kinetic weapons (railguns with biological weapon warheads, for example) or lasers, etc.Multiplayer is both easy to set up (hotseat/internet) and fun.The BadLate game tech is homogenous, meaning that choices break down in importance fairly soon.  It's possible to research everything in the tree, with no exclusive tech lockouts or cultural 'themes'.Intel/counterintel generates quickly, making the midgame as much of a 'cookie cutter' scenario for tech development and building.  Doing otherwise leaves you defenseless to precision strikes, or firing blindly at a planet in the hopes of breaking something important.By that same problem, given that midgame tech development must be followed in certain patterns, early game requires specific development and tech, eliminating much of the 'individuality' allowed.The UglyNot really anything, though Interplanetary does not apparently function on Windows 10 systems.SuggestionsPlayers are encouraged to stagger weapons tech development with intelligence and defensive tech capacities, and largely ignore utility techs until lategame.  The same requirement largely exists in construction; weapons, (counter-)intel, and then spamming utility in order to fund construction of your superweapons.  Once you have enough weapons to survive, simply focus on intelligence.  If you focus hard on counterintelligence, the AI will largely ignore you entirely, meaning that in VS AI matches, you can largely skip defensive techs until later in the game as well.For developers; the recommendation is to make the tech tree one of individual flavor, rather than railroad paths.  Spread some of the various tech benefits (city growth, chosen weapon potency, energy generation, etc) through each 'branch', and then focus the 'branch' on a particular playstyle (widespread bombardment, precision strikes).  Slow science generation enough that choices are meaningful, and the ""science victory"" achievement is actually one that takes effort to receive.  Perhaps some effects in the kinetics tree to show variation expected thanks to gravity and orbit (cone trajectory, rather than a line).The SummaryDefinitely playable, Interplanetary is a fun artillery game for players who don't want to micromanage or focus on number crunching.  7/10.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												Interesting concept, horrendous execution.Projectile combat is just a guessing game, one that can simply be reduced to ""attack when you're ahead of the enemy's orbit and there are zero obstacles in your way."" The only way to reliably get hits is to let your attacks fall into the target's gravity well. There's zero room for interesting maneuvers because you can't see or reliably guess where the future positions of the planets will be, and you can't adjust any its trajectory mid-flight. Lasers trump everything. The only thing balancing it is that it has a small radius and that you need to have intel to really make use of it, but intel/counterintel is just a resource sink, i.e. can I build Telescope Arrays faster than the enemy builds Data Security Hubs? Strategy-wise this game sucks, especially if you have more than two players. The innermost and outermost players inherently have a strategic advantage compared to the ones in the middle because there are fewer attack approaches. City placement is random and it's much better to have cities that are relatively closer for shielding purposes. It's not in your best interest to shoot first because that draws away energy that could be used for defense/construction. Since you can't loot enemies for resources, the only strategic advantage that you get from it is that you remove a threat, which quickly dwindles to nothing the more players there are. Thus it favors defensive strategies over offensive ones, i.e. just keep building until you strip the planet dry before making a move. Also, a 3+ player free-for-all becomes a Mexican standoff, which disincentivizes attacking even further.Honestly the game is just a one-trick pony that actually kinda fails on its selling gimmick. The physics simulation in the game is ridiculously simplified: it's all in the 2D plane and it's no more complicated than eyeballing it. Approach vectors don't matter; the only thing the game cares about is that the shot connects. Which makes no sense for, well, a freaking railgun whose projectiles are governed by orbital mechanics. For instance, tripling the impact velocity should increase the damage by roughly an order of magnitude, which would also be nice because it would reward more difficult (i.e. moving, not falling) shots.Also, the interface is clunky but at least that can be fixed.

												A very fun game.  It can be difficult for newer players because you have to allocate your resources wisely and have to take into account planet movement, spin and gravitational effects when firing a weapon.  Also, you have to choose when it is the correct time to go on a complete offensive and give the enemy hell, or hold back and build buildings that generate power, minerals, intelligence and/or counter intelligence.  A few of the many reasons I like this game is because it took only 13 minutes to download, and I have a down speed of 2.4 mb/s on a good day.  Equally, the game is well-balanced and I have not yet encountered any bugs or performance issues.I must say, upgrading your buildings and cities, whilst handy, does not seem to give you much of an advantage.  It appears that building more weapons can be more effective than improving existing ones.  I would, therefore, say that this is something the developers would want to take into account, in the future.As well as this, I do not like the fact that each player can only control one planet.  Admittedly, if this were a feature, it would be rather OP, however I do still feel a little disappointed that you and the AI are restricted to one planet.  Overall, This is certainly a four-star game, if not five-star.  I am greatly impressed and pleased that, although I am still playing on easy, it did not take me long to get the hang of the game.  I would certainly recommend this game to anyone interested in turn-based, strategy and multiplayer games.			"

												This is a good game with quite a lot of potential, but several things annoy me to the point where I've stopped playing:1: THE GAME HAS A HUGE MEMORY LEAK.Now I don't normally type in all caps, but I haven't been able to finish a game yet due to the memory leak growing to eventually 3 gigs+ and causing all sorts of bad behavior, then crashing.  I'd expect this in a pre-alpha, but for $15?  Really?  I feel like a Kickstarter idiot lately as the amount of half-baked not ready for release games lately is amazing.You know it's about to crash when the interface starts glitching.  But then the save function usually doesn't work.  I guess I could save religiously every ten turns or so, but when playing vs other players?  ""sorry - have to save"" - Give me a few minutes and re-join...2: The cheating AI aside, the interface is atrocious.  You want to be able to plan ahead, but there is no overlay to see your positions on your planet from a distance ( ie - red dots as it rotates), so you are never sure if your planet will rotate enough to get a shot off the next turn.  Also, when you are going to take damage, you don't SEE it hit.  Most of the fun in these types of games is seeing the shot and what it damages in real time.  You might as well skip the animation in this one - fire, come back, zoom into your planet to see what was hit.In a typical artillery type of game, you can see your shots, where they flew, and how to adjust to hit the enemy. To add insult to injury, the cities are the most hidden/first to be made not visible items???  And if the enemy has enough stealth, you simply forget their location?  You can't even remember what you saw last turn?3: Playing with the AI is useless unless you turtle for 40 turns or just build 10-20 ( not joking ) railguns and idiot-spam them.  PVP:Now, it is good playing hotseat, which is fun, but the time required to do so is hugely prohibitive.  The issue is that playing versus humans nets a 3-4 hour stalemate due to the only way to really do damage are superweapons.  If they make a grid of defenses over each city, and start building some stealth, you're going to waste the next few hours doing nothing. (ie - turn 40+)  Your railguns are not aimable, your missiles can't get through the kinetic defenses ( can't aim them unless you have a visual target), and lasers are the only thing that can consistently hit cities.  Until they get laser shielding.  Maybe you get lucky and take out one city with railgun spamming, but it takes all five dead to win.  You can take out a few things, but the cities are the only thing that matters.  Once those have 2-3 defenses on top of them, you're into the endgame:A: lob an asteroid and hope it hits something useful and critical/not fixable as it's random.B: Fire your one super laser and take out a single building or damage part of a city.C: wish the interface would stop forcing you to do your research queue when all you want to do is fire and get on to the next round.As it is, my son and I have played for 4 hours and still not finished a game before it crashed one of our two systems.Two copies, $30 wasted.  I should have just bought a game for my console instead.			"

												This  is a arty game (think worms,gunbound,etc) except you are using the offensive power of planet(s).There is no planet conquering though just pure destructive mayhem.The game can be played vs. A.I. , co-op, or pvp. How you win is simple destroy all the cities on your opponents planet.There are different structures you can for resource gathering,offense,defense all of which are upgradable including your cities.The game sports a tech tree that has three branches that will lead you to your resource,offense, and defense path.There are railgun,missle, and laser as the main three  you can use and 2 super weapons you chose from.The super weapons are  the last weapon types you can research.Being a planet based game you do have to worry about the gravity of other plants when using any weapon other than lasers.The planets all have their own rotation direction as they travel around the star for the solar system.The game is turned based but the attacking from both you and your opponent does not happen until both have done their action turn.After that both of your offensive choices play out until done.If you are a fan of arty games, like lovely looking space graphics with some gravitational physics you will like this game.Its both fun against the A.I. and more fun against / with others for a short burst or a long haul.

								I would recommend this game for anyone that likes civ, but wants constant battling. It's less intense than defcon, but still very action packed. There is that early game build up of structures, but there is always that worry that someone will strike first against you. Hitting with your railgun and missiles comes down to a brutal physics  and sometime luck as you guess the right trajegtory. Honestly, I've played only a few hours and I think it's great. There is loads of potential here for the developer to add onto. Beware though it is an alpha. There are many things that need balancing and tweaking. The tutorial doesn't make everything abundantly obvious. The tech tree is short and the is no reminder to pick a tech. It's is still at heart and concept wise a good game. If its on sale definanetly grab this game, if its not on sale eeeehhh meh. It might be worth 10 bucks, but in its current state waiting until it goes on sale or into beta is the best bet.			"

												I wasn't interested in playing this competitively against players, so I can't speak to that aspect of the game, but the AI skirmishes are extremely poorly implemented, making the game not very fun, and actually damaging the ""hard sci-fi realism"" aspect they were aiming for. The AI opponents have a 100% hit chance with any weapon at any distance under any circumstances, while you are limited to either blindly guessing on trajectories, or relying on a targetting redline that becomes innacurate the INSTANT you hit next turn, as its assumtions are all based on where planetary bodies are, NOT where they will be. Note to developers, for the past several centuries we have possessed the mathematical wherewithal to accurately predict planetary movements, so its probably fair to expect that the targetting technology your civilization is relying on in this game would be able to predict those same movements accurately. TL;DR, its not fun from a game standpoint to get stomped instantly, and you ruined your attempt at realism by failing to do any homework whatsoever.			"

Early Access Review
								As this is an early access game, this review applies to the state of the game at this time(2014-8-22)---An interesting game that is best played with friends, Interplanetary puts you in control of a planet pitched in a fierce battle against the other players (And the developpers hinted AI may be coming soon) by shooting at eachother with railguns, missiles, lasers, and superweapons. This sounds easy enough but you'll find that when you need to shoot your opponents, your railgun will be facing the other direction due to your planet's rotation. Your lasers don't hit anything but air and empty soil because your opponent has worked on counterinteligence, and your missiles were brought off course by the gravity well of a passing gas giant. He takes the shot, but misses you just barely. And the gravity well of your planet redirects those railgun shots right into the orbit of a third player.I did not expect it, but it is surprisingly challenging in your tactical and strategic choices. Do you build everything nearby so the early game railguns will do barely any damage at all, with everything you have fitting nicely under one defence structure... or do you spread out everything so a superweapon can't hit everything at the same time and destroy half your buildings with one well placed shot? Who do you aim at first? That guy who keeps shooting railguns at you and is obviously out for blood, or the guy who is peacefully building his war machine with mines and data security centers? The list goes on, but it has more than enough variety to allow for plenty of experimenting while it avoids having a single strategy that will always come out as the best.It is certainly worth giving a try, with plenty of decisions and choices to keep you thinking, but fast paced enough to get through a game without spending your whole day on it. (Average, casual games I played with friends lasted about 1-2 hours)For 10 euro, I would say it's worth it and recommend giving it a go. If you're not convinced, keep an eye on this one for when it goes on sale			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DNR: The game is very, VERY well done, espicially at it's age. However, the slow pace and ""early acess-ness"" of this game may turn some off.Pros:- Something about it makes it reeeeally hard to turn off the game, even when you realize you've been playing for a million years straight.- The general in-depth ""ness"" of the game. It aint your average artillery game.- The developers won't try to screw you over *cough* EA *cough*Cons:- Finding a group to play with on multiplayer is kinda hard. (Most games seem to pop up at 3:00 PM PST)- WiFi issues. While they aren't as bad as when the game came out (or so I heard), if you have a big game (try to limit your game size to 3), there WILL be issues.- The slow pace may turn some off.I'm a bit on the fence about the save feature; your planet has a limited amount of resources, meaning all games will eventually and enivitably end; a save feature would be nice, as these games can litrerally last forever.But don't let any of the cons turn you down, the devs are hard at work making a singleplayer mode, stable WiFi connections for bigger games, and a save feature. And if the devs keep this up, the first con - the community being small - will go away, the community will get bigger. And I can certainly recommend this to anyone, given they don't hate slow games. (Not FPS wise, as in gameplay wise)			"

								I'm going to make this review short as I want to go keep playing it.This game is amazing! My friend bought him, 2 others and me a copy and we've been playing it for hours, and we will keep playing it for hours, it's kicked of feuds and arguments and betrayals and I've never lost 3 friends quicker in my life! It's like Monopoly 2.0It's great fun and I hope more people buy it so I can play with some more people :DThis game is easy to learn and hard to master, so far we have come up with lot's of different strategies with varying levels of success. I can only hope for a more complex research tree and maybe some more building, me and my friend have discussed some ideas too, like irregular orbits or EMP missiles. anyway. If you have friends to play this with. buy it! its so much fun.			"

												I never write reviews but this game... its just that good. You get lost in its very simple and easy to learn gameplay. no need for tutorials here basic economy and resources and limited weapons... also the notifications panel reminds me of endless space. Hopefully they will add colonization. But overall very addictive. Was on turn 60 and forgot to sleep for work.			"

								I want to like this game a lot. There are a few key problems that keep me from doing so. Primarily the balance of weapons and defences is very far off. When your planet is hit with a railgun round, the round splits in atmo into 5 or so chunks that cause quite a bit of damage. Your kinetic defences that you've hopefully deployed cover a very small area... and guess what, railgun rounds have a large area of effect, so when a round hits even just outside of your defences, it causes damage everywhere. If you possess the power to hurtle cannon rounds across your solar system, you should have the ability to build defences that cover a much larger area of your planet. Another smaller issue I have is that when going up against more than one AI player, they are practically unbeatable. They build faster, and are far more accurate than you will ever be.TLDR: kinetic defences are almost useless, and shouldn't be. And the AI is very powerful. Like Matrix level.			"

												If you ever wanted to play an intrasystem-interplanetary wargame, this is one.All kidding aside though, INTERPLANETARY is pretty deep. The control scheme is well-integrated into the game, making it very playable with minimal game knowledge; it also has a very high replayability factor, since the nature of the simulation ensures that no two games are the same. All in all, well worth the purchase price.However, the game is not without room for improvement: I do think putting connection and upgrade trackers on the top-screen city bar would be a pretty nice addition. Also, the game assumes zero deviation from the ecliptic, meaning that all the planets -- and other objects -- in the system orbit and move otherwise in a single two-dimensional plane, neither ""rising above"" nor ""falling below"" the average orbital plane. The game assumes perfectly circular orbits, too. I'd love to see this kind of thing with some deviated orbits, like a real star system. Now THAT would be a great game!			"

												Played with friends. Everybody shot at once. There was 60 railgun shots. 2 Asteroid Redirections. 1 Solar laser. After everything hit I pulled up the damage report. Game crashed. 11/10EDIT(A more serious review): For a more accurate representation of what to expect, search up Interplanetary gameplay videos to get a feel of what it is like. Overall it is worth the money if you have people to play with, and if you like to see explosions go for it. Keep in mind that as of current, Interplanetary is still in its alpha phase.For those who are not too patient be warned, this game is turn based and people can drag the round/turn out.As always, it is your opinion on whether or not you like the game. So do a bit of self research before you buy this game.EDIT(Nov. 2016): -Pros-Game is fun with friends.My only satisfaction is when the enemy planet explodes with fireworks because i just shelled it with 50+ railguns.-Cons-Multiplayer is empty.Turns take forever to simulate sometimes.AI have ~100% accuracy but don't use all their available weapons.AI difficulty just means how aggressive they are. (Sometimes i see no difference)Singleplayer is no challenge because you can just spam minerals, energy, railguns, and defenses .TL; DRAI needs fixing? Balance railgun spam? I only play because I'm satisfied with the fireworks.			"

												A fun turn based strategy game where you build railguns, missiles, and lasers to destroy enemy planets. It is very satisfying to line up your shot, using the gravity of other planets to help your railgun/missile hit another planet and blow up their buildings. It is also possible to accidently hit yourself with your own weapon, which I have done several times. Unfortunately theres not usually anyone online to play with, which sucks because its such a great game.			"

												A game where you develop a base on a planet that has predefined number of cities (1-10), try to keep your cities intact and at the same time battle other players/planets by hurling ordnance their way. In a nutshell you could classify it as a “battleships” kind of game in space where your fleet of ships is replaced by cities and buildings on a planet.When I first purchased this game I thought it will be perhaps a sort of 4X space TBS game.But it’s actually a very unique game instead. You won’t colonize, build any ships or explore.It does remind me a lot of the good old Fragile Allegiance. In fact it feels in many ways as Fragile Allegiance Unity Lite. Although FA had trade, diplomacy, ships… on top of all what Interplanetary has - and was a real time game while this one’s turn based.I really like this game. In its current state it is a very stable and well balanced product.It is a small game in scale. Don’t expect too much of it. A cool game to pass time shooting up AI – and a great game to spend playing in multiplayer with few buddies and beer.Each player starts the game on his own planet. With the predefined number of cities and finite raw materials. That means you can actually run dry – or even starve the enemy.The planets orbit around a sun, in various directions. Every turn makes the planets orbit a little bit further.You start with very few things to build and then develop technology to build more using energy and minerals.Buildings like:Mines, Power Plants, Weapons, Defenses, Intelligence Buildings, Counter Intelligence Buildings, Superweapons.You also grow your cities by stimulating the growth rate – and with more population in the city you can assign them “city projects” which act in a similar way that building upgrades, giving you various temporary or permanent benefits – at times at a small cost in other areas.An interesting aspect of the game is intelligence gathering and counterintelligence – which I will refer to simply as “spying” here. It’s surprisingly well implemented into the AI that really pretends to not know where exactly each and every building you have is located.Spying is basically that part you’d have in a battleship game where you mark down the places you hit the enemy or miss.There are three main aspects to this.Intelligence – Is how well you know the enemy. It stacks up against his counter intelligence score to give you the result. Depending on how high the resulting score is that’s how much you can see his planet in detail. First you would see his superweapons, spying buildings and not much more. With higher score you start to uncover his weapons location, information about his economy, population, location of his mines, power plants, defenses and finally – the location of his cities, which if you know the location of, it makes you much easier to target his most vulnerable spot and ultimately win the match.Counterintelligence – Is basically the amount of misinformation every player puts out there with the help of special city projects and buildings. With this you are able to lower every enemy’s knowledge of you (it’s calculated globally so no need to target anyone specifically).Eyeballing – This is what you will do yourself, mostly when facing lower number of enemy players. See, after each time you pummel the enemy planet with some ordnance – you receive helpful information of where you hit the targets – and if they were buildings or cities. With this in mind you can observe the craters and ruins you caused on his planet – to further extrapolate where to fire. You will very often feel like an artillery commander – guiding your guns to the target. And you will often be able to choose – with precise and homing weapons – where to hit. Would you rather take out the power grid, or superweapons or annihilate a city or two…Weapons fire simultaneously after every player finished his turn and aimed.Aiming is done in the targeting view. Some weapons like rail guns simply plot an arc of fire to the enemy – which is simulated respecting the gravity. You always should lead the target when firing a kinetic weapon, unless the target is very close to you, because it takes some time for the rail shells to reach it. Other weapons like missiles not only aim at the planet – but have a second degree of targeting which involves zooming on the planet to decide where exactly to drop the payload. There are also precise weapons like lasers which require direct line of fire, are extremely accurate although have small area of blast.Aiming can be tricky – but is very rewarding once you get the hang of it.The game has two types of superweapons. One is extremely strong but imprecise – the other is very precise but not as devastating. Both pass any planetary defense. Another difference between them is that one shoots from the sun and other shoots from the outer rim. So depending on where the target is – one would be better choice than the other.The game has a variety of strategies you can adapt. High replayability value – for how simple it actually is. Yes, I guess I should add it’s a game you could learn how to play in around 10 minutes. It’s very straightforward to get in – while hard to master.The tech tree itself is one of those “no BS tech trees” where every single tech is meaningful and in the end – it’s a pretty short tech tree you will usually complete around turn 60-80.You should also try to anticipate what will the enemy use to attack you with – spy him to get a better picture of what’s to come. For example by seeing his techs under development.I fully recommend this game. It is a solid, small-medium scale game, best played in multiplayer but also very entertaining in single.The game has still much room for improvement.It feels like it has such a potential you really start to see that there could be more – much more – content in it.It feels like the perfect base game that could be greatly enhanced with DLC or an expansion.My DLC/expansion wishlist:- Asteroid/Remote Planet mining after your planet runs dry of materials.- Ultimate Weapons, like say the ability to create sth like artificial moons or whole planets you could use as additional gun platforms.- The ability to build things underground. Perhaps the addition of vaults where you could gradually transfer your population to in the late game to much better protect them from bombardment.- Random Events. - Explore missions to survey uninhabited planets in the system for goodies. Letting you send missions to them – exposing them to lot of danger, but being able to reap the rewards if successful.- MORE Techs.- A small video here and there wouldn’t hurt. When you win the game, the turn just ends and it takes you directly to the scoreboard. I wish it would give more oomph. You know, these small things in games.So yes, again, I wish that after playing the game a few times – I could play an alternative version of it, maybe mixed with PLAGUE INC concept with much bigger focus on bioweapons. The ability to have the game last longer with longer tech tree which would include more rewarding things than just the two superweapons. How about… a shield that would envelop the whole planet? That shield would make your planet very secure – but be extremely costly to maintain. And you could make it possible to be hit in just few places where the generators are. Another idea, since so much depends on the orbit of your planets. Why not add some technologies that would let player control his orbit? Some planetary thrusters if you may. I think it would be fun. And I don’t mean to ruin the game by turning it upside down – many of the things could be optional.Bottom line is, in my mind this is a solid BASE of a game which has great potential. There’s a LOT of fun in it. But in the end you do wish there was more… much more.			"

								Pretty solid foundation for an Early Access game. Hoping to see more great things added to it. If you've ever played any of the Worms games, or any tank battle turn based game, this game takes it to a new level. Build your interplanetary defenses and weapons and unlease a volley of attacks on other planets. Sounds easy, until you realize the red targeting line isn't going to take into account planetary movement and the influence of the gravitational pull of the other planets moving in the solar system. Takes a bit of though, but of gut calculation, and a bit of luck at times to really hit your enemies home with your weapons.Pros:- Awesome concept executed well- Resource management is simple, yet forces decision making. Do I want more new weapons or defenses next turn, or do I want to attempt to do more damage now? Hopes:- I hope you'll be able to designate names for your missiles, because if you have half a dozen, but did specific upgrades to some and not others, it's hard to figure out which missile has the upgrades. And I didn't see a specific name for the individual missiles like I did in targeting mode.- Maybe have a variety of orbit types?- Take over other planets or moons?- More weapons			"

												There are some good things about this game, like the interesting concepts and the artwork/asthetics. But there are some major problems:- Most of the player's time is spent doing tedious and annoying things that feel like chores. Iterating through every single building one by one to apply an upgrade, or painstakingly aiming every single missile one by one through a series of twists and turns across the solar system... only to have them all miss the target. Even navigating through the different views sucks up time, because you have to wait for the camera to finish spazzing out every single time.- Secondly, there aren't a lot of meaningful choices for the player to make. There's no real incentive to focus on offense, which makes the game drag on for even longer.  A lot of the items in the tech tree are pointless, the same goes for a lot of projects. Play one game, or at the very most two, and you'll see how a large portion of the game can mostly be ignored. There are too many tiny, meaningless details that take up time I'd like to spend strategizing.The game was interesting for a couple of playthroughs. I think this game could be great if the actual mechanics were made less tedious.			"

												Interplanetary is a physics oriented artillery space game. It's a turn-based game, first you need to manage your home planet and set the shots, and then you sit and see in real time the combat between the planets. I really enjoyed to set the trajectory of your guns against the enemy planets - they move around a star, and the gravity affect all the shots (except the lasers). I also liked the management of the buildings on your home planet: you need to connect them with energy supplies, defend them with support structures, etc. If you shot with lasers and missiles weapons, you can also choose the targets on the desired enemy planet. This game also features a tech tree, with lots of new techonlogies that improve your civilization.There's a in-game text tutorial window, very clear about how to play, and I had no trouble entering directly into the action.The only think I dislike was that sometimes the AI takes too much to think about his actions, but it's not a big deal.I am having a great fun playing this game, I recommend for the playes who like strategy and physics games.

												This game is brilliant. And I do mean absolutely brilliant. It's not often a game comes along that both manages to be incredibly simple and yet so magnificently complex. And that's the true beauty of Interplanetary.Despite being a strategy game, despite having tech trees and build units and economy etc. Interplanetary, threw virtue of an intuitive interface, tooltips that tell you exactly what you need to know, and combat that centres around a simple yet unique mechanic, manages to be a game anyone could pick up and within minutes understand everything they need to know in order to enjoy playing.What is that central mechanic you might ask? Well to put it simply, gravity. Interplanetary is a game were you construct weapons, defences, and resource buildings in order to fling tiny little projectiles of mass destruction. During each turn you lock in your trajectories, cross your fingers, and watch as your planets death balls of destruction fly across the screen. ""Did you guess the orbits properly? Will that planets gravity be enough to align the shot? What if the turn accelerates the missile too fast?"" These questions and more will be ricocheting across your head as you cross your fingers and pray your little shots hit. And the ones coming towards you don't.And that's just what's so wonderful about interplanetary. Even with such simplistic gameplay it will have you on the edge of your seat nervously waiting between each and every turn, completely absorbed in the interactions of these little planets and their annoying to predict orbits. It lands perfectly in that ""easy to learn, hard to master"" spot. And stands as a game I can recommend not only to strategy lovers, or space nuts, but to anyone looking to have a good time.Seriously, if you think you might like this game, get it. You won't be disappointed.			"

To avoid that you can ""hide"" them with certain structures.                 +Defenses- Build shields to protect your cities or important structures from attacks.                 +Structures-Your basics; Power, materials, intel, science, defense, offense.                 +Upgrades- Increase power, enhance weaponry, science/material intake etc.-Battles:                  +Weapons- Placement is important since the planets spin on an axis, making timing important.                 +Physics- Timing and ""leading"" the target is important here since everything is spinning on an axis and orbiting the sun. Catching the gravity of one planet to redirect a projectile is also possible, as well as throwing off your shots!-Gametypes:                 +Single Player- Vs AI, you can battle many and tweak the system as you like.                 +Multiplayer- Not a big croud to play with here, mostly just your friends.-Content:                 +Not too much of that here, just your basics and some upgrades for those basic structures.-Price:                 + At $15 I would say it is $5 too much, it's a fun game but bare and ""plain"" really.

								This game has a near infinite amount of replayability, and a near infinite amount of play styles. Sometimes people will bombard your planet with railgun shots on the second turn, and sometimes no shots will be fired until somebody calls in an asteroid. The tech tree fits the length of the game perfectly, as well as it is almost 100% balanced. The new upgrade feature really adds another dimension to the optimal play-style, as it allows for more energy and materials to be produced in a smaller area. The array of weapons that you can arm your planet with is grand, be it with pinpoint accuracy lasers or homing missiles. One of the best, but most complicated parts of the combat system is the gravity of the planets and the sun. You could aim a shot so that it looks like it will be spot on, but then the planets will orbit and gravity will throw the shot out of the system. All in all, this game was definately a 10/10, I hope to see many new features in the future.			"

												This game is deceptively simple, while providing a very rich experience.  There are some strategy elements to it which provide the depth, as you can manage resources, intel/counter-intel, weapons, and defense.  Yet these elements are nicely streamlined so as to not overwhelm a player or make the game too complicated.  The game is very accessible.Things like the fact that your planet rotates effects which weapons you can bear on your enemies during your turn, while your orbit around the sun effects where you are in relation to your enemies, the gravity wells you have to contend with, et cetera.Like I said, this game uses innovative and simple mechanics to provide a very rich gaming experience.  I highly recommend this game.			"

												Interplanetary is a solid strategy game set in space.Pros:- The tech tree is great- Graphics are great- the U.I is good- The LAWS OF PHYSICS is applied when attacking other planets.Cons:- Online is basically dead.- No story or context for why these planets are in this war- A.I is too overpowered - Defense Units are uselessInterplanetary is a solid game if you have friends who play this game. Without friends this game sucks......6.5/10			"

								This game surprised me... for the better.It feels like a galactic game of chess. It's simplicity makes it easy to pick up with a lot of room to master. During the rotation phase it does well with music and game speed to really make those, ""Oh my god! Is it going to hit!?"" moments feel intense and rewarding. Almost like ships at war looking for the perfect window to broadside their opponent.Great game!			"

								As of v0.2:Artillery simulator in space with a twist. Technology research, building things, big guns and of course planning trajectories included.Play sessions can be quite lengthy. At the moment it's way more fun to play with 3+ players.Also now it's only possible to play with your friends (as in - no AI), so unless you have friends to play with or want to hotseat with yourself - I'd suggest to wait for AI update.More details in the video:

												At the current stage, I do not recommend buying this game for that price. I got this game in a hundle bundle, paying just a few € that would have been justified. 14,99€ is way too much.If you find this game on sale, you can still give it a shot.You have a decent amount of weaponry and utility available and at first, it is quite interesting to see where the projectiles travel depending on nearby planets.Scrolling through the tiny tech tree, you make up your mind on what to boost first and later on just go straight for the super weapons. It's pretty straight forward, yet not always tactically very decisive or interesting. Good luck finding all the buildings for your newly gained upgrade, though.After a while you find yourself annoyed from needing ridiculous amounts of power plants (nuclear ones!) just for putting one extra utility building. This is not because of energy consumption, it is because of a maximum amount of links each station can host.Another thing that gets annoying after a while is trying to make the projectiles actually shoot an angle you want since they only accept relatively small angles. You are literally moving the mouse pixel by pixel, hoping that the projectile's way shows up properly.Clicking through lasers and missiles, you spend an enormous amount of time waiting for the constant zoom in- zoom out animations, leaving you confused on where that building was you wanted to focus.The user-friendlyness clearly needs to be raised with proper displays of available shooting arcs, proper selection for planetary targets and maybe the option to build just one weapon and support it with clusters of ammo for less clicks and the same amount of projectiles.Relatively small amounts of projectiles kill your fps here which is another argument to reduce the amount of projectiles and guns and add spreading effects on impact and such.

												So, as someone who's versed with orbital mechanics (OM) and ""similar things"", this naturally caught my eye.  Bottom line up front:  good game with a lot of potential.  It's worth a look if you dig this sort of stuff.Yes, ""a lot of potential"" means it's not quite there yet.  Stop right there if you're thinking, ""Yeah but it's early access.""  Early access should entice the gamer to want more, not frustrate with a product that they won't want even when it's complete.   Even science fiction has a logic that binds it together to make it believable in its own realm.  I've pounded my adversary round after round only for the AI to win and destroy all my cities in the last round.  This looks like an inadvertent cop-out from the designers that should be addressed.  The OM/physics needs work.  I've done OM related work before...we're familiar with heavenly bodies and gravitational fields.  The projected trajectory is a cool concept but we can predict with great accuracy where an object will go.  A civilization that can launch stuff as easily into orbit surely would have better OM capabilities as well (not eyeball it).  I get that the trajectory aiming is part of the game, but when my shots go awry...it doesn't give this player the ""hmm I didn't think of that.""  A few of my shots very closely mimicked the AI's trajectory.  The AI ended perfectly on target while mine was influenced by a mysterious force (note inadvertent cop-out statement).  IMHO, the game play needs more polishing to reach the ""intuitive controls"" level.  They aren't hard figure out, but there's no good explanation as to what does what and why it does it.  For example, there's no clear reason as to choose certain research projects in the tech tree.  Do they make a worthwhile difference?  How will the designers show this to the players in the upgrades to come?I'm content with this purchase.  But I'm an easy guy to please.  And if I'm merely content, I'm quite certain the majority of players are expecting that the ""best of Interplanetary is yet to come.""  I for one will be expecting that as well.  At this point, I recommend the game...with the cautionary wink and smile.			"

								Interplanetary is a fun game. There is no debate about that. And with that fun there is a lot of strategy, and even skill involved to win at a game. And with such, there is a degree of deciet and even back stabbing. Nobody knows who has what, who's on a team with who, and who is really capable of destroying who. If you're interested in the game. Make sure you purchase multiple copies, kuz playing with friends is really what makes this game for me. A few things about it that aren't so great is that the game feels extreamly limited. I would enjoy a more diverse tech tree. But that really is my only complaint, the game runs perfectly and the game is really just a load of fun to play.			"

It was going to be peace and harmony... until I found out you have limited material in your planet. :) 8/10, tons of potential for an early version, potentially amazing.(Camera controls a bit... clunky doe)EDIT:Just got more into this lately. Has gotten updated quite a bit, but there are some things here and there.Generally:Pros-Great visuals-Can eat up a ton of time, sort-of like Civ V-When played with friends, or, for a start, with other people, fun-Easy to play, extremely hard to master the hardest of shotsCons-UI hasn't been updated(in a game, menu looks k now), still feels like those buttons are temporary-Lack of players-Cheating AI-Camera controls can be confusingAs someone who enjoys the idea of multi-planet warfare, I can't give this game a bad review, it is good in the core. Although something I would like is multi planet spawning/capturing planets because you know... 1 planet is not enough :(			"

The mechanic is well made and the combat is very satisfying. The one problem I find is that there are very few kinds of weapons and buildings, and the lack of any instructions whatsoever might make you feel you're playing it blind. Still, it's a very fun little game to play with a couple of friends, trying to bring each others planets, or an AI's planet, down.			"

												This is an excellent strategy game. You build various weapons, power plants and defense grids on your planet, research tech, and sling missiles and railgun rounds at neighboring planets in an attempt to wipe out the competition. I tend to favor massive defense grids, which require huge amounts of energy, so I usually beeline for kinetic defense followed by nuclear power research. Then I build as many nuclear power plants and mines as my planet will hold and squeeze a lot of guns in throughout the network. My entire planet is secure, and I can safely fire at enemies. Others will take a more offensive apporach, immediately speccing into the weapons tree, and beeline for railgun and missile upgrades with intel mixed in to hammer foes into submission before they can even get off the ground. Both strategies have merit. But watch out for the superweapons! If you're taking an offensive approach, make sure you have the energy required to fire them. If taking a defensive approach, best to just build up massive amounts of counterintelligence (so people can't see structures on your planet)... because nothing can actually defend against a superweapon. Thankfully the last update let you place gamewide limits on how many of these can be build on both sides.			"

As a result, the first thing you go for is laser tech and after that you basically always win. Once you have shields no one can touch you until they develop super weapons. After that if you don't have super weapons of your own, it's too late for you.Overall, still a fun game to play, even with some significant game imbalances and very stupid AI.7.5/10			"

												Here is my review of this game.Match agains 2 Normal AI players (Keep in mind, there are 2 levels of difficulty beyond this!)Shots fired at me from AI players before game ended:Railgun: 6Missile: 7Laser: 17 (!)Asteroid: 2Solar Laser: 2Shots fired at each other:Railgun: 2Missile: 3Laser: 0Asteroid: 0Solar Laser: 0In addition to this f***ing hilarious level of bias, the AI players make Civ 5 AI look honest. They build and generate resources at an undeniably impossible rate, always keeping 2 steps ahead of you at all times. I did the math for the first 5 turns, they built more buildings than they could've possibly afforded. The AI in this game is hilariously BS and no one's ever online to play it, so forget it.			"

								well this game is still in progress guys and girls :P ahh well the grafics looks for now still good, as this game is still in Alpha I have high hopes more stuff will be availble later. as for now the game can have atleast 4 players able to play, its like diffrent kind of planet fights, alliances and so fort. I even dare say you might do some roleplay in it :P usaly its a System with a Sun, and lik 9 or 14 rings with small, medium or Large planets. I hope you (in the future) are able to travel to non counqred planets an control them asswell. but we will see, and its very cheap game as it in Alpha stage. I higly do recomend it :) I see you in the distant futur, not faar, faar away :P			"

								I would easily recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games, or even those who usually don't play too many strategy games.The game plays very easily for a strat game and for the most part is just about fun, and there is soo much fun to be had. Trying to launch weapons accross a solar system while predicting where the target planet will end up is awesome.When I first started I wrapped a shot around the sun to hit the enemy and was instantly hooked.

												I really like this game, it is like solar system scale Scorched Earth, Cannon Fodder, or Pocket Tanks.  It is really nice for a lazy Sunday afternoon when I want to conquer the solar system, but don't really feel like leaving the planet to do it.  Just have some contractors build some giant cannons and blast away enemy planets from the comfort of your own homeworld.			"

								TL;DR version: The game is still in alpha, so if you don't want to deal with bugs, don't buy it to play it. However, even in it's current state, it's an excellent RISK or Monopoly style 'evening game' with friends, and hopefully will improve further in the future. For the price it's at, I strongly recomend it. And if you don't buy it, at least keep an eye on it.I'd like to get one thing out of the way right off the bat. This game is already one of my favorite games, and if they are able to improve on it from what they have here, and truly flesh out the mechanics and support, than this will be one of the best games of all time, hands down.However, right now, at this time, there are some problems with it, and you should be aware of them before you consider purchasing. First off, it is ONLY multiplayer right now, be it hotseat, lan, or online. Part of this is because the game is most certainly tailored for a multiplayer experience.Unfortunately, the game does not have a chat feature, nor a lobby feature, which means that playing the multiplayer is a bit lessened as an experience, unless you have another means of keeping in contact with your friends. Additionally, the Online servers are VERY unstable. Not everyone will be able to connect, and it's tough to determine who and where the connection problem is at.Aside from that, the game has very little explanation text, beyond the tutorial. The tech tree needs fleshing out, with a better description of how certain things behave, and what you can expect from them.Now for the positives.  Like a game of risk, this is a game best played by getting some buddies to sit down and play it out for an evening, forming alliances, backstabing eachother, bemoaning your losses and cheering your victories. And it certainly brings that feel one hundred percent. I've yet to be able to play a large game with my friends, but I look forward to when I get the chance to, and to see a truly dynamic swing of advantages.			"

								It's a blast to play. But as most everyone else has stated, the AI is very tough and they rarely miss, but I believe the next update (the release) will allow AI difficulty choices. I've had a hard time finding anyone online to play, most games are private, so that sucks. Hopefully by the time the release rolls out more people will be playing. From what I've experienced in my limited play, going up against 8 AI opponents is far more fun than 1 on 1, and it's easier. The most fun I've had was playing an 8 player game (I finished 2nd, still haven't beaten the AI), I just wish I could find some humans to play.			"

												It is difficult to say if this is a good or bad game. At first it is a lot of fun. Establishing the industry on your planet, placing your weapons and defence, placing the oberservation and stealth building, finding a way between firing weapons and having enough resources to defend our planted. It is also great to find the best way to attack another planet especially when it is far away. I was always very happy when I hit a planet on the other side the solar system.However, there are two big problems in this game:- So far, you can not rebuild a city (or at least I don't know how). If you lose a city, it is gone. The problem is that if someone has a lucky strike (close to your planet, game stops his planet on the right side), he can wipe our some or all of our cities very early in the game. This means that you lose a lot of resources which creates the second problem...- Superweapons! they are awesome, they look great but they are also overpowered (my opinion). If you are not getting attacked by other players (lucky you) and can rush trough the research you can build yourself a fortress and wipe out the other players in a few turns especially if he is good in using them.So, is it a good game?Yes, if you like these kind of games and if you accept its design flaws.No, if you expect more options and if you want it perfectly balanced.

								This game has an interesting concept and is extremely fun to play. With a friend in the seat next to you it can be an enjoyable experience. It is a good game, with lots of potential, but it has its problems. Not many bugs, if any, that i have encountered, but there are three main problems; 1, the lack of a projectile velocity indicator, a planet velocity indicator, and a single player AI. This game would be great if it had those, and the first two are easy enough to make. But coding an AI is a lot harder than most of you idiots reviewing this game make it out to be especially for a strategy game like this. And if they are going to work on it or are working on it, expect it to take a bit. Another thing is that not many people play the public online, so make a friend buy it or play it in hotseat mode. Or just promote it extremely heavily. Overall, a simple concept turned into a pretty solid game, minus the lack of an AI. hope this helps influence your decision on buying this game.			"

								Ever wanted a game like DEFCON except in space and with giant planetary railguns? No? Well apparently these guys did and it's awesome.This game is like DEFCON except if M.A.D. wasn't a thing but instead people had no idea how to actually hit each other nor what to actually hit in the first place. You be launching giant, hypervelocity masses towards the enemy planet only for it to fly way off course and hit the next planet over, or be blocked by a giant planet between you and the enemy planet, or slingshot around the sun, and miss your own planet by inches. Its equivalent to launching nukes to Russia only for it to hit South America instead, and getting one nuke to hit the targeted country out of the hundreds you launched, not even being sure if you hit anything remotely important.You also have to manage the resources just to fire said giant, hypervelocity masses, and build and research other weapons with their own advantages and disadvantages.Could definitely use a better interface but at the same time could be much worse, and being it's early access it's probably on the radar.If you liked DEFCON it's a definite buy.

												This is problematic. I recommend the game if you're interested in the worms like gameplay, with rudimentary tech trees and  if you'll be playing it with your friends. Let us start with the good stuff. Hurling massive objects at your stupid neighbouring planets is just as fun as it sounds, guesstimating the trajectories and getting multiple hits is highly satisfying. Constructing strategies around weapon types is also satisfying and bantering with your friends about their intel levels (or lack thereof) is fantastic fun. The superweapons are very powerful and incredibly funAnother good thing is the overall ""good feel"" of the game. I can't quite put my finger on it but it is just fun to play. The online play is also generally good (although sometimes it does get buggy, more on that later).Now the bad. While there is nothing that screams ""DON'T BUY"" about this game there are a few things that are not great. The bugs I mentioned earlier, there are some annoying ones. Like when you aim missiles at your enemy, you have to get a trajectory that gets them close to the planet and than you click on the planet to zoom in and select a specific target, however if you're zoomed out to far it won't let you click so you have to scroll in and than click. Not bad with one missile. Quite frustrating when you're trying to aim 8 of them within the turn time limit. Sometimes buildings don't quite build the way you wanted them (connection was there when you placed it but than a turn later the game says it's too far).Bigger bugs are the game breaking ones, sometimes for unknown reason a player in the multiplayer game will be stuck in the ""tactical"" phase and will have to abandon the game to let other players keep playing. There is also no drop-in, if your game crashes (never happened to me but did happen to others) at the end of a 2 hour match you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck. Sometimes the framerate in the tactical phase will get incredibly bad (due to the number of simulated projectiles) and that might cause some players to crash, not to mention the calculation issues that occur when that happens.Another problem is general balance. The general way weapons are balanced is via intel. Railgun are ""unguided"" and you just get to aim them at a planet and hope you hit something important. You might kill a city by pure luck, or all your shots might end up in the ocean. Railguns really work by the volume of fire strategy. If you fire a lot of them at an opponent some of them SHOULD hit something important, that also will overload defences. The main thing is you don't really need intel for them.Missiles and lasers need intelligence on the enemy to be effective. Missiles do less damage and have smaller aoe than railguns but you can aim where they'll land, lasers have an even smaller aoe but there is no way you'll miss it like you can everything else. So intel and counter-intel is key to beating these weapons. Thing is, all you really need to do to is get good intelligence on your opponent once and than you'll have at least a vague idea where the important stuff is (like cities, the goal of the game). If you're not sure, you can just aim vaguely in their areas. If you hit them the game will confirm that and you'll know where to fire.Railguns are fun, but missiles and lasers are simply more effective in the long run. Same goes for the two superweapons, the mass driver (pushing a big asteroid into your enemies) and the orbital laser. The asteroid is DEVASTATING. But you need to hit. The laser is slightly less devastating, but it can't miss. if your opponent has cities on the day side and you know where they are. Your enemy is ♥♥♥♥ed. This would be better if the orbital laser only had a chance of going through defences, instead of ignoring them completely.Then there is the fact that there really are only 3 weapons. I'd like it if there were some other types of weapons, or perhaps more superweapons. Being able to kamikaze your dying planet using a mass driver (as an act of vengeance) would be great. Interplanetary gauss guns acting as physical lasers would also be nice. More variety would do great things for this game.That was long winded. All in all, while my ""bad stuff"" section is longer than the ""good stuff"" section, it is only so because I actually really like the game. And I want it to be even better. If the idea of the game seems appealing to you, and you've always liked worms. Than you're probably going to enjoy it as much as I have, despite the inherent problems it has.			"

												A highly flawed game with an interesting concept. Game is about flinging projectiles through space to eliminate the population of enemy planets. Certain weapons are highly effected by gravity and require planning out trajectories. Its a fun concept but after spending some time its hard to look past the games numerous flaws. -Game is incredibly simplistic. Only 4 weapons, two effected by gravity, 2 not. Little variety in buildings. Simple yet unbalanced tech tree.-Position in a solar system is very important and unbalanced. If you start a game not on the outside just restart. In the middle you will be a common easy target, in the center you will be unable to take accurate shots at those on the outside.-Lasers are very effective because of their precision but you spend a LOT of time aiming them as you have to do it individually-AI plays very obnoxiously-Big frame rate drops in the simulation phase late game-Poor soundtrack that doesn't go at all with the space themeCould be a good game with a lot more time and effort but just comes off as frustrating and unsatisfying.

												Interplanetary is an easily overlooked indie game available on steam for around $10.  It is a turn-based strategy game with two phases. The first phase consists of a research and development turn during which players select technologies, build infrastructure, and place buildings on their planet. The second phase consists of players' weapon systems firing, and their trajectory estimates playing out. Each player controls the trajectory of their weapons which are acted upon by the gravity of celestial bodies within the solar system. The time period seems to be set in the near future, and the technology available reflects this appropriately. The single goal of this game is to enact planetary genocide against your rivals. The game feels somewhat like a match of Risk, in space, and with some basic grand-strategy elements, and ballistic physics.  Like Risk, players can expect to spend about one to five hours per game.  And like Risk, the game can get quite addictive, especially considering that it provides online multiplayer as well as local hotseat.  Hotseat allows multiple players to play the same game on the same pc together, and is an extremely underrated feature which is often left out of turn-based strategy games. There are a few things that I believe would add to the game.  For instance, the ability to colonize or conquer planets within the solar system, an “upgrade all” feature for buildings, the ability to name your planets and cities, and basic social, diplomatic, and political policies could add a great level of depth and immersion. Nevertheless, the gameplay is inviting.  Interplantary does not try to be something it is not. It remains simple enough to pick up and quickly get the hang of, short enough to play casually, and immersive enough to allow the imagination some stomping grounds. Overall, this game is definitely worth the asking price, especially if you like to have a few friends over for an afternoon of casual strategy and camaraderie. On sale for under $5, this title would be a steal in a steam-sale splurge.			"

												A highly flawed game with an interesting concept. Game is about flinging projectiles through space to eliminate the population of enemy planets. Certain weapons are highly effected by gravity and require planning out trajectories. Its a fun concept but after spending some time its hard to look past the games numerous flaws. -Game is incredibly simplistic. Only 4 weapons, two effected by gravity, 2 not. Little variety in buildings. Simple yet unbalanced tech tree.-Position in a solar system is very important and unbalanced. If you start a game not on the outside just restart. In the middle you will be a common easy target, in the center you will be unable to take accurate shots at those on the outside.-Lasers are very effective because of their precision but you spend a LOT of time aiming them as you have to do it individually-AI plays very obnoxiously-Big frame rate drops in the simulation phase late game-Poor soundtrack that doesn't go at all with the space themeCould be a good game with a lot more time and effort but just comes off as frustrating and unsatisfying.

												This is a super-cool little strategy game.  Interesting building mechanics and an *amazing* shooting mechanic that feels great every time you land a hit.  It's not super-obvious from watching videos but you have control of both angle and power of your shots and trying to account for changes in gravity as the planets move around is like an awesome future version of billiards.  With explosions.  And lasers.Some surprising depth in the strategy layer. You can go spray'n'pray with rail guns or try and go a more surgical route with missiles and lasers. That requires that you stay ahead on intelligence so that you know where their key infrastructure is located.  Definitely worth the price of admission.PS - This is exactly what I want to see out of small dev teams:  Low price point, tightly focused game where the time was spent on careful design choices in lieu of flashy effects. Bravo good sirs!			"

												BUY THIS GAME:1. If you have ever been at the least bit interested in projectile motion. This game's physics are highly dynamic, yet it simplifies the mathematics into an understandable visual representation as it incorporates planetary orbits (albeit circular) which you must fire your projectiles from and to, as well as the velocities of your projectiles and the gravity and its effect of each passing planet on your projectiles. **You have to do some forward thinking however as the planets are stationary when you are planning your bombardments but will continue in their orbits as the Action Phase commences adding many near hits and misses and moments of ""Ooooo it is going to hit!!!!"" followed by ""WHAT THE @#$%?!? IT WAS SO CLOSE**2. If you enjoy sci-fi wars' of worlds. Colorfully and beautifully rendered solar systems that you get to destroy with projectiles, missiles, lasers (not on the heads of sea-bass), and even tamed asteroids...3. If you enjoy strategy games, whether playing solo versus the AI (settings range from newb to Einstein in their ability to predict the motions), or with and against other sentient beings you wish to annihilate. Even though the tech tree may not be as expansive as a Civilization game, Interplanetary allows for differing strategies from the start of each game. Do you hide and turtle up for the late game, or build quickly and start bombarding immediately, or somewhere in between? In a manner that is not overwhelming, there are resources to be managed and intelligence to be gathered and countered that all factor in to establishing your strategy for planetary destruction.4. If you remember the days when developers were of the PEOPLE and want to encourage future development of games uninhibited by corporate driven profit ideologies! Unlike most games today released for an exuberant price followed by further skin systems and nonsense that requires further pocket diving, Jolly Roger gives a game from the days of old. ***JOLLY ROGER PROVIDES AND ENCOURAGES (if you are comfortable in doing so) BASIC TOOLS FOR MODDING*** I have played the game less than a day but already looked at the potential for tweaking the game play and appreciate the ability to do so as it allows for future potential of varying game types and experiences.Overall, this game might not be completely polished in its UI or spell checking, but I do give it 5/5 for what Jolly Roger gives you in Interplanetary's bang for its buck. I highly recommend it to you and your friends to play together and believe you will find yourselves addicted once you get past the initial learning curve (which isn't that steep and can be passed after your first game).

												A simple strategic turn-based game that allows you to build up your planet, invade the enemy, and finally, conquer the enemy. The best part of this game is the multiplayer, because fighting against players is always a tougher challenge than just facing AI.The graphics and sounds are well-done, so overall, this game delivers great aesthetics. I would recommend this game as a great casual game that you can play with your friends on a laptop in a small get-together, because it's one of those games that you can play at your own pace.			"

												I heard that you should not play single player but multiplayer instead. But when launching the game I came to find that not a single person was on multiplayer. I waited a while as well hosting one but not a peep. So I played the single player and found that what the others said was true. It seems like a great game but since the singleplayer is lackluster and no one is on multiplayer there is no real reason to buy this.			"

												This game is irritating... grudgingly I'll also admit it's a little funThis is either a quick-fun game with too much complexity or an underwhelming complex game. Sale item only.The tech tree is fairly forgettable, you can only work on 1 tech at a time (and excess science poins are lost) and you can't queue multiple selections without them being a chain.Aiming has a lovely red line to say where your shot would go if nothing moved, making it look like you can plan out technical shots around other celestial bodies... nah. If anything else is even slightly in your way the shot difficulty spikes hugely into the near impossible region.Building upgrades are either fantastic or rubbish- go you get a limit of 2 upgrades and about 6 choices, but about half are garbage, leaving little actual choice...

												Short take:Initially fun game, with potential for strategic depth. But very little of either after a first or second playthrough. Premise: Build your railguns and missile silos and fire them at everyone else in the solar system; it's a deathmatch. Don't forget to pick something to research! The deal:The fun dries up quickly though. The reason it does is actually the ultimate failure of the game. The part of the game that should be joyful and exciting, the aiming and fire controls, are poorly done. It comes down to nudging your mouse one more pixel to the left to get the wacky flightpath indicator to fart out a viable firing solution. Also, rather than group firing all your weapons, you must repeat this tedious process FOR EVERY SINGLE WEAPON YOU BUILT ON THE PLANET. That's right, if you built 10 missile silos, you must use the awful mouse-nudge to trajectorize and fire each single weapon separately, every time, every turn. Then, the resulting destruction isn't at all satisfying. It can be fun to line up a curving shot with an (unguided) railgun slug on a target planet. But the result is just a sad pop sound. Comically, the only real confirmation that you have succeeded in destroying a city with over 40 million presumably human inhabitants, is a little skull icon in the screenside combat log. Do this a few more times to win the game. Yes, that is the bulk of the gameplay, and yes, it's pretty much that simplistic. This might lead you to think that there's some sort of nuanced underlying depth going on that makes for great PvP or something. Unfortunately, that is not the case. WYSIWYG.Side note on some design flaws:My overall feeling is that certain things were included in a derivative (I know ""Cargo Cult"" is cliche now) way without the real understanding of how those game elements impact the the whole. Example, a research tree is included so cities can generate science points and unlock new upgrades, just like every other game that has this tech tree element. But here it seems to just be there as a thing to do. At no point does it feel like focusing on one section of the tree while neglecting another has a major strategic consequence the way it would in well-designed games that include this feature for an actual reason... So, I'm left with the feeling that it's there 'coz that other game has it.  Any other tiered-tech per-structure system might have made the game more strategically interesting. Perhaps small tech trees for each building, forcing the player to choose to upgrade now for more instantly gratifying damaging shots, or hold off to expand the structure later for higher potential outcomes but a higher potential loss if the building gets destroyed. There are other examples of this throughout but that one stands out.Because there's good potential, I could go on for a long time about similar relatively simple and meaningful ways the game could've been improved.Should I buy it?:Wait for a major price drop, or sale. I suggest not spending more than $5 as, optimistically, you might get 5 hours out of it; unless it strikes some kind of chord with you.			"

												Interplanetary is a quite some Fun, if you play it with Friends. I grabed it during a Sale and bought the 4pack, shared it among my friends and we soon started Annihilating each other. I try to keep it simple and compact.The Graphics:Nothing superb but not bad either. It does the job. There isnt much to show basicly. A few planets, a skybox, the Sun and then the few effects for shooting and hitting each other.Story:Not there. There is no Campaign or whatsoever. You can play vs the AI if you like but its kindah like the Worms AI. Not much fun imho. Stick to the Multiplayer and you´ll have some fun while shouting at each other.Gameplay:Very minimalistic basicly. You start with a planet with 5 cities, you then start building a couple of Mines and Powerplants. Then build teh guns and shoot at each other. If all of your cities are destroyed, you´re done for. You got some dumb projectiles that randomly disdributes the Hits on the planet and ofc, you got some Smart weapons like missiles where you set the Impact point on the Planet. Not to forget the Lasers, wich are somewhat super accurat but only can hit the side of the planet that is Facing to you.The Balance:As far as I´m aware, there wasnt a Single balance update since launch, only a few stability patches that where desperatly needed at Launch, but thats got nothing to do with the Balance.Some weapons feel Overpowered. In ""our"" first few rounds Laser became quickly popular, since they dont got a balistic flight. They hit instant in a straight line. Ofc there is a soft counter, to name them Shields, but if you aim them clever you can work around them. Same for basicly all Defensesystems. You only got a few weapons to choose from:-railgun, basic balistic gun-Missiles, advanced balistic weapon-Lasers, point and click weaponAnd the 2 ""superweapons""-Solarlaser, wich is basicly a Ray that is fired from the sun, not from your Planet and 1 hits basicly everything-Asteroid Diversion, a Load of clusterf*ck aimed at your opponents... and somethings coming back to youSo, including the superweapons you only got 5 different Weapons wich lets room for improvement. And since the Laserweapons are point and click, they are pretty much the strongest. Our group Disables them in most of our Games, because of Obvious Reasons.This game features a Techtree that is quite big but nonetheless allmost useless. We tried different tactics but straight rushing the Superweapons and going for Ecoboost tech afterwards, seems like the only competive way to play.Summit:I really enjoyed the Game so far BUT there are quite some things I would like to see adressed since the games is a bit expensive with 17€ without any discounts.The games doesnt feature an Observer Mode, wich means if you play with like 4-5 of your Bud´s and you´re out first, you sit there and wait for them to Finish since you cant watch them anymore.The tech and weapons needs rebalance, nothing big but little adjustments would be lovely. Like increasing the needed Techpower get the Superweapons. Be aware that the Game runs fine but still gets Server timeout errors once in a While. Around every 10th game or so.Do I recommend it? Yes, if you got some Friends to play it with and if it is on Sale.Thanks for Reading.			"

												-AI for singleplayer take very long to end their turns (at least a minute per turn for the normal AI). Even then, the normal AI don't even shoot their 10+ weapons at all, which seems like a bug.-The research tree is uninteresting and tedious, since most of the research is boosts to your buildings rather than new things that change the game. -Multiplayer is somewhat bugged (in one game I couldn't left click to build buildings or shoot weapons, but could click on menu buttons?).-There is very little strategy to the game. Just bombard your enemies as much as you can and hope you hit a LOT of buildings (nothing is particularly vital). Every game goes into late game, so you always have to build for the long term.			"

												I like how the game is presented. I like the tech tree, the visuals, and the music. However, the main aspect of this game is trajectory warfare (pick a flight path and anticipate orbital movement of your target). Now while the idea of trajectory warfare is a novelty it is executed rather poorly in this game. Not only do you have to deal with poor camera controls, but even if you hit the target it provides no satisfaction. The strategy aspect of this game is too deeply impacted by chance. Simple build up of counter-intelligence makes this a rule rather than an exception. If you're playing this game on multiplayer, know this: The outermost and inner most planets have a severe edge over the middle ones, as there are less angles of attack on them.Overall, I applaud the design team for thinking outside of the box, and creating a truly unique experience, however I cannot recommend this game for anything more than a quick bout of curiosity.ENVOY RATED: 5/10			"

								PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS ONLY FOR THE CURRENT VERSION.Okay, its a good game, the basic mechanics are all there already and thats great! And the idea behind this is superb: Fire long range missiles (an other stuff) at another planet in your galaxy - AWESOME!!However this game suffers in its current state from a severe interuption of flow and imersion. You choose what you want to build, what you want to launch and then you have to wait like 2 - 4 minutes for the game to calculate what you and your opponents entered and how to react to that.Its kills imersion and makes the game VERY easy to just give up and walk away from, and thats a shame, cause it really is a pretty good game.Finished version - I'll let you know (It will probably be yes)Current version - You'd be better off putting that money on food.

												I play this game with my friends and it's really good fun to play together over the internet.The game play is basic, and I didn't use the tutorial, but it only took a few games with friends for us to work out how everything works and to start having some really good fun.The skill shots can be really fun, when you just miss a shot and end up hitting the wrong person or even yourself!It's not a great single player game, the AI has unrealistically good aim, but even the hardest AI was beatable after about 10 hours of game play, I still play VS the AI now and again to work out what is best and try new stuff, but this game is 100% better and worth about £5 for multiplayer.I would recommend splitting a couple of four packs if you have enough interested friends, I did that during the winter sale and we are all having a great time playing.

												This game has a great concept, interacting with orbits and gravity to wage interplanetary war, but could use better execution. Unfortunately I found the interface not to my liking. - The building placement interface was decent, but there is no obvious way to change your plans if you accidentally click. - Shifting angle and perspective of the universe works well most of the time, but it is too easy to end up with what you want to see off screen on a smaller monitor resolution. - Aiming was too ""jumpy"". I really wish I could specify my aim using a text box for angle degrees as opposed to moving the mouse.- The event notifications could be handled better, particularly if there are multiple of the same,- I wish the event notifications said which of your buildings were destroyed instead of just showing where they were.If the UI was more friendly I would enjoy this game a LOT more and probably change my recommendation.

												If you ever wondered what an interplanetary artillery game would be like then it probably doesn't get much better than this from a design point of view.  Unfortunately I never imagined it would be so SLOW.  I nearly fall asleep between game turn cycles with all AI.  Which is sad because I wanted to like this game so much that I put out 15 georges for it.  I really don't understand why the game cycle takes so long.  I'm running a Xeon E5 2.8ghz with 16 gb so it's not because of a shortage of compute power.  Surely it could have been designed to play faster especially when starting a new game.  Late game Civ5 cycles faster than this.  I now regret buying it because frankly the plodding gameplay is boring me on to other things.  For that reason I can't recommend it.  Otherwise I think it's a pretty slick production which is why the ruinously slow pace baffles me.			"

								Note: This review was written during early access meaning things may change as more patches are released.It's dfficult for me to recommend this game right now despite the fact that I love it, since it's primarily a multiplayer experience and i've only managed to get into one game with other players since buying it a month ago. The server lobby is often empty and hosting a game takes quite a while most times as you wait for players to join.With that being said, if you don't mind waiting 10 minutes or so to fill an online game lobby, or you simply want to play LAN with a friend or family member, I think it's a really enjoyable experience all round with a very solid feel to the game.Your goal is to develop your planet in a relatively simple sense, then stick some guns onto it and take aim at your opponent's planets. It sounds easy, but considoring gravity pulls on all weapons, aiming can be very tricky at long ranges until you get the hang of it! But it's not a frustrating kind of tricky, it's the kind that makes you shout ""YEEEEAH!!!! WOO!"" when you get a hit and read the damage report.The game is turn based.Graphically this game is pretty sexy looking with a simple UI and good quality chat window.The community, atleast when you find other members of it, seem really great. A playful, fun loving and intelligent bunch from my experience so far.For the price, Interplanetary is well worth it (£4.99 at the time of writing this reviewm however don't expect to see thousands of players online waiting for a game and if you're not into using your head and patience as you game, it probably isn't for you, otherwise space and RTS fans alike will love this little gem :)Thanks for reading!

								Interplanetary is a very entertaining turn based strategy game with the twist of gravity.

												Somewhere between space defcon and space tanks, this is an execellent simple-ish strategy game about base building and trying to figure out how to make tiny artillery shells go where you want them to.  Has a fair bit of depth, but doesn't take crazy long to play a game of it.  There's something wonderful about the giddy feeling I get as I cheer my tiny projectiles on as they hurtle in the general direction of the enemy planet, hopefully colliding.  It's probably not what you expect it to be, and it's a lot of fun.			"

								Creative, original, entertaining, awesome. Interplanetary is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game which is about building up your own planet with cities, and trying to destroy your enemy. The game takes place in a single solar system with two civilized planets that are basically trying to destroy one another. On your own planet you can build cities with power plants and mines to collect resources. You can build defenses to shoot down an enemy incoming missile or a shield over your city to protect it. Also you can build weapons which shoot missiles or lasers to destroy the cities of your enemy. But beware! Have you ever heard of gravity? I bet you do, well you and your enemy are not the only planets floating around in this solar system. All planets have gravity, and it's your job to line up your shots correctly with the influence of gravity to hit your target. Well, these were just the basics...I like this game alot because the concept is so unique, i've never seen a game like this. Unfortunately there are not so many people online. So I reccomend buying this game with a friend so you can play together. Have fun in your own solar system. To the stars, and beyond!			"

												Overall, pretty fun game, I like it.That said, it's far from a flawless experience:Has some interface problems:Tab should move between GUI fields. It does not.Cancelling targeting should be as easy as right-clicking once, not a dozen times and pressing random buttons hoping targeting aborts,Selecting planets with guided weapons should be far less nitpicky about accuracy of clicking.Tutorial needs some fixing(Spelling and grammatical errors, incorrect information ""Press End Turn""->there is no End Turn button->It's ""Next Player"".).Scrolling with WASD in an otherwise mouse-oriented game is ridiculous.And some glaring issues: The occasional inexplicable crash during a multi-hour game sucks.No ability to play games with other players + AIs, it's just one or the other.A tech tree that's kind of small, leading to most players having most of it by the end of the game.While it's nice that the game tells you how many of your own buildings have been destroyed or damaged, it would be nice if it showed you which ones specifically, or told you which had been destroyed, rather than having to remember or guess at it.Some performance concerns:Running on a decent computer the game performs fine. It's more that it should be fine on a piece of crap too.Really, really, really long loading times for under-spec-but-still-capable-of-playing computers(On the level of 5-10 minutes.).The system requirements are ridiculously demanding for what the game is. I'd expect something like this to run fine on an early Pentium with a VooDoo 2. (It is not impressive visually, nor is it doing especially demanding calculations to my knowledge.)Seriously, if an older machine can comfortably run something like Supreme Commander or Mass Effect, it should laugh at Interplanetary. It weeps instead.It'd be nice if some sort of ship/fleet/satellite  combat was implemented, rather than pure artillery. Having a few little mobile or semi-mobile units around to do things would be a nice addition.			"

												With 3 hours under my belt I have to say it's gameplay is ok.  It requires a bit of forward planning to get ordnance to the target without being pulled off trajectory by the gravity of an errant planet; but there are some interface issues which have cropped up already.After all this time since it's launch I'd guess these aren't going to get fixed otherwise they would have.  I got a cheapy key on ebay so it's cost me 6 quid.  which is acceptable.Multiplayer looks pretty dead and multi AI per game is going to be punishing unless you've read up on all the fine detail of the tech.Get a laser quick because it's line of sight.  Then lots of mines because without minerals you're stuffed.Worth £6 but no online play that I could find.			"

												I just want to start off with the fact that I very much so want to write this game a great review; I want to praise it for its fatastic artwork and fun gameplay. However this was not meant to be, as of the time of this reviews writing, the game has been ""fully released"" for about six months and I have play rough 12 multiplayer games. Each of the afforementioned multiplayer games crashed or lost multiple players due to game issues before even half of the game was completed. This is absolutly unacceptable, a game that claim to be ""fully released"" cannot have srious gamebreaking issues six months after launch. This issue would be vastly mitigated if the singleplayer was playable against the game's ai, however the ai is superb at the game and cannot be defeated wthout signifigant patience (via trial and error to learn the game), or skill that otherwise would have been learned in multiplayer (which is unplayable). If the issues I have mentioned ever are fixed I will update this review, until then this game is not worth a single dollar (literaly).			"

This game reminds me of a FTL, KSP crossover, bully me for what you will, this is the kind of vibe I'm getting from it. The system in which you do the technological upgrades could be improved, as some take two turns to research which slows down the game but does add to the suspense to the game, which I love. Overall great game, guaranteed to be playing it more often.			"

								This game has everything to be successful... however it still lacks singleplay, and that is terrible. There is no urgent need for a story mode, a campaign, nothing like that, but the absence of an AI to play against limits the game enjoyability, as you are forced to find people to play against, which is not everybody's cup of tea.This is not the case as with unfinished, half-developed games, a sad constant nowadays. In fact, the game is very well though of and it plays well - and what is best, it is a refreshing novelty in strategy games, with its unique concept. The problem is not being able to play it!!! (unless someone is willing to do it with you). If the developers manage to include an AI to allow singleplay mode, this game will really shine.			"

												good idea to start with but lacking in many ways- Awkward controls of the map and interface in general- AI players will compute incredible accurate slingshots but on your side, the shot simulation never takes into account moving planets = unfair in solo- Nobody playing online- finishing a game is a pain, there are no death blow and killing your adversary might be either long or impossible.but on the good side, it's kinda pretty without doing too muchthe research tree, the randomness of your proximity with your ennemies and the kind of specificities you have to react to like Laser or missile protection are kinda interesting.I wouldn't recomment though, this game should worth a few pounds only really.

												I wish Steam had the neutral recommendation. Also, I bought this using bundlestar.com. I didn't buy it using Steam.TL;DRPlay on multiplayer only because AI is overpowered.I only played a quick singleplayer game because none of my friends have this game. You have to lead the shots from your planet to the next estimating where the next planet is, and the AI knows exactly where you are. The best way to describe the AI is Soldier: 76 AI. He already has aimbot and his ultimate is more aimbot. That simple.This game I would only play for multiplayer, now that may be obvious but I like singleplayer games because I don't have that many friends who like strategy games.			"

The this game isn't the perfect one but still it's amazing !  I hope the community of the game will grows fast !EDIT: I've met one of the devs at a convention, and he was as cool as I thought ! Too bad I wasn't able to speak correctly :/Keep doing what you're doing devs, because it's awesome !			"

												It's a rely good game if you have friends to play with.The AI is a bit to accurate at hitting, otherwise it's OK to play signelplayer.So, if you have a friend what recommends this game. Then you Just have to get it! :D			"

								First off, the art and the visuals of the game look absolutely fantastic. I really enjoyed the randomized look of my planet each time I got into a game. The gameplay is pretty fast paced and also plays well, but waiting for players to finish their turn sucks. A felt like the game requires a good deal of strategy and diplomatics with other players. The options screen covers everything you'd want and overall the game is very well done. I've had no framerate issues on my machine, and I have nowhere near a super computer. Highly recommened game, 8.75/10			"

								This game is good fun (after playing a few matches of hotseat). However, because there is no single player element at the moment it means you dont really have a whole lot of play time at the moment. Sure there are online games but there are VERY few people online which is frustraiting especially if you live outside the time zones of EU and America because you can simply find nobody else to play with.I really look forward to this games full release and think it deserves a definete recommendation from me (Y) saw it in the greenlight and voted for it and I am glad to see its on steam now!

								Update:Single player / AI has been added, and there is a new surge of activity online.it seems the netcode has improved aswell although I have yet to test it thoroughly.with these updates all my primary issues with the game are solved and now I can wholeheartedly recommend it.---------------------------------------------Short version:This is a good game.However I cant recommend for now as there is no single player the multiplayer scene is dead and even if you find a match there are connection issues.Long version:The concept is great, implementation is pretty for an alpha and I can definitely see it developing into a truly fun game. In the few games I did play I had loads of fun - making alliances against a common enemy only to betray them at the end. building mass drivers, missiles, lasers, asteroid diversion to completely wipe out enemy planets. I really enjoyed all that.Now the problems. while the game is incredibly fun its actually hard to start one. there is no Singleplayer mode (although the devs are developing it), trying to play randomly online will often greet you with an empty lobby (unless you bring in your friends) and even if you do you find a game, there will be issues with connection ranging from lag, to disconnections and outright refusal to connect. the game does however play wonderfully over LAN with friends.These issues make it nearly impossible to play the game you paid for, and are why I cant recommend this game for now. however the second these issues are fixed I wholeheartedly recommend you get this game.

								This is one of those hidden gems that don't get enough reputation to take off. The game is very funn and addictive but it has one down side, because of the lack of a AI you need to play against other people and without the reputation the game dont have many active players leaving the matchmaking lobby empty.But when there are people to play against it's a blast.

Add in astroid diversion and lasers... even better. It really is alot of fun.Bad:  Planetary orbits are all wacked out.  The closer you are to the sun, the faster the orbit should be.  That is basic orbital dynamics.  Also, they games get REALLY log.  3 hours of play equals 2 games... and I did not finish either as I had to take off.

Even if this turns out to be your first game don't worry you will get a little tutorial to start you off in-game and after that you are let loose to fight and survive the enemies on other planets in the solar system. if you arent sure what to expect i encourage you to watch just 20 minutes on Youtube of any video showing the gameplay. But i'll be honest i love this game and I am so glad i have finally got it.			"

								I was tricked into trying this by the positive reviews. My excitement was greatly diminished by the absymal performance (hi Unity engine, 1.5 gb of RAM and unplayable slowness when playing against AI) and the relatively confusing (and with that I mean poorly designed) combat execution, where you'll be struggling to follow the action as tons of planets shoot at the same time.I'd love to test this for jolliness in multiplayer once my gaming buddies acquire it. If/when this happen, this will get updated.(As this is the first release with AI, I'll forgive the godlike accuracy of their shots.)tl;dr: Performance bad, UI / UX bad, no saving (SP & MP), not worth it for SP, might become a nice game some century.

												Fun game, just needs a bit more polishing. The main problem with it from my point of view is you can't select which techs you want to research in what order. I was expecting to just hold down ctrl and click on which order I wanted the techs researched, but you can only select an order if the techs are in a line, which is like researching farming to solar power while you still haven't discovered the wheel.

												This is a fun game, not many people playing online everytime I've looked into Online. Been playing solo against the AI and having an okay time. Took a bit of learning to get things right so there is a bit of a learning curve to this game. I'd try and play with friends if you can or, if you like waiting a bit, try and play an online match. You build weapons, shoot at other planets and try and destroy them. Each turn you can build a weapon or some resource item, if you have the materials and energy, then pick a talent before targeting your weapons to the other planets. Do read the tutorial it's very helpful and without it, I think I'd been lost.I can say this game is worth getting but only if it's on sale for 50% or more. In my mind, what they're charging for this game isn't worth it unless you're a die-hard of the Turn-based and want it for your collection of gems. I got this game almost a year ago and forgot about it after an IndieGala sale. When I saw it come out of EA I thought 'well where did this game come from, lets give it a shot' and so I did. Had fun but, as I said, if I'd paid asking I'd still had fun but been looking at where the content for my money was.			"

								GOOD GAMEYes, there is only 1 bad thing at this time. The problem is you need someone to play with. I mean there is not many players.But the game is awesome.I never spot a bug in this game. There are some basic buildings, simple tech-tree and i hope it will grow larger.2 kind of cannons, 2 lasers, and some meteorite stuff that i had no chance to test.Economy is important aswell, soe you need to build mines, power it with generators, and be carfull cause every building has limit of connections.We got some radar stuff, to spy on the enemy. Its good to know where the buildings are cause lasers are targeting directly one point. While cannon hits random stuff cause planets is spinning.Physics is good, I dont see anything bad about it. Plantes are spining around sun and themselv, pretty real. Except solar system is flatt, and i think its much easier.Game is timeeater, it consumes realy much time to play one match. But its all fun.

												Only played one match so far but I like the idea of taking shots at distant planets that affect the trajectory with their gravity. Aiming is pretty weak. They show you the theoretical path of your projectile but for some reason the projectile doesn't follow it exactly. They apparantly didn't factor in the movement of the planet and maybe the exact time of the firing. We wouldn't have some kind of computer to factor in planetary movement? I find that hard to believe. Also, the laying down of the flight path is imprecise. It would be nice if you could have sort of a sniper feature to get the precise trajectoy you're going for. I think later in the game you get some kind of homing device that fixes this problem.Didn't see a way to repair cities or start new cities but that would just drag things out. The quick start didn't tell me about being able to fix or upgrade buildings but mostly aiming takes a lot of time and then everything gets fired at once and very quickly impacts with a teeny ""biff"" sound that is about the most unimpressive noise in gaming. SOASE has it right. ""BAADUNG"" and a huge cloud of dust goes up into the atmosphere. You can't follow these projectiles or slow them down so its very undramatic. Aiming is tedious and the whole game seems to be about aiming and upgrading things. You don't build any ships. You put up buildings and then try to maintain them. Think how crazy that is. You're making war with these distant planets but you have no way to invade and steal their stuff. The whole point of war is to beat them up and take over but in this game you can't. All you can do is destroy. When you research something there's no progress bar. They do give you a ratio like 212 of 450 but they didn't have enough money to put in the universally accepted and easily visible, moveable progress bars. It is also hard to see the slight change in border color when you select a thing to research. When you're rounds impact the planet you will not get zoomed in automatically to see the shells spectacularly impacting, destroying buildings and throwing cars around. This would have been a nice reward after all that tedious fiddling with the aiming system but its not included in this game. You will also not be rewarded with numbers popping up out of the destruction to tell you you've actually had some hits. All you get is a little ""pft"" or ""pft, pft, pft. pft"" if you hit with four rounds. No dog pops up to laugh at you if you miss.Interplanetary is just like Kerbal Space Program if you replace the rockets with cannons and take out the assembly building, the parts, docking, career and any kind of designing. You could also compare it to Sins of Solar Empire if you take out all the ships, the diplomacy, the trade and the pirates and the very impressive battles with many ships and dozens of special effects, the carefully balanced warrior civilizations that are all different. SOASE with just Novalith Cannons is Interplanetary. How bored are you? That might be a nice advertising slogan.			"

												This was a fun game until I realised that the whole game is basically a matter of who has the most intel and counter-intel buildings. Then it became boring. It detracts heavily from the combat. Also I'm pretty sure the AI cheats even on the easy settings (I assume they get some of resources bonus).Fun but annoying. Not sure if I'd recommend it. Worth a try if it's on sale I guess.			"

												If you're on the fence about buying this game like I was, just buy it. It's a great game to play with friends and the community is great.  However, if you're looking for a game to be quickly developed, that's not the case here. It is a faster development than most indie games though (I'm looking at you DayZ).			"

												Seems like the entire game is built on one tiny mini game - a set up a trajectory for missiles. Past this this there is buildings, research, upgrade and then later on lasers and ""missiles"" which function slightly different.But, it can't be argued that, what you need to do is get very very good at the minigame of setting up a projectile tragectory and pressing ""go"" - everything apart from that can be considered set dressing.Would certainly refund if it was possible.

												I bought this game for it's reviews, but it became quickly obvious that this game has a large fan boy base, as it does not in any way disserve so many good reviews.Pros:The game has a unique approach to it. I have never seen a multiplanet game that required trajectory planning to hit your target.Cons:That trajectory planning has no real way of calculating it, it's entirely by eye. This, combined with the wonky camera system, and the difficulty that makes to see the entire solar system at once makes it 20% skill, 80% luck, especially in a timed-term game.You experience everything the game has to offer in 20 minutes of playing, very few structures, no units, 4 weapon types: Laser, Rail, Missile, and asteroid. The difference between the 4? Just about nothing. 1 set is countered by kinetic defense, 1 by shield. woo..The forced-spinning during the 'Simulation round"" will make you sick.And all I listed above, is the entire extent of the game. Enjoy.			"

												This game is quite possible the most linear game I have ever played. Research tech, build stuctures, shoot other planets....thats it. And if you cannot kill the other players or AI in a shortish amount of time the game just become boring. Also at a certain point the AI only shoots at you with all their weapons. An do not get me stated on the astriods that destroy all your buildings after you run out of resources and therefore cannot rebuild them.My recommendation is do not but this game if it is not on sale during a Steam sale as you will most likely not play it for more than 15-20hrs.Or just don't buy it at all.

												Good idea, poor execution. You run a planet, and your aim is to collect resources from your planet and destroy other planets using large fixed weapons. Unlock more weapons through a tech tree and become more destructive.Shooting weapons is where the skill comes in. It has to be placed facing the right direction and projectile weapons are affected by the gravity of other planets. You can only fire as many shots as your 'energy' allows each turn.It's slow, it feels cumbersome. Watching a shot fly off into the distance when you know you've already missed is frustrating.I was hoping it would have more strategic elements (orbital forces, spaceships, strike teams, ground assaults on key elements) but it's 100% planet to planet fighting.It gets boring quite quickly and replay value is virtually nil.There is no campaign/story mode and I've never played online, but I'm not eager to, it's slow enough offline.

								Well, this is a difficult review in some ways.The game itself is more or less what I expected it to be, and although it still needs some polish and feature work it's certainly playable and it looks very nice.The real problem with the game is that you only have three options (or a mix of them) for playing: local multi, online, AI.For a new player like myself, the AI is insanely overpowered, and I get demolished without being able to do anything effective against them. As for local multi, that's not really an option for me. So online seems like it would be the way to go, but there's not really many people playing the game. I sat in the lobby for quite a while occasionally opening rooms, but it seems like there's 8 or 9 people that just want to play in private rooms all day and ignore me.Pity, really.In any case, the game itself is good, and I hope it continues to progress, but if something isn't done to facilitate matchmaking and adjust the AI difficulty then it could actually destroy this game.I'm choosing to be optimistic here and vote positive, but think carefully about it before buying this one.

								Well, unfortunately, as it currently stands, this is a multi-player only game.  If I had known this, I would not have spent the money on it.  At the very minimum, this should have some sort of single-player tutorial mode, which is not currently included.  I was forced to play 'multi-player-hotseat' with no one technically assigned the second seat.  Since there is no AI for the second player, then it becomes a game where you are defeating yourself.    As to the game mechanics, it is a type of gravity sim, where you fire kinetic rocks at your openent, OR lasers once you have the tech, and your firing is adjusted according to gravitical effects for kinetic weapons, affected by all other planets in the solar system, and can be blocked for lasers by line of sight issues if there is the sun or other planets in the way.  Rules wise, it all makes sense, but as a single player game, this is a complete no go.  Sorry folks, if you don't have friends to stop by and take the 2nd seat, you have nothing to do.  If you DO have friends to switch out the hotseat mode, then you have the issue where your friend can see everything you are building even though they technically do not have the technology by game rules to do so... IE over the shoulder views of what you are doing when you are sitting in the hotseat.			"

												Way too simple for this money. A rather bad attempt to make Worms or Scorched Earth in space. I wouldn't even pay to play it on a phone (which is about how much complexity you can expect). Even on sale this was simply a waste of money.First of all, there is absolutely no need for 3 dimensions, you only shoot in the orbit plane anyway. Graphic is unnecessarily advanced, it's like playing Chess on Unreal engine.The two weapon choices, lasers and ballistics, get boring fast. Amount of buildings you need to stuff your planet with to get through a bigger game is staggering, with absolutely no micro-management help. Want to upgrade? It's click-it-all time. Piece by piece.And then there is the ridiculousness of orbital movement prediction not being somewhere in the tech tree. You can push an asteroid into a planet and build a freaking death ray next to a sun, and you have to guess the ballistics as if you are throwing rocks?Lastly, with all the simplicity, it takes miraculously long time for the AI to make their move and to simulate everything.

								Would I currently recommend this game for anyone? NoWould I recommend this game for someone who really digs the concept? YesThis game is fun right now, but doesnt seem to have too much depth. I haven't seen too many updates that provide content. It boils down to building the shields to whatever your opponent is building and weapons to smash him, along with upgrades to sensors and mines and infrastructure. The concept is solid, I just feel like it needs more depth than it currently has. Colonization of other planets is an idea I've thought about while playing the game, especially with each planet only having finite resources.			"

												This game has problems.The GUI? Well done, lacks a bit of polish in some spots, but rather excellent.The music? A well done score, compliments things, feels right for the game.Aiming function? For lasers, it's amazingly easy. For mass-projectiles? An abomination.The tech tree? Horrendous. tech points are wasted if unused. descriptions are done poorly and don't explain very well the functionality. Mass-tech is absolutely useless - the game does no 'math' or 'aiming' for you. Lasers are the auto-win.Fire positioning is absurd. It doesn't allow you to choose at what point in planetary rotation you want to fire.Lastly, your planet runs out of materials.You can't rebuild cities.Basically, you start playing the game, and it's all random - the player who wins is the player with the best luck for planetary city positioning and that gets luckiest on what section of their planet is facing what direction.

												Kind of a one trick pony, and that trick doesn't make a damn bit of sense in the context of the game. The core of the game is aiming a projectile through multi-planetary orbital mechanics. I realize it's just a game, but it just defies even the most forgiving of logic to believe that a planet which can build interplanetary missiles and rail guns can't accurately do the math to figure out how far you have to lead the planet you're targeting.Other than the orbital mechanics shooting gallery stuff, it's a totally generic build-and-attack strategy game. If you like the shooting mechanic, then pay the few bucks and get this on sale.			"

								Overall I find this to be one of those brilliant games, that has so much potential, but ends up fading away because no one ever hears about it. If you enjoy Sci Fi strategy games, get this one. The mechanics are solid, even if basic, but that's to be expected with a game in Alpha. It's actually challenging. In games like Civ, you can win, without ever really having a strategy, but with Interplanetary, you really have to strategise as you are meant to for a Strategy game. Watch a few gameplays, and see for yourself exactly how a game plays out. The only current flaws I've come across, is the lack of a Single Player mode, (which has been confirmed for future release) and the lack of complexity in the lobbies, such as, no chat, and no way to set up your lobby other than a password lock, (not to mention the rarity of actually finding people online to play with) But in order to find people online, you need to buy the game. Because it's in Alpha, the players still have some control over what should be changed about the game. So, all in all, I would strongly reccommend buying this game as soon as possible as to prevent it from slipping away.			"

								This game is fun, simple as that. It has only multiplayer though and I can never find anyone online nor a single player campaign/scenario (which I have heard they are implementing), but they do have a hotseat multiplyer which few games have now. The concept is fun and original, and while the tech tree is a bit simple, it's enough for now. I'm sure the devs are expanding it soon. The weapons all have different strengths/weaknesses and feel different. The shielding is useless from my limited experience on it though. Plus in a game which has planetvsplanet based warfare; you would think there would be colonizing options to make the solar system feel more alive, but there isn't. Yet I can still say that this game is very fun and with time I am sure it can surface as one of the most fun indie games out there.			"

								A really great game, had a lot of fun shooting 5 volleys of missiles and 5 laser beams at my enemy! Will definately be trying this out with more people, having stray missiles from the trajectory system is fun to play around with. The game is still in early access but has great potential! Would love to see multiple planets, creating cities, more weapons, more buildings and more management!! It's hard to make a comeback after you've lost some cities. Looking forward to singleplayer as well, hopefully the AI will be challenging. Really cheap too for only £3!!!!			"

								This is a genuinely interesting take on an old concept. Take the old cannon attack/defense game and add some element of orbital mechanics to it. Be warned: the AI is an excellent shot (and the between turns animations take a few minutes because of all the calculations). Still, this is a worthwhile addition and a fun way to spend an hour shooting at things in a slightly more complex fashion than point-and-click.			"

												Ok so I have played the computer a few times, and a couple of games against humans. I got to say this about Interplanetary: It is a very strategic game. You spend a lot of time pondering your next move, the tech tree is deep but not that deep, making your choices of tech dictate your strategy. Do you run gun spam? Get missles? Run for a super weapon... etc. Every turn your choices have a long term impact on your future, choose wisely. Its by far not a 'super' complex game, but its better that way. The amount of choices available allow make it not some wildely varying battle but a game of the mind. The price is right, not to expensive, and the game has supprising depth for something so viscerally appealing (you can't say the idea of bombarding your fellow planets doesn't appeal to you.) The graphics, sounds, and music are all good, and run fast on even simple machines. A must get for strat gamers everywhere.			"

												Can't recommend at the moment, although it has potential.Pros:+Calculating all the angles for your shots is intuitively presented and really fun when it comes off.+There's a good science tree with interesting consequences for the development of the game over maybe 100 turns or so.+Interesting intel and counter-intel systems.+Essentially a fun game.Cons:- Seriously buggy. I literally haven't got past turn 30 in any game without some major bug. They aren't necessarily game breaking but they screw the game nonetheless. I regularly find that suddenly my whole planet's resources have disappeared, or all my cities have grown to max pop overnight, or something else random like that. Other times the whole game simply crashes. I've tried to play through 5 games and not one has survived the bugs.- Seriously badly optimised. I have a decent enough Alienware computer and it can't really handle this game, which is ridiculous when you look at it. It isn't that the graphics are a problem, it's that the processing is a problem. If you play with more than 3 players (the game is supposed to do up to 8) then by turn 30 or so the CPU is taking a full minute to process the turns, and then it gets exponentially worse. I tried a game with 8 players and before even turn 10 it was unplayable. This is unforgiveably bad programming optimisation.Conclusion: A real shame - it feels like it would be really fun to play through a game, but you just can't. "

												Yes for now. There are two MAJOR problems I have with this, though:1- The time it takes for AI to calculate their turns. I'd like to do an 8 player match, but waiting over a minute between turns is just mind numbing.2- The AI. On easy they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. On normal, the next difficulty up, they seem to know EXACTLY where to shoot to hit you. Out of ~30 projectiles fired at me, ~8 missed. You, however, don't have this knowledge. and unless you're using lasers, will suffer pretty badly.EDIT: Having played it once again, it's too far on the other side, now. The AI on easy is TOO accurate and seem to target you far more readily than other players. That or I'm horribly unlucky.			"

								It is basically an Artillery game where your base and the enemies bases are planets orbiting a star. You have to defend the five cities of your planet and destroy your enemies' cities. You need to build facilities to collect resources and intelligence and build your weapons and defenses. There is a tech tree you need to research to unlock better weapons and defenses.You and your opponents play in simultaneous turns to build facilities and to fire weapons. The trajectories are influenced by the gravity of the planets and of the star. After everyone end their turn the game simulates the planets moving and its effect on the shots.It is a fun game to play with a friend.			"

								Pretty entertaining! Whether you're firing long shots across the solar system - slingshotting around multiple planets and hoping you correctly estimated where they'd be, or hunkering down as your planet counter-rotates between two enemy planets, making your preparations to fire both sides point-blank, there are a lot of satisfying moments in this game, certainly enough to justify the $10. I'm not even mad I didn't buy it while it was on sale.One thing that bothered me was that there is a distinct advantage to being on the outermost planet; twice on every orbit of an inner planet, they are headed either directly towards or away from you, and your firing solution is dead simple. On the other hand, you are never moving directly towards or away from THEM.And be warned about the asteroid superweapon: it only fires from ONE point in the asteroid field, so its usefulness varies with where in the system your enemies are in relation to it.

												I enjoyed playing with this strategy game but I think it suffers from one very annoying flaw...The Game focuses on the gravity fields surrounding planets in the (imaginary) solar system you are waging war in.You fire projectiles across the solar system and plot your projectiles paths with the aid of a prediction line,and this seems to be the games selling point. But...Unfortunately you find that the most effective weapons are the lasers, - which are not affected by gravity....This sort of kills the whole fun of plotting trajectories for projectiles or missiles as they become redundant fast.(If you have not built lasers too by researching the right technologies, then you`re going to lose as soon as your opponent does...).I also found the predicted projectile paths very innacurate as many times I`d have set up several rail guns trajectories and used the targeting paths shown, only to see my shots miss by large margins. The general rule is that the further away the target is from you, the less accurate the prediction is. Unfortunately the AI seems very accurate when firing back.It`s quite hard playing against a single opponent in single player mode so can only imagine how fast I`d find myself being obliterated if I start a game with several AI opponents...I DO like the game  and think that in multiplayer, against human players this will be quite entertaining so I`m recommending it, but kinda wish you could disable the use of lasers, as this would prolong games and enhance them.

												This is a great concept and a great game.  What's not to like about interplanetary warfare?There are strategy elements including a complex tech tree with multiple paths to victory.  It is very important to consider what to research and build and in what order.  Offense or defense?  Strike early or build infrastructure?  Focus on intelligence to enable pinpoint strikes or counter intelligence to prevent them.Resource management is a big part of the game and forces risk based trade-offs.  Build a new solar plant for next turn or save enough energy this turn to power defenses?Actual combat is a bit like billiards or mini-golf - but in space with gravitation.  Wait for the easy shot or risk a difficult one?One downside mentioned in early access reviews is AI difficulty level, but this is now fixed.  AI has a difficulty setting so that the Normal setting feels like playing another human.  This is important since computers are very good at ballistic calculations.			"

												This game is the love child of Worms and the tabletop game Battleship ... but in space!! >< It is simply awesome ... play it, you won't regret it.In more detail, 3 pro's and 3 con's for balance:Pro's:1) it has the addictive charm of both the above mentioned games; as it utilizes the artillery style of worms with the damage style of Battleship. To win you have to eliminate your opponents cities, and in a few multiplayer games I've had opponents yelling ''i sunk your battleship'' ... which continues to make me smile.2) it is very simple to pick up, as the general mechanics and the buildings should make sense to you very quickly, and games are also relatively quick, so it's great for short bursts of fun - though mastering the game is not easy. There is also no story or general context, or diplomacy, other than to 'sink' those cities. That sounds bad but it is not, it is refreshing and the game excels at providing focused strategic fun.3) it is satisfying - hitting an opponent on a near impossible shot, or having your planet just escape a major hit ... it just feels good.Con's:1) not much information feedback from the game. it would be nice to know how much damage I did, or how many shots got through, or, well, anything really ... there is also no information at the end of the game either. I guess I could just be spoilt by other games, as this does not detract from the enjoyment or mechanics. However, even though I can understand that limited information is best at the end of each turn (that the intelligence system should give you what you need), there could be something at the very end (even a simplistic score based on damage or population or something).2) a bit buggy, had a few crashes here and there and the AI takes a while to make a turn.3) no quick save feature (as far as I can tell). Given the occasional crashes it is useful to save after each turn, which means going into the menu each time and selecting a save ... not a hassle you say? It gets really annoying after a while.Overall: just buy it and love it. My hopes are this game will continue to get developed, as I would love to see a few extra buildings, a bigger tech tree and all new features. It is addictive fun :)p.s: though the game is best played with other people, the AI seems fine to me. I've only played on easy and normal but the AI seems to generally hit well enough and miss well enough on both of those settings ... the AI is not obviously overpowered or underpowered to me, though they don't really use telescopes to spy on the player much.

												Going to keep this short.It's like Pocket Tanks meets Civilization in space.Everyone plans out their economy, research, production and shots, and end their turns.The planets resume their respective orbits until projectiles die out or hit a mark, repeat.			"

												I've always loved turn-based artillery action, and Interplanetary is a welcome addition to the genre. Less ""Worms"" and more ""Scorched Earth"" with some strategic building mixed in. Online play is where the game shines, although curiously online AI players are not yet supported.I would like to see a few additions/changes made, if possible.1) Persistent projectiles: Currently, if projectiles miss their targets, they explode before the next round starts. It would be nice if they remained until they hit something. This would add some much needed chaos and open up the possibility of new strategy elements (flood the solar system with cheap railgun slugs and hope for the best!).2) Balance for orbit positions: Some may disagree, but the players on the outer orbits are definitely at an advantage. Players on the inner orbits are guaranteed to get chewed up first, and the outer rim planets are free to build up and attain superweapons. Perhaps the method of balancing this would be my third suggestion...3) Planet speed: It seems that all of the planets move at the same speed, but the outer ones should move slower. This would make them easier to hit, perhaps?The developer seems to be actively updating the game, so hopefully they can consider these suggestions. All in all though, an amazing game! I highly recommend it!			"

												Nice game that has a fairly simple learning curve. Not a huge standout amongst building/research/level up/shoot type of games but a solid start for a first release that's for sure !  Game suffers from a lack of real depth, waiting times whilst simulating moves, different factions/races with unique upgrades, ai is sterile and predictable. It isn't all bad though, it has a a simple and attractive ui , although it does need to be not right in the middle of the screen-offset it to a corner with a line to what you are looking at and it would be a vast improvement. The whole orbital missile and railgun mechanic is really very well done, the space setting and soft background music sets the tone nicely and the view system is pretty comfortable and intuitive for gamers who have had some time with these sort of build/research/kill/defend type games. It's basically tower defense 3d in space..and it works nicely.Sweetwork and look forward to what else they come up with in the future  :)			"

								Pretty entertaining! Whether you're firing long shots across the solar system - slingshotting around multiple planets and hoping you correctly estimated where they'd be, or hunkering down as your planet counter-rotates between two enemy planets, making your preparations to fire both sides point-blank, there are a lot of satisfying moments in this game, certainly enough to justify the $10. I'm not even mad I didn't buy it while it was on sale.One thing that bothered me was that there is a distinct advantage to being on the outermost planet; twice on every orbit of an inner planet, they are headed either directly towards or away from you, and your firing solution is dead simple. On the other hand, you are never moving directly towards or away from THEM.And be warned about the asteroid superweapon: it only fires from ONE point in the asteroid field, so its usefulness varies with where in the system your enemies are in relation to it.

												Very dynamic strategy game where every round is different. Round lengths are different, weapons are different, strategies change every round, and there is a good use for every building. The fact that because I was losing an intelligence battle I could not use my endgame super laser weapon and so had to blind fire railguns to lower his counterintelligence while researching upgrades means this is an amzingly complex game if you want it to be. On the other hand you could just keep firing railguns everywhere.			"

												Can't recommend at the moment, although it has potential.Pros:+Calculating all the angles for your shots is intuitively presented and really fun when it comes off.+There's a good science tree with interesting consequences for the development of the game over maybe 100 turns or so.+Interesting intel and counter-intel systems.+Essentially a fun game.Cons:- Seriously buggy. I literally haven't got past turn 30 in any game without some major bug. They aren't necessarily game breaking but they screw the game nonetheless. I regularly find that suddenly my whole planet's resources have disappeared, or all my cities have grown to max pop overnight, or something else random like that. Other times the whole game simply crashes. I've tried to play through 5 games and not one has survived the bugs.- Seriously badly optimised. I have a decent enough Alienware computer and it can't really handle this game, which is ridiculous when you look at it. It isn't that the graphics are a problem, it's that the processing is a problem. If you play with more than 3 players (the game is supposed to do up to 8) then by turn 30 or so the CPU is taking a full minute to process the turns, and then it gets exponentially worse. I tried a game with 8 players and before even turn 10 it was unplayable. This is unforgiveably bad programming optimisation.Conclusion: A real shame - it feels like it would be really fun to play through a game, but you just can't. "

												Yes for now. There are two MAJOR problems I have with this, though:1- The time it takes for AI to calculate their turns. I'd like to do an 8 player match, but waiting over a minute between turns is just mind numbing.2- The AI. On easy they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. On normal, the next difficulty up, they seem to know EXACTLY where to shoot to hit you. Out of ~30 projectiles fired at me, ~8 missed. You, however, don't have this knowledge. and unless you're using lasers, will suffer pretty badly.EDIT: Having played it once again, it's too far on the other side, now. The AI on easy is TOO accurate and seem to target you far more readily than other players. That or I'm horribly unlucky.			"

								Interplanetary is a beautiful game. You get in with no idea and build a solar plant with 2 mines, after a bring turn you build a rail gun and more mines maybe with a kenetic defence notice you have researched two techs. After this you fire at the enemy and miss then go on to build more guns and fire them later. After a while you think the AI has no chance since you have lasers early game. You hit next turn and the AI happens to have both super weapons and 15 railguns combine with 6 rockets and lasers. All hit with pin point accuracy and you have just been destroyed in one turn. But the multiplayer is where everyone is just barely hanging on. Their buildings are been constantly rebuilt and by the end only two remain with one last hope, only one wins. Buy this game now.

								This game is so fun! The first time i played it, I played for 8 hours straight. While it is still in alpha, its a very impressive style of RTS that's much more relaxing than others I've encounterd. Like another reviewer said, it feels like a game, not a job.As for some improvements that could be made, other ""maps"" (for lack of a better term) could be made, with elliptical orbits, larger neutral planets (with increased gravity), a second sun to orbit, or a black hole just as a couple examples.AI is pretty difficult to fight against. I'm pretty sure on turn 3 they have enough railguns to destroy every other planet in the solar system, while my planet is just building up some mines.There isn't a huge player base, so multiplayer is kinda hard to come by, but whenever you play with a large amount of people, the outermost planet tends to win since its somewhat harder to shoot them from the innermost planets. Eliptical orbits could put everyone on equal footing.Also, railgun op. Devs, a railgun shoots a single bullet, not a shotgun shell, plz nerf.			"

								This is a promising game with what's currently on offer, considering it's still early access. It's very pretty and the combat mechanics are a lot of fun, trying to aim rockets to curve around other objects in the solar system makes it a lot more entertaining than selecting a target and firing.The development of planets is pretty simple with only about 10 different types of buildings you can build. This is both a blessing and a curse; it makes the game easy to pick up and I was fairly familiar to the mechanics within a few hours, but of course for people who playa  lot of strategy games it might be overly simple. Most things currently in the game seem well balanced, with the possible exception of the ""super weapons"". They seem rather overpowered and from my experience, most rounds just end up as a race to be the first to get one.My online experience hasn't been great so far, I'm yet to complete a game online due to various issues with the game itself as well as people just dropping out of games. It's really disappointing because there is a lot of potential that isn't being found there yet. The non-online ""hotseat"" mode is a lot of fun as it stands and with private online matches or some sort of system to stop people dropping out (possibly reputation depending on how many games you finish?), the online multiplayer could be great too.There's no single player as it stands, but this is of course planned and could be really solid too, as long as the AI are up to scratch.In short, this game is good as it currently is, but I see the potential for it to be great, and at this price, who could argue with that?

Early Access Review
								My old review was negative due to the lack of a singleplayer gamemode, but now that the devs have added it, I changed my review to positive. While the game may still be in early access, it is extremely promising. The mechanics are very unique and there's never been a game quite like it. Interplanetary is one of a kind. It combines gravity and lasers/guns which requires you to have some skill at knowing how to aim them. As I said before, it's in early access but so far the features it has are very proming.			"

												This game was just so boring to me if its your kind of game then go for it. games like this (in the ballpark anyway) that I liked were civilization 4. To me the game just seems to be missing personality maybe a story mode would have made it last longer. I think someone who liked dwarf tower may like this though.			"

												Interplanetary Is A Great Game! I Would Take The Time To Go Through The Pro's And Con's , But, I Think This Pretty Much Sums It Up:*The Ai Is Interesting And Great To Play With*The Mechanics Work Well*The UI/Interface Is Easy To Understand*The Tech Tree Is Deep But Simple To Learn*There Is A Wide Variety Of Weapons/Options To Investigate-In Bigger Games The Game Can LagBut Overall, 10 out of 10 From Me!

												AN EXCELLENT ARTILLERY SPACE GAMEI’ve been a fan of artillery games for many many years. I’ve played most of the Worms games and loved them (most of them), and I loved playing a game called Tanks way back in the early 90s. Yes I’m old. I had to break out of the retirement home just to write this review for you guys so please give it a thumbs up.Anyway, Interplanetary differs from all of the other artillery games I’ve played in that the developers have taken the genre into outer space. Boy does it work wonderfully in this new playground! Because planets are continually orbiting their host stars you have to predict where you think the enemy planet will be by the time your projectile will have reached it after having traversed the star system - very much like leading a target with a sniper rifle in a first-person shooter game.Not only do you have to take into account the movement of your target planet as it performs its orbit, you also have to consider the movement of other orbiting bodies, their gravity wells, and the fact that they may move in to the way of your otherwise well-aimed shot. I’ve often been saved from the onslaught of incoming enemy fire by an uninhabited planet “heroically” diving in the way to bear the full brunt of the barrage. Thank you, physics! :DMoreover, you have to take into consideration the rotation of your planet and that of the target planet too. If you’ve built a laser and it’s on the opposite side of your planet facing away from the enemy then it’ll be completely useless for that targeting turn until your planet has rotated to face the correct direction. Likewise, if you’re aiming for a particular enemy city and it’s currently on the opposite side of the planet, from your point of view, then it’ll make it a lot more difficult to hit, and you may even have to wait until the planet’s rotation has put it on the side that’s facing you to score a successful attack.Very basically, in each turn you can build, undertake research, and shoot at your enemies. You have to plan this carefully because firing lots of weapons in one turn may not leave you with any energy remaining to begin contruction projects that round. This is true the other way around: too much building and you'll have no energy left to fire your weapons. So it's best to go on the offensive when you've got easy shots lined up, and build up your planet when the targets are far away and with lots of celestial bodies obstructing the path.You then win the game by destroying all of the enemy's cities and massacring the millions of civilians who, hitherto, inhabited it.PROS- Single player and multiplayer with up to 7 enemies in both cases. This can provide some very interesting and challenging matches, especially when one player's shot misses the intended target and hits someone else instead :D- Buildings and cities are upgradeable e.g. power plants can produce even more energy, satellite arrays have improved detection of enemy structures, HP increase...- Weapons are upgradeable e.g. increased damage, reduced power consumption,- Lots of great upgrades to research and unlock via the tech tree.- Great orchestral soundtrack that adds wonderfully to the atmosphere.- Firing a shot around the sun only to have it slung-shot back in your direction, hit your own planet, and destroy your own buildings is surprisingly good fun. There’s even a Steam achievement if you manage to do that! :DCONS- Relatively few weapons: rain gun, missile, laser, solar laser, asteroid diversion... That’s it, sadly.- The computer AI has pretty much perfect aim. In my experience the AI shots almost never miss.- All of the matches are played in just unary star systems (i.e. just one sun). I know it would make aiming interplanetary projectiles a lot more difficult in binary or ternary solar systems (2 or 3 stars respectively), what with all of the extra gravity wells, but it would be a great challenge for those who want a ‘hardcore’ game mode.- (as an extension of the last point) All of the host stars are just main sequence stars like our Sun. It would have been great to have had different star types like blue super giants and white dwarfs. With their differing sizes (and different mass) firing projectiles through the planetary system would require very different trajectories and velocities with such different stars. Also, their very different masses, and therfore gravity, would greatly affect the angular velocities of the orbiting planets - another factor that would influence how you’d have to plan your trajectory paths during the targeting phase.I’d easily give Interplanetary an 8 or 8.5 out of 10. It would instantly get an extra point if the developer added the “missing content” outlined in my cons section.If you like turn-based strategy games, with excellent artillery action which requires precise planning, and also involves base building with research then Interplanetary should be an insta-buy for you.As always, leave any questions below and I’ll get back to you.Happy mass-murdering!

												- Join a random local game with AIs to test how the game works- Get Noscoped by AIs with 100% aimbot http://imgur.com/a/PH3nN- Join a multiplayer match to get some playabale matchmaking- Get rekt trying to figure out what ""Asteroid Division"" was and building it- Wait for 10 turns while my planet is torn apart to be able to build ""Asteroid Division""- Finally ""Asteroid Division"" is ready and my last two cities are about to go down- Shoot ""Asteroid Division""- Watch how a massive horde of asteroids crash into the enemy planet and barely take everything out- Watch how two more hordes of asteroids crash into the enemy planet and finish it off.10/10 would explode a planet againNow for the honest review; i love this game, it is really fun to play and entretaining. What i liked most is the ""aiming"" system wich takes into account soo many variables you'd find it out hard to get used to. (Every single thing moving arround a solar system has gravity and WILL affect your weapons, unless its a laser, of course.)However i find it hard to find a match lastly, there isnt many people playing that i can find (Maybe has something to do with my GMT-3 Timezone from south america wich is not a very big online-gaming part of the world), so if you have someone to play this game is just fantastic, and the local multiplayer certainly works like a charm if a friend comes over. Otherwise i'm not completly sure i'd recommend this game.			"

												This game is a great time waster, the new solitaire or minesweeper for me. The routine of connecting your first cities turns into a race to see if you macroed fsat enough.However the game is extremely lacking in depth and options. Although there are choices to what you can do, you can (and should) take the same path to victory every time. Anything that doesn't get more weapons on the field as fast as possible is a waste of time,All weapons take an inordinate amount of time to target, and must be targeted individually. Certain defenses must be in place before certain points of time. And the ability to race for superweapons means you must also race for weapons - but not too hard, because you can still beat them to it.Also the graphics are extremely unoptimized leading to massive stuttering. And nobody is playing the online mode.If you enjoy performing the optimal strateg ove rand over again the game will be fun! But if you're expecing anything with more depth than solitaire give it a pass.			"

												I enjoyed playing with this strategy game but I think it suffers from one very annoying flaw...The Game focuses on the gravity fields surrounding planets in the (imaginary) solar system you are waging war in.You fire projectiles across the solar system and plot your projectiles paths with the aid of a prediction line,and this seems to be the games selling point. But...Unfortunately you find that the most effective weapons are the lasers, - which are not affected by gravity....This sort of kills the whole fun of plotting trajectories for projectiles or missiles as they become redundant fast.(If you have not built lasers too by researching the right technologies, then you`re going to lose as soon as your opponent does...).I also found the predicted projectile paths very innacurate as many times I`d have set up several rail guns trajectories and used the targeting paths shown, only to see my shots miss by large margins. The general rule is that the further away the target is from you, the less accurate the prediction is. Unfortunately the AI seems very accurate when firing back.It`s quite hard playing against a single opponent in single player mode so can only imagine how fast I`d find myself being obliterated if I start a game with several AI opponents...I DO like the game  and think that in multiplayer, against human players this will be quite entertaining so I`m recommending it, but kinda wish you could disable the use of lasers, as this would prolong games and enhance them.

												This game requiers friends, so keep that in mind, It is a really fun strateegic game that you play against your friends, though I do have one problum with it: There is no saving for multyplayer, so if you want to play a game you better make shoure you have a good 4hurs or so straight to spend playing a round.

												A game is pretty good when you start to feel pressure and panic as you play.  The urgency of spotting enemy facilties, setting up defenses, anticipating a good shot opportunity as orbits allow.... didn't think a turn-based game would have the sam frantic feel as Missile Command.  Very cool game, easy to play, quick satisfaction/completion if you only have 20-60 minutes.			"

												a REALLY good game, its not too hard to get into and can be modified to make it more interesting, a great game to pick up if you want a space-strategy game. EDIT: I neglected to mention this but as the game goes on, the AI, to keep up the same sort of diffulcuty and to cope with major losses ends up hanging and taking a VERY long time to decide its turn. Also, the loading screen takes its time too when its very far into the game. well very far being about 45 turns... It is still a GREAT game, but you need to have patience, or stick to very small and quick games.			"
