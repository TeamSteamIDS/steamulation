												So I dug this game out of my library and have been playing it a lot recently.Started up a game as England because why not.I take over Whales and what's left of England. Then I start my war with Scotland. It goes as well as can be expected they have two cities I have...lots. It ends pretty fast. However just before Great Britan becomes unified I am excommunicated from the church. No matter William the Fatty dies soon enough and I am back in. I then set out on my duty like any good Catholic Lord does and Chritianize this land I have taken.Everything is going well. Our cities are growing in England, and on mainland Europe we managed to take over Brittany and Belgium and Holland. With this new base of man power I believe it is time to bring the word of Christ to the lands of the heretics in the east!However just as I am about ready to go on the Crusade, France decides I am too threatening to them and declares war on me. No matter English dreams can wait, we will just have to take over this damned country first.The war progresses quickly. France is overwhelmed by the veteran soldiers of the English army, mostly consisting of militia, but they are English Militia so they get the job done.We take over Western France and push farther into French homeland, we even take Paris. Just when the war seems to be wrapping up the French call in the Milanese to help them. I never liked Milan and it never surprises me when they declare war. Soon enough the English standard is flying over Metz and Dijon and all that is left is Marseille and Milan's Italian holdings, they will fall soon enough.However on my march to South France I accidentally declare war on Portugal when they came to the aid of France in a battle. It is only small little Portugal and their Iberian holdings will be great for bringing the Sign Of The Cross to the Moors....someday.But alas. It seems England became to big for its breeches. The Not-Holy-Nor-Roman-And-Certainly-Not-An-Empire Holy Roman Empire declares war. UGH. This is going to take much longer than expected. And to make matters worse it seems at some point I was removed from the Church.  I only notice because apparently a Crusade was called On Toulouse, which I own.Whether I am now the Anti-Christ or not I was still English and I wasn't about to let some European trash walk into my realm and take it. So I fortify my holdings and wait for the coming storm of armies. In quick succession France, Milan, HRE, Portugal, Hungry and Spain join the Crusade. Not good.Having lost a king and a large handful of family members in the war so far I needed to be careful. So instead of invading their lands I let them come to me. Quick enough three armies are outside my stronghold outbumering me 2:3 (I had reinforced with an army made of entire cavalry).First up is Spain. I let them wait outside and build up siege equipment. Then they attack. It is over before it starts, since apparently Spaniards are made up of weak soldiers who don't even know how to hold a spear properly. Defeating them with minimal losses I turn my gase to the next foe, Hungry.They put up a better fight than the Spanish but they too are not match for English bravery, and are soon defeated and sent home to Eastern Europe to have their silly fights with the Poles and Rus'.The last army to face is the Germans. However I am seriously lacking in soldiers defending Toulouse and have to attack with my Cavalry army. Though at the start of the battle my general warns me that their army is made up of many spears, they have studied me well and it seems that only they will put up a good fight, it truly is time for brave hearts and brave deeds.England has the high ground on the battlefield and we swarm over them like a hoard of.....well angry English. The battle is over disappointingly fast. Their army is in retreat, it seems that even their emperor came to the battle but he too flees from the field like a woman. Our Light Cavalry, those dashing fellows they, catch up to him before he knows what happens and is my prisoner.I demand a ransom but he ""claims"" he doesn't have the money something about the international jewery shafting his economy. Nonsense. If he can't pay with his Florins then he will pay WITH HIS HEAD!Maybe executing the German Emperor wasn't the best idea but no matter, there is still a war to be won. I defeat the French, Portugese, and Milanese Crusading Armies in time and even branch out into Iberia and across the Rhine. Somewhat expectedly the Pope dies and a new one is elected, not much of a surprise he is Italian, and he hates me. But I still have dreams of one day reclaiming the Holy Land in the Name of Our Lord and Savior. So I send an assassin to kill the Pope. The first one fails but the next one doesn't and the Pope dies soon enough.Disappointingly the next one is German, well that can't be so he dies as well. The next is Polish. Well I don't have any problems with Poland so he can live, for now. He even allows me to return to the Church, I think things might be turning around. But when I go to defend my homeland against...someone it is all a blur by now, I am excomunicated again, what a disappointment I had high hopes for this new Pope but it seems he will go the same route as the last.However my greatest assassin, Christopher the Christian Killer fails me, not only does he fail me he gets himself killed and I am now at war with all of Christendom. With my last King dying from ""mysterious causes"", and most of my armies heavily wounded from the continuing war, I retreat. Pulling my forces back across all of France seeing all that I had fought so hard to make. Metz, my most recent conquest gone like an instant. Toulouse that I had held out against all odds when I was deemed ""An Enemy Of The Faith"". Antwerp, where strong soldiers had held out against constant German invasions for over two decades, indeed to was a hard pain to swallow but it had to be done, with the peasantry in open revolt by home from being removed from the Church for so long. I always knew the people would betray me given the chance. So the great armies of victorious England headed home back to farming, waiting, watching for the time when we could once again sail across the Channel and bring the word of Christ to the heathen.

												I started with Rome: Total War and it was a great game. You picked an empire to control and used diplomacy, force, and cunning to grow. You manage armies, cities, and special units (spys/diplomats) in order to conquor Europe and surrounding areas.What Medieval II: Total War did was took Rome: Total War and made it even better. With the same mechanics and the addition of converting cities to forts and vice-versa the gameplay becomes even better. New units, new Factions, and a new map gave this series a well deserved title.I myself consider Medieval II: Total War to be the best game in the entire Total War franchise because instead of dumbing down the game (which is becoming rampant in the game industry) they took what they had and improved upon it instead.I recommend you buy this game if you are an intelligent person who enjoys to plan things out and act upon them with patience and coordination.Thanks for reading.

												This game has stood the test of time. In an age of decline and ruin in strategy gaming, one's mind wanders back to the glory of the past, and that glory is Medieval 2 Total War. Forget for a moment, the horror of poor optimization, leave behind the decadance of overpriced DLC, and remember the greatness of heroic men battling on fields of Medieval Europe. From the rocky crags of Scotland to the sands of Arabia, this game has it all. You ask for unique factions? Medieval 2 has many. Want a good campaign without horrible AI and bad diplomacy? This game delivers.  Do you desire frenetic Free-for-all battles? This game has those too. Now, take your mind back to the present. Total War is not what it once was. Mourn for our dying franchise, for there was greatness once. There once was a light in the civilized world, and this was it, this was our finest hour.11/10. Master of Total War and High Emperor of Creative Assembly. "

												I have clocked over 1000 hours on this game on the old retail DVD version. And all i can say is this is the best Total War game CA has released - and will probably ever release. Shogun and later games have their good sides but this one is still the best. Kingdoms expansion adds some 200-500 hours more of gameplay should you run out. Stainless Steel and some other unit expansion mods adds some hundreds more. Graphics are getting old and the good ol' AI is not that splendid. Not even with mods - but this game along with it's older brother in arms Rome Total War got things right on some things that CA persistently cannot reproduce anymore: pure fun, paper rock scissors -type of strategy that enables exciting and interesting meta-campaigns. (who cares about official campaign goals - these games are always more or less open ended). And lets not forget those exciting long battles. Later games brought more crashing and complexity and lost something on the road. Fun and entertainment value being the first ones who took a fatal trebuchet cow carcass shot to the neck.			"

												If you love the time period and liked Rome Total War then this game is for you.  I was not that happy with the game until I learned how to effectively charge knights. In Rome Total War you simply double clicked on what you wanted dead. In Medieval ll  you have to keep your formation in line before attacking. This is accomplished be judging the ground between you and the enemy unit you want to decimate.  When you are at a run with your knights and they are formed up in line hit the attack order (Double click).  Hitting them head on is a must (unless they are pike men then hit them from the back) spearmen don't stand a chance when a formed charge hits them. The diplomacy in  this game is involved and steeped in history. The different agents can help you do things like cement alliances with marriage or steal money from other nations with merchants.  The pope has impact on your decisions when you are a catholic nation. The crusades are very fun and a good mini quest which will help you groom princes to become better kings. The family tree adds a personnel touch which makes you actually care about your generals. The availability of mods also makes this a great game for instance if you get tired of the same old game then you can download something like Stainless steel mod which overhauls the entire game.

												TL;DRAn overall excellent game that I would highly recommend to anyone.Now, for the detail. First, I'd like to say that I have played this game for far longer than my steam hours. I played the gold edition disk for about 3 years before adding it to steam. I'd estimate I have something in the 600 realm of hours, 700 if you include steam time.EDIT: 600/700 on gold edition CD. Add that to steam time.On to the actual game. This game is a fantastic and educational experience about the middle ages. Even though some of it is innacurate 95% is correct, and you will most likely learn at least a few things you didn't know. To start with you have the option of 5 different factions, and by destroying other factions you unlock them as playayable. (orrrrrrr, you could just go into the files and change it so you can play as all of them straight away :)The campaign map is a well designed and easy to look at part of the overall game, with a clear layout so that you can tell what is going on instantly. The controls and design for building and recruiting are made easy also, and the advisors are helpful to new players. (though annoying for more experienced ones) and you can get involved straight away.Now for the best part. The battles are an overall incredible experience where you can lead an army into various types of battles; from raiding and capturing a castle to a field war of skill. As you play more, you can win fought out battles that you normally would not be able to or if the odds are stacked against you, and you become a true commander and build your empire.The DLC (Kingdoms pack) is actually a very worthwhile DLC, bringing in 4 new campaigns packed with new factions, units and maps, however I would not recommend playing these until you have at least got the hang of the main campaign, as these are far more in depth and you will get more out of them after obtaining a basic level of experience.To conclude, this masterpiece is my personal favourite in the series and I'd strongly recommend you play this over any other Total War title. If you are considering it, buy it. If it goes on sale, even better. Buy it as a gift. I'm sure someone will love it.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Medieval II Total WarDeveloper:  The Creative AssemblyPublisher:  SEGAGenre:  RTS/TBS hybridGeneral ImpressionI've been playing Medieval II Total War since it's launch in 2006. It was the first game in the Total War series to introduce texture diversity within the troops of a single unit. It remains one of my favorite strategy games, mainly for its easy to mod game engine, which sparked many high quality mods such as ""The Long Road"", ""La Guerre de Cent Ans - The Hundred Years War"" and ""For King or Country: The English Civil War"".Strong Points+ Pleasant graphics and sounds.+ High modding potential.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- 4 years per turn, in the vanilla campaigns.- No Achievements.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												        Yet another amazing addition to the franchise! What Rome: Total War does, Medieval 2: Total War does better. The first thing  I would like to talk about are the graphics. They have tremendously been enhanced from Rome: Total War, and you don't need much of an upgrade if at all to play this game! Shining plate, and mail armor. A great amount of new units, and weapons. Even improved animations! Unlike Rome: Total War, many of the combat animations of the units have been synced with the enemies attacks and deaths as well. No longer is it a slash at the air and instantly killing the enemy, now it's a fluid stab to the ground that makes you feel like they are actually fighting. One of the features I found quite neat are the types of armor your unit has for their armor rating. Now your unit gets the look of their armor rating! If you have bronze, it is usually padded armor, silver is half-plate (Or mail, depending in unit type), and Gold is full plate (If your unit can be upgraded to gold)! Their weapons however, do not change, or at least I have not seen a difference. Combat is also quite different than Rome: total war. Your units take a second to actually respond to a command which makes more sense to me, and it is also much slower. The campaign map is nearly the same as Rome: Total War except it has some minor changes. Overall, if you like strategy games this is a must have in your library. Too long didn't read: Feature improvements, better animations, slower combat, new types of armor. Good game, buy.			"

												Medieval II: Total War is a strategy game from Creative Assembly and published by SEGA. It is a sequel to the previous games, Rome: Total War. This time the game is set on medieval era.Medieval II: Total War retain many elements of gameplay from Rome: Total War with many enhancement such as the improved religion system and world events like the Christian Crusade or the Islamic Jihad. As a Christian Kingdom you can answer the call of The Pope the conquer the land considered infedel by them. Settlement are now divided into 2 type, a castle and a city. Settlement can be converted between.Graphics of Medieval II: Total War are improved in many ways from the previous game. Each soldier has a varying number of elements to him, such as arms, legs, body armour, shield heraldry, and so forth. Each element has a varying number of styles. Arrow and fire arrow effects feels more alive. Blood effects has also been introduced, but without gore effects.Medieval II: Total War is a great sequel of Total War series. Medieval era especially the Crusade era is one of many interesting setting in Total War. With improved graphics, the performance of the game still great, the game runs very optimized. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Was playing as England. The Pope calls a crusade on Jerusalem. My armies march from Caen on foot. After a grand adventure of manly tear shedding badassery I arrive and slaughter all the infidels in a battle worthy of song. My general is named John the Crusader for his valour. I get one turn to rest in the captured city.Then six full stack Mongol hordes appear, lay siege and ♥♥♥♥ everything and everyone. I watch hopelessly as they kill my general and his army, mount their desecrated corpses on the city and name it their home. The Pope allies with the Mongols in their capital of Jerusalem not long after. Then the Bubonic plague hits.I switched to Scotland ._.			"

												I went from conquering the Portugese, obliterating the Moors and waging war on France. The Pope disliked this, and ex-communicated me. As he called a crusade on my capital, I assassinated and replaced him with my own cardinal. My puppet pope brought me back to the Church, and called a crusade upon France, allowing me to take it with the help of most of the world. I then sailed to England, and took Scotland and burned their fields and exterminated their populace. The Mongols arrived and I eviscerated their horses upon my walls and stakes. After the Pope hailed me as a hero, I invaded Rome and the Papal State was no more, and I foguht my way through every Christian faction until I took Jerusalem, bringing a victory to my campaign.I then started in Middle Earth, Erebor being my new home. The people of Dale were nothing but an annoyance, so I siezed their homes and their docks, burning the MirkWood Elves to use as fuel for my fires. Sauron decided that I was to be removed, and sent his armies to my mountain. He broke upon Dwarven Steel like a water upon rock, and I marched upon Mordor, broke down the Black Gate and took Bara-Dur. Gondor cheered, as my armies marched on Minas Tirith and I became the new Chancellor of Gondor, putting an end to the reign of the Dark Lord and Men and Elves, and hailing a new age of Dwarven resolve.The Argonians were isolationists until I got a hold of them. We gathered our guerilla armies, and marched out of Black Marsh. We took the surrounding provinces, solidifying our hold upon Tamriel. The White City were threatened, but dared not oppose us. We fought a bloody war against the Khajiit, their deserts hindering our advance, but we triumphed in the end, putting an end to the bloody furbags. They became our armour and new home decorations. When the Daedric arrived, they could not hope to penetrate the Lizard agility of the armies, each one slipping through their grasp, their gates closing one by one, until finally their armies were defeated. Thus leaving the world in a state of uneasy peace.The amount of mods in this game makes it worth while, not to mention the large amount of content in the base game and DLC. I highly reccomend picking it up.			"

 Despite it's old age, it's a masterpiece.Medieval II: Total War is one of the best strategy games I've played. It's both enjoyable in a strategical and personal sense.Lets just straight get into why.Gameplay- The game manages to be detailed with their strategy, forcing you to actually flank and position your troops. It doesn't just account to how large your force is or whose troops are more disciplined, though, those two are factors to consider as well. In multiplayer, you might even be able to factor in Psychological Warfare! It gets pretty in-depth. And I love that.- In the Campaign, your Generals, Merchants, Spies, Diplomats and Assassins can gain, lose, enhance and diminish traits. It forces you to treat them as actual people to win the war, not the game. Your General is too hot-headed? Have him take up an Administrative Role for a while...Oh, he's too scary? Have him spare the peasants. He's a good guy, despite all the villages he burned...Probably.- The building and unit descriptions are just superbly fun to read, I find myself spending minutes reading the buildings and units on the queue. As well as the trait descriptions..It makes the game more immersive.- General Speeches are just the best thing ever. They can either be very good, like ""Pray now for the intercession of Saint Michael in our Imperial Cause..If you ride a horse, add a prayer to Saint Martin for your devotions!"" Or they can be extremely savage, ""They say that the French are better loves than fighters, this is true: Ask any goat, pig or other farmyard animal."" And, my favorite, can be hilarious, ""Well, here's the thing. I look at our foes, and all I see are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥-weasels!"" These things don't matter. They don't. But they're so good. And the fact that the later Total War games remove this makes it feel like something was missing in their core.- If you're ever bored with native gameplay, the modding community is ready to make you waste more hours on their mods like Stainless Steel, Third Age, DarthMod, etc.- The dead bodies don't despawn. The unit sizes are 80-160 men per unit. Maybe even more. I think that speaks for itself. It does? Of course it does.- While the campaign is great, I can't deny, nor can anyone deny, the fact that the AI is bad. I'd like to take this short moment to just be thankful that it's not as dumb as Empire: Total War's..- The unit variety is very large at first, but after a few hours of gameplay, you'll start to realize how little it is..Community- The Community isn't very bad, but not very good either. From my experience, the people are usually nice, and everyone follows the rules given by the host. (And apologize if they accidentaly don't.) Though, you will still occassionaly run into rude people, cheaters, campers, etc. Still, I still find a lot of fun in Multiplayer.Graphics- The Graphics in Medieval II isn't very impressive, but it's not bad either. But hey, it's an old game, so the lack in graphics is justified. Besides, charging knights will still look epic in any Total War game, no matter the graphics.Experience- The best thing about any total war game, or any game, is the experience. I have so much misadventures and adventures in this great game. I had a great general who died in defense of our Great Capital. (His name was Richard the Fearless.) I had an Assassin who assassinated every Pope that was elected until only the Cardinal from my nation was left to be elected. (His name was Ezio Borgognion the Killer.) I had a faithful unit of Mailed Knights that I brought to in every single campaign since the moment they were recruited early into the campaign. It's just..It's great. To be honest, this is probably why Medieval II is considered one of the best strategy games, and one of the best Total War games. It's the adventures you get through this.TL;DRBattles - Multiplayer - 10/10 | Singleplayer - 8/10Campaign - Multiplayer - 9/10 | Singleplayer - 9/10Gameplay - 8/10Graphics - 8/10Community - 9/10Immersion - 13/10Overall - 10/10. Go get it, if you're a fan of Strategy, you won't regret it.Oh, I forgot to warn you. Do NOT ♥♥♥♥ with the Pope.			"

Knowing betrayal can lurk in this game, I simply war against all and trust none.My first conquest was britannia. Scotland put up a good fight, however fell to England's power. The rebels were taken care of quite early.Now with the british isles under my control, I set my eyes on France. They owned a large deal of land, however were bankrupt and didnt have enough money for a good military force. I took this as my chance. I send a few armies over to deal with the French, and proved successful. The french king was slain by the blade of mine.With France under my control, I set my gaze upon Spain and Portugal. However, they would be more of a problem. They have the advantage in seas. Therefore, I sent multiple of my general's armies over to deal with them. We proved successful and eventually cut down spain. Portugal denied becoming a vassal, and was therefore absorbed into our glorious English Empire.Now with most of Western Europe under my control, I set my eyes upon the Holy Roman empire.They were taken down, however we took a good beating from the HRE. The pope calls a crusade upon one of our major military cities. Luckily, this place was already heavily guarded by my men. We were able to last through the crusade.Feeling angered from the Papal State's foolish act, I set my eyes away from the last 2 cities of HRE and onto the Papal States. The pope was going to die.The papal states were weak, being small to begin with either way. Now, I have the papal states under my control, and the Holy Roman Empire left in a glimpse of its former self. I finished off HRE, and realized the mongols were invading. I swiftly remembered the mistakes of my past, and garrisoned my heaviest armies onto my borders, expanding it cautiously.The mongols were close to us when the Byzantine Empire fell. Now i have quite a bit to look forward to.			"

												Total War: Warhammer just came out huh?Total war: Medieval 2 Warhammer End times just came out as well, all you need is M2TW and Kingdoms, and now you have the entire Warhammer world, instead of just a small patch of it.Perhaps your not into Warhammer? How about Lord of the Rings? Want to play as the orcs of morder, and bring back the one ring and see what happens?Perhaps you want to just relive the medieval times as a loyal Crusader, or warmongering Jihadist?Then Medieval 2: Total war is what you want.The modding community for this game is INSANE! There are mods which allow you to improve upon the base campaign significantly, to completely overhauling the game. This is something no other Total war in the franchise has nearly achieved. This game's modding community can beat anything CA puts out, the new Medieval 2: Warhammer End times mod that came out roughly around the same time Total War Warhammer came out, proves this.Buy this game. NOW. (Be sure to buy Kingdoms!)			"

												Definately has to be one of the best strategy games I have ever played. First of all, the gameplay offers a massive choice of nations and units each with their own traits. 17 different factions on top of long and short campaigns give a lot of room for different story paths and immense replayability. The mix of battles, diplomacy, family traits and strategy AI create a truly realistic and immersive game that offers an infinate number of choices to your next move, although the turn-based elements often feel oversimplified. It does have a solid real time combat foundation, but the AI is either really good or really bad depending on the difficulty setting. There is no middle ground. If you are new to real time strategy games, this one has a pretty steep learning curve. Even seasoned players may feel overwhelmed.One campaign can take days, even months of play time. However, sometimes the game can become a bit taxing to less motivated players (not that I'm complaining) and the AI during battles can often glitch. Whilst these glitches are mostly minor, they nevertheless break your immerson in the game and can be quite annoying when your soldiers glitch about instead of doing as they're told. Despite all its weaknesses, Med 2 is still a briliantly crafted game, its strategy mixed in with impressive graphics and cinematic music will keep you wound up in the Medieval age for thousands of hours.It's one of CA's best (Total War) games. It beats Empire, it beats Napoleon (which was rather a pile of garbage so that wasn't hard) and it beats Shogun2. I still like Medieval 2 better than anything that came after it.			"

												  Medieval II Total War, Yes it may not have GREAT graphics but it is amazing for when it was made aka, 2006. This game did have a few glitches and all but was an amazing game, using the Rome One Engine, and also having an amazing Modding community for which expanded the Total War series, from different Genres, for which when you look at this now Total War era, you see the ability not allowing Modders to change the game full way but only about Half way. Medieval II Total war shows a mix from the past to the Present day, and I think THIS game was the gateway from old Total War to the new. I love this game and its mods, like Stainless steel, Third Age, And if your a games of Thrones, there is a mod for that too! So if you love the Medieval Era, You love Total War Series, I recommend this game for you, I rate it 8/10!			"

												Despite it's name, the game actually covers the period from early medieval and up to early Renaissance/Age of discovery. The game covers Crusades, Mongolian invasion and even early colonisation of America. Medieval features factions (both playable and AI controlled) ranging from Aztecs in The New World to Turks, Russians and Mongols in the East. All that in 1 vanilla game without any DLC or mods.			"

												Having played Rome 1 and its expansions, Empire, and Attila in addition to this one, I would have to say that Medieval II is still my favorite of the series. I spent countless hours, both on the disk version, and then later on the steam one conquering my enemies or desperately fighting off hordes of invaders from the East.There are plenty of excellent mods out there for just about anything you can imagine, but I never really felt the game needed mods to be enjoyable. In fact I probably have more time playing the stock version than I do with mods.For a game that's a little over 10 years old now, it's held up remarkably well, and I'd venture to say that it's one of my favorite strategy games of all time.Edit: Removed section about redeeming retail CD keys for a steam version, as that apparently no longer works. Sorry for the misinformation.			"

It's nice to watch your country burn for heresy, or to turn into pagans by unkillable witch ... or If you are too bored get excommunicated ...

												This game was amazing at the time it came out. I totally loved it. But I would recommend to play it now, because attempts to bring the rich lore of the Lord of the Rings universe into the video game space have been about as successful as asking a hobbit to cut back to just five meals per day. Struggling under the weight of expectations and movie tie-ins, these games have left those desperate to explore Tolkien's engrossing world disappointed at best (looking at you Shadow of Mordor). It took a devoted team of modders to do what the triple-A titles could not, and the result is the mightily impressive Total War modification - The Third Age.


Medieval II is an old game, but it's worth playing again and again for the Lord of the Rings mod!

												My honest opinion:The AI is what really stands out. It's just as competent in battle as Attila's (the most recent TW title) is, and does well in the campaign, too.The tactical (battle) part of the game has aged incredibly well, all things considered. The combat mechanics are robust, and abilities are important (though a bit 'busy' in terms of interface, and fire-at-will is not always enabled by default on units that are meant to only fight at range). The asymetry in rosters means that combat can really vary a good deal, yet the balance feels just right.The strategic (campaign) part of the game aged less well. It's certainly playable, and it, too, feels balanced yet complex, but I'd be lying if I said the user-interface was all that good. As campaign UI goes, it's somewhat cluttered IMO, though I'd argue it's probably better than N:TW's was.In technical stuff, it's really, really stable, something that inexplicably was not the case in Empire and N:TW... in those games, I seemed to get sound glitches on the campaign screen, crash during battles, and so forth pretty much every campaign, forcing constant saving to be ready. Here, though, the game never seems to glitch up or break down.In artistic stuff, the game does quite well. For the era it was made in, the unit cards are good, and the unit models are surprisingly detailed when you zoom all the way in. The music is great, too. And the voice-over is, as always, the one mixed-bag (aside from the campaign UI, which was mentioned above). Voice-over work is terrible for units, but acceptable for in-game advisor and narration of pre-battle stuff (in historical battles, etc.).Overall, is it worth it for $20.00? Well, without mods I could see arguements that $20.00 is too high... but bear in mind how long the game has existed and how many people made mods for it, and it becomes evident that there will be plenty of mods to wade through and try.So, I marginally recommend it. A decade ago, I'd say to pick it up in a heart-beat... today, it's still just as good, but should really be a bit cheaper given that you will want to get the Kingdoms expansion as well and, hey, it's a pretty old title now (both it and the ex-pack).On sale, though, it's a no-brainer: pick it up.

												Now let me tell you, I am a great builder, the best in the buisness, I'm great, I know how to build things. But you know what's not great? Our country. We don't win anymore. We used to have clear victories, but we don't have them anymore. Our country's in serious trouble. I mean, when do we beat France in war? In an even battle, they kill us. When do we beat Scotland at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. We invite people from all over the world, including Syria, and we have no idea of who these people are. They are spies, they are sneaky diplomats, they are naffatunes, and some, I assume are good people. But we need a total and complete shutdown of Muslim immigration to England. We also need to build a great wall between us and Scotland, and it will be a beautiful wall with a big fat door where people can come in LEGALLY. Islam hates us, they really do. They exterminate and sack our villages, and I'll be sure to protect the Papist community from them. The pope questions my faith sometimes, but it's a disgrace to do so. I sent 4 cardinals into Ireland, I really did, and I built a great cathedral in York. Soon the Moors will declare a jihad on London at this rate. Anyways, when do we beat Venice at trade? They get 40 florins per turn on a resource, and we get 10! Let me tell you, if you crown me king, I'll bring back Blood Eagle and I'll bring back a hell of a lot worse. It'd be a pretty picture to see the Polish Queen on her knees. She's hot, just like my daughter, the future princess Ivanka. If she wasn't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her. Our country is weak! Our military is like number 20 on the turn report. At least that's what the experts tell me. I get a lot of pro players, they're calling me, they're saying ""king, you're gonna do something that's gonna be so tough"". And it's true. That's why I am officially running to be monarch of England, and we're gonna make our country rich again, we're gonna make it strong again, we're gonna take care of our knights, and it will all be great. Oh and I'll bombard the ♥♥♥♥ out of the Turkroaches with my trebuchets!t. Donald John Trump			"

												Medieval II: Total War is probably my personal favorite entry in the Total War franchise. This is partially due to my love of the time period, partially due to my previous obsession with the original Medieval: Total War (if they added that to Steam, I'd snap it up in a heartbeat), but largely because it managed to find the perfect balance between complexity and simplicity when it comes to campaign options - a balance which later entries in the series have tried to reproduce but often fall to one side or the other in attempting.Like all Total War games, Medieval II features a turn-based strategy map where the player manages their armies and cities, and a real-time tactical battlefield where they play out combat against opponents' armies. Medieval II covers the medieval period of Europe (and includes northern Africa and portions of the Middle East), allowing your faction to attempt to conquer the entirety of the western world of the time.It's fantastic and an enormous timesink. The graphics hold up surprisingly well for a game that was almost released a decade ago, in large part because the spectacle is so based on the massive numbers in the armies instead of incredible detail on the individual units.Medieval II is a wonderful game, and I heartily recommend it to any strategy fans.

												Hey there! I'm gonna assume you're deciding about if you should buy this game. So here you go...Well, here's a quick summary of the game!1: It's obviously similar to many games made by Creative Assembly.2: It's somewhat ""cheap"" compared to other games3: Better AI than Total War: Rome II (as many others would say)4: Not split into little DLC peices, compared to today's Total War games5: This game is still active in multiplayer, 10+ years after it's release!My opinion: It is basically Total War: Rome II, but better and it is worth it's price, including the DLC (Kingdoms). So if you're thinking about buying this, I would say yes. However, this is just my opinion of the game, so you can choose if you would like to buy this or not. Anyways, have a nice day and I hope I've helped you make your decision today! ^-^EDIT 11/26/2016: Voted for the ""Test of Time"" Steam Awards!			"

												A great TW Game, with very good grahics, good campaign map, and many other cool features. Gameplay is easy, and simple, with little experience in other TW games needed, though it does help to have a knowledge of TW games in general when playing *any* Total War game. Diplomacy is greatly improved, giving   the feture of seeing what the proposal's strength is(a HUGE plus, when compared to Empire's rather un-responsive AI Diplo), and the Campaign Map is of excellent quality(obviously not Rome II quality, as i is some years older, but still very good, and very detailed) Battles are great, with a good UI allowing full control of the battlefield, and immersive maps that truly do the game justice. Again, the graphics here are great, and very detailed in the city/castle making. Another big plus is the inclusion of the Family Tree, later removed, which is great for viewing whom is within an ever growing family, and who should be king(a great plus over having to kill off the un-desired heir in the previous Medieval: Total War XD).I cant give this game enough positive reviews, and have yet to come across anytihg negative.10/10 for me, well worth the purchase. Highly recommend during the currant Total War Weekend, and still after.			"

												Medieval II Total War is an interesting game that lives up to most expectationsThere isn't that much to say here. It's a good game that has some very obvious flaws. Flaws that are amusing in their own ways and can be fixed with some good mods if they bother you. For those who don't know it, The Total War series has essentially two different games in it. The tactical battles, which are great and on nearly all the screenshots - Letting you be a commander of your army and lead your men to victory. And secondly a strategic campaign in which you manage your nation and try to take over the world(In a short time if you go for the game's objectives, but it's a game- your objective is having fun). The weak spot in all of this is the AI. The AI is, to put it lightly, comparable to an inbred dog with downs. While some parts such as the tactical battles don't show it as much and has the AI do decent at tactics, the diplomacy and campaign AI can't figure out what's going on and seems to exist purely as something to facilitate interesting tactical battles.But enough about the AI, it's still a good game that can show you the slow, interesting change from medieval warfare to guns and cannons, and lets you use it all in your battles to conquer the world. Along with this you will possibly end up exploring the new world, dealing with the mongols and crusading. In the end, you can be sure that plenty of things will happen to keep you interested and there will be plenty of places to conquer. Mechanics such as religion, your faction's family tree, and actually having to pay attention to your finances mean you will be busy with your empire's details without forcing you to micromanage it all. Though that is an option if you want toAll in all, it's pretty good. Decent graphics, good gameplay, and a big campaign to keep you busy. It's not the best Total War game out there, but it's trying its best!			"

												ok for people that saw my silly review about this game before, im gonna actually say why i like this game and not my blitzing recordpros:-great campaign with every faction being unique and religious wars like a jihad or a crusade-great events like the mongol invaision, the black death and the timurids that will put a hurt to you and maybe destroy you-multiplayer community stands really strong even if this game was made in 2006 (even if apollo drove out everyone from medieval 2 and makes them play third age and medieval kingdoms 1212ad)-like i said above, every faction is unique so that means that every faction has their own strategies, for example poland is more of a rush faction while spain is more of a missle faction and byz is more inf focused-A REAL expansion, not dlc whoring to make the game as it should feel like, oh did i also mentioned that this expansion adds 4 NEW EXPANSIONS? (americas, britannia, crusades, teutonic)-there is the ability (in expansions and mods) to make a hotseat. what a hotseat is, its like a multiplayer campaign but you can fill all the factions and play it with your friends (search more in videos at least)cons-its easy to exploit the ai and the game is kinda buggy when it comes to pathfinding (its still good tbh)-if you are a guy that likes only graphics then this is not the game for you (but i dont care about graphics)-i know that i said that the medieval 2 community is still big but it decreased recently (one of the reaons is because apollo left medieval 2 and plays only TA and medieval kingdoms and that forces them to play those mods to just send him replays)if i had an option i whould rate it a 10/10. its just the best total war with the best expansion. this is a MUST BUY TOTAL WAR			"

												TL:DRBest game ever. 9.95/10. Very good for strategy fans and those looking to get into strategy games. Fun!Long ReviewEasily my favourite and most played game of all time. Including my hours from before I had this amazing game on Steam I'd say I have 1000+, if not 2000+, hours. Perhaps even 3000+ hours. This is an amazing game.PROS
Graphics are nice considering how old this game is. Spend most of your time zoomed out anyway so it looks good.Campaigns fun. The AI are abysmal at times but it's nice to have a laugh every once in a while. Campagins usually play out differently each time although patterns do emerge. Change this by changing your playstyle.Seemingly limitless possiblities. Want to try and tackle the Papal States straight away? Go for it. Want to rebild the Roman Empire? Go for it. Want to be a noble highlander reclaiming the Holy Lands and build  Scottish Empire in the arid desert? Go for it.Battles are fun. Crushing enemies beneath your feet is fun. Creating one empire to rule them all is fun. Planning your next strike and best targets is fun. Mods can enhance you playtime by many more hundreds of hours. Every con has a solution or silver lining. DLC is great. Expands game time by even more! Adds interesting mechanics to mix things up. Music really enhances the atmosphere.CONS AI can be too easy to beat sometimes. Solution: Play multiplayer! Gun units seem to be a bit buggy and dont work 100% of the time. Seems to mostly be musketeers. Not really much of a problem. Just use other gun units. Diplomacy. AI don't make the best choices. Solution: The series is called  Total War  for a reason! Naval battle will be lacklustre for those who enjoy naval battles. You have to auto resolve but perhaps that is a good think since most of the naval battles in the Total War series aren't great. Units bug out on walls sometimes. Usually issuing the order again or telling the unit to walk instead of run, or vice-versa, fixes this.ConclusionThis is the best Total War game ever! Everything is fun! Gametime to Price ratio is through the roof! The only real problem is lack of multiplayer campaign. I would love to play campagin with my friends. There is hotseat but then you can't fight battles with and/or against your fellow players. Perhaps an HD remaster with tiny tweaks to diplomacy and unit balance and you will have the perfect game!Christendom will be awed by the game reviewed here today!Great games are like sweet nectar, come let us play this most rare and glorious game!Note: This review will be edited a lot when I find things to add and reword it to be more fluid. My comments will also probably be deleted and reposted slightly differently. They really need an edit comment option for people like myself! "

												So I decided to start as France because I LOVE heavy cavalry and I doubt anyone has done it so far.     I started my campaign by absorbing the nearby rebel settlements into my empire.  The first battle goes poorly, I only just barely win and only from capturing the center of the town, I am beginning to doubt if  France was the right choice.  The second battle, however, goes very well.  I use proper cavalry tactics and completely descimate the rebel settlement, adding it to my glorious French empire.  After that I begin dominating the map, settlement after settlement, battle after battle.  Finally, My empire is the largest, the strongest, the richest, the most advanced, and the most populated in the world.  I have also allied with the British, the Polish, and the Holy Roman Empire, with dreams of conquering the British Isles.     I am soon given that chance when I recruit a mercinary fleet of ships.  I get Military access from the foolish British and set my armies in key strategic locations.  The next turn, I execute order 66.  The British are taken off guard and I kill all but two of their generals, king included.  I then turn my eyes to their last territory, where their pretender king awaits.  My king's army marches forth to this English coward, and just when we have our siege equipment ready and our swords drawn, the other British general attacks us from the west.  Nevertheless, we have the advantage and as my my ballistas are aimed for their gate and my horses crush their western army and my troops storm their city and kill their king, but at a cost, my king is bravely killed as well.  Which is good, because we had been excommunicated from the church just prior and were finally let in at news that my ""heathen"" king had been killed.    Just as I make preperations to incorporate these accursed Islands into my empire I am betrayed.  As it turned out, HRE actually hated my Polish allies and decided to attack me as well.  I am enraged to see their sorry yellow and black hides besiege my forces in Metz.  I quickly show these traitors whose boss and wipe out their troops.  But then, their leader, alone, attacks some of my forces near Metz.  I am surprised he beat me with few casualties as he charged DIRECTLY INTO MY LINE OF SPEARS!  He then retreated directly into the stygnian depths of Germany where I could not reach him. No matter, revenge can wait till he's watched his country burn.  I begin hitting him, hard, and end up splitting their empire in half.  Unfortunately, In my viscious assault I am, again, excommunicated from the church.  Thankfully the pope dies and I am reconciled, and to top that, the new one is polish so HRE is then excommunicated.  Sadly the pope calls a crusade on Cairo, and if I don't send my leader, I'll be excommunicated.  So, I do what I must, and before too long, have a crusading army worthy of many gasps.     The crusade goes poorly, to put it mildly.  I end up, for no reason, having my men continuously desert to ""find another party that will be more on track to the destination"".  So I end up wasting thousands of florins on disloyal mercinaries who constantly desert me.  By the time I make it to Cairo, the crusade is over and I am lacking in any reasonable army.  So I start back to paris.  On the way there I reach Constantinopel and notice it is lacking in any good military, and just can't resist taking it from the Byzantines.  Back in Europe I have finally taken over the British Isles and was attacked by Spain, who happened to be allied with the HRE.  Now I am in a war on three fronts and have the number one military in the entire world.  And one more thing.  Word has reached me that the mongols have risen so now I seem doomed.     Nevertheless, I manage to take two spanish cities and most of Byzantium.  After that, all that happens are pointless bloody battles that leave thousands dead in their wake.  Finally, gunpowder is made, and France is pushed into a new golden age.  I conquer the Spaniards and the Moors, I take all of Germany and exicute their king, and I destroy the rest of the Byzantines.  It seems france will never be beaten.  Then, just as I attack Jerusalem (my victory region), The Mongols attack me and a hopeless battle is fought.  My troops fight like true men, and for every dead Frenchman, 5 more Mongols die.  I loose the battle and swore vengeance on the Mongols.     I start World War 1 with all of Europe facing against the mongols.  And after years of costly battles, me and my allies make it to their main capital city which, ironically, is Cairo.  We barely win the battle.  For years the world is at peace.  Then, the Timurids attack, and it all goes awry.  They take over the Papal states, and much of eastern Europe (including Byzantium).  My troops are barely able to defend what is left of France, and I do not know if any other European nations survived.  The Pope betray's me and takes Cairo to start a new eastern catholic civilization.END RESULT:-Europe and Asia are controlled by only three major nations (France, Timurids, and Papal States), all of which are constantly at each others throats.-America is where the capital of France lies, and is slowly being taken from the Aztecs.-There are unconfirmed rumors that Milan survived and currently owns part of south-east Asia.-I hope for luck and divine intervention as the Timurids are slowly closing in on the America's.-The world is plagued with inquisitors and pagans, all whom corrupt the lands and murder people.-No one's faith is seen as ""satisfying"" from the Pope's perspective, and crusades/jihads are constantly being called on me.                                                             Fin(P.S. GLORY TO FRANCE!!!!!)			"

												Decided to start a game a england. Easy peasy i thought. In a 200 years i was already in control of the British Isles,all of France and even lil Scily. I was also one of the most christian of all the christain kingdoms. I could've called a crusade on ANYONE i didn't like. All was good right. Then the Milanese attacked. See during my entire game these spaghetti eating ♥♥♥♥s would constantly antagonize me. Whenever they attacked i would smash through their puny armies and march right up to Milan itself, sometimes taking it and forcing them  to relocate to Venice or Genoa. I've killed more Doges then i could count. But i've never been able to completly rid myself of them. See for some reason that litteraly god only knows, the pope would demand i end my war with them whenever i was about to finish them off. So for about 50 or so years we played this game of mudering each other until the pope forced us, mostly just me, to stop. Eventually i just had enough. My kingdom was begining to fall and i could not handle to pay my way out of another war i could have won. The plague was ravaging its way across europe and i feared the french Nobility might have been planing to rebel. So when Milan attacked like they always did i played the game right up to where it always ended. With their remaing forces cowering behind the walls of milan or Venice as my galliant Generals prepared to storm the city and fly the banner of the three Lions from its walls. Like always the pope decided that i had my fun and i should apologize to milan like usual. But not this time, no this time i said ♥♥♥♥ you Pope and took milan, Killing their doge and destroying their entire army. Now you'd think this is where the story would end right? The good guys defying the odds and finally defeating their age old rival right? sadly this isn't the end nor will the end be so Romantic.See after taking Milan, the Pope excomunicated me for defying him. Which made me public enemy Number 1 to even my closets allies. On top of that the Milanese regrouped in venice and trapped my men in Milan. If they went to take venice then they would lose milan to a greater force but if they stayed in milan then the Milanese would have more the time to rebuild. I was prepared to counter this by sending more forces into italy. But right as my men begin to enter italy from southern france, i get invaded. See my age old ally and undisputed ruler of Iberia, Spain, Decides to launch a full scale invasion over the mountains. Destroying what little resistance remained.So here i stand. Ruler of a heretical empire that's barely holding together and being betrayed by its closest allies hoping to carve out part of it before it collapses like vulchers circling a dying animal. All becuase the Pope refused to let me have justice.10/10			"

												When the units obey your orders, Medieval II is an amazing spectacle and a fun game to play. Not only are thousands of hand-chosen soldiers fighting at your command, but cities rise and fall at your leisure based on war, diplomacy, sabotage, and assassination. This game isn't perfect, but it deserves far higher than an 8.6 average rating, so I'm throwing in a 10 to make up for the lack of enthusiasm.			"

												One of the very best games ever made. Some of the old, great games perhaps do not age very well, but a few are timeless simply because of their quality. No frills, no gimmicks, no set pieces, no cover systems or achievements - just gameplay and game design in it's purest, most endearing form. Medieval II is one of these games.The game, in typical Total War fashion, involves economy, politics and army management with the ultimate aim of meeting  certain victory conditions, which will vary for each faction. A world map acts as the main user interface of the campaign, but the majority of gameplay will happen in the series' trademark - the battles.In my opinion, this is the greatest game in the Total War franchise. Rome I had more varied unit rosters and was truly groundbreaking for it's time, but Medieval II is just Total War perfection. Hitting the ""sweet spot"" for complexity, political obstacles and size of the campaign map, the game has, whether by design or accident, remained the most (obssessively!) playable Total War to date. The difficulty levels of the campaign feel ""just right"", whether you are new and play on easy or normal, or want more of a challenge and pick legendary. This was the first Total War game I played, and increasing the difficulty felt organic and like a real progression.Everything just comes together in a way which will be evident if you have played any other Total War titles, but regardless of that fact, the campaign is the best experience Total War has to offer. Battles are at their best in the series, with a level of strategic depth which keeps a dedicated online battling community alive to this day, but with an accessibility and satisfaction which makes you want to learn. Winning a campaign, defending a castle against the odds and winning online battles are some of the most rewarding feelings I've ever felt in games. The battles here are Total War at it's best. Every unit has a purpose and a counter, and winning a battle feels truly tactical. Unit speeds feel perfect, and units engaging each other feels crisp, unlike the floaty cluster effect seen in later games in the series. Losing a battle will always be down to a tactical error which will have you wanting to learn and coming back for more. If they managed to break your infantry lines with a clever charge strategy, you will feel like you were outsmarted. There are no gimmicks.The atmopshere of the game is good - the medieval setting and campaign map match the visuals and the soundtrack well. Despite being an old, outdated game, there is a certain charm to the graphics, which makes it stand the test of time as opposed to Rome I, which has poor visuals to the point where it intrudes on the gameplay. Very few games have charming visuals which can stand the test of time, and this is one of them. To illustrate what I mean, others might include the Pokemon series and the Jedi Knight series. Whilst not the strongest point of the game, it does not, however, detract from the gameplay, which is the important part.The only one gripe I can think of is that the armored knights and cavalry might be too cliché and similar for some. A conquistador in full plate armor and an English Knight in full plate armor look similar, with only the heraldry and colours making them identifiable. Personally, however, I never minded this, but it is one issue people have when discussing why Rome I might be better - Rome I had very varied and visually distinct units.An extremely engrossing game, one of the best of all time, I can't hesitate to recommend this. While not as groundbreaking for it's time as Rome I, which is the darling of the series, this is the better, more refined and perfected title.			"

 Medieval 2 Total War- where do I start...? Medieval 2 Total War is the fourth game in  the Total War series. It is a combination of turn-based camping and real time battles. Medieval 2 TW is a great game for every fan of the medieval time period and for every fan of a good strategy game. The Grand camping is great fun as in every Total War game, but when it comes to real time battles, Medieval 2 stands out. Player can set his own custom battles, where he can choose variety of factions to play. Custom battles can be ground battles or sieges of villages, towns, castles, forts etc. I find custom battles really epic and fun to watch. Watching artillery breaking down walls and killing loads of men is just great fun.Another great thing in this game is multiplayer. You can play coop camping with your buddy or join/host a loby and play some epic battles/sieges with up to 8 players.With M2TW Kingdons, you get 4 new DLCs and they come with their own campings, factions and units. Every DLC brings a new time period so you can experience the whole Middle Age from Crusades to finding America. And now, drums please...... The MODS. Oh, yes... Good mods are what TW games are known for. There is a great modding community for this game. Mods like Westeros Total War, Elder Scrolls Total War, Third Age Total War etc. make a whole new game out of Medieval 2. My favourite mod is Third Age Total War which adds 2 new campings (Third Age Camping and The Fellowship Camping). This mod changes all the faction in the game with factions from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books. There are Orcs of Misty Mountain, Mordor, Gundabad, Gondor, Rohan, Elves, Dwarves... Every faction has it's own units (yes, there are orcs, trolls, even Sauron, Balrog and  other iconic characters from the Middle Earth) and every unit looks like it came from the LotR movies. A good number of these mods can be played online! MY CONCLUSION If you like medieval time period, if you like knights and epic battles, hell even if you just like Lord of the Rings, get this game (with Kingdoms DLC if you want to mod it!). You can get this game for 1-5 dollars on sites like ♥♥♥♥♥ and it is definitely worth it's full price! (not like some other Total War games, sadly).			"

												A much more ""modern"" version of Rome Total War. Only this time it takes place during the Medieval period.You run historical empires during this period as your object like all total war games is to rule over the land. Unlike in Rome: Total War where missions are everything and you have to complete these in order to ascend to the top. This loosen's those restraints and allows you to govern over your lands without the need to do an objective every five minutes. The new SPQR is the Roman Catholic Church. Pay your dues to the church within this game and the Pope will appericate you a lot and thereby will allow some things from you within good reason.The UI for both battle and strategy is a lot more better and a lot more direct than Rome:Total War. The game also provides another detailed tutorial for first timers so you won't have any headaches when your play hours on this game is done.If you want a more updated version of Rome: Total War then buy this today! I recommend it			"

												In my opinion, Medieval 2 is far more enjoyable than any Total War game that has come after it (out of the ones I have played, atleast: Empire, Napoleon, Shogun, and Rome 2). You get more of a classic sense immersion from this one. Taking a young lad to lead a meager peasant band to subjugate an independant city, having him gain experiance, a title, special traits and an army that contains hardened veterans aswell as mercenaries recruited from various campaigns all over the Meditarianian and beyond is simply pure fun. Units react more organically and tactics can truely overcome superior units, unlike some situations in newer titles. The mod scene really makes this game shine. Warhammer (Rage of the Dark Gods), Lord of the Rings (Third Age), or maybe just an enhanced Medieval experiance (Stainless Steel) add and increase tons more playability and enjoyment to an already very good game.

""Despite it's high age, Medieval II is propably the best single player Total War game to date.""What makes this game's campaigns the most enjoyable for me are the historic events that pop during the game. Events like the Mongol or Timurid Invasion, the invention of gun power and the introduction of guns and cannons in the late game or even the discovery of the Americas are what makes this game so unique among the other games of the series.Also, if you own the addon, Medieval II has the best total conversion mods of any Total War game to offer, some of which more than equal the base game in quality and depth.tl;dr It's great.

												For me, Medieval 2 was the second of the TW series. In many ways it had the same attractions as rome 1. It's a very subtle upgrade on Rome 1, and whilst using the same engine, it is an improvement on Rome 1 in many small ways. The advent of historical events, and the players ability to influence flavours the game in a rather pro-historical attitude. Once again campaign actions are mirrored by those on the battlefield, and the more complex and dynamic AI makes for an enticing potential challenge. Overall, I heavily recommend this game.			"

												This game is the best Total War game in existence. This is by far my favourite. Not only are the vanilla and expansion campaigns a lot of fun, but the almost infinite fantastic mods adds the replayability of this game a thousand fold. Pros- Campaign experience is awesome. Lots of depth. Plenty to do. Complex enough that its not difficult to learn, but not easy to master either. It's so easy to get immersed into your kingdom and care about your subjucts. History is your oyster. You become what you want. You can be a benevolent king who's people adore, or a bloodthirsty tyrant that rules with an iron fist, a bumbling general that doesn't inspire his men at all, or the greatest commander alive who even peasants will fight to their death on his command. - More campaign stuff. Cities are realistic in that people actually live there and can be murdered upon sacking the city or plague occurs. The buildings you construct will be present on the battle map. Manpower limitations and recruitment pools disable players from spamming 1 unit type. You have to fill your ranks with a variety of units or wait a very long time for your perfect army. Crusades and Jihads are heaps of fun.- Battle pacing is perfect. The units don't kill each other in a matter of seconds with a bunch of fancy kill animations. They slug it out and get bloody. Everything depends on tactics. You don't just win because you bring lots of elite units. You have to outsmart your opponent or else your quality units won't count for much. - Sieges. No Total War game has more epic sieges than this. Sending four thousand men to assault a citadel garrisoned by half that number will take you a long time to win and push your tactical skills to the limit. 3 layers of walls require you to constantly think about reserving your artillery or your rams. If you run out of ammo or your rams break or theres nobody left to pick up a ladder with 1 wall ring left to go - well you're screwed and you have to retreat. It's awesome. If you are forced to retreat and come back the next turn and they haven't repaired the walls it's all damaged in the exact same way you left it. - The sound track is the best out of any Total War game- MODS. Third age, Westeros, Call of Warhammer, Stainless Steel. Just to name a few. Cons- The AI is pretty stupid and passive. If you're new to the game you might have some difficulty at first but once you understand the AI thought pattern its very easy to outsmart even on the hardest difficulty.  - The game is full of exploits and bugs that were never patched out. Overall I give this game 93/100. Which is pretty good considering I gave Warhammer 80/100. I'll still be playing Medieval 2 long after everyone forgets about Warhammer in a year or so.  "

												Decided to play this game again started a campaign as Byzantuim. Start the game and head east taking a few cities off Turks. But then Venice attacks one of the main Byzantine cities Thessalonica and takes it. I turn my attention West towards Venice I retake the city and head West. I reach the west coast and rather than head north, I build a fleet and attack Sicily taking Naples and the island of Sicily itself. Then I head north. You can probably see where this is going. I launch a succesfull attack on Rome and march further north and take Bolonga. By this point my army is highley exprience (some have gold exprience). But then Bolonga and Rome rebel I launch a second attack on rome which is unsuccesful. Rome was the entire objective of the campaign to reclaim Rome for true Romans (not like the Holy 'Roman' Empire). My Veteran army in Bolonga attacks the HRE army but they are reinforced.HRE - 4100 TroopsByzantuim - 1050 TroopsThis should of been the end of my Italian campaign but the 4100 strong HRE army was actually 3 armies the first army was quickly defeated and then the second came. My horse archers softened the second army up but soon ran out of ammo then the lines of infantry smash into each other my left flank had hidden troops that attacked the left of the HRE army. The HRE'S right broke and then the enemy army got outflanked they fled and we were so close to victory. And then another army came, this time roughly equal to the amount of men I had left but the last army had feudal knights, superior to my infantry who were also Exhausted. I sent every last man in... and then the HRE army completely shattered. After the defeats of the first 2 armies the 3rd army simply broke and ran. On that day 2000 HRE troops were captured and 1500 were killed but the Byzantine army took heavy casualties too. Nearly 50% of there army were killed but regardless they had won.Yes this really happened. Oh yeah the game yeah like uhhhh 10/10 Ign.			"

Seriously after retrying Rome 2, getting frustrated, uninstalling, reinstalling this, it's amazingly stark in terms of gameplay just how much better a game 7 years older is. Battles are waaaay less infuriating (clicking a unit to move makes them start walking, not immediately running - I had no idea how much this bugged me until now), get a line of units to walk towards the enemy, when they make contact, they start fight IN BATTLE FORMATION - no individually clicking each units specific attack orders.

												Okay guys - brace yourselves! Long review incoming!*explosions*This game is exactly the sort of game I've been wanting. It sits in my library of Best Three Games: Medieval II: Total War, Age of Empires II (not the HD edition, that's a buggy mess), and Freedom Planet. :P (Grand Strategy, RTS, and.... platformer? What's this nutter up to! :P)It's a fantastic blend of turn-based strategy and real-time strategy.The whole Total War series is good, but Medieval II is extremely cheap. When on sale (and we all know how common those are!) you can get the game for $10 and the Kingdoms expansion for $5. Unlike later TW games, the Kingdoms expansion is a really really good DLC, adding FOUR WHOLE NEW CAMPIAGNS. Much better than one petty ""culture pack."" :PIf you don't know what Total War is, the screenshots & vidoes don't really do the game justice. Simply because there's SO MUCH to the game.Basically:On the campaign map, which in the main campaign goes from England to Russia to Egypt, you control things in a turn-based way. You make your moves, then another faction makes theirs, then another, etc. Because the game has about 20 factions for the Grand Campaign running it on a slow computer will be a bore. :PHowever, when you are attacked you don't fight in a turn-based way. Rather, you fight the battle in realtime. Whether you win or lose, your results are transferred to the main map. If you can't be bothered fighting (e.g. 10:1 odds or naval battles - in Med 2 you can't manually fight naval battles but it doesn't matter since navies are a side point), there is an autoresolve.There's spies, assassins, diplomats, merchants, wololos- er, priests which you can all use to further your objectives. Want to blitzkrieg? Open the gates with a spy. Can't be bothered killing a faction? Kill all their generals with assassins and rejoice in the Faction Destroyed notification. Send your Catholic Priests off to Egypt and laugh as either a) they cause Cairo to riot due to unrest or don't laugh because b) they all got assassinated.Don't fancy medieval times? Don't like the Pope? No problem - you can either assassinate the Pope and wait until you get gunpowder units for those, or you can browse the vast section of mods.Generally, mods are fairly easy to install and not too buggy.Medieval II also is the host of the most functional Lord of the Rings mod: Third Age Total War. It also has two subsets to that: Divide and Conquer, which stuffs the map full of factions / settlements, and Massive Overhaul Submod, which again expands... well, everything.And apparently there's ""Hyrule Total War,"" a mod, which is apparently Zelda. For some silly reason there's a Rome 1 mod for Med 2, despite the fact that Rome 1 is cheaper (get it on sale for $4 :P).And there's also the four expansion campaigns which you can play to your desire.Multiplayer is rather fun, though custom battles (in which you fight opponents out of the blue and the campaign map is utterly ignored) have the problem of no ranking - you can find yourself fighting battles with somebody who you can steamroll because his cavalry never charges, only walk, or find yourself fighting battles with somebody who can steamroll YOU. :PThere's also Play By Email games, which are for the campaign map. It's time-consuming (and difficult, partly 'cause timezones) to fight battles actually against the other human player - it is possible, just difficult - and hence most games just use autoresolve. Nevertheless, it's a fun feature which shouldn't be ignored.The great thing about it is that no matter what skill level you are, you will be able to play & enjoy the game. Complete newb? Set difficulty to Easy and you'll never be fully conquered if you're vaguely competent. Veteran? Put the difficulty up and laugh as you steamroll the AI that took you 300 turns to do when you started.Mind you, the difficulty settings are misleading. The same AI is used - all that happens is that as you go up the difficulty, they get combat bonuses, free money, and free public order. Normal tends to give the most balanced game (not because their Peasants are suddenly deadly, but because the AI leaves cities with even less garrison than usual).Furthermore, the more you play the more you'll realise the game has a surprising level of detail that isn't immediately visible. Generals (and Agents, but Generals are more noticeable) have a system that I heard described as ""RPG-like;"" fight the French 10 times with one general and voila, he gets the trait ""Hates the French:+2 command when fighting the French."" An assassin missed your general? He might get paranoid and thus decrease how likely he is to die from assassination. Keep on executing prisoners with one general? Enemies will rout & run away quicker. Leave a general in a city doing nothing? He might lose loyalty.The economic system is simply masterful. Creating farms? Population growth goes up. Building roads? Trade income goes up, not just for your settlement but for the settlements it's trading with. Building a Market in a city in the middle of nowhere? Surprise surprise, your trade income went up by +6 (most units cost 300-800). Got gold nearby? Watch your mining profit soar.Mind you, people who are new to the game can just build things that make them money and not bother about it. More experience players can see how much money it will make them and wonder if it's worth doing.This game isn't for everybody. People who like to run around with guns blazing, die, respawn, have 10s of shooting, die, respawn, etc etc etc will not enjoy this game. But as for me, it's the best thing since Windows XP came out.It is also the only game that I can play and feel tired - not physically tired, but mentally fatigued. You can play the game with little thought at all, but you'll progress slowly. The more attention you put in, the quicker your WORLD CONQUEST begins.Still not convinced? Go get Rome Total War for $4 next Steam sale, see if you like the way it plays, and if you want to spend $12 (on sale) for five whole campaigns (plus a bucketload of complete mods, not some petty statistics change) go for it.(Note: Later Total War games are extremely expensive in comparison, so go get Rome 1 & Med II)			"

												Short ReviewThis is a fun game. Much better than the first one. I love the middle ages units (we need a Fantasy Total War game). There are only two things I dislike about this game: 1. The Pope always intervenes so you cannot wipe anyone out. 2. The Mongols are way too tough.I still like the game. You can build up your cities, recruit troops and fight the battles on the battlefield where you can control all of the troops, and it is a cool empire building game. Europe, however, is getting really boring to me to fight in. Unlike Shogun the original Total War, it seems that the AI troops do not always run and hide when vastly outnumbered.Anyway, Medieval II is a little older but a really decent game.			"

												This is still my favorite Total War (as of 2017), but I really just wanted to add another shout-out to the ""Third Age"" total conversion mod. I just repurchased M2TW here on steam, and after following a few community threads to the Third Age mod, I felt compelled to encourage others to try out Third Age : Total War. It's an incredible work of art, and an amazing addition to the TW library of campaigns and settings. Anyone who enjoyed Warhammer at all and still enjoys Medieval 2 should make the Third Age total conversion mod a priority on their to-play list--if you aren't playing it already.			"

												I bought this game a year ago whilst it was on sale and I thought, ""hey, this might be a cute little strategy game to play on my down time!"" I was wrong...It took me a few weeks to learns how to play, which is fine by me because I like my games to have a little bit of depth to them and this was my first total war (which is bittersweet, because that's like being a virgin and having sex with a pornstar, only to have the rest of your experiences wanting). Anyways, I loaded up the game and started a new campaign as Scotland on very hard difficulty. I managed to conquer the British Isles in the name of Mel Gibson, which was good because my economy was sky rocketing. After a few years in game I had built up five full stacked armies of knights, armoured footmen, and archers. It was time to invade Normandy to liberate France from the HRE. I studied Allied WWII invasion plans for a while before I actually comitted to my attack. So I declared war on the factions inhabiting the Italian penisula and invaded mainland Europe on two fronts. Whilst I was fighting battle after battle, I got Russia to ally with me and attack the countries to the east of HRE. After a while, Russia and I completely obliterated the mainland. However, Russia wanted more land. A few turns later Russia declared war on me and we fought tooth and nail to secure our newly conquered lands. Russia was winning for a while, but then everything changed when the Mongols attack. We were both weak from fighting a mock WWII so the Mongols just steamrolled Russia. I tried to ally with the mighty Khan, but he refused me. In my weakened state, the factions of Iberia declared war on me and invaded the British Isles while the Mogols savaged my holdings in the mainland. Despite my best effort, Spain, Portugal, and the Mongols defeated my glorious empire. In the end, I failed my people, my God, and most importantly Mel Gibson.11/10 would fight a medieval WWII again.			"

												If you want the definitive Total War experience Medieval 2 is it. Unlike new Total War games, Medieval 2 is much more complex in its gameplay mechanics. From maintaining merchants and diplomats to army management. Medieval 2 feels more of an empire building simulator than newer games such as Rome 2.  Battles feel much heavier and units tend to react more realistically to commands. The sense of weight makes battle feel much more organic than Shogun 2, Rome 2 or even Fantasy Warhammer.  If you do choose to buy this game, be sure to install Stainless Steel as it provides a much more historical early and late game era campaign. You can check out some footage of it on my YouTube channel.			"

How could they turn on you?Trust me, if your ally makes peace with his enemy, he's about to attack you.If your ally has no room to expand, he's about to attack you.If you have been at peace for too long, he's about to attack you.If you are allied with Milan, Milan's about to attack you.10/10 would crush all my allies again.

												As with the entire Total War series, Medieval II is guaranteed to keep you entertained for weeks on end as you prepare to conquer the old continent. Once you get bored with it (which you won't because there are lots of factions to chose) you can also download awesome mods for it, like LoRd of the Rings themed factions.Pros:Real time massive battles where strategy and deployment makes a difference. Great graphics, that also run great on older PCs.Satisfying turn base campaign map where you level up settlements and put your generals and their troops on the move.Pretty good AI and diplomacy.You get to ♥♥♥♥ off the pope.Cons:Don't ♥♥♥♥ off the pope.Battles can get a little repetitive if you get good enough. Like when you end up using the same units all the time. But you can always change that and also try to play at higher difficulties.Losing sucks and the AI does seem to chose the worst times to break alliances with you  or like create full stack armies out of thin air. But such is life, you won't always know where your enemy is.			"

Medieval II: Total War (TRADE MARK) is pretty cool, I guess. If I had to pick my second favorite Total War game it would probably be this one. You play as ruler of a nation during the feudal era of Europe and parts of Western and Central Asia. As this ruler it is your job to spread the dominance of your culture and religion across the old world while trading, bartering, negotiating, and fighting with other nations who are more than likely just going to be more heads on the pikes at the end of your campaign. It is a time of great uncertainty. The powers of the world won't stop calling one another mean names and every now and then you have to send a priest out to deal with a heretic in what is essentially a bible fight. Like Rome, Shogun, Medieval I, and the games after it, Medieval II is split between a campaign map and a battle map that changes depending on what location on the campaign map the battle takes place in. You still have the usual things, you build your cities, do diplomacy, move your armies around on the map, command huge armies in battle, things like that. So lets talk about all the neat little things Medieval II adds to the formula.One, there's an obvious graphical improvement. Medieval II looks miles better than Rome, and adds other improvements such as a change in unit models depending on their weapon and armor levels. If your peasant spearmen are equipped with chainmail then the chainmail will actually show on their models instead of it just being implied to be there. Second, the addition of religion and mercantilism adds another level of roleplaying to your campaign as you attempt to convert peoples of other faith or do battle with other merchants for economic resources and business rights. Third, new animations and battle damage are added to your armies. So sometimes you get to see a cool little animation where a soldier will beat up an an enemy and call him mean names. There's also blood, while not as gory as later Total War games, your units will get drenched in blood the longer they fight, indicating how long that individual  soldier has before biting it. And fourth, the soundtrack is probably the best Total War soundtrack to date. My personal opinion, but my opinion is great. There have been also a few events added to the campaign mode. Things such as the Mongol invasion, the black plague, discovering the new world, Crusades, Jihads, the Pope excommunicating you because you're too radical and he's tired of your skateboard phase. etc. Wow, all these cool things! So what's wrong?A few things. First, the AI once again doesn't like to cooperate. They're ask for trade rights, map information, and an alliance one turn and then attack you the next. Broken armies of 50 or so people will gladly die to your thousands rather than end the war, and the Pope always seems to demand that you stop a war you're winning even though more than not you didn't start it. He's that kind of school principle. But should you play Medieval II: The one with the armies, not the one with the skeleton guy? When it comes to the mid 2000 Total War games I feel like it comes down to preference. Do you prefer antiquity to feudalism? Or do you like Knights over Legionarries and Hoplites? Either or you can't go wrong with Medieval II. The additions to campaign mode are welcomed and there's plenty of meat there if you treat the Total War games more like a roleplaying game than a strategy game. I have about as much time on the physical copy of this one as I do in Rome: total War. And if you want, you can still technically play as the Roman Empire in the form of the Byzantines. It's not really the same thing, but hey, they're there. Also, the modding scene is friggin astounding. Everything from gameplay tweaks to full out new games.Two that stand out to me are ""Thera: Legacy of The Great Torment"" and ""Third Age: Total War"", the latter being a Lord of the Rings total conversion of the Kingdoms expansion pack.Medieval II: Total War gets a big number out of a big number.Odontophobia is the fear of teeth.

												Whilst the graphics for this are slighlty outdated it has to be one of my favourite games of the series. The mechanics of the game feel fluid and very easy to grasp. Whether you have played the rest of the games in the series or this is where you want to start this game is fantastic. The mechanic to prevent you from recruiting armies of the best troops available and forces you to recruit a few lesser equipt units to bulk out your army.Overall the game for me would score 8/10, it loses points down to the outdated graphics and the factions having very similar units along with the lack of naval battles. It does gain points due to the recruitment system and the fact that it feels very fluid and immersive			"

												First ı played as holy roman empire and allied with everyone around me because ı was afraid that they would ♥♥♥♥ me up at the start. After taking all rebel castles ı realised ı was the only one with a good army . So being an hungarian ı didnt wanted to kill hungarians. Nordic people were too far and too weak to worth it and south was already allied with papal states ı wanted to keep my ♥♥♥♥ good with the old guy so he doesnt start crusades on me. I saw huge lands of france ı thought a worthy foe and ordered 4 armies (2 merc armies) to invade atleast 4 castles. at start ı had all the allies and france was weak with no allies which is good ı didnt even need any allies so france was keep loosing region.Soon it only left with one or 2 castles which ı was already SuperPower with 7 armies.As ı was getting ready to destroy france ı realised other nations wanted my ♥♥♥♥ and kept ruining my merchants ı was getting annoyed. soon as my army arrived to last castle of france old man of papal states told me to hold my horse ' U AİNT KİLLİNG NO FRENCH AİGHT OR IMMA KİCK YO OUT OF MY RELİGİON' he said ı was like fine then ı just wait for that mission to end while ı was waiting damn france took all my allies and made them against me which again papal states didnt let me kill them too ı wasnt loosing ground but it was ruining my trade you know. After realising that my first ally hungary tryed to kill my people and take my land ı lost my ♥♥♥♥. I was at war with everyone even with the egypt which ı had never seen them whole game. I attacked them all and killed more people then black death. İn the end ı was a heretic empire thats trying to negotiate with mongols and russians so ı can find their castles and destroy . it was really fun ı have to say and the multi is nice too specially playing with friends.

Medieval II - is still the #1 Total War game in the entire franchise.Stand-alone, it is the best balance of gameplay, game design and war + empire building that is core to what TW is all about.But with mods? This game is easily the only game in the TW franchise that you need to own if there is any question about it.Relive not only perfect European history with KGCM mod; but lord of the rings, game of thrones, the elder scrolls, roman periods, and more.This is the #1 most modded game in the franchise which tells you how dedicated the player community has also been to this title.

												Hello! Broke down and wrote a review on your favorite game! Even without a game, but in a series of games. I play them for a long time and very happy, I pass on all levels. This game is very addictive people like you went to her for an hour, and has already passed several centuries. So I bought the last series Total War, but unfortunately they are very demanding and that would play them, I need to update my computer. Behold, now is saving up money for his upgrade. :) I recommend!10 out of 10!			"

												If you love Risk on steroids this is the game for you. I've loved this game since it first came out and I've played the campaigns well over 100 times - you always get a different outcome to some degree which I like. There is something very satisfying about crushing your enemies!Only thing I don't get is the family succession - it's always random and it bothers me that some adopted nobody general has the same chances to be king as your bloodline. That I think was a fail on the game maker's part.			"

												The best game in the series so far, and probably forever judging from the path the series is taking (yeah, yeah, I know, Shogun 2 is great, but not as great as Medieval 2 in my opinion; and I won't even talk about Rome 2 or Attila...).I still play this game today, and I have played more of it than all the others combined; it's one of my favourite games of all time.Legend/10 !

												Best game in series in my eyes. Most moddable of the series. Loads of good mods out there, that either tweak this or that, or improve or expand this or that, not to mention a slew of total convesion mods that take the game to a different era or genre entirely. Just finished making a map pack with 15 new vanilla MP maps that draw locations off the campaign map, so only the host needs the files & anyone can join without downloading anything. I have it on steam now, but got the game on disc when it came out. A workshop on steam would be nice, but that's what www.twcenter.net is for. Highly recommended.			"

												Our last king restored Hungary to it's rightful place in the Christian church. We must not let it fall!My western border with The Holy Roman Empire is secured and christianty is almost fully restored, we must restore our eastern front! Many of our greatest builders were sent to build churches, chapels and Abbeys, we trained our greatest priests to become bishops and cleanse our eastern territory from the heretical thought. Our eastern border wasn't protected though, so we had to make alliances, Georgia came to us in request to trade, it was a perfect moment to make a diplomatic action and propose an alliance, gladly they accepted. We both had a common enemy of course, the heretics who call them selves ""Byzantines"".They are nothing but a dying empire, after we aided Georgia in their wars and the world was shown the true strengh of Mother Hungary, the Russian and Polish embassies embraced our relations and proposed an alliance. Of course we agreed, now that we have Georgia in the east, Kievan Rus' in the north east and Poland in the north, we can direct our forces to the west!The Holy Roman Empire is in constant war with our polish allies, but my advisor said that it's best to build up our economy. So we did, in a matter of years Hungary became the richest country in Europe and maybe in the whole world, soon we started buying cities from Poland and Kievan Rus', our borders grew and my kingdom strenghened. Our Polish friends were also getting stronger and our relations were better than ever. But Poland was too concerned with wars than with their own faith! The church has excomunicated them, and I had to declare war on my closest friend. I hasitated but I shudder to think that I could ever betray them...The church was unpleased with my actions, but I can't betray my own friend, I still think there is hope for him, I just need to meet him once more, have a drink and discuss his issues with the church. But alas I was too late, he has fallen in battle trying to defend his lands, his entire city butchered, women and children.And now I have to pay for my actions, I have been excomunicated. I am writing now as I'm waiting for the inevitable.Soon, a crusade will begin.			"

												The two perfect works of Creative Assembly = Rome and Medieval total war. Probably medieval total war has the most perfect tempo i have seen in turn based strategy games. The battle scenes, the horsemen, the catapults, the merchant and diplomat actions. It's just awesome. -The only con of this game is diplomacy is kind of too agressive. You might get betrayed by 5 nations in one turn The Pope would'nt even care. But oh?! HOW DARE YOU ATACKING THE HOLY EMPIRE AS THEY ARE PILLAGING YOUR LANDS! this kind of diplomacy i'm talking about. Execpt that. The game is perfect.			"

												Six massive armies of heavily upgraded Byzantine cavalry with five to eight star generals got destroyed by a single ten-star Hungarian general with twenty bodyguards, and then the Hungarian forced me to pay 3000 dollars to ransom out ten of my soldiers.11/10 would get destroyed by Hungarians again.In all seriousness, this is tied with Rome 1 as best Total War IMO. As an avid Rome 1 player, Medieval 2 took a while to get used to, with all of it's new features, but it is extremely fun once you get the hang of it. AI and graphics are not the best, but this game was made years ago(and who really cares about that anyways?) Highly recommended to fans of medieval warfare, Total War games, or just strategy games in general.			"

												Medieval II Total War is a good game, a fun game. But when put beside it's predecessors, it's also a very small game. I am not talking about size here, or even the scope of the game but more it's advancement over the previous installment. It's that same question you always have to ask yourself every time a franchise you enjoy comes out with a new installment.Should I get the new one or just replay the old one? In the case of Medieval II the answer is, you might as well go play another campaign in Rome.While Medieval by itself is a great game that promises hours of entertainment it doesn't really do anything that you couldn't already do in Rome. Most of the new features are minor in nature or simply cosmetic the lack of advancement is instantly noticeable when you realize that Medieval even managed to bring over a few bugs from Rome that were never quite fixed.For the newcomers to the series, Medieval II Total War is a mix between a real time strategy game and a turn based grand strategy game. The turn based aspect focuses mainly on empire management, improving your cities, raising and moving armies and conducting diplomacy with other factions. This area has traditionally been the weak spot of Total War games and Medieval makes no changes there. The system is clunky and bugged, the AI is completely worthless and the diplomacy might as well not have been included. Anything the grand strategy aspect of Total War tries to do has already been done a thousand times better in pretty much every other grand strategy game.But then again, you don't buy a Total War game for the cerebral strategy. You buy it for the guts and glory of the the real time battles where armies clash and legion perish all for the hope of victory and while the satisfaction you get from a successful maneuver is still present so is the complete lack of any sort of intelligence on the part of your opponents. As with all other Total War games, the AI is incapable of doing anything beyond the classic attack move with no concern for formation, flanking or skirmishing leading to almost every battle being a cakewalk unless you are terribly outnumbered.Graphically the series still impress although the uniformity with your units is beginning to show, the sounds work well enough that you are never taken out of the action and the soundtrack is acceptable most of the time.All in all Medieval II is a good and fun game that you can spend hundreds of hours in easily. Should you buy it still comes down to that same question however. If you have never played a Total War game I would always recommend you get the newest in the series. Medieval II is still an advancement over Rome, albeit a very minor one. If you already own Rome however then there is little new for you here and you would probably be better off saving your money for further down the line when another installment in the series comes along with a more profound leap in mechanics and technology.

												To start off, you should probably buy this game. I say probably, because $20 is a little pricey, but if its on sale for $10 or under get it! It is a great strategy game with two main modes. The campaign map is like an overall strategy game where you try to conquer the world, and the tactical battles are individual battles where you control an army. Although the graphics are outdated, the strategy in this game is priceless. Played a game as Portugal, and first killed Spain. Then fought and made peace with France, then went south and killed the Moors, then kept going east and killed sicily, kept going and am currently about to kill Egypt. I also conquered Rome from Sicily and returned it to the pope, who became my bestie for all of 2 turns until he died. The next pope hated me, but at the moment I am not excommunicated. And so,If you read it through this far you probably should  buy the game.Just do it.Update:I just discovered the plethora of mods for this game, and they are truely amazing. Mods like third age make it seem like an entirely new game, and add so much replayability to the game. Another great reason to get this game.			"

												Medieval II... Wooft. Got to be the best Total War game there is atm.- = Negatives+ = Positives+ Of course the graphics and mechanics are a little outdated (but are still better than Atilla.. Just sayin).+ Battles are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing! Unit Variety is not a problem here at all.+ Campaign is extremely detailed. Still has the best UI for a Campaign I think.+ Mods are amazing (Third age and Call of Warhammer)+ Factions all have interesting and different units from eachother.+ DLC has 3x more content than the original game (3 new campaign packs and units).+ Most interesting era (in my opinion).+ Most units are balanced.- Two handed glitch in Vanilla game. (Not in Expansions).+ Castles and settlements are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.- Cavalry (If you can use them well) seems slightly OP in some ways.- Lack of special abilities for units.+ UI is easy to get used too.- AI is extremely stupid if you don't turn the difficulty up.+ Familiar factions and units. Such as Scottish Highlanders and English Longbowmen ect.+ Gameplay seems extremely smooth compared to more recent TW games. Might just be me though.+ Great endgame challenges. Which you can find out for yourself XP.- Mods can be quite a challenge to install if you don't know what your doing. But there are good tutorials out there.- There are a few factions that are more powerful than others, but that is to be expected.. *cough cough* Venice.And there you go! Did this help? If it did be sure to like :)			"

												Medieval 2 Total War is a fantastic game its visually very nice it continues the great trend its predecessor set while bringing its own game mechanics which are enjoyable and well balanced. It has a very entertaining campaign that adds more historical events such as the Crusades and the Mongol Invasion. Personally in my opinion it shines best in the multiplayer realm though with intersting maps and good variation of tactics and faction styles. Truly it is one of the best Total War games and well worth what you pay for it			"

												Medieval 2 total war was released in 2006 and it still holds itself well. The graphics do not feel dated and the game mechanics are similar to other total war games, making it easy to get into. The singleplayer suffers due to the stupid A.I. but there is enough variety to keep you entertained and there are mods that improve the campaign game further.The greatest part of this game however is its dedicated community and its multiplayer experience. The multiplayer is still very much alive and kicking. Whether you are new to total war or experienced in similar games you will fing something for you. From siege battles, 1v1, team battles or free for alls, you can usually keep the multiplayer experience varied through a variety of game types, factions and rule sets.There is a host of youtube commentators that give this game the support and attention it deserves. It was a great investment when I got the game all those years ago, and is definitely worth a go, especially if you can pick it up on offer.			"

And still come back to it nowadays on steam.It has some great mods and mod potential.If you are a Tolkien fan theres Middle Earth Total War MOD which is pretty awesome.If you want to play vanilla tho it offers pretty good campaigns and the Kingdoms offer a lot more factions diveristy you could ask for... All that for a very low price. Really recomended on the total war Series.Overral Score 10/10			"

												Do I reccomend this game, hell yes I do. This to me is one of the greatest total wars ever made. I have invested so much time online and offline of steam and this is just a breath taking game. Sure the graphics are out dated but it really doesnt matter is so much fun.The battles are amazing. The Settlements are fun to besiege althought Medieval II settelments are really annoying at times to place units in but still fun. A large variety of factions to choose from to build an empire that you want. The Kingdoms expansion is incredable, I gives you four brand new campaigns to conquer with even more faction, and unit variety. And the best part are the mods. This games has incredable mods for it I have only played one but that one is enough. I absolutley reccomend thsi game its among my top 10 games ever. It is extrodinary for its time and still stands tall and proud.			"

												I must have played thousands of hours of the vanilla version of Medieval 2. Then I discovered the mods.A review of the game, as it is now for 20 Euro, is that it is still a great strategy game with awesome tactical battles. If you haven't played any Total War, then I would recommend to start with Medieval 2. There are newer games, but those are tweaked away from what I think are the best features in the Total War series. And yes, buy the collection so you get Kingdoms (4 new game modes that each feels like a proper expansion, compatibility with Third Age mod) for 3 Euro more.My only major complaint with Medieval 2 is the AI. The difficulty scaling is just how soon the AI will declare war on you. Even if you have a tiny neighbour that you've been allied with for hundreds of years and protected through dozens of war, it is only a matter of time before they will declare war on you. The tactical AI will form a solid battle line and try to flank you with cavalry. And do exactly that in nearly all situations.Longbowmen (and some other archers as well, can't remember which ones) are also way overpowered, since the most lethal thing known to (horse)man in this game are wooden stakes, and longbowmen can plant those in the deployment phase of a battle.

												For how old this game is it's still one of the best strategy games I've ever played. The game starts in the dark ages and progresses through the Renaissance. You take control of a faction (the Holy Roman Empire, Egypt, England, France to name a few) and run the trade, religion (including joining/launching Jihads and Crusades), family (via marrying into other  royal families or having worthy generals married into yours), exploration (once the technology is available you can lead your faction to settling the new world) and military. When battles occur you can choose to skip them or fight them in real time which is a blast. This game has so much in it and it is so immersive that it is definately worth playing even now.			"

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!     so yeah i'm sure by my title you can guess where i stand on my opinion of the game. Now before i begin i will say that i have played many games of this category. for instance there is nearly all the total war titles and europa univeralis 4, hearts of iron 3. So i am not unfamiliar with this (and for those who are you will find it is VERY easy to get into). Pretty much everything about this game is perfect i mean the gameplay when you command your troops in battle is so immersive and spotless it is hard to find a complaint. Not to mention this game is weirdly more advanced and realistic compared to later total war game, like empire total war and napoleon or even the newest rome 2. I mean you actually have to have your diplomats move and not just be lazy and click a button and open up the diplomatic menu. Not to mention the soldiers actually act like people! now if you haven't noticed the troops from shogun 2 and rome 2 DESPERATLEY need to take notes from this MASTERPIECE of a game. the troops in Medieval 2 move so fluently it is unreal, in rome 2 they feel like bricks with legs, shogun 2 (and empire and napoleon) are slightly better with this which adds to my earlier topic of how earlier games are better than the new ones. empire and napoleon makes more sense with how they soldiers move though because of the timeline, shogun 2 kinda does because it does have a couple gun regiments. but rome 2 i have no idea.And another thing is that Medieval 2 is not arcady like rome 2 and empire napoleon and shogun 2. in rome 2 there is a timer in the fortress in a siege so if you just have one dude step in that stupid circle you will win in 2min it is crazy, now i know there is one in Medieval 2 but considering it is in they WAY back of the fortress it is not even there. another thing is the maps are very different and unique and are just generally much better than what i've seen in rome 2. (by the way if you are wondering why i am comparing so much to rome 2 it is because it is the newest game of the total war series and this just goes to show that pretty graphics can only take you so far, because that is all rome 2 is to me) Also the gameplay in the battles in Medieval 2 are so much more stratigic and are just generally perfect in everyway possible, unlike rome 2. Now the whole point of the total war games is to have an easy political view game and a very complicated and stratigic battling system in between. THAT IS WHAT A TOTAL WAR GAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE. (which is why Medieval 2 is so amazing) in rome 2 the battling system is so horride and awful it makes me want to puke, and the diplomatic gameplay just.....i can't even describe my disgust with that, in Medieval 2 it is just so perfect and amazing that my only explanation for how good it is, is probably that a god crafted Medival 2. Now i could go on and on about how Medieval 2 is the best total war game i've played. Like the music is so amazing and inspiring and immersive. Medieval 2 also is SUPER IMMERSIVE AND PERFECT IN NEARLY EVERY WAY POSSIBLE! now i could talk for the rest of my life on how good this game is, but i am pretty sure that whoever read this long probably got the idea already, so yeah Medieval 2 is 10/10 in my book			"

 Even though Medieval 2: Total War was released in 2006 it still rocks with the best of today!The graphics are a touch out dated but the strategic game play is powerful fun when comanding a massive army about to seige a castle. You order to fire the catapults! You then witness flaming boulders slam into the castle gates and walls! The sound will cause you to turn up the volume!  Your next order is for the footmen to carry ladders to the castle walls and attack the archers! They yell as they run towards possible death and yet none show second thought. Just then the catapults have just destroyed the castle gates and your horsemen charge full speed and enter the castle. Sorry, lost my self in memories of M2:TW. This game is that good with no signs of fading! How do I know this? Well, I bumped into Medieval II - Total War Gaming Group (MTWGG) that plays regularly and will be happy to help you. They are great international people and an even better group leader named Dark Angel. So when you purchase M2:TW make sure you check them out.  Here is a link to their group page. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MTWGG Buy the game, join MTWGG and enjoy some of the best strategic gaming on Steam right now!  :)			"

												Once upon a time, I had carved out a worthy empire in northern Germany, and Scandanavia, and was steadily working up to a war againist the HRE, until they finally struck and began to attack. By then, I was having horrible money issues, due to poor upkeep, and an insane abundance of generals. I had an army far superior to the HRE's but they had immense numbers, I carved my way through atleast 3 armies before my own was reduced to less than a hundred and I was forced to retreat. But, with no cash to rebuild a defence I decided it was time to leave behind the dozen generals and the deadly enemy I had made for a much more peaceful living. My ally, Venice gladly traded Tripoli to me for all my cities. In no time, I was able to stablize myself with just 2 generals, all the rest died in a horrible accident with the English navy. However, I had no room to expand and was forced to battle Sicily. It was suprisingly easy after I had taken Tunis. But the Mongols had begun to capture every city they could. They wanted Tripoli too, so I easily gave it to them, their navies and armies scared me. But before I left, I renamed the city to Mongoliassholia. Now, in Tunis I built up my economy and made up enough money to get 3 Carracks to sail me to Sicily and Sardinia, which I easily conquered as the Sicilians somehow lost their entire forces defending Tunis. After much conquering, I had Corsica, Florence too, and was well on my way to finish off Sicily off east. When Portugal, and Milan decided I was in the way of their expansion. By then Germany, Egypt, and the Turks had been destroyed. Scotland reduced to Ireland, the Netherlands, and a city in the Baltics somehow. Portugal had made Spain and the Moors into vassals. Russia had been reduced to their original size, by the Timurids. The Mongols stretched out from Tripoli, to the Ukraine. Venice, once a power thanks to me had been too stretched out, and France, had managed to move all the way out to Poland, and Hungary, and were steadily taking out the rest of Venice in Europe, and eagerly awaiting to finish the ones off in Scandanavia. They wouldn't attack me though, we were in good standing. Now, as my eagar axemen, and sword-bearers are ready to invade Bologna, the Mongols come knocking again, and the max turns are reached. This is where I ended my game. Sandwiched between enemies. My allies, far gone. The moral of the story is use condoms, so your generals don't make 20 god damn children.			"

												Medieval 2: Total War is a highpoint of the Total War series. It is certainly the longest supported and one of the most highly modded of the Total War games. On a surface level it's an empire management game requiring economic management of cities and regions. On a secondary level it's a diplomacy game, requiring careful decision making regarding allies and opponents as well as currying favour with the powers that be i.e. the Papacy and thirdly it still blends in the faster paced action of the tactical battles that allows one to actively witness and control sieges and battle upon the open field. As an older game the graphics are poor but not terrible, due to the usually zoomed out perspective, that doesn't show up poor unit models. It's challenging and has only the barest introduction for new players, requiring learning through trial and error, (which is more effective), and has a UI that contains as little or as much detail as you like, depending on how far through the menus you progress, something newer games tend to try to oversimplify and thus lack detail. Medieval 2: TW is more than likely going to be around for a long time yet, with it's continuing active player base, and it is that more than any review online that speaks for the quality of this game.

												Medieval 2: Total War is the 4th game in the Total War series and was released in 2006. It shows it's age a little when standing next to the newer games in the series, but is still fun to play. Medieval 2 is set in the latter half of the middle ages, between 1080 and the 1500's. Medieval 2, only allows you to play as 5 Factions when you first start out. All of these factions were the historically powerful factions of the age. Defeating additional factions unlocks them for play up to 17 different playable factions in total through campaign mode.A mixture of real-time tactics and strategy, as well as turn-based gameplay, exploration and expansion, Medieval 2 is fun to play, but is starting to show it's age a little. I suppose we are getting spoiled in 2015 with games that have realistic looking characters; However, it is still fun and would be recommended to anyone who enjoys the Total War series.			"

The game is super fun, especially Grand Campaign and the British Isles DLC the only thing bad about the game is that every faction basically has the same type of units just different names and sometimes not even different names. In Rome there was a lot of diversity by every faction having totally different troops but not the case in Med 2. Sorry Med 2, this is why you are the 2nd best.			"

												After our victory over the English and the Danish, taking many miles of northern coastline, Scotland was settled as a new, prosperous kingdom. Many alliances, trade agreements, and marriages flourished. But the Pope called a crusade against Jerusalem, and I raised an army for the cause. My noble swordsmen clad in plate embarked for a long voyage through the Bay of Biscay, along the Iberian Coast, and then followed the North African coastline to take Cairo as a staging ground to move armies against Jerusalem. We were successful; my army took Cairo in the name of the Pope. I raised a new army and sent them northeast, deciding to take more land for the Pope. But, to my dismay, I saw that no other nations were joining the crusade. Complicating matters further, the Mongols joined the Turkish and Egyptian cause, and a three nation army destroyed my own in the field. Left with my original crusading army, in Cairo, we withstood one assault after the other. My fleet had returned home, evacuation wouldn't be here in time. After many assaults, my army broke through their coalition lines and we took Alexandira, watching Cairo fall back into enemy hands. There, we raised a fleet and sailed away from our enemies. But they pursed my fleet, and shadowed and raided us at every opportunity. Going back the original way would be too long. France had declared war, so I made the decision to invade southern France. We landed and razed the fortress to the ground. My army was thin, we wouldn't be able to hold it. We burned our ships and pushed north. We fought off raiding Frenchmen several times, and were forced to raze another fortress to the ground. Finally, my army of crusaders, diminished to less than fifteen men per unit, bloodied, muddied, exhuasted from years of combat, arrived in Caen, part of our continental territory. I put them on ships, and sent them home. Did that actually happen? Yes. Yes it did. This is the best, most complicated, challenging, and entertaining installment of the Total War series.			"

I could go on about the whole variety of units and how each faction has different specialities and playstyles depending on the type of units there best with.I have spent over 800 hours into this game and im not even bored yet due to the epic battles,battle music  and just the intensity of it all. This game was made in what 2005 soemthing like that and i still rate it THE BEST game to ever of come in existence with 0 games even coming close to being better than this one is.I would put this on the top of your wishlist and highley reccommend you should play this game "

												My favourite and most played of the Total War series, with probably closer to 400 hours, before I bought again on Steam.A stand out element is the music – I have been known to boot up into the main menu, just to savour the fantastic score, I believe entitled “Time And Again”, accompanied with the crashing of thunder and lightning, and watching the silhouetted troops march by.Part of the reason Medieval II (and Kingdoms) is my favourite, is likely because I just have not invested the time in the newer incarnations (the following 2 just didn’t grab me), but undoubtedly the combat style of the era is much more to my taste.All in all a really great game, with more than enough to keep you enjoying well beyond the purchase price. Fully recommended.			"

												After our victory over the English and the Danish, taking many miles of northern coastline, Scotland was settled as a new, prosperous kingdom. Many alliances, trade agreements, and marriages flourished. But the Pope called a crusade against Jerusalem, and I raised an army for the cause. My noble swordsmen clad in plate embarked for a long voyage through the Bay of Biscay, along the Iberian Coast, and then followed the North African coastline to take Cairo as a staging ground to move armies against Jerusalem. We were successful; my army took Cairo in the name of the Pope. I raised a new army and sent them northeast, deciding to take more land for the Pope. But, to my dismay, I saw that no other nations were joining the crusade. Complicating matters further, the Mongols joined the Turkish and Egyptian cause, and a three nation army destroyed my own in the field. Left with my original crusading army, in Cairo, we withstood one assault after the other. My fleet had returned home, evacuation wouldn't be here in time. After many assaults, my army broke through their coalition lines and we took Alexandira, watching Cairo fall back into enemy hands. There, we raised a fleet and sailed away from our enemies. But they pursed my fleet, and shadowed and raided us at every opportunity. Going back the original way would be too long. France had declared war, so I made the decision to invade southern France. We landed and razed the fortress to the ground. My army was thin, we wouldn't be able to hold it. We burned our ships and pushed north. We fought off raiding Frenchmen several times, and were forced to raze another fortress to the ground. Finally, my army of crusaders, diminished to less than fifteen men per unit, bloodied, muddied, exhuasted from years of combat, arrived in Caen, part of our continental territory. I put them on ships, and sent them home. Did that actually happen? Yes. Yes it did. This is the best, most complicated, challenging, and entertaining installment of the Total War series.			"

												I started the game for the first time as England because I am a noob. I invaded france and Scotland. The pope excomunicated me and called crusade upon me. Then I got butt ♥♥♥♥ed by the Holy Roman Empire.Huh. I wonder what it would be like it Remus started the Roman Empire rather than Romulus.We would instead be talking about the great army of Reme. The Reman empire. In school we would be reading The Rise and Fall of the Reman Empire.And I suppose I would be talking about how I invaded France and Scotland, got excommunicated, then got butt ♥♥♥♥ed by the Holy Reman Empire.

												M2TW is a fun cheap game, that will cause you to stay up much to late telling yourself ""just one more turn"". The game runs well on nearly any PC and its unbelivably well-priced for how entertaining and detailed it is. Now, I am sure someone could argue that there are better RTS games out currently, but considering the release date of this game and its price it is definitely worth the buy. I would say my favorite part of the game is how many variables and details are incorporated in the logistics involved in the campaign (such as financial, military, domestic, diplomatic, and geopolitical elements). Every time I play through a campaign I learn something different.Basically, if you want an addictive and engaging RTS to play, and you want to spend as little cash as possible I would absolutely get this game.

												This game will grab you by the chin hairs, and pull you in it! The diplomacy is terrific, the battles are beautiful, and the options are steep! It's like burning raiders to death with a flamethrower! Great stuff. The campaign is insanely fun, every battle you do will affect how others think of your kingdom, and it will all affect your general, prince, king, whoever is leading your men to victory. I myself prefer to slaughter everything, as it sends a message, and it turned a loving, nice prince into a cruel, hateful one! Brilliant! My king is a tyrant, and everybody who rebels meets the same fate as the armies which attempt to destroy my castle. What I am saying is, in this game you get to be a conquerer! Trust me on this, I know my charisma is only at 4, but my perceptation is at 8. You will adore this game. This game, is the shining turd of all other Total War games.			"

												Probably the greatest Total War game to ever be released. Shame it didn't get the advertising campaign like Rome: Total War did. Truly an underappreciated masterpiece. My biggest wish is that Creative Assembly can achieve this level of mastery once again. If you can withstand graphics from 2006, I highly suggest playing it. As you build your kingdom over the course of 400 years, don't forget to discover America, declare a Crusade/Jihad, assassinate the last 3 heirs of a family line to take over half of their kingdom, use your recently converted christian populace to stir up unrest and rebellion in the local muslim kingdom or vice versa, develop gunpowder, have one of your priests elected pope, get excommunicated, have your merchants systematically take advantage of another nation's trade resources, assassinate your own king, and watch as everything you worked for crumbles when the Black Death hits. This game had it all.			"

												My favorite campaign in this game so far has been my campaign as Hungary. At around my fifth turn i declare war against the byzantines and subsequently wreck them. then the Holy Roman Empire, which btw was not holy, roman, or and empire, declares war against me. I succeed in repelling them from my capitol, and take a few of their cities before they call for peace. Then venice brings three full banner armies smack dab in the middle of my country. I amass a small force of horse archers to distract one of the armies. I camp a steep hill and manage to win the battle. Confused at my victory, i conjoin the remaining horse archers with my main army, and decimate the venetians. after that i declare total war against all other countries, and eventually achieve victory.

The game runs really smooth and I have a 4 year old MacBook Pro so no issues there at all, even on huge battles.The main issue is the ONLINE. What's going on? I can't connect with hardly anybody? I've only found one other person to play with and they're sharing my annoyance. Not sure if this is a version issue or a deeper problem but I really hope it gets fixed, only reason why I bought it again!--------EDIT--------Only Macs can play with Macs, so send me a friend request if you're looking for a few good games!

												Even though I think Rome Total War is the best in the franchise Medieval II Total War is my personal favorite. Despite it's old age this game has an outstanding unit variety, beautiful graphics which still hold up, a huge campaign map with a great variety of factions each with different enemies to face, different problems to solve and unique warfare and units to fight with. I finished the long campaign with all the factions at least once so I'm pretty sure I put around 1000-1500 hours into this game. 10/10 this game is glorious and epic, it's on the top of my all time top ten list.

												Medieval 2 is the first game in the Total War series that I have purchased, but after watching many gameplay videos on Youtube and various other sites, I had very high expectations for the game. Within less than an hour, all of my expectations were met. Medieval 2 has a fairly straight forward learning curve, and is very forgiving to those who are new to the game. With both skirmishes and a grand campaign, there is plenty to do, with many different factions to choose from, each with their own unique units and specialties. With a fantastic engine and good graphics, the game feels very realistic. The campaign is very deep, with many different agents and battles, making you come up with new strategy's every time you play. Beating the campaign unlocks the rest of the factions to play as, with you only starting with five. Overall I would rate this game as an 8/10, as there are some minor bugs.			"

												This is one of my favorite Total War games. It's not perfect . But , I actually like it better than , say , Total War Rome 2 . Rome 2 just feels weird . Hard to explain. TW Shogun 2 is also outstanding! As well as the original Rome Total War. Excellent. Again , none of them perfect. That's kind of a huge problem in gaming. Always adding new features and bells and whistles instead of refining something that was already great.			"

												This is the only review I've ever written for a game on Steam. After playing Medieval 2, Rome, Empire, and Rome 2, I can safely say that Medieval is still my favorite in the series. Yes, the later iterations ARE prettier. This game was released in 2006 after all. However, in my opinion, you can't beat the game engine they used. The Warscape engine that is utilized by the newer games (empire onwards) has taken a loooooong time to reach the same level of melee combat satisfaction that I got from M2. Sure, there are no fancy one v one animations. BUT, those animations also wrecked havoc with how many battles played out. I don't think I ever saw two soldiers gang up on one soldier in any game other than M2 and Rome 1. Battles are played out more by training stats, upgrades, and tactics vs. a boat ton of special abilities and badas* animations. I know there are plenty of people who won't agree, but it's just my experience. The biggest reason why I always come back to this game is the modding community. I had the game running on a virtual version of windows on my mac (years before the mac version was released) JUST so I could play Third Age Total War. Not to mention all the unit mods, engine and animation tweaks, etc. This is still probably the most mod friendy total war game out there. I spent dozens of hours over the last 8-9 years compiling units and tweaks to get my game just right, enduring hundreds of coding errors and game re-installs. Little by little (and somehow without taking over my life) Medieval 2 became a near-perfect game. And this is a guy with little to no mod creation or coding experience whatsoever. All in all, it's a wonderful game that won't be surpassed until they potentialy do a new Total War in the Medieval setting. It's perfectly fine without mods, but if you're like me and discovered just how awesome the modding community is, it's the best Total War game to mod in my opinion.			"

I know I am!  There are many games that allow you to wield a sword or axe or bow, but, really, why do that when you can wield thousands of them?  The beauty of Medieval II, like the rest of the Total War series, is that it does an out-standing job of capturing the tactical nuances of combat from pre-modern eras, as well as doing the strategic piece pretty well also, insofar as you can manage your cities in a variety of different ways as well as control agents.  This is definitely a game for those that like to think and who like a game that rewards them for thinking.  MTW2, like the rest of the TW series, has diplomacy, agents, merchants, assassins, and priests, and captures the dimensions that these bring to the strategy.  However, these elements, like all others, are there, ultimately, as an element related to combat, which is where this series shines.  It is called Total War, after all, not Total Diplomacy, or Total Economic and Cultural dominance.  Additionally, the game events throw at you some unique challenges of the period which really do quite a lot to keep the challenge and pressure on even as your empire becomes more and more mighty.  For the period, the graphics are incredible, and like other TW games, it's a lot of fun to just zoom in and watch your units work.  All in all, this series is unique and indispensible to the PC gaming world.			"

I used to play this game all the time back in the day, truly one of the best games i have played. I love this game. Thats why I was shocked to find this game with the expansion sold for $1 on humble bundle, with shogun 1 included and some other random crap. That must be the bargain of century. So yeah, I recommend. Its worth of thousands and thousands of hours, especially when there is quite a selection of mods on internet. Only cons I can give is the stupidy of the AI, which has been curse in every TW game. But despite that, its a fantastic video game.			"

The battles are great, where you can confront your enemies in open fields, or assault (or defend) towns and cities. You can also choose random battles at the menu for a quick skirmish battle. The graphics and gameplay are superb and it always leaves you coming back for more. Oh and if you play as England, you can create Sherwood archers (Robin Hood XD) 94%			"

												The successor to the classic Rome: Total War, Medieval II: Total War is a fun game that introduces new concepts and deals with a period of time from shortly after the Norman Conquest of England to the Age of Discovery. Among other events that will be affecting you in this time period are the Mongols showing up, gunpowder being introduced, the Black Death arriving and killing most of your population (don't worry it does the same to everybody), the Timurids following their Mongol ancestors, and then the beginning of the Age of Discovery. Castles and Cities develop in two separate ways, and produce different units.If playing a Catholic nation, you have to deal with the Pope. He can make or break your nation, so keep an eye on your approval rating with him. After a victory, most of the factions are then unlocked. They are also unlocked individually if you happen to be the one to land the killing blow.Side note: If you do unlock all the nations, three are the Moors, Egypt, and the Turks. Do take care of your volume at that time, because when you click a unit, move them, or attack with them, they do have a slight vocalization. Which at times could make people nervous (about killing infidels and the like). Some who hear you play may also get a bit nervous when you play the Holy Roman Empire (or the First Reich).			"

												I have played every total war there is ! Had this game on gamefly download, why the hours show so low. I played the crap out of this one! In my book, one of the best verison of total war! This is the grand campaign, and fixs a lot of , if not all the things that made the shogun and medival one verions such a pain! Medival 2 gives you one of the most diverse unit combat systems, out of all the total wars and doesnt limit army size and expansion by random rebels and lack of viable ecomony opitons,and omg............ No Reapers! Thank you SEGA =) Not to say the other totals wars are bad. Just that this is the most polished verison, of the old total wars. Before they try to really force  you more into commanding from the front in battles. Rather than playing from the map! Crusades, Jihads, Popes, Reglions, Marriages, Family ties, Death, all play a part in this dynamic point in histroy, in this game!Cant Recommend Enough 10/10 in my book!!!!!!!			"

-Quick Review-Medieval II: Total War is a Medieval strategy game developed by The Creative Assembly and released 2006. Medieval II: Total War is full of country-micromanaging with strong emphasis on historical context, strategies, and battle planning.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There is a Campaign where the player takes on the role of the selected nation, and develops said nation militarily and economically. The story is generally trying to follow historically accurate events, foes, allies, and important key leaders.

Gameplay: There are two game modes in Medieval II: Total war (or in this genre of Strategy game in general): Battle Mode, when it's opposing armies clashing against each other. The other mode requiring just as much skill as battle strategy (probably requiring more) is World Mode, where you navigate the map, edit city construction, politics, religion,  army movement, and much more.There's a lot to learn going into Medieval II: Total War, if you haven't played any of the previous franchise games. (Which I hadn't; this was my personal first Total War game) The game starts out with a tutorial campaign explaining basic combat concepts to battle warfare and gives the player a rudimentary introduction to camera movement, and unit controls. While the tutorial is effective at helping you learn, there is far more information to learn about the franchise inner workings, and for that: your best friend is the in game advisers (I like to think of them as my F1 key).

Achievements: There are no steam achievements for Medieval II: Total War. There are historical battles that you can try your hand at, and in my opinion winning a historical battle that is usually lost, is a huge achievement.Price: Medieval II: Total war is priced at $19.99, most strategy games eat up time like it's nobodies business, I personally like to spend an hour for every dollar I spend and Medieval II: Total War will do just that, and then some.(Personal note: I do feel the need to thank the person who bought Medieval II: Total war for me as a gift many years ago. Thanks Golag, maybe someday I'll finally beat you in it.)Conclusion: Story: Emphasis on Historical facts and events (Very cool). Gameplay: Difficult to learn if you haven't played any other Total War games. Achievements: None, however there is no lack in difficulty. Price: Fair, almost all strategy games are worth their weight in game hours played.I recommend this game to Gamers who enjoy either History and/or strategy games. Generally it takes a fair amount of time to learn how a strategy game works, after you learn the mechanics then the game goes faster and it's very easy to get sucked into it.

												OH BOY this is really gonna be hard since i've never actually run into a difficult to play Total War game. Medieval II: Total War is a great game both for its setting, factions, and great campaign elements that really drive the game. The only problem I have with this game is its incredibly wonky camera (the worst of any Total War game i've played). Its so difficult to do battles in the campaign I resort to autoresolving most of the time. This isn't game breaking but it definitely keeps me from playing the battles all too often. Thats just a little something that bothers me but don't let it keep you from getting the game sicne it truly is another great game to a great series.			"

												Medieval II: Total War Positives:+ Nice music soundtrack which fits the Medieval theme of the game.+ Great unit variety, with swordsmen, spearmen, archers, cavalry and siege engines like trebuchets and catapults available to use.+ Many buildings to construct in your towns or castles, such as farms, roads, churches, leather tanneries and so on, each providing different benefits to your kingdom. + Dated graphics but they are still acceptable. Units like templar knights are quite colourful.+ A really cool religious system. Catholic countries in Europe have a reputation among the Pope which can be improved through completing religious missions or building churches. The higher your reputation the more sway you have with the holy leader, so you can order crusades in Muslim lands for honour and glory. If you play as an Islamic faction, you can order jihads lol.+ Decent map size extending across Europe and the Middle East.+ Expansion packs are huge and offer even more gameplay. + Command thousands of troops on screen at once in epic battles.+ Nice mix of agents on the campaign map, each with different purposes. Priests can convert regions to your religion and denounce witches or heretics, but if they are unsuccessful, could turn to a life of heresy themselves. Assassins are another key unit, skilled in the art of killing enemy generals or family members. Then there's merchants, which can capitalise on trade goods across the world map and send the profits back to your kingdom, but foreign merchants may try to drive you out of business! Diplomats are fairly self explanatory and royal princesses can visit other kingdoms to find a husband, while also acting as a diplomat too. + Hundreds of hours of gameplay here.Negatives:- Unit animations on the battlefield aren't very good. They're difficult to see and not that interesting. Later installments of the Total War series improved this. - Diplomacy is virtually useless, allies are unreliable and will attack for literally no reason, your relationship with them does not impact the likelihood of whether they will attack you. This is a major problem with the game, mods don't seem to fix anything (I've tried multiple ones.) - This game has constant warfare due to the broken diplomacy system. You never do get a break from conquering other kingdoms. Anyone who has played a total war game before knows that it can be quite overwhelming, tiresome and boring fighting turn after turn. It's nice to build your empire in peace sometimes. You don't really get that opportunity in Medieval II: Total War.- Overpowered Mongol hordes that appear during the late-game can be very irritating. For some unknown reason, Creative Assembly (the developers) like to throw a curve ball at the players in almost every single total war title they release. Total War: Shogun 2 had realm divide, where every Japanese faction declared war on you after you became too powerful, Total War: Rome II had civil wars, where massive armies spawn in your territory to take over. Medieval II: Total War has....the Mongols. All I can say is good luck and be prepared for when they arrive.Overall Score: 8/10Even though Medieval II: Total War is an old game which struggles with diplomacy and realism, it has a lot of fun features and micro-management which the more modern total war games seem to neglect. The use of priests to remove witches and heretics, the inquisition trialling your family's characters for blasphemy, the crusades, merchants who fight over resources  - this is all good, interesting gameplay on top of the real time battles. It's an excellent if not exhausting game, due to the AI's constant affinity for wanting to attack you.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. The tactics and strategy are extremely simple, making it less difficult. Some factions are obviously ridiculously powerful with more starting regions, better units and technology, but it is still an absolutely amazing game.

												  So this was my first Total war game. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy the RTS genre of games. It is a perfect blend of Turn based strategy and risk style of game in the grand campaign. But with the cool feature where you command Thousands of troops and you decide the outcome of each battle. The tricky bit for me to learn was the economy and how trade works and how to manage it the best, but with a little patience and a bit of cunning even you can slaughter the helpless annoying pope who excomunnicates you when you pet a kitten that is homeless. My favorite nation was the Holy Roman Empire (one of the five startering nations to pick from) I suggest new players play as ether as England or France they are the simplest nations. To start with, KEEP in mind every little action you do as a christian country will  affect the pope. So ether slaughter the old guy or give him boxes and boxes of chocolates and stay away from his anger. This is my first review I hope it was a decent one.			"

												After putting several thousand hours of time in to retail disc copy of M2TW, and having played all the other TW games, this is the best of the TW series when modded with Third age or Stainless Steel (available here http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?556-Kingdoms-Hosted-Modifications ).  Many of the other mods available for M2 are really good warhammer, EB2, Last Kingdom are worth trying out. (admittedly Shogun 2 is the best vanilla TW game)M2 has weight to its combat, that is lacking in the more frantic, less unit based style of R2 and Attila.  M2 has family tree integrated into the dynamics kingdom management, which is much reduced in later TW games, in M2 I care about family and generals in a way that I never do in subsequent.  With Third age mod the graphics are pretty close to as good as you'll get in later TW games (I run a Titan card so max out all settings in all TW games).M2 demonstrates why modding makes PC gaming the master race.

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who has been a fan of the Total war games, strategy games, or even has a interest in the Medieval times. Having played over 100 hours and only completing one faction out of 17 playable factions for campaign.Even if you don't want to start a campaign they have custom battles that you can make the rules for or even historical battle in which you reenact famous battles fought during this time period. There is so much replayability and each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses such as England has really good longbowmen but lack in good cavalry compaired to other factions. So if you are looking for a great strategy game that will keep you busy for multiple hours at a time and are intrested in Medieval  history then Medieval 2 Total war is the game for you!			"

												Even 9 years later, Medieval II Total War is still the best strategy game out there.  A huge amount of different factions and hundreds of different units means that each faction will have their own battlefield strategy.  On top of that, little details like the weather and elevation can come into play, not to mention how tired your own units are.  Despite all that complexity, the user interface is very simple and straightforward-even a novice can master the game's mechanics in as little as an hour of gameplay.  And if you somehow manage to exhaust the main campaign, the modding world has kept this game very much alive, with new mods always in the pipeline.			"

Higher difficulty levels can actually cause a little problem, however, for a true strategist this isn't impossible to pass obstacle, actually it's quite opposite, it's even greater joy in the destruction of nations that was constantly bothering us.

												Ignore the low play time... hundreds of hours have been amassed on a retail copy.Medieval II is, quite simply, one of the finest games I have ever played. It's the game that got me back into strategy games after a long hiatus, and that introduced me to what is now one of my favorite game series ever.But will you like it?Well, let's start from the beginning.Medieval II is a combination turn-based and real-time tactics strategy game that takes place in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East during the Middle Ages. You can play as one of 17 different factions in the campaign mode (plus four others in skirmishes) that have a wide variety of playing styles, strengths, and weaknesses. As 450 years go by, the Old World is thrown into chaos- or Total War, as the narrator would say- as it endures Crusades and Jihads, rebellion and betrayal, infighting among the Christian nations, two monstrous hordes from the East, and that terrible calamity known as the Black Death, all while the slow wheel of time turns and technology continues to advance from the simple spear to the crossbow to the terrible might of gunpowder. The Kingdoms expansion essentially adds four entirely new games, with campaigns in more localized areas of the normal TW map with over a dozen new factions to play from, in scenarios that all present very different challenges.You will spend half of your time on the grand campaign map, a sort of political overworld where you manage the large affairs of your empire and move about your units. Here is where alliances are made and broken, provinces are developed, units are recruited, money is managed, and the dark tasks of espionage and assassination are undertaken. While a battle might change the course of a war, this is where you make sure that you have every chance of winning it in the first place.But most people play Total War for the battles. With the capacity to have thousands of units on the field at any given time, they're as much spectacle as strategy, as the ordered chaos of the battlefield threatens to overwhelm even the greatest captains. With a rich unit roster and a wide array of special abilities, your armies will be versatile and able to employ any number of tactics, from slowly whittling enemy numbers down with a stream of arrow fire to forming a defensive circle to protect your captain to employing a devastating hammer and anvil strike with your cavalry to launching diseased cow carcasses at their generals. Morale, terrain, weather, and energy levels all play important roles in how well your soldiers will be able to fight, and how well you will be able to govern the events of the battle.While there are some common strategies that can be undertaken for any nation or situation, no two campaigns or battles are the same, as the game can and will throw out surprises for you that you'll have to think quickly about to overcome. You may think you're doing well as France, fighting off England and preparing to make an invasion of the isles, when suddenly those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Portugal declare war on you and blockade all of your provinces, forcing you to stretch yourself out along two fronts. And while you may be able to overcome this obstacle, His Holiness the Pope probably won't take kindly to your conquests against your Catholic brethren, and may excommunicate you. All eventualities need to be prepared for in Total War if you want to survive.While this game is nearly a decade old, it still has a sizable and dedicated community of players to turn to if you want to fight a battle, try out a mod, or just get some friendly advice on how to deal with the Timurids. And as one of the easiest TW games to modify, it also has one of the best mod communities you'll be able to find, with an active base of players uploading and supporting their mods to this day. I highly recommend Stainless Steel, an expanded version of the base game with more provinces, factions, and units, and better AI, and also Third Age, a total conversion mod for Lord of the Rings that in my humble opinion is arguably the best TW game ever created, despite being a mod. If those two don't suit you, I'm sure you can find others that will.As for performance, the game still runs fine almost a decade after release, and still looks great. I can start a battle with 5,000 troops on the field and have little to no lag on my less than stellar computer. The score is also one of the finest I've had the pleasure of listening to in any game, and fits it very well.So, what are you waiting for? Go get the game! Europe won't conquer itself!			"

There is a huge variety of factions and each have their own unique units to choose from. A fantastic campaign map which covers the Holy lands, Northern Africa, Europe and also America(which you discover later in the game).The only bad thing is that the graphics arent the best and i suppose that is because the game did come out in 2006.

												Pretty much like Civilization 4/5, only instead of some goofy animation of one dude/mechanical killing another, you get taken down to a map and engage in RTS action. You can compose armies of many unit types of the time period, and each one has an information card telling you about that unit and a description of their historical use. You can play as 5-ish factions initially, though you can unlock more.Just like Civ4/5, while on the overmap you can upgrade cities/castles and engage in trade/sabotage/war/diplomacy with other nations, only you can't build new cities, only take over others, though you can repurpose them to Towns(Money Makers) or make them into a Castle(Troop Maker), though both can make money or troops, their respective ones do it better.For those who have played Rome: Total War, Medieval is extremely similar, except during a different time period. There are improvements, such as improvements and supporting modern resolutions without mods.Speaking of mods. there are two very good ones, called ""The Elder Scrolls: Total War"", which let's you play in the Elder Scrolls world with all their empires and factions. And also ""The Third Age: Total War"", which let's you play in The Lord of the Rings world, in GREAT detail, and is rated one of the best mods for Medieval II: Total War, and is currently(March 5th, 2015) ranked #1 on ModDB.I greatly recommend this to any Total War or RTS fan.

												played this game for years and decided to purchase it again now. great game!playing on very hard/very hard on the original game is not really that hard, but in kingdoms it was really good.one thing that i hate thoe: if the enemy besieging your settlement you can sneak a cavalry unit behind them then attack from there and they will do nothing. also happends when in any other battle.9/10 because if i give 10/10 how will they get better?

												How to play as England 1. Pick England  2. Fight the dirty French 3. Fight the dirty Romans  4. Fight the dirty Danish  5. Forget about economy, welfare and happiness of your kingdom 6. Buy out the Spaniards and the Vatican because they will sell out  7. Do NOT forget to forget about economy, welfare and happiness of your kingdom 8. Fight the Roaches  9. Fight the smelly Egyptians  10. At this point you will have so many rebellions and your armies will be so weak because of the massive territory that you will win the game and be proclaimed ""THE ALMIGHTY, SHINY, BRAVE, ROMAN CONQUERING, FRENCH CONQUERING, DANISH CONQUERING, ROACH BEAT TING KING OF THE WORLD!""

												Im new to total war i have only had this game for about 4 weeks and i have few problems with the game.  I love this game, but the one thing that ruins the game is the stupid AI, i can win seige battles outnumberd 3 to 1 because the AI charges in one choke point, and the  AI don't leave big garrisons of troops to defend their citys, even their capitals. the combat is perfect and realistic, battles are sluggish, and they don't end as fast as in other total wars. some factions are better then others like France and England, some are mediocre like poland, which is not a really popular faction or the paple states. campaign is fun and somewhat difficult,but again the AI ruins it. the time period itself makes the  best expeirence so far bringing me right into the world, you get to live the life of a medieval knight, or a king leading his army into battle as you take citys, and defend you're own . i give this game a 8.5/10			"

												Another game from the Total War game series and another hours spent conquering the map. This time we have the opportunity to dominate medieval europe and the surrounding area. Higher difficulty levels can actually cause a little problem, however, for a true strategist this isn't impossible to pass obstacle, actually it's quite opposite, it's even greater joy in the destruction of nations that was constantly bothering us. Game worth it's money, from time to time there are great discounts on Total War game series, so are You ready to set new orders in medieval Europe?			"

												Ignore the low play time... hundreds of hours have been amassed on a retail copy.Medieval II is, quite simply, one of the finest games I have ever played. It's the game that got me back into strategy games after a long hiatus, and that introduced me to what is now one of my favorite game series ever.But will you like it?Well, let's start from the beginning.Medieval II is a combination turn-based and real-time tactics strategy game that takes place in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East during the Middle Ages. You can play as one of 17 different factions in the campaign mode (plus four others in skirmishes) that have a wide variety of playing styles, strengths, and weaknesses. As 450 years go by, the Old World is thrown into chaos- or Total War, as the narrator would say- as it endures Crusades and Jihads, rebellion and betrayal, infighting among the Christian nations, two monstrous hordes from the East, and that terrible calamity known as the Black Death, all while the slow wheel of time turns and technology continues to advance from the simple spear to the crossbow to the terrible might of gunpowder. The Kingdoms expansion essentially adds four entirely new games, with campaigns in more localized areas of the normal TW map with over a dozen new factions to play from, in scenarios that all present very different challenges.You will spend half of your time on the grand campaign map, a sort of political overworld where you manage the large affairs of your empire and move about your units. Here is where alliances are made and broken, provinces are developed, units are recruited, money is managed, and the dark tasks of espionage and assassination are undertaken. While a battle might change the course of a war, this is where you make sure that you have every chance of winning it in the first place.But most people play Total War for the battles. With the capacity to have thousands of units on the field at any given time, they're as much spectacle as strategy, as the ordered chaos of the battlefield threatens to overwhelm even the greatest captains. With a rich unit roster and a wide array of special abilities, your armies will be versatile and able to employ any number of tactics, from slowly whittling enemy numbers down with a stream of arrow fire to forming a defensive circle to protect your captain to employing a devastating hammer and anvil strike with your cavalry to launching diseased cow carcasses at their generals. Morale, terrain, weather, and energy levels all play important roles in how well your soldiers will be able to fight, and how well you will be able to govern the events of the battle.While there are some common strategies that can be undertaken for any nation or situation, no two campaigns or battles are the same, as the game can and will throw out surprises for you that you'll have to think quickly about to overcome. You may think you're doing well as France, fighting off England and preparing to make an invasion of the isles, when suddenly those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Portugal declare war on you and blockade all of your provinces, forcing you to stretch yourself out along two fronts. And while you may be able to overcome this obstacle, His Holiness the Pope probably won't take kindly to your conquests against your Catholic brethren, and may excommunicate you. All eventualities need to be prepared for in Total War if you want to survive.While this game is nearly a decade old, it still has a sizable and dedicated community of players to turn to if you want to fight a battle, try out a mod, or just get some friendly advice on how to deal with the Timurids. And as one of the easiest TW games to modify, it also has one of the best mod communities you'll be able to find, with an active base of players uploading and supporting their mods to this day. I highly recommend Stainless Steel, an expanded version of the base game with more provinces, factions, and units, and better AI, and also Third Age, a total conversion mod for Lord of the Rings that in my humble opinion is arguably the best TW game ever created, despite being a mod. If those two don't suit you, I'm sure you can find others that will.As for performance, the game still runs fine almost a decade after release, and still looks great. I can start a battle with 5,000 troops on the field and have little to no lag on my less than stellar computer. The score is also one of the finest I've had the pleasure of listening to in any game, and fits it very well.So, what are you waiting for? Go get the game! Europe won't conquer itself!			"

												-Try to take over a town but get rekt.-Blame the game at first but decide to try again taking a different approach.-Instead of sending your entire force into this massive blob you place small amounts of them in three positions around the city you have Center Force, Right Force, And Back Force.-Harass the defenders with arrows baiting them out of the city so they can be cut down by your infantry.-They send some of their forces to attack your Right Force.-Wait for them to get outside of the town and then trap them in a bubble of soldiers.-Send Back Force to attack their archers who are all inside the town center.-They send some pikes to stop you.-Take out their pikes with the help of your javelins.-They send spears to slow you down.-Meanwhile the forces they sent after Right Force earlier are all routing back to the town center.-Your archers are out of ammo in your Center Force.-Same with Right Force.-You charge Center Force into the town square.-Send the rest of your Right Force to support Back Force.-Center Force taking heavy losses from the archers.-Back force breaks through the spears.-The combined force of Back Force, and Right Force charge into the exposed backs of the enemy's within the town square.-Noone is spared.Then you realise that was just for one town...and you have like 45 more to conquer...

												Don't be fooled by my hours, I've played for much much longer offline. In my first campagin as England, I ended up losing, but I didn't care, I had a blast with the battles, politics and everything else. I've had so many different adventures and scenarios, from a French invasion of England, culminating in a fatal last stand across the River Tent outside Nottingham, to a battle between my Spansh Musketeers, Conquistadors and Sword and buckler men against a massive Aztec army, ending with a mass route of the Aztec army after my cavalry charged down the side of a hill, Lord of the Rings style, into the Aztec's flank. And this was basically before I tried the mods. Stainless Steel adds a bigger map, more factions, more units, and tons more content, adding even MORE adventures and scenarios. How about a Russian conquest of Eastern Europe and Asia Minor circa 13th century, with a medival NATO of England, France, Denmark and Germany allyign to stop you? I've done it, and still haven't finished it yet. Rebuilding the Roman Empire with the Byzantine Empire? Was easy at first, until the Mongols showed up. I've got so many campaigns to get back to and start, I don't see myself ever deleting this game off my machine if I need space, or even out of boredom. If anyone offers you this game, it's cheap, or you're just thinking ""Looks pretty cool"", pick it up. You will not regret it. This is easily one of, if not the greatest, strategy games I've ever played in my life. Just one word of advice; prepare for the Mongol inavsion before hand, or you're going to have a BAAAD time :)			"

												     This, in my opinion, is THE best total war game that they've made. And in addition, it is my favorite strategy game. The only RTS game that I can think of that is better, would be C&C Generals, but EA never made a second one!!!Back to medieval, for a bit of an outdated game it still looks amazing, and it runs flawlessly, highest settings, even on my computer which only has 2 lousy GB of RAM. They campaign is fun, and it feels more in-depth, and more ""wholesome"" than the newer TW games like ROME 2. Just little things that you'll notice throughout the game that'll  make it just SO much more fun. The kingdoms expansion is even better!!! 90% of my logged game time is just the brittania campaign. I can't get enough of this game, I spend hours on end glued to my screen witnessing my armies conquer, and my ""light"" Ostmen slaughtering heavy Scottish Nobleman like they were pigs. And unlike ROME 2 where in melee combat, infantry just gets into a giant clusterf@#k and it takes forever for one side to win, melee combat in this game is so much better, each soldier in a unit has their own little fight and they're pals may jump in and help em out with a quick axe-to-the-head. I can go on and on about how amazing this game is, but then you'd be reading this for hours. Just buy the game. And see how amazing it is for yourselves. And you wont regret it. 10/10 one of the greatest games EVER made.P.S. - ELEPHANTS WITH CANNONS. end of story...			"

												Where have you been all my life?I purchased Medieval II: Total War when it was on a sale a while back, but never 'opened' it. I bought it because I remember seeing a friend playing it when it first came out, and two things stuck in my mind:1. WOW! 8 GB on my hard drive?! That's too much space!2. Man, these battles are huge! And you have to manage the governance? That's insane!I'm a big fan of the Age of Empires series, so I was very used to a simpler, more combat-focused game series. M2TW's size (legitimately, that wasn't just a joke) as well as the amount of managing you needed to do looked intimidating to me, so I never tried it.How wrong I was.This game is absolutely glorious. Managing your nation, commanding your armies, working through all the inner workings of medieval society: this game found a way to make it work together. Here's an example: In the short British campaign, you have to conquer both Scotland and France. Scotland has few allies, so they weren't difficult to invade. However, France was a whole different story. France was not only allied with many of my neighbours (The Holy Roman Empire and Milan), but they were highly regarded by the Pope of the Catholic Church. If I tried to invade France, not only did I have to also fight against their allies, but I risked becoming excommunicated. I went for the risk, becoming both excommunicated and enemies to nearly all Catholic nations, and that made my French conquest significantly harder. I had to stop playing that campaign because, while my nation was the strongest, my borders were constantly under attack every turn, and I'd rather start a new campaign and learn from my mistakes.Albeit still a computer program and not reality, Medieval II feels like the closest thing to a simulator of Medieval combat. It's almost as if they intended to create a game series and engine to emulate that!I have not checked out the other Total War games, but I am going to once I'm done with my campaign on this one. So, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Strategy games and haven't tried these games, go for it! It has quickly become one of my favourite games, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for something new.Or old. I'm really behind the curve on this.			"

												This is the last pre-warscape CA Total War game, and really the last that could be successfully modded extensively.  This latter piece of the puzzle matters because some of the community dating back to when the game originallly released went to a lot of trouble to make mods, such as Stainless Steel and the total conversion for Lord of the Rings: Third Age.For me, the charm of Medieval 2 though is really centered around the game itself, the time period is so well suited for the style of game play that CA makes with the turn based stragegy map combined with the real time tactical battles that the result is just endless amounts of fantastic game play.This and Shogun 2 are for me the two best games CA has ever created.  Thumbs way up.			"

												I played this on CD to the point that the disk stopped working. I don't have an hour total, but I can assure you I spent a good two or three years putting about as much time into this as I did my full time job.Probably the last really well thought out Total War game, and one of the least buggy. There is no stupidly awkward city management system (Empire), most of the factions are reasonably well balanced (with the exception of the Italian States, who are crushingly overpowered in a player's hands - still better than pretty well all the other total war games out there), and things move at a pace that doesn't feel to relaxed or too rushed (shogun, napolean).It's not a masterpiece by any means, but now that I revisit them, I don't think any of the Total War games really are. It is a pretty fun game though, and certainly worth getting if you've are looking to get into the series.Edit: When I say ""the least buggy"", I'm just refering to the Steam versions. Rome:TW on CD, from like a decade ago, remains stable as a ♥♥♥♥ing rock resting on the surface of a giant steel cube with the gravitational pull of a black hole. There is also a 6 billion ton weight sitting on top of the rock. I've been told the Steam version doesn't work that well, but haven't had to try it despite having lost my Rome CD recently, because Rome is from an era where devs depended on human decency and CD codes as DRM.

												My friend Kept the bulk of his filthy lowborn Braveheart Wannabe forces in the town centre so I surrounded it and charged in with the glorious British Super Whale Knight Heavy Assualt Squad(If you get that reference you can have a cookie)! What a foolish tactic-- Hey what are those flaming arrows doing?""OH GOD THE CITY IS ON FIRE!, MY FRIEND IS ON FIRE!, AND SO IS MY FACE!, EVERYONE PANIC AND RUN!"" -- My supposed elite force as archers rain destruction all over the angles of retreat and through the slits of my Knights' helmets10/10 Would be outsmarted by disposable Peasant bait again and set on fire for my Hubris, A truly SHAMEFURDISPR-- Oh wrong game :PWhat I am trying to say is:+ Tactics are the core of this game, a smart commander can win with nearly any competent force composition as opposed to just buying top tier unit spam.+ Great Political/Kingdom Management System outside of battles.+ Ungodly 22 factions, each with their own nuances and tactics to master, but still realistic.+Beautifully done melee and archery combat, the fights are fully animated with their own brutal kills and flying corpses, which is kind of a must for a medieval RTS- Learning Curve is not for the faint of heart- Games take a very long time, especially when good players can fight each other to a stand still- Sometimes its unclear how quickly your units break, especially in some circumstances where they seem like they will win, but the AI is generally very good and this along with a few smattering of bugs (Not on Rome TW2 Level) make up a small portion of the Game Overall.9/10 one of the best in the series next to Shogun and won't require any too fancy a PC to run me thinks hMMM?

												When I was younger I played the original Medieval Total War for thousands of hours. The attention to detail coupled with great game mechanics gave rise to almost unending playability. This newer version has captured a lot of the charm of the older game, and the new factions, units and updated graphics means I once again find myself plotting how to conquer Medieval Europe. Yes there is a shiny new façade and tweaked mechanics that some may not enjoy as much, but the attention to detail, historicity and joy when playing is still very much there.			"

												The Total War game that had everything. The newer iterations of the series keep removing features and depth to the game.Obviously this is not a perfect game, the engine can only run in 1 CPU core and that really hurts when having a huge battle with unlimited units on the field.It has lots of exploits and bugs, the pikemen are basically useless. The vanilla AI has some serious issues with pathfinding, especially when you select a group of units and try to move them in a siege battle.Now, most of this issues, except of course those caused by the engine itself are addressed by the excellent modding community this game STILL has. Go browse the Total War Center website and see by yourself the mods this game has to offer. Recommended at full price.			"

												The Total War game that had everything. The newer iterations of the series keep removing features and depth to the game.Obviously this is not a perfect game, the engine can only run in 1 CPU core and that really hurts when having a huge battle with unlimited units on the field.It has lots of exploits and bugs, the pikemen are basically useless. The vanilla AI has some serious issues with pathfinding, especially when you select a group of units and try to move them in a siege battle.Now, most of this issues, except of course those caused by the engine itself are addressed by the excellent modding community this game STILL has. Go browse the Total War Center website and see by yourself the mods this game has to offer. Recommended at full price.			"

												When I was younger I played the original Medieval Total War for thousands of hours. The attention to detail coupled with great game mechanics gave rise to almost unending playability. This newer version has captured a lot of the charm of the older game, and the new factions, units and updated graphics means I once again find myself plotting how to conquer Medieval Europe. Yes there is a shiny new façade and tweaked mechanics that some may not enjoy as much, but the attention to detail, historicity and joy when playing is still very much there.			"

												My favorite game of all time, and one of the best, if not THE best, Total War titles.It doesn't have the improved politics, economy, replenishemnt, and public order systems of the later titles, but it M2 has it where it counts, visceral battles, free-form campaigns, amazing soundtrack, and a lot of personality that the later titles have lost. Before I had the steam version I logged 600 hours on this game, and that was WITHOUT mods. The major strength is that you can pretty much play the campaigns any way you want with minimal interference from the ""story"" , unlike Napoleon, R2, and Attila. You create your own history instead of being pushed into following actual history.The AI might be a bit dumb and it has its fair sure of bugs and glitches, but there's no DLC.Supposedly the latest steam version doesn't let you use certain mods, hasn't been an issue for me. I'd recommend two mods that I always use: Retrofit (takes kindoms features into the M2 grand campaign) and Crimson Tide (lots more blood and dirt).			"

												This is an excellent entry in the Total War series, better than its predecessor (Rome) and its next 2 successors (Empire and Napolean). The time period allows for exciting gameplay and lots of variety. The campaign mode fixed a lot of the problems from Rome (late game issues like being unable to deal with large cities and distance from capital). This game also introduced randomization of soldiers, so they all look different instead of being an army of clones. This game has one of the best experiences of building a globe spanning kingdom from 1 or 2 settlements. AI isn't amazing, but smart enough to put you in some tough situations now and again, especially on higher difficulty settings.DLC campaigns are fun and add interesting scenarios.All in all, lots of fun, tons of nations to play with, meaningful differences in unit types, and challenging strategy.

												While overall this game is great, squalor and the pope completely destroys the campaignThere are obviously meant to be some balancing to stop exponential growth, but there is no way to stop squalor and it just makes the game's campaign really annoyingAs for the pope, he constantly sends missions to stop attacking factions, even if it is defensively but the worst part is, he doesn't do the same to the faction you cant attck, this means that when I'm fighting the french not only am I not allowed to take the settlement which I was so close to before but also they can both siege my settlements which I cannot send a relief force for but they can also blockade my ports wihout be even being able to defend			"

												""What is best in life?""""To crush God's enemies,to see them converted before you,and to hear the lamentations of their Imams.""-Conan the Barbarian (said during his stint as a mercenary for the Pope)Seriously though, this game is still awesome, even after all these years later! In fact, M2:TW just celebrated its 10th birthday, this November 2016! And its still easily one of the best, if not the best, of the Total War series!Improving upon, and outdoing most everything in the previous M:TW and Rome:TW (whose engine it uses) games, Medieval II was a triumph of RTS when it was first released. And a year later, it only got better with the best Total War expansion to date, Kingdoms. And thats not even considering all the many wonderful fan-made mods this title has available, thus extending its greatness even more so! Even fantasy lands are game! Want to wage war in Middle-Earth? There's a mod for that! Feel like fighting for The Elder Scrolls' Tamriel? There's a mod for that! How about waylaying the Warhammer world? Well, actually, that game was released earlier this year. But..there's still mods that predate that!Caution: this game is a time consumer! You can EASILY spend 50+ hours on just one campaign alone, and given that there are 17 playable factions available (eventually) in just the base game alone, and that there is NO END DATE for any campaign (only an end to the campaign objectives, but the game still goes on, so you can play a medieval kingdom all the way into the 21st century and beyond, take that modernity! #ProgressIsForSuckers), you can rack up a kingdom's worth of time spent on this game! Rome wasn't built in a day, they say, but it sure was completed faster than this game is!Whether it be conquering your back-stabbing neighbors (all the italian powers, always!!), managing your empire (where is the govenator when you need him?), retaking the Holy Land from the infidel (ya jerks!), converting the heathen (come on fellas, its ""A.D."" now, get with the program already!), or making a heroic last stand for all of Christendom against the rapacious onslaught of the Golden Horde (which is what you get when you don't tip the chinese food delivery guy on one too many occasions), yes sir, Medieval II has it all. Even the possibility of having one of your generals get so cuckholded by his nakedly adulterous wife, that he loses it, becomes the most shameless man on earth, and shacks up with a tranny, thus bringing eternal shame to your kingdom! As I said, Medieval II has it all. Even things the developers really should have just left alone...*ahem*.If your a strategy gaming fan, there are certain games in the genre you just have to have played in your lifetime, like Age of Empires II: Age of Kings. This is that kind of game. Don't miss out. And here's to hoping that the developers go back on their ""we don't make games with the number '3' in their titles"" statement, and, once they are done with (the also fantastic, well-worth-your-time) Warhammer: Total War, they start developing Medieval III.

												I have been playing this game well before it was put on Steam. I'm actually really happy its on Steam now since I lost my old CD keys, this game is quite a gem. This Total War game is the one I compare every Total War game to and none of them ever come close to this one in terms of fun and replayability. The seige battles for both attack and defence in this game feel genuinely better than the ones in future installments. They are satisfying to play, whether you are taking down the walls with catapults/cannons, storming a citadel with seige equipment like rams and ladders, or just defending against invading forces storming your city.The units in this game matter, but its how you use them that makes for the most interesting battles. Clearly when the professional (late game) units go up against peasants and such, especially in an open field, we know who is ultimately going to lose (in most cases), but with right combination of units, including peasants, and the right kind of placement, you can easily defending a settlement against even the most advanced/elite units. This also depends on difficulty too as the AI can be vicious if given the chance.I aslo enjoyed the religion system in this game, but mainly for the catholic factions. The Papal states are not a minor faction and they will wreck you with not only their own units (which are pretty powerful) but all of Christendom will come together to crusade your face in should you get excommunicated or if the pope doesn't favor your faction nearly as much as the others (meaning he'll look the other way for a bit). For what it is, it is a complex, but straightforward system that can either be used to your advantage or used against you. The modding community for this game is pretty awesome too. Hyrule: Total War and Stainless Steel are both mods I love and they work so well with this game that it gives me endless hours of entertainment even to this day. The game still has a rather active modding community for something of its age, which is great since it just makes a great game even better. Finally, the game is just all around fun. How you play this game can easily make for a great time or just a great way to waste time in general all the while being entertained. I wish Sega and the Total War series in general looked back to this game and Rome: Total War (the first one) to see what they got so right about their game series and just put that + whatever improvements and mechanics (like naval battles) into the game. If they were to make a modern day version of this game with everything that made this game great, I would buy it in a heartbeat. But in the meantime, there is this game, so if you are looking to pick it up, do so and enjoy!			"

												""What is best in life?""""To crush God's enemies,to see them converted before you,and to hear the lamentations of their Imams.""-Conan the Barbarian (said during his stint as a mercenary for the Pope)Seriously though, this game is still awesome, even after all these years later! In fact, M2:TW just celebrated its 10th birthday, this November 2016! And its still easily one of the best, if not the best, of the Total War series!Improving upon, and outdoing most everything in the previous M:TW and Rome:TW (whose engine it uses) games, Medieval II was a triumph of RTS when it was first released. And a year later, it only got better with the best Total War expansion to date, Kingdoms. And thats not even considering all the many wonderful fan-made mods this title has available, thus extending its greatness even more so! Even fantasy lands are game! Want to wage war in Middle-Earth? There's a mod for that! Feel like fighting for The Elder Scrolls' Tamriel? There's a mod for that! How about waylaying the Warhammer world? Well, actually, that game was released earlier this year. But..there's still mods that predate that!Caution: this game is a time consumer! You can EASILY spend 50+ hours on just one campaign alone, and given that there are 17 playable factions available (eventually) in just the base game alone, and that there is NO END DATE for any campaign (only an end to the campaign objectives, but the game still goes on, so you can play a medieval kingdom all the way into the 21st century and beyond, take that modernity! #ProgressIsForSuckers), you can rack up a kingdom's worth of time spent on this game! Rome wasn't built in a day, they say, but it sure was completed faster than this game is!Whether it be conquering your back-stabbing neighbors (all the italian powers, always!!), managing your empire (where is the govenator when you need him?), retaking the Holy Land from the infidel (ya jerks!), converting the heathen (come on fellas, its ""A.D."" now, get with the program already!), or making a heroic last stand for all of Christendom against the rapacious onslaught of the Golden Horde (which is what you get when you don't tip the chinese food delivery guy on one too many occasions), yes sir, Medieval II has it all. Even the possibility of having one of your generals get so cuckholded by his nakedly adulterous wife, that he loses it, becomes the most shameless man on earth, and shacks up with a tranny, thus bringing eternal shame to your kingdom! As I said, Medieval II has it all. Even things the developers really should have just left alone...*ahem*.If your a strategy gaming fan, there are certain games in the genre you just have to have played in your lifetime, like Age of Empires II: Age of Kings. This is that kind of game. Don't miss out. And here's to hoping that the developers go back on their ""we don't make games with the number '3' in their titles"" statement, and, once they are done with (the also fantastic, well-worth-your-time) Warhammer: Total War, they start developing Medieval III.

												I bought this game originally by the DVD, the gold edition. It was the first Total War game I'd ever played. It made me play Rome: Total War, and then I explored the rest of the series. I fell in love with this game at first sight. I found this game by a youtube series that was really interactive. It was amazing. I found the setting amazing, I found the ability to forge my own history amazing. Commanding your troops as you use tactics or sheer numbers and brute force to bring victory. I think this is what got me in to History.  It is an excellent game, especially if you value gameplay over age.			"

TL;DRI got to execute the Pope, declare a Crusade on the Holy Roman Empire, and conquer the world and spread Milanese Italian fashion under the flag of Duke Bernardo the Mad, son of Duke Giorgio the Cuckold.9/10A MUST HAVE MEDIEVAL GENOCIDE SIMULATORPersonal InsightsThere's a myriad of sources out there that can cover the intricacies of gameplay far better than I could, so I'll try not to waste your time reading my review, when you could be in Medieval II fighting off 8 invading factions simultaneously, and outsmarting every enemy general on the battlefield.The GoodOutmaneuver enemy armies of better equipped knights and professional crossbowmen and win by epic, narrow margins with your  town militia and peasant archers in the early game, then laugh when you yourself raise armies of knights, and crush peasant armies with K/D ratios of 1:100 in the late game when you have so much excessive gold, you find yourself building Huge Cathedrals and Brothels in every corner of your empire just to drain your bloated treasury.There is no better feeling than when you've crushed all other factions except Denmark, Russia, Turkey, and Egypt, who then decide to form a super-alliance to prevent you from conquering the 20 remaining territories on the map, which you then do anyway.Unrest growing in a city? Raise taxes to Very High, move your entire garrison outside the city, and then wait. When the city rebels in 3-5 turns, besiege the city, kill the rebel soldiers, and then exterminate the populace to reestablish peace in your empire.Tired of using battering rams? Send 5 spies into an enemy castle for guaranteed access to Didney Worl! Laugh as the gates open as your troops surge through, and kill the French King to punish them for their crime of daring to proclaim French cuisine as superior to Italian.Artillery Elephants.When your general kills enough prisoners of war and exterminates the populations of enough cities, he can earn the epithet, ""The Butcher"". With 10 stars of command and 10 skulls of dread, Bindello the Butcher held off the Mongol invaders with little more than armies of Spear Militia and Peasant Crossbowmen. Unfortunately for him, Bindello the Butcher eventually died in an earthquake when I sent him to retire on the Iberian Peninsula.The BadVanilla AI sometimes fails to attack you with large enough armies. Vanilla AI sometimes lets you siege their capital for several turns, even though they have a full army nearby that could attack your besieging army, and break the siege.Executing Prisoners makes your faction ""Untrustworthy"". Why should enforcing capital punishment have any effect on trust?Vanilla AI will break a 50+ year old alliance to attack one of your lowest income villages, even though your army, wealth, and territories outnumber theirs by a ratio of 6:1.Vanilla AI will declare war by blockading one of your ports, and then failing to attack or do anything else for the next 80 years.Although Battle AI is mostly competent, if not brilliant, there have been a few scenarios in which opposing generals appear brain dead. If you siege a castle, and the AI has external reinforcements, the reinforcements have a decent chance of just camping outside the castle, and letting you slaughter its defenders without trying to aid their own faction.OnlineOnline experiences are limited to battles in the base game, although it appears you can run hotseat campaigns in the expansions. My experience with online multiplayer as been extremely limited, as my first online match was this year, more than a decade after this game was released. Nevertheless, I have been extremely satisfied with the handful of matches that I have had. Be warned though; in 2017 and beyond, it will be hard, if not impossible, to join an open match. Join some Medieval II groups, or tell your friends to buy this game if you want the most out of the online battles.ModsMy recommendations for modding the game? Play the game totally Vanilla for at least one long Grand Campaign, and then think carefully about what you would like changed. I put in over 200 hours in the Vanilla game before deciding to provide some tweaks to add some more options for gameplay. My current mods include Ultimate AI for the Campaign AI, and about 8 changes to the game files. Those changes are:Movement Speed increase for agents (but not armies)Increasing Age limit for Generals, so my 10 Star Generals stop dying at age 60.Increased Garrisons (free upkeep slots) for Cities and CastlesTrainable GeneralsStronger Walls/Gates, to make sieges a bigger challenge.Added Schiltrom (defense formation) to more unitsMisc. Diplomacy Fixes (easier Military Access)Misc. Mission FixesClosing ThoughtsMy experience with the Total War series actually began with the original Medieval: Total War. Medieval II has proven to be an improvement over nearly every asset of that game, and is actually compatible with modern hardware. If you like any other of the games in the Total War series, fictional Medieval scenarios, RTS's, or Eurocentricism simulators, I strongly recommend this game.TL;DRAs Milan, my faction was excommunicated for failing to stop annexing the territories of my Catholic neighbors. The Pope declared a Crusade to take back Rome, which I had annexed from the Papal States several turns earlier. Seeing as I controlled all of Europe except for England at that point, I decided to hunker down at Rome, and let the lone English Crusading army actually reach its intended destination. At Rome, I had a full garrison of high quality Milanese militia, led by three generals. Outside of Rome, I had placed another full army ouside the gates as reinforcements. When the English Crusaders arrived, I was somewhat worried, as the English had brought proper Knights and Armored Swordsmen, whereas I had Spear Militia and Cavalry Militia. Nevertheless, I waited for the English assault. Sure enough, the English began their assault on the walls of Rome with catapults and trebuchets. Yet, they never managed to see Rome's interior. My Cavalry Militia sallied out of the gates, and killed the artillery crew, while my reinforcements attacked the would-be Crusaders from the rear. The English Crusading army was destroyed, and as equal and just retaliation, I annexed the entire British Isles and exterminated their citizens for good measure.9/10This game is Machiavelli's wet dream.

												This is an excellent entry in the Total War series, better than its predecessor (Rome) and its next 2 successors (Empire and Napolean). The time period allows for exciting gameplay and lots of variety. The campaign mode fixed a lot of the problems from Rome (late game issues like being unable to deal with large cities and distance from capital). This game also introduced randomization of soldiers, so they all look different instead of being an army of clones. This game has one of the best experiences of building a globe spanning kingdom from 1 or 2 settlements. AI isn't amazing, but smart enough to put you in some tough situations now and again, especially on higher difficulty settings.DLC campaigns are fun and add interesting scenarios.All in all, lots of fun, tons of nations to play with, meaningful differences in unit types, and challenging strategy.

												While overall this game is great, squalor and the pope completely destroys the campaignThere are obviously meant to be some balancing to stop exponential growth, but there is no way to stop squalor and it just makes the game's campaign really annoyingAs for the pope, he constantly sends missions to stop attacking factions, even if it is defensively but the worst part is, he doesn't do the same to the faction you cant attck, this means that when I'm fighting the french not only am I not allowed to take the settlement which I was so close to before but also they can both siege my settlements which I cannot send a relief force for but they can also blockade my ports wihout be even being able to defend			"

												This is probably my second favorite Total War game after Shogun 2. The middle age setting is amazing and the graphics hold up pretty well for how old it is now. Nothing beats slaughtering thousands of enemies using English Longbowmen or Venetian Heavy infantry, the battles are just so large and require knowledge of tactics. One thing that anoys me is the enemy campaign AI and the diplomacy, the AI doesn't raise balanced armies and is usually just lots of the same unit type. The differences that set apart all of the factions really make a difference when playing, for exapmle using the English you want to be building armies that are focused on using Longbowmen but other factions don't have that option. I have had hundreds of hours fun on this game over the years and i'm sure I will be playing it for many more years!			"

												Medieval ll: Total War is the 2nd game in the TW seriese. With many grafical updates and new mixed unit meshes it was supposed to be better then the Rome counterpart but thats not the case. The AI in Medieval seems to be more defensive, I found in many cases where I put the all the setting in the favor of another faction such as high unit count major upgrades and anyother thing I was able to do but the same outcome was presented. Camping in the same spot till I go for them, then again the game douse has its up sides such as double walls and many gatehouses. Also their is a massive amount of units such as spearmen, swordmen and so-on and so-forth. Ill give it a 7-10. The AI really takes a chunk out of this game. *At times*			"

												This is probably my second favorite Total War game after Shogun 2. The middle age setting is amazing and the graphics hold up pretty well for how old it is now. Nothing beats slaughtering thousands of enemies using English Longbowmen or Venetian Heavy infantry, the battles are just so large and require knowledge of tactics. One thing that anoys me is the enemy campaign AI and the diplomacy, the AI doesn't raise balanced armies and is usually just lots of the same unit type. The differences that set apart all of the factions really make a difference when playing, for exapmle using the English you want to be building armies that are focused on using Longbowmen but other factions don't have that option. I have had hundreds of hours fun on this game over the years and i'm sure I will be playing it for many more years!			"

Seriously, Warhammer is nothing compared to this thing. Set in, of course, medieval europe. Fight in the crusades, conquer the americas, whatever you want. Call a crusade, even. Or, if you're not a fan of the church, you can kill the pope in battle and burn rome to the ground. Not even joking, the pope is a general, and if you edit some scripts you can play as him too. Look it up, it's quite simple, just most it from Non playable to unlocked and bam, play as the pope. You're welcome. Now go kill some popes, or be the pope, whatever you want.			"

												  Played this game for over 400 hours and loved every minute. The base game was fantastic and offered a great mix of intellectual organization and also the opprotunity for roleplay elements, the world map being large enough to keep you satisfied with whichever nation you choose as it will always provide a challenge to turn that map one colour.  The DLC was also some of the best I've played in most likely any of the Total war Series. Each capturing a different period of medieval history while also providing a range of challenges. The America campaign being one of my favorites since it shifts the atmosphere of the game so radically.  Now as if the base game and DLC wasn't enough. the community has picked every piece of meat from the bone in terms of mods for the game which allow you to play as a lord of the Seven kingdoms of Westeros, the Uruks of Isengard or even just mods that increase realism and immersion.  This game has captured my attention for over 400 hours, and its been a solid experiance the entire time.9/10			"

												Excellent game. WIll keep you interested and have fun for days. Even if its not the latest release in Total War series it is still as good as any current titles of this genre. There are some secondary areas which could have been designed to require more active attention from players resulting in more depth. But as the title says its all about WAR and you get plenty of that in detail.Having more information regarding how different types of troops compare against each other would have been helpfull but I guess discovering that on your own the hard way on the battlefield instead of just the unit card stats adds to the challenge.

												My personal favorite in the Total War series. Medieval 2 gains a lot by being set in a time and place that is more or less easily recognizable to westerners. Assuming you start the game as the default English or French, you'll be mostly battling accross Europe with late game forays into northern Africa, western Russia, and the Middle East. Your units will, for the most part, also be familiar and easily understood. Even a casual student of medieval European history will understand why charging a spear wall with calvary is a bad idea, or why you don't use tight formations to advance into arrow or catapult fire. The game's medieval atmosphere is further boosted by a provocative musical score, accurate sound effects, and nation-themed voice dialogue. Gamplay in Medieval II, like any Total War game, is dividied between the strategic global campaign map and tactical maps where battles are played out. The strategic gameplay is solid, and players will be required to juggle tax income, religion, unrest, noble desires, and public health with the logistical demands of supporting your armies between battles. While the game lacks the research tech tree introduced in Empire, technology pacing is present through city building. As you build and upgrade your stables, archery ranges, and barracks you'll gain access to new troop types while smithies, jousting fields, and swordsmen guilds will enhance the equipment and quality of troops. Tactical gameplay is fantastic with players having strong control over formations, positioning, and abilities. Complexity is added in with morale and stamina mechanics, both of which are easily understood and implemented in a way that makes sense. The few faults that do exist in the tactical gameplay only emerge when directly comparing the game to more recent Total Wars, like Shogun 2 or Rome 2. Combat and unit cohesion in Medieval 2 can feel more rigid and unresponsive than its successors, but never enough to seriously impede gameplay.  "

If you siege a castle, and the AI has external reinforcements, the reinforcements have a decent chance of just camping outside the castle, and letting you slaughter its defenders without trying to aid their own faction.OnlineOnline experiences are limited to battles in the base game, although it appears you can run hotseat campaigns in the expansions. My experience with online multiplayer as been extremely limited, as my first online match was this year, more than a decade after this game was released. Nevertheless, I have been extremely satisfied with the handful of matches that I have had. Be warned though; in 2017 and beyond, it will be hard, if not impossible, to join an open match. Join some Medieval II groups, or tell your friends to buy this game if you want the most out of the online battles.ModsMy recommendations for modding the game? Play the game totally Vanilla for at least one long Grand Campaign, and then think carefully about what you would like changed. I put in over 200 hours in the Vanilla game before deciding to provide some tweaks to add some more options for gameplay. My current mods include Ultimate AI for the Campaign AI, and about 8 changes to the game files. Those changes are:Movement Speed increase for agents (but not armies)Increasing Age limit for Generals, so my 10 Star Generals stop dying at age 60.Increased Garrisons (free upkeep slots) for Cities and CastlesTrainable GeneralsStronger Walls/Gates, to make sieges a bigger challenge.Added Schiltrom (defense formation) to more unitsMisc. Diplomacy Fixes (easier Military Access)Misc. Mission FixesClosing ThoughtsMy experience with the Total War series actually began with the original Medieval: Total War. Medieval II has proven to be an improvement over nearly every asset of that game, and is actually compatible with modern hardware. If you like any other of the games in the Total War series, fictional Medieval scenarios, RTS's, or Eurocentricism simulators, I strongly recommend this game.TL;DRAs Milan, my faction was excommunicated for failing to stop annexing the territories of my Catholic neighbors. The Pope declared a Crusade to take back Rome, which I had annexed from the Papal States several turns earlier. Seeing as I controlled all of Europe except for England at that point, I decided to hunker down at Rome, and let the lone English Crusading army actually reach its intended destination. At Rome, I had a full garrison of high quality Milanese militia, led by three generals. Outside of Rome, I had placed another full army ouside the gates as reinforcements. When the English Crusaders arrived, I was somewhat worried, as the English had brought proper Knights and Armored Swordsmen, whereas I had Spear Militia and Cavalry Militia. Nevertheless, I waited for the English assault. Sure enough, the English began their assault on the walls of Rome with catapults and trebuchets. Yet, they never managed to see Rome's interior. My Cavalry Militia sallied out of the gates, and killed the artillery crew, while my reinforcements attacked the would-be Crusaders from the rear. The English Crusading army was destroyed, and as equal and just retaliation, I annexed the entire British Isles and exterminated their citizens for good measure.9/10This game is Machiavelli's wet dream.

Easy to learn difficult to master especially playing against a human scum ..the ai is good for its era but will declare war at you if its on higher difficulty  and on the battlefield yet it does some noob stuff like having its archers alone and ahead of the main firce etc.One of the games that i would love to write a whole essay yet its a review of the game.... i think its a must have, could be run in a potatoe ,massive slaughter  game  and its very low priced nowadays so its a win for you and a win for volvo  "

While Crusader Kings II can't really be topped in terms of depth and the sheer amount of intricacy on offer, at the time of its release Medieval II offered players a chance at some cunning diplomacy using spies, priests and even princesses to influence the enemy factions, in addition to an updated battle engine.Definitely worth picking up, especially if you're curious about the more recent Total War games and want a slightly less complex entry into the military strategy world.

												Wanna know how I got these hours? I'll sum it up in one word. Mods. Without all the beautiful mods, that have been created by an amazing community, I wouldn't have loved this game as much as I currently do. Without the mods it is still an amazing game. One of the best, if not the best current Total War. Amazing cavalry charge, beautiful arrow stagger, and even those awesome armor upgrades. If you want to start playing Total War then I urge you to buy this game. Does it have it's cons? Yes, yes it does. There are many bugs and glitches. I've encountered a few crashes, and since this an older game be ready for lag if you try to have the graphics and unit sizes to the highest setting. There have been a couple bugs that annoy the ever-living crap outta me. Such as during Sieges, you try to run your archers off the walls but half of them stay there. If you try to set them up behind the wall they were just on, prepare for stupid unit Ai. They form up against the buildings or something stupid like that.Even with the oldness, the bugs, the crashes. I still give this game a 10/10 because of the amazing mods it has.Third Age: Total WarElder Scrolls: Total WarCall of Warhammer: Total WarPlanetary War: Total WarJust to name the four I use. So buy it, buy Kingdoms with it. Then go on to download all the mods. If you don't then get excommunicated scrub.THIS MOD FOR TEST OF TIME NOMINATION!			"

												I have Medieval 2 and Kingdoms on disc already and I only recently bought this on Steam again as a backup. I have sunk countless hours on the disc version.This game is a massive improvement on Rome 1 that was before this and of course is far better with the amount of mods that are availiable for it. Especially if you have the Kingdoms Expansion which I recomend you should get as well. Vanilla is very good and holds its own but like most Total Wargames it is improved further with mods. To improve historical accuracy and provide total overhauls. I recomend you have a look on twcenter.net for what modders have made availiable. This game covers 300 years of history from just after the Norman invasion of Britain, the Crusades, the Mongol invasion, the discovery of gun powder to the exploring of the Americas. I don't think i'll ever get bored with this game as I've always come back to it even after playing more recent games such as Shogun 2, Empire and Rome 2 which I also enjoy. So my love for this game has not anything to do with rose tinted glasses.			"

												Out of all the Total War games, I've liked Medieval II the most, mainly since it has enough mechanics to the gameplay without adding too much complexity that you end up using in the end.  As an example of this, I found the merchant mechanics pointless in Empire Total War when you're going for a conquest victory.  There's also a lot of content here with the new world discovery, and the Kingdoms expansion, which do more than just change the map around, especially with the new world scenario.  The downside is the AI can be very stupid at times, like when you're being sieged you can sallly out, and the enemy will for the most part stand still until you're close.  So for instance, you can use a balista or archers to take them all out if you position them on the flanks of the sieging army and you won't take any casualities.Aside from that, a really good buy, especially if you can get it on sale.

Medieval II: Total War™One of the best Total War titles with probably the best campaign.Medieval II: Total War throws you into the Middle Ages.You can choose from a good number of states like the Holy Roman Empire,Byzantine Empire,France,England,Scotland and so on.The game has Single Player,Multiplayer,Historical Battles and Custom Battles.You can save replays of your battles.GraphicsFor a game released in 2006,it looks good even to this day.So don't be afraid of the game's age.GameplayEach state has it's own victory conditions.Throughout the game,events like the Mongol Invasion or invention of powder will influence the way you play the game.Religion plays an important role in the game.The Pope can call a crusade while the Muslims can call a Jihad.Aside from generals and armies,you can recruit and use agents such as priests,spies,assassins,merchants and diplomats.Diplomacy in the game is decent,but doesn't have many options.The Real Time Strategy part of the game is great but it has it's problems.The AI will do weird things sometimes,and the unit pathing in the game is not that great.Mods and DLCYou can enhance this game by buying the DLC which also offers great campaign stories and other factions.By buying the DLC,you can also install mods.The best and most famous mod is the Stainless Steel mod.It pushes the game to it's maximum capacity,updating graphics,adding more factions,improving AI and more.

The family tree and the crusades/jihads will make your own story. 3.Historicly acurate. 4. As time passes you will face new challenes, I will only say one but it is big......MONGOL INVASION. 5. so many units and factions. most in any game I might say. 6.Kingdoms expansion. Its not like the dlcs of the new total war games. It is 4 of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t dlcs for a smaller price and more content. 7.You can rename cities. 8. no annoying and glitchy ship battles(there are none). 9. Multiplayer is large and in charge. 10. CHEAP. Now I gave you 10 reasons to buy it. I will give you a bonus one. 11. Third Age Total War. NOW BUY IT AND EXPANSION			"

The battle system is all in all very fine and in Multiplayer its an interesting experience and i would even buy the game if i could not play the singleplayer. The game has been improved by al lot a mods, f.E. Sword and Spear, Stainless Steel, Third Age.... There are a few bugs and things, that had been improved in later Total War titles, but its one of my  alltime favourite Total War games. I recommend it for anyone that is interested in strategy and the price is absolutely appropriate.			"

												I got this when I put about 200 hours into Rome Total War I wanted more TW games so I found this and I like the middle ages so bought it.That was very wise (typical of me) as this is second to Rome Total War which I believe was the best game in the TW series I have a review for that but this is about Medieval 2:Total War which is a historically accurate RTS/TBS portrayal of the middle ages it features many factions eg.England France The Holy Roman Empire Poland Egypt Turkey Russia that's some of them it has in-depth mechanics and imersive gameplay where you will grow attachments to generals and actually feel some emotion when they die (goodbye maxed out at all skills general....) in Medieval 2 Tital War you will control a nation in of course the middle ages in the campaign skirmish and multiplayer if you don't know what the TW series is then read the next paragraph if you do skip it TW is a series of games that historically portrays periods throughout history it involves RTS battles aswell as a TBS campaign where you manage your nations finances military structures that are built etc.you will order units around the campaign map where they will get into battles that can be autoresolved or you an take direct control of the battle on an RTS map where you will control your forces against the enemy one in TW there us NO basebuildingThe game does howeer suffer from a very barebones multiplayer some balancing issues and a somehwat weak AI which can get to be a problem Pros:Historicaly accurate Large variety of factionsLarge faction rostersBoth an RTS and TBSVery in-depth mechanics Well made campaign Cons:Some units are overly expensive Some factions are incredibly superior compared to others Rubbish easy and medium difficulty AI hard offers some challenge Pope is very annoying Some factions are very unlikeable and some people will very rarely play themOverall this is a very good game and its pros greatly outway it's cons but if you are not a fan of the middle ages you will possibly not enjoy this game as it is trying to make an accurate portrayal of the middle ages so I will conclude this review at a 8/10			"

												One of the finest RTS games I have played and probably my only real favourite in the Total War series.  Within this game you start off as one of the monarchies of the medieval era, England, France, Spain etc, inhabiting the West with the Turks, Egyptians, the Moors etc controlling most of the Eastern regions.  And I use control loosely, for this game is about constant strife, border control and damning your so called allies to your own religious hierarchies.  The gameplay itself is split into two halves.  One half is the typical RTS strategic combat, where two armies with varied units, face each other on the battlefield to determine a victor!  In this part of the game, there is a Rock Paper Scissors style of strategy, with Spears besting Knights, Knights besting Archers and Archers besting Spears, though as your own technology expands and your coffers grow larger, more diverse units will be available to you.The AI can be a little stupid at times, often forgetting your commands or taking an insanely longer route than it needs to travel to reach it's destination.  So some micromanagement is needed there.  The second part of the gameplay is entirely Turn-Based.  You begin with a selection of territories relevant to your faction's Monarchy, you also have your own Royal Family who each have their own needs and quirks which affect your overall strategy.  And in this phase of the game you'll be charged with building your resources, exploring the world, and interacting with your neighbours.  Honestly I find this part of the game to actually be rather interesting, it's always fun to approach your neighbours with peace offerings and treaties, only to plan treachery for when the time is right.  And there are numerous and inventive ways you can attempt to accomplish this through, in a very Game of Thrones style of diplomacy if you're familiar with the subject matter.I found this to be the better of the Total War series.  Others will have their preferences to Rome, Shogun or maybe even the Napoleonic Wars, but if you have any doubts of either, just do your research.  I hope my review will help contribute to that. "

												  Played this game for over 400 hours and loved every minute. The base game was fantastic and offered a great mix of intellectual organization and also the opprotunity for roleplay elements, the world map being large enough to keep you satisfied with whichever nation you choose as it will always provide a challenge to turn that map one colour.  The DLC was also some of the best I've played in most likely any of the Total war Series. Each capturing a different period of medieval history while also providing a range of challenges. The America campaign being one of my favorites since it shifts the atmosphere of the game so radically.  Now as if the base game and DLC wasn't enough. the community has picked every piece of meat from the bone in terms of mods for the game which allow you to play as a lord of the Seven kingdoms of Westeros, the Uruks of Isengard or even just mods that increase realism and immersion.  This game has captured my attention for over 400 hours, and its been a solid experiance the entire time.9/10			"

												For a game this old it sure is fun. I'm pretty sure it's like 10 years old at this point and it looks that way too, but it plays great. Second only to Shogun II. Seriously, Warhammer is nothing compared to this thing. Set in, of course, medieval europe. Fight in the crusades, conquer the americas, whatever you want. Call a crusade, even. Or, if you're not a fan of the church, you can kill the pope in battle and burn rome to the ground. Not even joking, the pope is a general, and if you edit some scripts you can play as him too. Look it up, it's quite simple, just most it from Non playable to unlocked and bam, play as the pope. You're welcome. Now go kill some popes, or be the pope, whatever you want.			"

Combining a blend of economic advancement, diplomatic shenanigans and military conquest, you definetely have room to manouvre with how you play with your faction, whatever your playstyle.Yes, there are some issues, such as ridiculously OP cavalry charges, scarily buggy battles on mountain terrain-style maps (some units are literally stuck and unreachable), and the AI's diplomatic nature completely unfathomable and changing (Always fun declaring war on the Papal States, conquering Rome then declaring a ceasefire by buying them off and then electing the new pope next turn with your legion of cardinals). However, these are miniscual when compared to how many hours you can plug away into this game and still really enjoy it, especially when you only begin to the tap into the mods that are available (Third age total war, Skyrim, Westeros e.t.c.).tl;dr: gr8 game, op cavalry, more skins then csgo, buy dis gam "

												Wonderful game i am sill playing it after 491 hours i got this game in 2014 and this is my first review. This game is the best total war game in history that i have ever played it is just perfect. Although i do wish there were more types of fortress because there are only 3 types but they have citadels towns large towns motte bailey fort etc to play on. Multiplayer is very fun but there are to many newbs and quitters. Overall a 5/5 so many units great animated fights i highly reccomned getting it just see for your self because it is like god gave us this game. this is a old game so graphics are ok but when i play in Medieval 2 i feel like a real general. Oh and btw there are many factions to choose from such england france Hungary Russia Poland Turkey Egypt etc. Also they have very cool events in campaign like the mongol invasion and the timiruds invasion btw i reccomend the american dlc. oh and if u do have it there are natives in the land and try to find them hint christopher columbus.

												A very good game to buy and even more: a strategy must have. The economy is more challenging to manage then RTW in my opinion, definitely in the beginning but you can become used to it after a bit of practice. There are also a few different features to this game which makes it feel like they stayed true to the medieval setting like crusades, cardinal and pope elections (which have an effect on diplomacy) and spreading religion.

												Medieval II is an magnificent game that will steal hours if not days from your life.  Important note though,  this game has a mix between  Turn-Based kingdom management  and  Real Time battles  so  if you don't like TBS or RTS games i don't think MII is for you.  Vanilla MII is a great game, but i personally suggest that you download either the StainlessSteel or the DarthMod mod conversions which change several game parameter and drastically increases the difficulty and adds tons of new content to the game. Diplomacy is pretty light but it is a forgivable feature due to this being a  Total War  game and the whole point is to wage war and conquer everything in sight. Vanilla AI pathfinding i horrible in sieges, but there are some mods that can fix it, although not fully. In conclusion, MII is a unforgettable game that is certainly worth the low price you pay for tons of hours of war and conquest.			"

												Wanna know how I got these hours? I'll sum it up in one word. Mods. Without all the beautiful mods, that have been created by an amazing community, I wouldn't have loved this game as much as I currently do. Without the mods it is still an amazing game. One of the best, if not the best current Total War. Amazing cavalry charge, beautiful arrow stagger, and even those awesome armor upgrades. If you want to start playing Total War then I urge you to buy this game. Does it have it's cons? Yes, yes it does. There are many bugs and glitches. I've encountered a few crashes, and since this an older game be ready for lag if you try to have the graphics and unit sizes to the highest setting. There have been a couple bugs that annoy the ever-living crap outta me. Such as during Sieges, you try to run your archers off the walls but half of them stay there. If you try to set them up behind the wall they were just on, prepare for stupid unit Ai. They form up against the buildings or something stupid like that.Even with the oldness, the bugs, the crashes. I still give this game a 10/10 because of the amazing mods it has.Third Age: Total WarElder Scrolls: Total WarCall of Warhammer: Total WarPlanetary War: Total WarJust to name the four I use. So buy it, buy Kingdoms with it. Then go on to download all the mods. If you don't then get excommunicated scrub.THIS MOD FOR TEST OF TIME NOMINATION!			"

												Medieval 2: Total War is one of the best games from the Total War series. The game itself is really in-depth, and the strategy is so immersive and complex. Even the campaign map has hidden strategies for managing the diplomacy of your kingdom, which makes the seemingly uncalled for attacks from neighboring nations look a lot less random. The battlefields and units are designed very well and the whole game looks very polished. Battle strategies can be somewhat complex, but once you get the hang of them you will feel like a 5 star general. Not to mention the fact that you can even modify the game to play as the papal states, which has influence over most European factions. I haven't tried any big mods for this game yet, but I've heard about many of them, so it's nice to know that there are options out there in the unlikely event that I ever get bored with the main game. If you're looking to buy anything on Steam, this is a game you should seriously consider adding to your library. Happy warmongering!			"

Great combat, awesome seiges and you have to use a good degree of strategy to beat your opponenet, but what really make this game for me is the mods. The mods are the best, making total overhauls or just small adjustments. Its what makes this game long lasting for me. My favourite would be age of Petty Kings,  A Game of thrones mod. Great fun as i conquer my enemies and crush their skulls. The generals also have alot of character as they evolve over    your playthrough. The spearmen are op and you can basically destroy anything with them with minimal loses in my playthrough.  Also on my desktop which has windows eight the game crashes every time i open it, be carefull about that.Recomend you get this, fantastic game and replay value over 10000			"

												One of the finest RTS games I have played and probably my only real favourite in the Total War series.  Within this game you start off as one of the monarchies of the medieval era, England, France, Spain etc, inhabiting the West with the Turks, Egyptians, the Moors etc controlling most of the Eastern regions.  And I use control loosely, for this game is about constant strife, border control and damning your so called allies to your own religious hierarchies.  The gameplay itself is split into two halves.  One half is the typical RTS strategic combat, where two armies with varied units, face each other on the battlefield to determine a victor!  In this part of the game, there is a Rock Paper Scissors style of strategy, with Spears besting Knights, Knights besting Archers and Archers besting Spears, though as your own technology expands and your coffers grow larger, more diverse units will be available to you.The AI can be a little stupid at times, often forgetting your commands or taking an insanely longer route than it needs to travel to reach it's destination.  So some micromanagement is needed there.  The second part of the gameplay is entirely Turn-Based.  You begin with a selection of territories relevant to your faction's Monarchy, you also have your own Royal Family who each have their own needs and quirks which affect your overall strategy.  And in this phase of the game you'll be charged with building your resources, exploring the world, and interacting with your neighbours.  Honestly I find this part of the game to actually be rather interesting, it's always fun to approach your neighbours with peace offerings and treaties, only to plan treachery for when the time is right.  And there are numerous and inventive ways you can attempt to accomplish this through, in a very Game of Thrones style of diplomacy if you're familiar with the subject matter.I found this to be the better of the Total War series.  Others will have their preferences to Rome, Shogun or maybe even the Napoleonic Wars, but if you have any doubts of either, just do your research.  I hope my review will help contribute to that. "

												Best strategy game ever.  1000's of hours of gameplay.  Never, ever the same game twice.  Bought on Steam because I was wearing out my DVD.  If Steam had my real time played, would be a likely 5000+ hours, and that may be a conservative guess.Start with pitchfork armies, end with Chivalric hammer wielding mayhem.  Play enough, and you unlock even more armies.  Spoiler, kinda? But seriously, playing a good, mid-late game, very hard/very hard setting epic defense against five or more allied Mongol armies in one turn isn't even the end, however epic that may be...  Rarely seen, the Timurids also lurk over the horizon.Buy it.			"

												Such a great game. Well worth the money, well worth getting the Kingdoms DLC with it, just adds more to do really. Honestly, I would say this is the best out of the Total War series. I like the feature of being able to put units under AI command, have the AI take control of an army during a battle, though the AI is bad, it is still a handy feature if you want to witness giant battles. It is a shame they didn't include it in the later games. I love being able to buid up armies and attack huge castles with mighty siege equipment, it is just awesome.The game lacks some things, but it is old. There can be stressful moments, where the AI acts like a complete idiot, you cannot position your troops where you want to position them, some slight issues, but the game is still awesome and playable. Has some great mods out there for it, so you can go and experience them too.Highly recommend it.			"

												If your anything like me or share my intrists in stradegy based games, or also enjoy games like the civilization series or any other thinking game really, then this is definatly the game for you, but not only this game, but any of the total wars, just pick a time period, buy the game, and start skipping school because of your new found addiction.

												With incredible historical background, jaw dropping world and kingdoms, Medieval II: Total War is one of the best strategy games I’ve every played, or likely will ever play. The battles are nerve griping, the historical references and characters are detailed, what more could you ask for? A historical and gaming nerd, like myself, would love nothing more but to get their hands on a copy of this. What are you waiting for? Buy the game!			"

												I am officially addicted to this game. Like the Football Manager series before me playing this game, it is very addictive and so much fun. Prior to purchasing Medieval II: Total War, I had only heard of the 'Rome II' edition which is the latest game in the series and the reviews didn't look too good for it, so I chose this, which I find a fascinating period in history. Anybody who is thinking of playing this game for the first time, give a couple of hours on a new campaign and once you get your head around how to play it, Medieval II: Total War is crackin' - Graphics are good, slightly dated, but the graphics aren't the sole reason you'd buy this game. I also bought the extensoin pack [Kingdoms] which allows you to pick from another variety of factions [eg Jerusalem/Crusades etc] - I can't praise the game enough. I love it and if you're looking for a great strategy game, steeped in history, this is for you. Enjoy.			"

												After playing many hours on this game I can say I am addicted. I almost exclusivley play the Third Age mod with divide and conquer as a sub mod on it. It is the best game I have played in a long time. I highly recommend this game if you like strategy games.			"

												A masterpeice of a game. This game came out in 2006, and the graphics still hold up. The game has amazing mechanics, is extremely fun, and is rewarding. I played this game growing up and it still holds up today. One of the best games of all time in my opinion. A must buy			"
