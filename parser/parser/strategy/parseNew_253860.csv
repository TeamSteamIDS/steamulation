												My first PC game, oh the memories... It's an all round awesome RTS (for it's time). Great graphics, sound, lengthy and thrilling campaign, awesome units (laser tanks FTW!), interesting story and setting. It's a pity that the sequels got progressively worse. The last iteration of the series (2160) was a complete disaster and the 2150 was just meh.			"

												The original 1997 Earth 2140 was very, very advanced for its time; the jewel in the crown was a variable and adaptive AI that could be more challenging and unpredictably cunning than even some human players.The Steam/HD version lacks this AI, or any AI at all, and most of the fun has gone out of the game because of it. ""Unplayable and boring"" is a harsh but accurate description that's frequent on the Steam forums.The original game is an underrated and magnificent game with great unit variability and faction balance. The missions were definitely challenging, even for seasoned players, and the adaptive AI really kept a player on their toes. The combat mechanics, friendly AI ""Generals"", resource/production nuances, and other features were well polished and supported a variety of strategic play styles.The HD version includes two Mission Packs, each with a selection of well-made missions and short campaigns, but without an AI for your opponents or friendly generals the missions just become a slog of whittling down the auto-produced horde milling about the enemy base.My recommendation is to go buy an old CD and install it on a machine that will run it instead of buying the Steam/HD version; This was a great game, and it needs to be played in a version that will do it justice.

												Oh man, I absolutely LOVED this game back when I was a kid! It was so goddam fun! It was pretty much my favourite RTS of all at the time! Went straight from Dune 2 to Earth 2140 to Dawn Of War!Y'know, a decade and a half ago.Suffice to say, it's aged a bit. It really doesn't have all the standard features RTSes have. Heck, you move with the left mouse button. So yeah, don't expect it to still hold up to games today.Also, the AI seems to be really bugged in non-DOS versions. Which is a real pity.			"

												I always wanted to try out the Earth series, beeing a fan of strategy games and all. So naturally I started with Earth 2140 with some decent expectations. Got the entire series for a around 3$. Figured they are very old games and the price cant go any lower than that.I was excited to see that 2140 has an HD version,but was quickly disappointed to see that HD means that it can be played on newer machines and some new resolutions are supported. From the intro of the game I saw that something was off. There was a product placement for a popular beverage in the somewhat distant post apocalyptic future and a display of different type of robots and machines that was suppose to set up the story. I did not make anything out story wise from that.Onto the main screen was excited to see the way it was created, like you as a character shifted your vision from left to right and was a bit riddled about the games factions (which are two , your typical Europe vs America factions). Nothing too bad about that. Was thrilled to see that there are two mission packs included as well. Hey ,more content,that is always nice.Was very excited to see a database of all buildings ,vehicles and soldiers in the main menu. After browsing through them, everything was looking pretty good.Until I actually started playing the game. I can understand that this is an old strategy game that may have been a pioneer at its age,but hey, so was Starcraft or Red Alert. This game disappointed in almost every expect imagineable to me.Let’s start with the story, which by the way I had to research it to get an understanding on what the hell is going on. Basically some big war went on and most of the most continents except Europe and America are wiped out and now these two factions fight for the remainder of Earth’s resources by destroying everything in their path. Not THAT bad, really hoped that the story would develop somehow, but it didn’t. Every mission starts with a radar like briefing with a terrain background that has really hard to read text that makes you want to skip the briefing alltogether. Even when you read it , every mission is bascially destroy the enemy base or capture some random buildings. The variety is almost non-existent.Pressing on to the cutscenes,that I really hoped to bring some plot into the game. Nope, did not happen. Every cutscene in the game is basically pointless. It just shows some random units atacking each other or patroling some buildings. No story info whatsoever.Progression wise (I played as Europe) you basically just have to retake some huge chunks of Europe and North Africa Back and then go conquer America. Again this is not that bad (most strategy games have this) but this time it is so poorly executed and implemented that it makes not care at all what happens in this game.Going towards graphics,well nothing to complain, the usual 2D sprites that were specific for that time.Good enough. But damn, there are like only 2 animations for fighting in the entire game (that I have recognized), one of wich ( the rocket with the smoke trail) beeing so overly used and annoying to see to some extreme repetition.You jump into the game mission and you are left to figure everything out by yourself. There are no tutorials (which is kind of ok, this beeing specific for that time when the game was launched). That would have been a good idea, IF the menu that is a C&C/Dune type of menu was not so completely counter intuitive and lacked actual ease of use.It took me several minutes to just figure out how to get resources in this game, which could have been exciting, but to me personally it was a disaster. When you do manage to set up your resource gathering buildings and your production buildings, you just spam random infantry and tanks, in masses, and you go roflstomp the enemies.Oh and speaking about enemy AI. With the HD version, they somehow managed to break it. Enemies rarely attack your base and aparently don’t produce units of their own at all. This can only result in zero lack of interest in replayability or sense of beeing challenged or beeing a strategy game, SOME STRATEGY. You just build up some random piles of units and go kamikaze with them until the mission is accomplished.The units design is kind of interesting,especially for that time. On the other side the unit voiceovers are basically the same for ALL units,which makes everything utterly annoying to click,really fast. Also unit wise,the pathing system and the way each unit atacks or finds the enemy is completely rubbish and painful to watch. The unit selection is clunky and feels un easy as well. The selection method gives you almost no info about what type of units you have (It just briefly shows the name of a unit and immediately disappears). While searching through the menu tabs, I found everything to be placed so badly . Buildings menu is a mess. Units selection menu (yes you have to click a different tab to see unit selection menu), feels useless. Unit behiavour menu set some interest,but considering the overall gameplay,it completely failed to me as well.On to the next part, which is ,yes , music. The music is decent,but NOT for a damn strategygame. Each track feels so randomly generated that it feels like it doesn’t have anything to do with the gameplay. On some occasions I noticed some type of music that you would normally find in soft porn or lounge bars. Good music,really bad implemented for this type of game.Ultimately I really wanted to like Earth 2140, but it just could not happen. It tries to do several things but accomplishes almost nothing and you are better off with a C&C/Dune/Starcraft like experience when it comes to RTS. This game fell so far behind the back that it really doesn’t deserves such a lengthy review.4/10. Not Recommended. Don’t bother with this one if you cherish your free time!			"

 ""Leadership comes in small acts as well as bold strokes.” Earth 2140 is a solid real-time strategy game with two unique factions, each of them bringing along a decent variety of units and weaponry. Unfortunately the user interface and controls leave something to be desired, resulting in a bit of confusion when you are trying to build and manage your base and units. But the weakest link in the chain is the behaviour of the A.I., and its urge to accumulate as much units as possible around the base, leaving you with the challenging agenda to confront and destroy a massive defense. Especially in the first levels this kind of tactical approach can be frustrating. Nevertheless it remains a classic RTS experience with an interesting unit design and combat system.

												Earth 2140 is probably a good game at its core, but this is an utter crap port.  The AI is bugged, the controls aren't very good (the mouse is kind of floaty and slow), and a lot of common resolutions aren't supported.  Thank goodness I only spent $0.69 on this crap.Get the gog.com version instead.			"

												I would recommend this game only to people who have the patience to get to know it. There is no tutorial or anything like that to help new players, although watching Lets Plays and walkthroughs on youtube was helpful. Once you get over the original 'WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON' phase on first start up, it turns into an enjoyable, fast-paced RTS, even if the AI is a little dumb on normal difficulty. My main criticism, though, is the story. It's barely there and it does a poor job of letting you know what's actually going on. The text screens also show you a blink-and-you'll miss it mission objective, so make sure you give them a proper read.			"

												top: english / bottom: germanOben: Englisch / Unten: Deutsch----------------------------------The AI problem:I've read some posts round the internet and some of them say, that the AI of this game is broken since the XP version (no matter where you buy it now or what version you buy). This means in detail, that the AI is in kinda ""passiv mode"":- it will just attack you, if you attack them (and just the group, you attacked)- no repair at damaged buildings- no build of units or rebuild of destroyed buildingsSo to test, if the AI problem is still in this Steam version, I played the ED till level 4, because there the UCS has for the first time production buildings (one for soldiers and one for vehicles). And I can say:YES, THE AI WORKS IN THIS VERSION :)It was buildings units from both buildings and it was repairing the buildings. But yeah, I didn't checked if this is also positive for the ""rebuilding buildings""-point, because the enemy gets the necessary buildings in level 5 (which is a quite bigger map and it takes time to be able to sandwich the enemy for checking this point). But I am really sure, that the AI is doing this too :)So Yeah, HAVE FUN :D----------------------------------Das KI-Problem:Ich habe überall im Internet davon gelesen, dass die KI in Earth 2140 seit der XP-Version total im♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sein soll (ganz egal, von wo man das Spiel kauft oder welche Version man kauft). Im Detail heisst das, dass die KI quasi im ""Passiv-Modus"" ist:- die KI greift dich nur an, wenn du sie angreifst (und auch nur mit der Gruppe an Einheiten, die du angegriffen hast)- beschädigte Gebäude werden nicht repariert- die KI baut keine Einheiten und baut auch zerstörte Gebäude nicht wieder aufUm also zu testen, ob das auch für die Steam-Version zu trifft, habe ich mit der ED bis Level 4 gespielt, weil dort die UCS das erste mal Gebäude zur Einheitenproduktion besitzt (eines für Soldaten und eines für Fahrzeuge). Und ich kann sagen:JA, DIE KI FUNKTIONIERT IN DIESER VERSION :)Die KI hat von beiden Produktionsgebäuden Einheiten hergestellt und auch beschädigte Gebäude repariert. Ja ok, ich habe nicht kontrolliert, ob die KI auch Gebäude neu baut. Das liegt aber daran, dass die KI erst in Level 5 Gebäude besitzt, die auch selbst Gebäude produzieren können (denn Level 5 ist recht groß und es braucht schon etwas Zeit, bis man den Gegner umzingelt hat, um dieses KI-Problem zu testen). Aber ich bin mir sehr sicher, dass das dennoch zutrifft :)Also dann, VIEL SPAß :D			"

												A good game.  Good tactical depth, good immersion and awesome units.  Lacking some newer RTS features, but still very fun and challenging.  Pathfinding is decent, with the occasional hiccup.  Some bugs still remain, although most are just minor annoyances.  Overall, I really like this game, definitely better than the sequels and definitely more immersive than many modern RTSs which have felt more tame in terms of the feeling of destruction and devastation.

												I know it's an ancient artifact of a game, but I can't handle it regardless. I'm usually pretty good about having an open mind while testing games, but this one is simply poorly designed. The game's age is no excuse. I was alive and well and played Age of Empires and the old Warcraft RTS games when they came out. They were great, and got me hooked on the genre. Went from Warcraft to AoE, to Dawn of War, and various blips online in between.My first and greatest issue is the menu. It's poorly designed, it's sloppy, and there is no clear labeling scheme for anyone who isn't already a veteran. It leaves the user to guess what each button means, and once you choose one to check there is no going back. You picked it. No menu, no known controls. Just go go go. While this would usually be enjoyable in a survival horror game, RTS is a planning sort of game. The excape button does not bring up a menu, and I pressed most buttons on my keyboard just to try to find a menu. There is no in-game menu. So once it's started you either win or lose or CTRL+ALT+DELETE the game to close it if you realize you picked the wrong option.(Edi: Read a while and found there are descrete identical buttons in the hud for different in-game functins. Sorry, but I prefer clearly labeled menus or even regular keyboar shortcuts.)Once you know how to play, the game is just fine. The mechanics are usual for it's era. The AI is usual for it's era. The graphics are usual for it's era. But the first few missions are so dumb I couldn't handle it. I did not have the patience for this game. If you played it years ago and want to see it again, get it on sale and have a great time. If you haven't played it and just want to know what it is, it's not worth the five dollars. I would put a price point of about $0.99 for this game.IF it had a clearly labeled menu where I could select a free-play option, I would have spent much more time exploring and learning the game. But the fact that it started off on a such a bad foot just contriubuted to the whlole grating experience that is Earth 2140.			"

Captains Log, 14.09.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Earth 2140 HD. Old school, Real-time strategy (RTS) game with a strange soundtrack, product placement and many interesting ideas. CHARGE! WHERE? DOES NOT MATTER! YArrrrrrrrrr!First look at the game:  also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]Earth 2140 HD took me back to the times of Command&Conquer, Dune 2000, Z and similar veterans of the RTS genre in a sci-fi and/or future setting. The units acknowledge each command with a military precision. You can go right in, play a mission and feel at home. That is sadly also where the trouble started for me:The game does not do a real tutorial, but you are let in quite easy with a seek and destroy mission. Not having to build a base makes this game easier. You can group your troops, issue a move and even a guard or escort command. But you cannot, or at least I couldn’t figure out how to, give a move-attack command so your units don’t go around ignoring enemies all the time. I read the manual. And I couldn´t figure it out. Damn you game! I wanted to like you! That being said, the path finding in this game is horrible, you own units block each other. That makes sense but lets you throw the towel if you try to maneuver more than one single robot trooper through one of the games winding canyons and tight spots in the general map design. That killed the game for me. Sorry to say that. Maybe I got soft and am not used to micromanage every little twitch of a tank. Maybe it was not very well done in this game. It is just my opinion after all.But, and that is something I find really important to say at this point, this game is not total trash to throw overboard for me. I will rate it in two ways because it is really not an instant NO!!!! which means I will try it again. And the reasons follow.You have AI control options for your own units. This game came out only two years after Command & Conquer. You can construction vehicles which are able to move around until you find a spot and then raise your building there. You have to plan the power usage, you can power off buildings. You can take over buildings. You can self-destruct buildings. You have lots of different units. Land, Sea and Air are part of this warfare apparatus for each of the two factions with different units. There is a lot of promise in those points. I can imagine this being a game where you really need to use tactics instead of just mass producing units and win by sheer force of the mass of units. Especially since you will be unable to move more than 10 units effectively *coughcough* So jeah, this is not an ideal game. It is not on the same level as Command & Conquer. But I will give it a second chance.Look and feel and sound: Earth 2140 HD comes with a soundtrack that features 2 very nice and fitting tracks and 7 tracks that seem to be from a 1988 erotic romantic movie where the director had a thing for saxophones. That means basically every third movie from that time. Even the cop and action movies had those….Damn you 1980! The units acknowledgements are well done and fitting, the battle sound effects like explosions and shots / lasers fired a nicely done. The graphic is a bit underwhelming, especially since most maps are just the rocky ground, some canyons and 4 or 5 trees. And of course the nearly invisible resource called “ore”. Captains Orders: Earth 2140 HD is not so much a game for everybody. It is for fans of the series that know it from back then. It is not good enough to get people new to the series into it though. They should maybe try one of the following titles Earth 2150 or Earth 2160. It is not for the faint of heart, because the soundtrack can kill you and of course you do need special equipment to find resources to mine. It is a hardcore old school RTS with not enough of the obvious good to warrant a recommendation. I will however try it again, because I like pain and second chances.Verdict:Overboard! (For nearly every person on the planet) Cargo! For the tough crowd who likes a nostalgic pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and has fun while trying to manage through this pathfinding hell. And deal with the consequences !For more Reviews visit  CaptNemo's Log[captainnemoweb.wordpress.com]For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit CaptN3mo's twitch channel[www.twitch.tv] "

												DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!I have spent enough time to know that this game is truly the worst RTS game I have ever played.Good points:The graphics are okay as it does not look terrible but I only say okay because the graphics are pretty awful in the CG scenes which is to be expected but there is a difference between trying and laziness and it fits the latter.One song was genuinely good in the soundtrack, when this song came on, I never wanted it to leave as it is catchy and has that RTS feel to it.You can save anywhere because you REALLY need it in this game.aaaannnnnnddd that is about it.Bad pointsThe gameplay: The gameplay does start off like a traditional RTS game with the base building and atacking but after the first few levels, it gets very boring very quickly because building a base is tedious as well as building an army. Building a base is simple enough, find a patch to lay the transport down on to convert it into a building. And that is fine unless your base is getting attacked and for the most part, that happens constantly and it gets even worse by the end making the base building just an absolute chore. To get resources,you must mine which again sounds fine but it is annoying when you do not know where to mine because the game never tells you so you have to get the mine to search around that could actually expose itself to the enemy and it is done for then because the transports move slower than a snail. At least in good RTS games, it actually indicates where you can mine rather than guess so that is poor usability for the player there. Another thing as well is the processing of building an army as it can take up to 1 hours alone to build a huge one and even then, it can get decimated instantly by the enemy but when your army tries that, it barely damages them meaning that your army is as weak as a child and the enemy has as much armour as the fear bullies have on people so it can be done but just in a horrible way. The gameplay is an absolute mess and there have been missions where it has took me 4 hours alone to pass because of how poor the maps are meaning that the levels are longer for no reason.Let me set the scene, there is a map where 75% of it is land and the other 25% of it is water, again sounds fine. Well to get your land troops across water, you have to order these boats where they can only take 1 mech or 6 infantry units so the process is long and the water strech is not far either, we are talking 50 years here and there is even a ledge where at least the infantry could cross but no, it is not the case at all and you have to do the tedium of getting 1 group over, get the boat back to the other side and repeat. I guess I could accept that situation if it was only done in 1 mission but nope, it is set in at least 6 of the missions and cue the anger and the annoyance. Another annoying thing is how the enemy structures are built as there are rocket towers all over some parts of the map in many levels and then you have mines to deal with in the later levels. The devs were seriously mine-happy in this game as there is literally about 50 of them scattered inch by inch to each other and you can only have a miner unit to sweep them but it is as riveting as cleaning rubbish up someone else has made at a club at the end of the night, it is not fun AT ALL. There were even parts where I had to save almost every 5 seconds I did something so I can continue because resources is so limited that it can make a mission go unnecessarily complicated very quickly especially when you are down to your last few units. It is ridiculous and I should not have to do that but nope, I had to do that for several missions.AI: The AI is also awful because the enmy is just cheap because when you are taking over a base, enemies out of nowhere just appear and attack your base so you have to make sure your base is well defended otherwise it can be destroyed very fast by infantry units of all things. The AI for your team however is seriously some of the worst because when you point them to somewhere, they do get there for the most part but there have been loads of instances where the units go a different direction that could expose them or they just do their own thing such as keep moving somwhere which gets them killed and this becomes a lot more common later on in the game making the controls annoying.The music: Like I said before, there was one good song and that was it. Well unfortunately this was the case as there are only 9 songs in the whole game and there is just not enough songs here making the music monotonous very quickly after it's first loop. Unlike in Command And Conquer where you can loop a certain song over and over and the fact that the quality of the music is 100000x better than the music here is non-existent because you can choose a track but you cannot loop it over because it is already on a set path to loop the whole soundtrack over and over again, I am not impressed. And then comes the quality of the music, it is BAD and I mean bad because the songs are either too boring to listen to, too inspired to listen to, or the songs do not fit in the game at all. Seriously the one song sounds like something from a prime time TV programme for old people and does not fit this game AT ALL. If you want to make a soundtrack for an RTS, THEN MAKE IT FITTING BY GETTING THE SONG PUMP YOU UP TO TAKE DOWN THE ENEMY BASES AND NOT SONGS THAT FIT FOR GARDENING SHOWS! The music is awful, concluded.The story: Okay, I was not expecting some deep story but there really isn't one because your faction are taking over countries and that is it. What is bad is the cutscenes as they are pointless since it just shows random artillery doing something and it does not set the scene at all. When you conquer a country (via 5 missions each country), it just takes you back to the world map so you can enter another country and there is no cutscene at the end of each company and it just make me feel so empty and made me feel like I achieved nothing and I wasted my time and I really did because 40 hours on this damn game is overkill! There is just no lore to this game, no background, no idea how it came to two faction in war of each other, absolutely nothing.In conclusion, this game is not only a mess but an absolute disaster as almost nothing comes out of it and just because the price of this game is cheap, it does not mean you should buy it as you should put it on something a LOT better than rubbish. This is easily one of the worst games I have played (and that is saying something as I play lots of games) as it fails to be a RTS game, it fails to be interesting and most of all, it fails to be a playable game.Avoid this at all costs, save your money and save your time as this game just wastes it!0/10 - an absolute piece of turd			"

												Eh I'm too old for this, this might of been an okay game many years ago, just now from playing competitively this won't satiate my appiete for challenge and dynamic gameplay. Screen moves clunky with no real instructions, and too long of a intro, kinda feels like they were trying to make up for lack of gameplay. So it's sorta like starcraft, just doesn't got the uniquie reactions you would get from the characters. Feels really generalized gameplay, almost like a ripped game. Doesn't feel polished, maybe it was for it's day, I got no idea.			"

												Loved 2150 and 2160, so thought I would try 2140...Its very basic in my opinoin to the point of being boring.There is no tutorial that I could find that showed you how to play the game properly, so took me a while to learn it with much googling.			"

												Only a buck? Why not.  I thought maybe it would be better if I went from 2150 to the older game.  After all I've seen plenty of examples where sequals really weren't better.  But this game suffers from the same problems I had with its sequal.  There are no tutorials telling you what the game expects you to just know.That would be fine if it followed the age old procedures of RTS games. But no.  On mission two I couldn't even figure out where to build my mine in order to start base building.  You know even in Warcraft 1 for DOS your peasants knew to start work as soon as they were spawned near enough to a mine. But in the Earth series, I have to micro manage my own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trucks.  Oh well not the worest thing I've played but makes me all the more miffed because of the wasted potential here.P.S. the soundtrack is pretty good. About the only fun I had.			"

												No wonder this went for pennies on the dollar sale! It seems whomever designed this had never played a game much less an RTS game before. I'm guessing this was a mobile app game port to PC even? If not, this is the level of quality of game. This is definitely NOT set up for HD or using on a flat screen even though the resolutions are there...the font all but disappears when you play anything but lowest res. Unfortunately, that also makes the battlefield map zoom in so tight you feel like you're fighting an entire battle using only the view out of a telescope. But if that wasnt bad enough, they put same colored font on top of same colored backgrounds for mission statements...sooo  good luck playing blind as far as background story / mission goals. But that's not really that hard as the battles are so simplistic that you can literally mass clump all your troops into one group and just push them around the screen to clean up everything on the map. There is no point the different units or any use for strategy.  I would have to say, give this one a pass as I dont see how anyone could even waste time as cell phone game much less one meant for PC!			"

												Earth 2140 is old lesser-known Real-Time Strategy that was released in 1997, with Command And Conquer-like approach to design, not unlike many other RTS back then. Released only on computers, original version was DOS version. It was later ported to Windows, with a huge flaw: AI wasn't working properly.So, what Steam version has going for it?Steam version lets you select if you want to play Windows version of ""HD"" version. Main differences are quite simple, HD works more reliably on modern systems. Intro movie was changed as well, scenes mixed around. Multiplayer isn't available in both, you have to search for DOS version for that. It also already comes with 2 mission pack, with 14 missions in total. Got to say, intro movie in the first mission pack is cool.And supposedly, HD version fixes WIndows AI bug. Yet it doesn't, thus you still have a screwed up game.Plot is quite simple. It's that you don't understand anything in intro movie, but it's cool, for it has androids and terminators.Ok, more exactly, it has United Civilized States, which is nation where robots do absolutely everything and people turned into complete ""pigs"", and it has Eurasian Dynasty, which is more of dictatorship using outdated technology of tanks and such. And all of them fighting to take over Earth surface for recources. Pretty much both sides are ""evil"" in their way, which is quite unique.And that's pretty much what you will get, just war, with no real story between missions.And yes, mission objectives are quiet varied, even though majority of them is ""build base, destroy enemy base"". It got you destroying all enemies in map without your own base, finding lost machine, capturing bases, or even has you in the center of the map, with limited recources and surrounded by enemy, making you go offensive immeditly. Also, no skirmish, campaign only.But once you get to more classic ""destroy enemy base"" mission, that is majority, the AI problems will surfrace.Earth 2140 playes like a C&C era game, having you press left mouse button to order units and having building/command/menu commands bar on the side of screen. And a very clunky one at that, controlling with only mouse is quite a chore, better learn some hotkeys. There is no good tutorial, so thsi game will require effort to get into.And yes, it got power plants, it got resources, which you can by building mines (and refinery and then have trucks move boxes around) over the yellow-painted parts of grounds, that you can see only on minimap (or when placing mine)... Jolly.Another unique thing is how research is done. You just build research center and it gets done qutomatically. Can't say that it's a good idea.Both factions get to have their own units, which are kinda different, in looks and a bit in stats, but otherwise fill same niches. There are 4 types of units: soldiers, who are good at dieing in numbers and capturing buildings, venichles/mechs that are the main part of army, water units and air units, which zip around fast. All of them have various weapons, rockets, napalm bombs, laser... though laser ones are the best. But they all seem to be balanced stat-wise. Or not exactly balanced, it's hard to tell. There are no strategy guides and nothing in the game explains what is best for what situation. That, and it may turn out that best tactic is to spam most effective units anyway, seeing game's age.And so comes main flaw with AI in this version, that ruins most of mission into dumb unfun session. He can't go offensive. He will not build new structures. He will repair though. He can't go offensive. He will only attack you once, as if scripted, if you discover him out, but once you do, he will remain defensive. And most importantly, he will produce a huge army for defence without stop, from what I gathered. And that isn't exactly fun, as you have to try to build a bigger army before AI does. Otherwise it will be a continuous attempt to kamikaze your way into, wall onto wall.I will be honest, I didn't figure out how to beat some of these missions.Earth 2140 even had an unique feature that was dependant on AI: Virtual Generals. You could select a bunch of units and then put them under ""General""'s control, making them scout or even attack through the map without you paying attention. I doubt that it had much of use, but in Steam version it doesn't even work at all. Graphics and setting are quite nice for it's time, nothing fancy though. Music on other hand is worth mentioning. It doesn't exactly fit the game. Tracks are nice, but they don't blend in. It got one or more jokish peaceful or jazzy tracks in it, with bird singing. Nice idea, but hearing it among one of few tracks in a game feels quite weird.I can't really say if original DOS version was bad or not, quite possibly I didn't understand this RTS yet, I didn't manage to beat whole campaign after all. And I did have fun here and there, on small maps at least.But what I can say is that it's unfriendly and Steam version's AI refuses to give a fun kind of challenge.If you want to get familiar with this title, you should find it somewhere else, aiming for DOS version.

												Until someone fix AI, it is a piece of sh*t. Because AI atack only once, because AI dont know how to build units. I remeber great strategy game, but i was with enhanced AI...If you want to play Earth 2140 buy it on GOG, they distribute alse old one with integrate DOSbox...			"
