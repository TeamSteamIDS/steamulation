												Fantastic magic game, if only Wizards would make it so that people with 2014 could also use decks from previous versions of magic, that would be awesome !!!probably the best balance of decks in the last 3 years.			"

												I've given MTG 2012 quite a few tries, but ultimately cant recommend it. I want to like it, and when it works properly its even kinda fun, but the amount of things wrong with this game are staggering. Poor UI design AND clunky interface, slow animations, automatically progressing turn timers, dumbing down of well understood mechanics, card logic bugs, autotapping/instacast, lack of proper deck building.. Ultimately some of those design choices can be overlooked. And some card logic issues can be forgiven. But the thing that comes back and kicks you in the face time and time again is the fact that the user interface for this game is just garbage.1: The interface is HORRIBLE. From the main menu design, to the way that cards are displayed in the game. The cards in your hand are nearly too small to read and overlap eachother despite having plenty of room to display. You have to zoom in on nearly every card to read it. You often cant see whats in your hand or on the battlefield due to something obscuring your ability to look at it. Many situations will ask you to make a decision before you've had a chance to either consult your hand or battlefield to figure out how you wish to respond. No key customization either. Mouse controls are pretty terrible too, although its hard to explain why.. everything is just crammed together in such a way that it obscures everything else and makes clicking on things difficult.2: Deck building: You cant. You start with 60 cards in a deck, and you unlock 20 more cards. These cards get AUTOMATICALLY added to your deck after every time you unlock a card.. meaning that for an optimal deck you have to go and remove them from your deck after each and every game. You also cannot select how many land to put in. the deck builder automatically does that for you. Also, scrolling left/right through the deck of cards to remove them is time consuming and tedious. Cant remember if its 2012 or 2013, but if you are zoomed in on a card while trying to build a deck and go to switch cards, it zooms out and then back in for each and every card rather than just instantly flipping.3: The turn and phase timers. (this -mainly- applies to multiplayer but to some degree single player too.) The timer is terrible. Yes its important to make timely decisions, but the timer in this game is frustrating. The turns pass automatically unless you pause them, rather than prompting you to pass priority. When you do 'pass' the turn, then theres still a ~4 second countdown that allows your opponent to interact, even when playing with the AI in multiplayer which chooses not to interact. If you are an MTGO player and try to play MTG2012 you will want to scream at how poor the system feels. Its designed to be newbie friendly as best i can tell.. As someone who was once a newbie to the 2012 planeswalker game, i found it frustrating. As someone was has 30+ hours into it, it still is. Sometimes i find that i cant seem to pause the game at the right time, other times i dont realize that its been paused and sit there like an idiot waiting.4: Interacting with cards at the right times is nearly impossible, its very easy to miss opportunities due to an automatic pass timer rather than a 'finished' prompt as might be found in MTGO. To this day i've never once been able to figure out the proper time to regenerate a creature in MTG 2012. Logically you would regenerate it after it takes damage, does MTGO bring up a prompt and ask you if you'd like to regenerate it during/after combat damage is being assigned? Nope.5: Triggered effects: Many cards give your entire team triggered effects. Such as any time a creature enters the battlefield, gain one life. Each time this effect triggers, theres a 3-5 second animation that plays. Each time a creature lifelinks, 3-5 second animation. Having 2-3 creatures that get +1/+1 counters each time you gain life, and multiple creature with lifelink, 3-5 second disruption per creature, per lifelink. I've literally had turns against the AI where i walk away for a minute or two at a time while waiting for trigger animations to resolve. I can understand why this kind of system is in place, however this can make a game that should take 15-20 minutes, take well over an hour, sometimes two. Theres no such thing as a fast turn, especially not against the AI.6: Cards on the field which have enchantments or equipment on it are near impossible to sort through or to target and require pixel perfect accuracy, especially those that are stacked with multiple enchantments. Double that difficulty for cards with flying that bounce up and down as you try to click on the 2-3 pixel wide card just barely sticking out from the side of your other. If you dont get the target right the first time you dont get a second chance when targeting.7: Selecting the right card in your hand (or from your deck/graveyard when searching) with the mouse can be very tricky. Theres a very narrow window of where the center of the card is Its about 1/3 the card's width. Its incredibly easy to bump the mouse and cast the wrong spell. The deck builder has the same problems. Theres enough room at the bottom of the screen for the cards to be bigger, and to not overlap so significantly. Considering that a click means autocast, you better get it right the first time.8: Tapping land is done automatically and the auto-tapper can and will screw you. This not being a toggled option for players baffles me. Considering all the issues with the interface though.. maybe this is actually some sort of blessing in disguise. Typically im going to say no, its not.9: The time between when one game ends and when the next one begins can be fairly lengthy with unnecessarily long pauses and loading screens. When you win or lose a game you are stuck at the 'game over' screen for what seems like 10-15 seconds before it sends you back to the menu. When trying to do the puzzle challenges this was exceptionally infuriating, one accidental click that you cant take back and there goes 30-45 seconds of restarting ontop of all the time you wasted with unskippable animations and such. There is nothing at all in this game that is fluid, fast, or free flowing.10: The AI. In multiplayer the AI is fairly bad. Playing two headed giant with a friend where the enemy had literal unblockable creatures during a semi-stalemated board, it only attacked with them once or twice. Apparently if you get enough creatures on the board the AI will just stop attacking entirely even when it has the advantage. Having many creatures with two unblockables that could continue to do damage turn after turn and who wouldnt be viable defenders; the AI just sits there turn after turn. Perhaps it simply does not understand unblockable, Or perhaps its incapable of functioning properly in a multiplayer experience or with so many units on the board. As far as i can recall it seemed to be a decent opponent in single player, mostly.11: Bugs: Bugs that cause the host of a multiplayer game to get disconnected from his own game. Bugs that cause you to be unable to cast spells on your own turn, bugs that break the interface in some regard and cause you to be incapable of continuing your match, bugs that stop you from being able to swap out of and into the game.Couple all the bugs with the relatively awful UI, the dumbed down 'user friendly' systems, and slow and general clunkiness of the game and honestly the experience feels pretty unsatisfying overall. The only redeeming quality of this game is that its one of only a few modern MTG games that has a single player component to it. And i -believe- its the only modern magic release (2012-2014) that has the arch nemesis game mode, which is actually quite fun.			"

												DotP 2012 is a huge step up from the previous failure ""Duel of the Planeswalkers"" (2009) which was a terrible direct port from XBL. While much has been fixed from 2009's release, with improved graphics, UI, and controls, DotP 2012 still struggles to properly emulate the actual Magic: The Gathering card game. The devs are so bent on keeping the players from editing their own decks that they purposefully include simplistic and poorly designed decks. Many decks are binary with boring win conditions and are missing their color's most basic traits, with unlocks only adding bigger numbers and not wider options. However, compared to DotP 2013 and 2014, I think overall this has the best decks. Besides the boring deck design, the real problem with the decks is the unlock system: although you only have to unlock 20 cards total and multiple can be unlocked at once, they lock you out of all the best cards. As you get deeper into the campaign, you are basically forced to continue using one deck, backtrack (or play MP) to ""grind"" to unlock more, or pay to unlock a deck. This problem is most visible in the Revenge campaign, where your opponents have every card unlocked in every duel.So what makes DotP 2012 worth picking up? It has the best game modes out of the three numbered releases; Archenemy is great fun because of the wildly powerful effects of the Archenemy's deck, even just with (or against!) AI. With all the expansion decks, 2012 also has the most decks available at 19 total. My favorite are Dark Heavens (B/W angels & tokens) and Ancient Depths (G/U mana ramp & eldrazi). Despite the multiplayer bugs and lag issues, I think this is the best DotP game available and is the best intro to MTG for new players.			"

												A much simpler remake of the older ""Magic The Gathering: Online"" game.  There's not as much deck customizeability as there was in the first online version of the game, but there's also not any microtransactions or money sink either.  So if you're looking for MTG without the headache of having to purchase & trade your way to an awesome deck (or ten) then this game's going to be everything you're looking for.  If your favorite part was the deck building, then you might not like the way MTG went with this iteration.If you've never played MTG (online or physical) then it's a card game that set the standard for card games.  If you like strategic card games and simple math, then this game's perfect for you.  It ramps up pretty quickly, but this iteration of MTG:O does a better version of showing you the ropes than previous versions and/or your buddy would.			"

												I bought this game when it first came out and it was fun whilst it lasted. Now there's never anyone online and the decks are broken. See*It will never replace face to face MTG but for a few quick ""5"" minute sessions that can turn into hours it was, at the time money well spent.*However since the last update all the decks I purchased (downloadable content) have now re-locked themselves and I refuse to spent anymore money paying for something I have already purchased. It is a bug that has not been fixed and Steam are willing to sell you a faulty product and therefore i cannot recommend this game, I advise you to steer clear.			"

												While the single player is fun, the multiplayer leaves much to be desired. Filled with endless bugs, the creators seem more interested in making profit than releasing a good product.If you are only interested in running the campaign, its definitely something I would recommend, however if you are interested in playing your friends stay far away from this version and upgrade to a newer version like 2014 which seems to have been vastly improved over its predecessors.Randomly the game will simply crash without any explaination. When searching for a reason, you will find an error log full of problems even before the crash, all of which never seem to be addressed even to this day.The game is slow, and by slow I mean, I felt my beard growing while waiting for the game to figure out what it was doing. During multiplayer games, it would simply freeze and take actions back, clearly having sync issues. You would repeat the process over and over to no avail, and do something else to find it would either work or the game would have to be quit in order to continue anything else.My friends and I had to quit several games in the middle of combat because of these issues, this led to simply getting a newer version.Because Magic the Gathering is meant to be played with other people, sadly I cannot recommend this game for the reasons I have previously outlined.

												I play this, I enjoy it, but it annoys me every time I play.Cheating AI.  When you win, its because of luck, not skill.AI always has a good hand, and always has it from the start.  Examples being, game starts and AI gets a card that immediately gives them 7 creatures, or they somehow have a handful of 0 cost artifacts from the beginning.  You on the other hand may be stuck with a handfull of lands, and it may take several rounds just to get 1 creature out.			"

												Offers plenty of content for newbies-to-intermediate MTG players. If you're a long time MTG player who's looking for a similar experience online though - you won't find it here; the customization aspect of deck building in this game is quite limited. Give it a shot if you're into card games or if you're a new MTG player who wants to learn/practice the basics. Word of warning if you're gonna get this game: Almost all of the DLCs do NOT offer additional content (except for the expansion and Deck Packs #1,2 &3 ) as you are still able to get most of the unlockables by progressing in the campaign.

												It's Magic, baby! Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 is a very competent port of the titular trading card game, despite some limitations.Players will quickly discover that they are only able to make mild changes to pre-constructed decks, only being able to remove cards from decks or add one or more cards from a set of unlockable cards tied to each deck.That being said, the pre-built decks are fun to use, and there is quite a diverse selection of these decks to satisfy most tastes.The game contains worthwhile single-player modes and a bunch of multi-player modes. You'll be able to duel strangers online, play co-op against stupidly lucky AI, play free-for-alls and the like.If you already play Magic, you will be instantly familiar with the gameplay. If not, the game does well enough to teach you the basics, as this game is meant to introduce newcomers to Magic: The Gathering.Recommended for fans of, and newcomers to Magic: The Gathering. It's good stuff.			"

												I recommend that Wizards actually make this into an ACTUAL TCG instead of a fake fraud/magic the gathering online pusher.  Yes, it is a 20 hour tutorial on how to play magic, yes you have to BUY EVERYTHING just to get a decent deck, and yes this is a TCG where you cannot actually build your own deck.It is Pathetic to see this game in such a state.  Magic is a wonderful TCG, but the layered horrible controls, bad interface, and extremely terrible price model make this something to avoid.  Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pokemon, and even spending 50 dollars in actual magic cards would be a better option.DO NOT BUY ANY MAGIC: THE GATHERING - DUELS UNTIL THEY CHANGE THIER WAYS!			"

												If you have ever played magic the gathering; you will get almost the same experience from this adaptation. You start out with 1 plains deck and soon begin unlocking more as you progress through the campaign; each deck allows you to customize it and has 16 unlockable cards. Keeping it simple; the deck manager doesn't allow you to create your own deck(Let's say I wanted a green and white; which is not availible). Now this is may be a bit of a downside when compared to the actual physical card game; the decks are arranged well enough that it shouldn't matter in the long run.Various modes from Custom Games(two-headed giant, free for all, archenemy), 3 different campaign(basically one-on-one, archenemy, one-on-one again but with a better deck and slightly smarter AI), and multiplayer.Overall the game is decent and fairly entertaining; I just wish that you had a ""card vault"" to store all the cards you have and pick in chose to put into a deck.

												I was just looking at my games for a moment and saw this old thing. I remember thoroughly enjoying this game. I'd play it after school all the time back in the 10th grade. It's been quite a while since then but I still recommend it. I never got too deep into the multiplayer. I mostly just enjoyed collecting cards and doing single-player. It was all quite fun though. Over the years I tried 2013, 2014, and the free to play MTG game too. None of them compare to the amount of fun I had with this one. Maybe I was just burnt out by the time I got to those but I also sensed something that just felt better with this one... I can't say for sure why that is but MTG 2012 is my favorite. One of the reasons I decided to leave this review is that I noticed I had 182+ hours racked up on this game. I honestly had no idea I spent that much time on it for it never felt like a chore. I was just having fun the entire time. You'll also see a sizable 80+ hours on 2013 and then 2014 dropped to about 30. The free to play one had so many issues I couldn't be bothered. I've enjoyed them all, aside from the f2p one I suppose, but MTG 2012 is my favorite. If you're interest in the series, there's no better place to start than here in my opinion.			"

												Okay, I finally gave this game a fairly thorough playthrough. It's not as bad as I first thought, and actually became somewhat enjoyable.I must note some key features that aren't outright stated:-Biggest problem is the lack ot total deck construction. Instead you are given an extra 30-card sideboard that is specific to each deck. On the bright side, this forces you to try out decks you might not have considered to begin with, and aren't inclined to make the same deck over and over.-Be wary of the DLCs and other optional junk. Most just unlock stuff you could already earn in-game. In fact, this was a major problem I had -- once unlocked, you cannot re-lock them. I *wanted* to earn my cards at the end of battle, but that was not available to me since they were all already unlocked.Overall, I enjoyed it. For the price of a $10 starter deck of cards, you get a reasonable  digital Magic experience. I actually prefer the 1997 Microprose Magic though. I give this an 8/10			"

												Solid tutorials, great decks, fantastic game modes, and stable multiplayer make this the best Magic game to come out.  Magic 2012 and it’s Archenemy gamemode are the standard on which the rest of the games in the magic series should be evaluated against.  It’s better than 2013 or 2014 – so buy and play this one first before trying the other games.  $20 is a fair price for the 60+ hours of enjoyment you will get out of this game (and I had never even played the card game before purchasing this game).

I don't know if I should recommend it or not. You know what, I'm going to it anyway, because it's not a bad game at all, and it didn't frustrate me once. It was mostly my own fault I guess. So do what you want with this mini review.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												This wasn't the first time that Magic: The Gathering was ported on PC, but I own most of the PC ports of the past and even current editions.It's fast and easy to learn yet hard to master. If you like trading cards, you'll probably will also like this game. There are different possibilities to play this game, you might try out the campaign, or just try to beat a challenge, you might try to fight against the Archnemesis (with two other ai, or hosted with other players online), You might try to fight against your foes with more versatile decks on the Revenge, or become yourself an archnemesis with shemes to work.Each part of the game can be either challenging or easy, that depends either on your deck, your playstyle and your balancing. You will gain 20 new cards for each deck you play, but to gain them you have to be victorious agains opponents (yes, you can beat the same ""opponent"" several times to do so, but allways playing against the same deck probably will bore you off soon). The first challenges are pretty much self explanatory and very easy. Others need planing ahead, and very intense knowledge of the game mechanics on Magic: The Gathering (for example that you can use Mana activated powers or others several times in just one combat round).The game is fun to play, and it even doesn't get boring after you played the campaign mode. But you'll be needing other people who still play the 2012 Edition of that game to reach the multiplayer achievements. So if you have some friends who also might like to play magic - try to buy several copies of it, and gift it to them... or let them gift it to you.			"

												This game does not allow you to build your own deck, but you can play with a dozen or so pre-designed decks with random limits on what cards of the same type can be in it.  It also crashes, displays card graphics improperly, and cuts off the edges of the screen so you cant see or use cards on the side of the playing field.  also it is very difficult to select or view enchantments on flying creatures.

												It's... kinda poorly implimented, to be honest. At least for singleplayer anyway. Matches take longer than they should because the game likes making you wait to see if you want to do something... even if there's nothing you can do. There's three modes: 1v1, 2v2, and a sucky version of Archenemy, which is... pretty limited, if you actually like the non-standard modes.			"

												This game had a big influence over me deciding to get into the actual trading card game. The game is easier to figure out than you would think, and Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 makes learning the game mechanics and terminology even easier. All it took was the tutorial within the demo to make me go out and buy a pile of cards. This is considered the ultimate TCG, and I'd say that that is justified, having played various different TCGs in my time (Yu-gi-oh!, Duel Masters, Pokemon, Naruto, Digimon). Now that I think about it, this is the longest-running TCG on the market, and it didn't need a children's cartoon to be successful, and that should say something. It didn't take long for some of my friends to jump on the Magic train when I introduced them to it, and it's always good to have friends to play a TCG with.So if you have any interest at all in trading card games, go download the demo.

												Overall a cost-effective version of Magic in digital form.  Very limited amount of cards.  I would not suggest buying this simply because of all the DLC.  Most notably the foil packs, and instant deck unlocks.  I just can't stand by those concepts of paying extra for shiny cards that make the game lag.  Or paying instantly for a full deck unlock bypassing the challenge of unlocking cards in the first place.  Can I pay for a victory screen DLC also?Most imporatantly Deck Pack 2 Forest Fury deck is broken for many customers.  Unlocked cards will be reset to 0/20 by exiting the game and restarting the next time one plays.  Seems to be no motivation to ever fix this so I can't recommend paying for this title at all.  Not sure if the Forest Fury problem is a Steam or Stainless Steel Games issue.Remove the digital DLC fireworks called shiny foil cards, Instant win DLC for each deck, and the Forest Fury problem and you have a respectable product for a good price.

												This is nothing compared to the physical card game but is an easy way to learn how to play. I'd recommend it to anyone curious about MtG and why it is one of the largest collectable card games to date. There are some fun modes in this version and always nice to be able to play when no one is available to play. Major draw backs are lack of fully customizable decks (you unlock cards for each deck but can not build a deck from scratch), and sometimes stack effects and other technical actions seem bugged at times.

												Magic: The Gathering, for those who aren't familiar with Nerd Culture, is the collectible card game in the vein of Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh where nerds take a break from reality and pretend to be powerful 'Planeswalkers' able to cast devastating spells and summon powerful creatures (not to be confused with Streetwalkers who have very different powers). They do this by buying lots and lots of cardboard cards with pretty pictures of (sometimes scantily clad) women in dramatic poses. There are cards of other fantasy-type things too but nobody cares about them. The winner is usually the nerd with the most expensive cards although there is some minor element of strategy and luck involved.The creators of Magic (who may or may not have been sober at the time) once declared that they wanted Magic to become a classic game like Chess. Chess of course is a symmetric game of pure strategy with no element of luck whatsoever and rules that have remain unchanged for hundreds of years. Magic on the other hand is an asymmetric game of luck, ephemeral rules, endless erratas and sore losers who complain about top decking. Given the huge role luck plays in Magic, it has a pedigree more in common with Snakes and Ladders than Chess. Also, Chess doesn't make you buy new pieces every month (unless you really want to).The computerised Magic 2012 is really Magic-Lite, offering only a subset of the Magic TCG and serving shamelessly as an enticement to lure unsuspecting nerds into playing Magic Online or the Magic TCG. For fans of the genre it's worth getting in a sale for the occasional Magic fix.			"

												If you are like me and play or have played in the past a lot of magic with real cards, don't miss out on this game. I'm going to start out with Multiplayer which is fun as long as you don't mix it up with DLC decks which are way too strong in my opinion and ruin the balance in-game. Campaign is something you will want to check out but in the end you’ll just go through the same enemy over and over again to farm your decks and go play Multiplayer with your friends. Archenemy and two-headed giant are well put and I can guarantee you it will be one of your favorite features in-game. So don't wait any longer grab the game and go play it with your friends because if nothing else it shines in Multiplayer for the great score of 7/10.			"

Archenemy mode is overwhelming at first, but it grew on me after a while—keep in mind your AI allies use your personalized versions of the decks, so it's a great incentive to play them all to unlock cards.

												Needing a break from Skyrim, this game was a perfect fit.  I have never played  Magic before this game and I am starting to really enjoy it.  The game itself is of course simply a computer version of the card game, complete with beautiful high resolution artwork on zoomable cards.  The art style is pervasive throughout the game.  Gameplay is quite complex (which is why I have not attempted the card game)  however the game manages the framework allowing you to focus on strategy, and the single player campaign and challenges start easy and unfold at a nice pace.  I did get all the DLC which has made the game a bit easier right off the bat with more powerful decks and cards available.  However, the need for sound strategy is undiminished.  Highly recommended.			"

It's a 3 on 1 match where the single player is the archenemy, although it's a real shame that the player cannot be the archenemy and try out the cool new scheme cards that the archenemy draws each turn, giving him massive bonuses against his 3 opponents.

												This game is fun and probably a really good intro into magic if your a beginner and want to learn, but overall compared to playing an actaul game its kind of restrictive. Like you cant really make your own deck, you select pre-made decks, you might be able to swap some cards in and out but its just not the same. Also I think a big rip off are those 'foil conversion decks', foil cards ARE normally really cool but not in digital form. its just.. digital..			"

												2012 review: Outstanding casual game, provided you have some interest in a card game. It's pick up and play which is the best thing about it - no deck configuration required. If you grew up playing Magic like I did, I think you will enjoy this as I do.2015 update: I am frustrated with all the different versions of Magic: the Gathering on PC and have a difficult time recommending any of them, let alone investing in them myself. At this point I think it makes a lot more sense to switch to Hearthstone since you know that Blizzard won't be abandoning it in a year with an entirely new Hearthstone 2016 product.			"

												This is a great game - as all of the Duels of the Planeswalkers games are. They're an inexpensive way to enjoy playing Magic: The Gathering. Just a head's up however, to anyone thinking about buying this game: They enemy decks are not randomized - - meaning if you are playing any of the the Campaign modes, your decks are always randomized, but the AI's are not. As soon as you lay down a card or combo that will quickly win you the game, the enemy always pulls a card or combo that will take you down - every single time. It is infuriating & horribly unbalanced. Would you play a game of Magic in real life against someone who could pick any card out of their entire deck at any time for any play they wished?If this doesn't bother you, then you'll enjoy MTG:DotP 2012 (or any other year/version)			"

It has everything you have grown to love. 2012 brings some needed improvement upon the first DotP such as real online MP support and (finally) a deck editor.Sadly, I can only say you will like this due to the fact that it has a deck editor and not a deck creator. You can not make your own custom white/green deck for example. You can only add and/or remove cards that you have unlocked (which at the moment is about 7).7/10			"

												Ah yes...a childrens card game. lol well not really. This isnt your typical Yu-Gi-Oh/Pokemans game. This is legit strategy up the @$$. Although you cant really fully customize and make your own deck in this game, Magic 2012 still has plenty to offer. You not only get a campaign but several different multiplayer modes and challenges along the way, teaching you strategy and the basics on several types of card effects. The game can get a tad repetative at times, considering that you cant make your decks but if that happens, switch to multiplayer and play some free for all, 2vs2, or 3vs1 and you've got a great card game. Beginners interested in the card game should definitely start with this game. Not a bad investment at all ^_^			"

I never had so much fun playing Archenemy with other players. You wouldn't believe the whining and griping because someone or myself played a certain card.

												I always enjoyed Magic the Gathering, I just never had the desire to spend money on the cards or spend hours finding people to play with (IRL or online). This was a perfect solution for my casual card game needs. Its fun, and has a great archenemy mode where you take on 3 people at the same time (with sexy results!)Only downside is the same as its predecessor, it auto taps your mana. Most of the time the game makes good choices, but if you have a tricky plan, or want a specific pool of mana sometimes it just makes a bonehead move that gets you mashed (without sexy results)			"

												Fun for the nostalgia, and you can have about 20 different decks for the price of the game. The interface works well, but the main flaw is that you cannot choose which lands to use when you cast a spell. Also, a huge drawback is that you're stuck with the pre-built decks. You can customize them but only by removing cards from them, not by adding any, so you're stuck with the combos chosen by the developers. The online works, but no one is there. If you can find friends to play with, it's great fun though, and there's a 3-player coop story mode that's very fun.			"

												Duels is an adaptation of the Magic card game, and I've enjoyed it. You select a pre-made deck to play with, beat AI opponents, and get more cards to add to the deck. The AI is mostly competent (unless, of course, they're your allies), and some of the matches can get pretty challenging.In this version, they added the ability to swap out cards you don't like, and that's a huge upgrade from the previous version. Also new are Archenemy games, where one deck uses ""schemes"" to take on multiple opponents, and these are mostly fun, though often frustrating and too luck-based.The music and sound effects are bad. I turned them off.I think it's worth it for $10. You can get a lot of playtime out of this, and the variety of decks keep the game interesting. If Magic sounds even slightly interesting, give it a try.The bonuses in the Special Edition aren't worth it. The foil conversions are just cosmetic, the game's music isn't good, and you can find the comics online for free.			"

												New to the series, I didn't expect to be able to gather the mechanics of MTG so quickly. As a long-time Yu-Gi-Oh player, it took a while to train my brain out of some of their rules, but once I did I found myself equally addicted. I can't speak for all MTG players old and new, but my recommendation is so far based on pickupability, and the insane levels of detail the game goes into.It's your classic card game you've come to love; we know that. The graphics for the cards are as always beautiful but what really sets it up for me is the amount of freedom I have in choosing what style and play type I want. From deck customization to multiplayer to co-op, there's no level of restrictions. I need more time to play to be able to critique it fairly, but I know i'll be thoroughly impressed as I am now. I've become a MTG convert, which speaks for itself. (Also, what an amazing opportunity Wizards of the Coast are giving to freelance concept artists.)			"

												Hey, this game rocks! A great sequel to the first 'Duels', and still one of the best in the series. I love the decks and game modes offered. This installment fine tunes the control and operation of the dueling environment from the first game, but removes the table and background customization (still looks better than 2014). I recommend the Gold version, the extra decks and expansion are awesome. The music is lacking; repetitve and sometimes annoying. Just a minor complaint. I say turn it off or down and throw on your own beats. Get it if you like the cardboard version, or the other 'Duels' games. Sadly, after 2013, the series drops off (in my opinion).			"

												When I feel like to play MTG. I find myself playing this game. It is because of it's beatiful soundtracks. 2013 doesn't include soundtracks as good as this one. This game is special. Soundtracks so good that they pull you into the game. I recommend this game to anyone willing to play MTG game without a doubt.			"

												Not as good as the real thing, but great if you want to get your MTG fix and have no one to play with.  The decks are pre-built but very flavorful and fun to play.  It's not perfect but for the price of a few real life booster packs you can get many hours of enjoyment with a huge variety of cards, a lot of bang for your buck!			"

												Fun game, fixed most of the past errors they had on this platform, decks are generally better built.  The game sorely needs an option to stop the timer, other than that quite a bit better than the last one and with new fun modes that add great fun and replayability. 80/100 The options to open / unseal the decks may be worth it since there are quite a bit of decks.

												New to the series, I didn't expect to be able to gather the mechanics of MTG so quickly. As a long-time Yu-Gi-Oh player, it took a while to train my brain out of some of their rules, but once I did I found myself equally addicted. I can't speak for all MTG players old and new, but my recommendation is so far based on pickupability, and the insane levels of detail the game goes into.It's your classic card game you've come to love; we know that. The graphics for the cards are as always beautiful but what really sets it up for me is the amount of freedom I have in choosing what style and play type I want. From deck customization to multiplayer to co-op, there's no level of restrictions. I need more time to play to be able to critique it fairly, but I know i'll be thoroughly impressed as I am now. I've become a MTG convert, which speaks for itself. (Also, what an amazing opportunity Wizards of the Coast are giving to freelance concept artists.)			"

												Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 is a great game if you want to get into the world of Magic the Gathering. Pretty much every mechanic is explained and there are a lot of decks to play with. The only problem with it is that you can't build your own decks, and some decks use different types of mana, but you are not allowed to pick which types of mana to use for casting a spell. Great game otherwise. Got me into the real card game. Very fun.			"

												A great introuction to the highly addictive world of ""Magic: The Gathering"". It'll feel slightly restrictive if you're used to being able to put together entirely custom decks, but it does provide you with a good supply of basic decks that you can tweak here and there for optimum efficiency.It also makes learning the rules of the proper paper game very simple as you're automatically blocked from playing illegal moves/cards and it offers up an explanation of why you're not allowed to do it.Multiplayer is a blast, although expect to get battered until you can unlock some of the more powerful cards for each deck.

												I've never played an online card game, and after this one I don't think I will again. This game is great fun for like the first 10 minutes. After those first few minutes it starts to get real boring as you'll be doing the same thing over and over. Single Player is only useful to unlock new cards, which you will need for later single player games and for multiplayer. Multiplayer is where this game is at. The only downfall is that this game has a very small player base. At the most I only saw 5-8 games in the lobby at one time. Overall, the gameplay is alright, sound is reasonable but nothing special, graphics are alright. For a game that costs only $10 on steam, you get what you paid for, to bad what you paid for isn't that good.5/10			"

												I have played the physical Magic the gathering only a little, and I never really got caught up in it, but when presented in a limited digital format I became almost addicted. Me and my friend played this game way too much, trying to outmanoeuvre each others favourite decks. It's a fun game, you grind a bit in single-player to unlock your cards, and then the real fun comes when you try to crush your mates. Of course, being Magic, it is heavily luck-based, much comes down to how many lands you get early (and in this version you cant control how many lands you have in your deck, I think that is possible in the ""real"" game), but the matches are short and intense so one bad game is no big thing. All in all, a great digital and more ""bite-sized"" version of a vast card game, recommended to anyone who wishes to try out magic before purchasing real cards, or just to anyone who wishes to play a card game without having to buy a bunch of cards and do all the collecting for it (like myself).

												Don't buy it simply on the basis that you can't chose what lands to tap, not only that there are lots of bugs. No online play since nobody plays the game anymore and the computer does ilegal moves or doesn't take into account the stack 100% of the time. (Such as I had an enchantment on the board that allows that everytime a creature I control enters the battlefield you may choose to deal damage to target creature or player and the AI used an instant to destory my creature and didn't let the enchantment effect to trigger. Even if my creature is killed it enters the battlefield since it wasn't directly countered, so the effect triggers o.o)This game with the gold version is worth around 5 euro imo, max 7 and I bought it for 20 euro. NOT WORTH IT. Buy 2013 instead or 2014. 2014 is best out of all the games by far. Magic 2014 is well worth the money.Hope this helped			"

												This is probably my favourite MTG game above all others. It can have a very steep curve, but once you start collecting all of the planeswalker decks, and find a few you like, the game gets immediately enjoyable. So just try to stick with it.This is a very light & direct approach to MTG but it can be as complex and challenging as you wish it to be. I only had a casual interest in MTG when I was younger, but wanted to try it out again as an adult. The problem was I didn't have anyone to play it with. So this was a nice alternative. What ended up happening was I reintroduced my brothers to MTG and now it's something we all love to play. Thanks to this game!			"

												I bought this game because I wanted to be a nerd like those kids in highschool. Anyway, it taught me how to play Magic; and it's fun in co-op. Unfortunatly, I suck♥♥♥♥♥and I get powned in singleplayer. But it's in good fun! My biggest problem with this game however, is that it doesn't let you CREATE your own decks; it merely gives you some pre-defined decks and lets you swap a few special cards.			"

												Fun game, fixed most of the past errors they had on this platform, decks are generally better built.  The game sorely needs an option to stop the timer, other than that quite a bit better than the last one and with new fun modes that add great fun and replayability. 80/100 The options to open / unseal the decks may be worth it since there are quite a bit of decks.

												You don't have to be an experienced Magic card player in order to appreciate this game. It is a very addictive digital version of the Magic: The Gathering card game. The campaign itself is a series of games versus varying decks with generally progressive difficulty. There are a few bugs in the game, but overall I'm pleased with its stability and replay value. It is most fun playing with friends. The campaign is virtually non-existent, and it isn't much for graphics or sound, but for active imaginations it has the potential to be a rewarding gameplay experience. This digital version is much easier to figure out how to play so the learning curve is fairly small. I recommend it at its current price to people who have any interest in the game already. If you have doubts, wait for it to go on sale.			"

												Magic: The Gathering — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 - игра без сюжета. Здесь не нужно делать моральный выбор и мучиться из-за его последствий. Все построено на чистой стратегии и тактике. Эта компьютерная игра, созданная по мотивам известнейшей настольной карточной игры, основной идеей которой является создание собственной колоды, включающей как отдельных существ, так и всевозможные заклинания, ауры и артефакты. Собранная колода проходит испытание боем, благодаря которым Вы получаете новые карты и можете модифицировать колоду. Очень важным элементом любой колоды является их синергетичность, а проще, способность ""работать"" вместе, усиливая друг друга. Когда любой начинающий игру в MTG впервые осознает важность этого элемента ему становятся доступны большое количество произвольных стратегий, которые он волен сочетать. Действительно, оппонента можно медленно ""обескровить"", отбирая жизненные очки на каждом шаге или напасть мгновенно, уничтожая большую часть армии на поле. Можно просто заставлять сбрасывать карты на кладбище. Стратегий уйма. Найти свою, подходящую только Вам, не составит никакого труда. Однако надо иметь в виду, что оппоненты тоже отличаются, и не факт, что с активной мега-колодой на руках можно будет его сразу одолеть (на исход боя оказывают влияние и колода противника с его собственной стратегией ведения боя и начальный набор собственных карт, который определяется случайно и может неприятно удивить). MTG — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 - игра не для всех. Но если она зацепит, будьте уверены, избавиться от подобной привязанности Вы уже не сможете и через какое-то время обязательно захотите собрать свою, уже настоящую, а не виртуальную, первую колоду MTG.

												Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 is a great game if you want to get into the world of Magic the Gathering. Pretty much every mechanic is explained and there are a lot of decks to play with. The only problem with it is that you can't build your own decks, and some decks use different types of mana, but you are not allowed to pick which types of mana to use for casting a spell. Great game otherwise. Got me into the real card game. Very fun.			"

												If you played magic as a kid this game will satisfy ones urge to play magic again.  It plays exactly like magic, a little slow at times but nothing to bad.  The various decks in the game have enough variety to match what ever style deck you enjoyed the most.      The AI is decent enough, not as good as playing other people but good enough for a quick fix.  All and all its a fun return to the Magic of childhood.Sadly you can not build your own decks out of the other decks, you can only choose which cards are in or out of a specific deck.  It's done to keep online play balanced I suppose but its a bit of a let down.			"

Questionable challenges, rather skillful AI (on the hardest difficulty.... well for me anywho) and the new Archenemy gamemode.Admittedly the Duels of the Planeswalkers Series is a good start for people interested in getting into MTG. The over simplification which probably feels somewhat repulsive to MTG veterans, can make the introduction into the multi-verse a lot less painful.There is online multi and co-op, but sadly no local co-op anymore.It's still no Shandalar...

												This game is a pretty obvious review, if your a fan of the card game you will like this if you are not or havint heard of Magic The Gathering: The Card game you will probly have no interest in this. Its a card game with nice graphics and ok sound. my biggest complaint was that the text can be crazy small sometimes. Id say pick it up if your a fan of the magic series in general or card games as a whole, otherwise skip this and  find a local cardshop and play the real deal sometime first. 8/10			"

												If you were ever into Magic the card game, this game is for you. It may not have the deck building, but fear not - it is still worth it. All the available decks are well balanced (which is why there is no deck building).  No deck seems grossly overpowered and can beat any other deck.  An entertaining venture if you are new or old to Magic.			"

												Wizards got it right when they reworked Duels for 2012. Nice slick interface. Much improved deck editing which resembles real deck crafting and fun online multi-player with friends. I wouldn't be suprised if this game earned Wizards tons of new paper Magic players. It's so accessible to the new player it's not funny. For $9.99 you can full experience what Magic has to offer and you're going to want more (and that's what Wizard's is banking on). Would be super cool if they could add new games modes like Commander to the game.			"

												Magic and Magic Online are relatively expensive because you have to pay actual money for cards. If you want the fun of Magic without the expense of buying a lot of cards, this is a good game. It has fixed some of the problems plaguing the previous version (push-to-talk mics, team-based multiplayer not requiring a team to be at the same computer) but still retained some of the problems (no text chat, auto-selection of mana to tap.) Overall, it's not bad, but the netcode can be pretty wonky at times.			"

												If you have never played the card game MAGIC before then this game will be foreign to you and it can get really frustrating after awhile. There is so much to this game as to the depth of play and strategy that goes into playing the game of MAGIC. You can win a match with one move and loose it the same way. While playing you can be ruthless while killing your opponent slowly, or fast and quick. This game does teach you how to play the game but there is so much to leave about it that its sometimes overwhelming when you see how many cards there are to learn and learn how to counter each card. The graphics with this game are perfect and fit the game well. The gameplay  is just right and doesn't keep you hanging for to long to make a move. You can play hard matches were its 3 vs 1 or freeforall, there are alot of modes to play and you can customize matches. This game depicts the card game of MAGIC perfectly.  I have loved playing and if your a MAGIC nerd like me then you'll love it too.			"

												-Game is no longer supported or updated by the developers.-Can't select which lands you want to tap.  It auto selects your mana, which is obviously bad when you are playing multi-color decks.-Uses Core set cards which are traditionally boring.			"

												This is the version of MTG to play if you don't feel like spending tons of money and/or just want a chillax game to play. Also a neat introductory tool to Magic if you or someone you know is interested.For MTG veterans, this is at best a ""chill mode"" with precons and slight restrictions like auto-mana-tap. For newbies or old returning players, this is a nice entry point.I personally enjoy it because the AI doesn't ♥♥♥♥♥ at me for taking my time because I'm that kinda guy. Also because I don't have to spend much, although I do miss my paper magic.			"

												I've never played an online card game, and after this one I don't think I will again. This game is great fun for like the first 10 minutes. After those first few minutes it starts to get real boring as you'll be doing the same thing over and over. Single Player is only useful to unlock new cards, which you will need for later single player games and for multiplayer. Multiplayer is where this game is at. The only downfall is that this game has a very small player base. At the most I only saw 5-8 games in the lobby at one time. Overall, the gameplay is alright, sound is reasonable but nothing special, graphics are alright. For a game that costs only $10 on steam, you get what you paid for, to bad what you paid for isn't that good.5/10			"

												This is probably my favourite MTG game above all others. It can have a very steep curve, but once you start collecting all of the planeswalker decks, and find a few you like, the game gets immediately enjoyable. So just try to stick with it.This is a very light & direct approach to MTG but it can be as complex and challenging as you wish it to be. I only had a casual interest in MTG when I was younger, but wanted to try it out again as an adult. The problem was I didn't have anyone to play it with. So this was a nice alternative. What ended up happening was I reintroduced my brothers to MTG and now it's something we all love to play. Thanks to this game!			"

												This game is actually pretty great. Not only was it worth the $10 to get 2 genuine hats in TF2, but you can redeem a promo card you can sell for at least $10-15, so you can make back your money and then some. Oh, and the game is GREAT! It's sort of addictive once you get the hang of it though. I use to play Magic as a kid, and this is some nice nostalgia from those days. The game can be a little frustrating, but other times, really rewarding once you beat a boss that had you pinned. It has multiplayer too, which means it has replayablity. I haven't done multi, and I haven't finished the campign(2 more bosses, and 2 more challanges) but I'm going to give this bad boy an 8 out of 10.			"

												Plenty of stupid frustrating bugs that the devs couldn't have been bothered fixing, however. The later MTG yearly installments after 2012 are total trash, but this one was genuinely enjoyable when it worked.			"

												Ever played the card game and thought ""Damn. I hate blowing all my money on all this random, overpriced, pieces of crap just to get a better playing deck!"". Well, this is possibly the next best thing to it (albeit the deck limitations). The artwork has always been rather alluring, so it's a shame we can't save the pictures of our favourite cards. Oh but I suck at this game but it's pretty...			"

												I should be a game tester because I have found more flaws and fixes in this game then the developers prob. Other then that it is magic as a video game, at times I felt that the cards where not random and that the computer was just drawing cards to win. 3.7/10			"

												I've played magic for over 5 years and this game is helpful to understand the basics and i did enjoy it a little. But it is not helpful in understanding some of the more advanced tactics that it tries to teach. There are many steps and pauses in a turn of magic or responding to something your opponent is trying to concoct and it takes you through these steps horribly. i am a very experienced player and went back to complete this game and i knew exactly what i had to do to win, but the game makes you do it in such a wonky roundabout way that i couldnt figure out how to do what i knew i needed to do to win the match. get it if its on sale. even for $10 you shouldnt have to relearn how to play a game you already know how to play just because the programmer doesnt know how to make it playable.
