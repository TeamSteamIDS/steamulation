												PositiveEtherium is a nice-looking game with some innovative mechanics, considering  that it was not made by a big studio or with a big budget. Especially the idea of converting basebuilding into augmenting nodes on the map, which need to be captured, justifies some praise. Adding an alternative victory condition by letting you assault the enemies fleet in space and allowing to spare ressources to convert neutral armies are good ideas.NegativeEtherium is a Multiplayer-Title. You see your rank displayed on the main screen. I can not tell much about that. It might even be good. The problem is, that the game has barely any singleplayer. There is a campaign-like mode that lets you assault and conquer the AI on several planets, but it is basically just playing the same mission over and over with adjusted difficulty. It is basically the same structure, that ""Emperor: Battle for Dune"" had. Unfortunately, the campaign, althou having much more random events and tactical possibilities on the macro-map, has nothing to offer on the actual RTS level, which is the playing out of planetary combat. There is no story, there are no cutscenes, there is nothing but the unit descriptions and a short faction intro. The factions themselves also play rather indifferent for my taste, but that´s debatable. Result:If you are into Multiplayer RTS and seek for  some new twists on the genre for a good price, then this game is for you. If you are looking for an old-school campaign-RTS, I recommend you Grey Goo. (Which would be my decision.)4/10			"

												What do you get, when you have a multiplayer focused game, terrible marketing and therefore almost no awareness of your game, coupled with a low-budget approach? The answer is Etherium.The gameplay itself is solid and an experience, that focuses on the main things you'd expect from a strategy title:- rock/paper/scissors mechanics- multiple tech tiers- focus on map/ressource control- base building and defenseIt takes all of this and breaks it down to the bare essentials:- Counter mechanics are straith forward and most units are hardcounters to others. - Unit production is almost instant.- The map is controlled via sectors with a capture point in each. - Base buildings are limited to pre-defined locations in the sectors and can only be upgraded however you see fit (with the exception of defenses, which are limited by number in each sector). All that makes the game a very streamlined experience, which is not necessarily a bad thing. You can focus on making decision. And having only a limited set of options makes every choice count.So it doesn't sound to bad, right? HOWEVER as I initially stated Etherium is obviously built with Multiplayer in mind. You have only a lackluster ""skirmish vs AI"" - campaign mode, your ""rank"" is displayed in the main menu aswell as a button to enlist in matchmaking... If only pressing that button would do anything!Because YES, Etherium is dead already. I strongly advice to look it up on steamcharts.com, should you have any willingness to buy it left in you. With a peak of around 15 (!) players per day this is a multiplayer title with no one to play with. It should come as no suprise to the devs, that people will not pick up their game, if they fail so hard at raising awareness. Etherium is yet another failed attempt to create a low-budget title that stands on multiplayer alone, but just doesn't have the content, quality and appeal to get enough people to actually play it.Conclusion: Steer clear of this game and save yourself the money. Neither the Singleplayer nor Multiplayer are worth the price tag.			"

												I probably should've taken the mixed (42%) ratings as a bad sign, and not bought this, but i did anyway as the gameplay seemed a whole lot of fun, unfortunately, this game is fundamentally broken, in that 5/6 ground missions i play end in the game crashing right after i achieve victory... this wouldnt be quite so painful, if it wasnt for the fact i have to replay the entire ground mission again, and again, and again, until it finally decides to not crash, which was a 1 in every 6 games experience... keep in mind, some of these ground missions are on pretty large maps, and towards the end of a game, they can take quite some time to complete, in excess of 40min or so, and as the computer players like to constantly engage you in ground missions... it gets very very tedious.Cant wait for steam to implement their refund system, as this game does not deliver a basic playable experience.I cannot in good conscience recommend this game, or the developer/publisher in any way, as this is the kind of fatal flaw that shouldve been ironed out pre release, not still be in the game months after it was released, if starcraft 2 had this kind of game breaking bug, everyone wouldve dropped it like a flaming bag full of dog poo.

												GameplayGreat game,the ideas are original with some innovation here and there. Etherium brings in a dynamic weather system where you HAVE to adapt to situations by selling units before they get blown away by hurricanes,crossing icy rivers for flanks after a big old blizzard,running away from a volcano that's about to blow up and steamroll your troops and more. AI's are perfectly fine on my end, medium AI's aren't that stupid,easy AI's are,hard AI's are challenging. The gameplay is also great but some of the controls are a little bit odd,you'll see for yourself when you buy the game. Conquest mode isn't online yet as of the current time and date of this review which is... 1 PM pst 3/25/15. MultiplayerThe only thing that I'm left wondering about is....What happened to the multiplayer? Multiplayer's dead on my end,I don't see any rooms in the lobby and there's no chatroom system whatsoever so it's a wee bit hard to connect to other peeps and make sure that it's not you who has a glitched/bugged/dead multiplayer system. Overall,it's a great game, they just have to fix the multiplayer system. Lots of people can't get multiplayer to work. Hopefully,they'll add more content to the game. $30 isn't too high or too little of a price for this game. ESPECIALLY if there's more people in multiplayer.Cores for RTS games.When you look for an RTS game,graphics are a nice plus but it's not ALL about the graphics. The graphics are great for an RTS. If you wanted an RTS that has a loooooot of graphics go for SC2 if you want to take a risk and plunge into a game filled with potential and support the developers,here you are. The gameplay's pretty much a SC2 and Company of Heroes mix. Gameplay is a major plus for a game. Putting all of the big Plus's for RTS games or just adding some innovation/improving the ideas for RTS itself is another big plus. Multiplayer database is ANOTHER big thing in ALL RTS games. If an RTS doesn't have a big multiplayer base,it's a goner. This RTS is suffering in that direction.Edit:Conquest is on! Ratings have been updated. 1:20 PM pst 3/25/15Edit: They really need to add some lore into the game though. That's also another big problem in the game that I hadn't bothered thinking about because of the lazers flying across the map on the battlefield. Regardless, still a fun game,just need a bit more content. Ratings have been changed as of 3/25/15 10:14 PM pst.Overall rating:7/10Graphics:9/10Content:6/10Multiplayer's dead/not showing up?:3/10Music:8/10AI mentality:9/10Buyability mentality?:YES,and yes. The game's ready to go,just a few slight flaws,a fix needed for multiplayer and some actual lore to be passed down into the game.Also need a bigger multiplayer base.Edit: Haven't played this in a while, back when it first released we didn't have the problem of the game crashing but now the problem's been introduced now for some unknown reason. Don't know how they screwed the game up. Game's great if it's not crashing but regardless, don't buy the game until the problem's fixed. It has a lot of potential and can still be a developed game.Updated 5/26/2016			"

												This is like playing an early access game. Clean up the bugs, add more narrative, more cinematics, unique armies and you can make an okay game.PROS1. WeatherMagnetic Storms (prevents units from moving), Blizzard (freeze water), Hurricane (kills air unit), Lava (damages land units). I love how it changes the gameplay. 2. Secondary FactionsVery interesting stories. Guardians (Robotic Security System), Raiders (Pirates) and Parasites (Giant Insects). 3. CoverI like how you can place units in trees to prove cover. Reminds me of the COH2 system.4. Space ViewVery interesting. Building a fleet to attack is semi-satisfying. The ships are very boring but combining the Political Cards and the fleet makes for an interesting game.5.Political CardsVery useful and fun.6. Air TransportI love how units just get deployed from an airship insteading of just appearing out of thin air.Air transport for 50 etherium is quite interesting. I would suggest an immediate air drop of units from the moment you build them. E.g. Comms unit in a transport, instead of dropping a Comms unit, transport and fly.CONS1. BugsGUI is buggy. You can't click on the ships in the space game. Planets do not appear until the AI approaches them. You can't open the reputation window in Conquest Mode.2. AIWay too slow while they compute their turns. Space battles take so long to finish.3. Tech TreeIt is redundant and very annoying. Having to unlock troops through tech points slows down the game in an unfun way.4. IncompleteThe story is incomplete. No explaination of the Palaces, why certain planets are important, no end game cinematic for a faction.5. Boring ArmiesThe armies are cookie cutter copies of each other. Units are so boring. They don't have abilities or special functions. I would suggest some form of asymmetry and some narrative for each unit.6. Number of SlotsIt is really silly to have to capture multiple territories just to get supply, tech points , logistics points, Command Points, etherium refineries etc etc... What if you want to tech rush? If you sell the tech centre, you lose the technology point. This form of balancing and limiting your choices is horrible as it doesn't add anything fun. I would suggest adding more slots for each territory e.g. 3 slots minimum. This will accelerate the game immensely.7. Map Bland. Weather is good though. I would suggest some architecture.8. Abilities (CP)An orbital bombing experience is odd. AI automatically moves away so you know that you save it for structures. Sure, the AI is smarter in this manner but it's not very satisfying. 1st 3 abilities are copies of each other. There should be more abilities to showcase how unique each race is.9. BuildingsWhile having one Command HQ is easy to control and upgrading control points is efficient, it is boring. Other RTSs have different structures E.g. Barracks for Infantry, Workshop for Vehicles, Air Field for Air Units. I would suggest visual upgrades to the Command HQ at the bare minimum.10. DeploymentThematically, you are deploying units from the space fleet. You should allow them to deploy in sectors you control.			"

Posted: September 4, 2015
												I Bought this game at a discounted price and could only reccomend it on sale...First experience:So as with almost all games I am unfamiliar with I decided to start with the tutorial. The graphics were appealing at first and gave the game a unique look. I finished the tutorial skirmish and decide to load up a conquest game tutorial. An enemy fleet appears and I am instructed to attack it. I was expecting a space battle or atleast a cinematic but instead was greeted with 4 shots from each ship being fired in a system ressembling a dumbed down $5 DS game I played once.Crash...I reload the game and assume that it must be a bug in conquest mode so I start a skirmish game and I am introduced to the factions. These showed little inginuity: You have your typical corrupt or oppressive human empire, a technologically advanced alien religious zealot and a group of aliens who sacrificed their entire race in order to live inside war machines. The last one was the first bit of creativity in this game that I found worth the effort. 3 minutes in and my screen freezes for a moment then my fleet decides to fly off and it says that I am defeated. confused I try another skirmish game.Crash...Being a modern game I expected it to run smoothly on windows 8 with 16 Gigs of Ram and a higher end graphics card.After finally playing through my first few unbroken skirmish games I am incredibly dissapointed to find that this game also suffers from over-balancing. All but 3 of the units and buildings per faction have incredibly similar stats to each other within the faction and share projectiles, names and descriptions withe similar units across the faction.The symmetry means that what faction you play as has little to no effect on gamplay other than visuals (Unless you go as the incredibly over-powered alien faction and their light walkers that dominate early game.)Final verdict: 5/10- Buy it if it's on sale or if you crave a simplistic RTS or symmetrical gameplay could be so much more.

												Terrible game.  The ideas are ok, it's just that it constantly crashes all the time.  From what I've heard the developer has a history of abandoning buggy games after release.  At least it saves me the trouble of not wasting money on battlefleet gothic, a game currently in development by the same people.If you're one of the few lucky ones to have the game working, you'll find it to be a fairly mediocre game.  If it wasn't for the high probability of constant crashes, I'd say to buy it on sale.  But as it stands avoid it.			"

			Cosmic reviews Etherium a real-time strategy game set in a science-fiction universe, developed by Tindalos Interactive and published by Focus Home Interactive.		

As you would expect this game is all about the ground combat. Etherium comes at a time where we have very few good real time strategy games around. The last one I played was mechs and mercs black talons which was a woefully bad game in every aspect. Rather than base building, Etherium core mechanic focuses around control points called monoliths. Instead of base building, one you have captured a monolith you can add extensions to it. These extensions have different functions such as a Etherium refinery for improved Etherium production in that zone, to a spaceport allowing you to deploy troops for that location.Each zone must be connected in some way to your main base to function properly. Should the enemy take a middle zone and split your territory. Buildings and more importantly Etherium production will go offline until reconnected. Speaking of Etherium, its the only production resource in the game and is aquiced every minute. Some regions will have Etherium spheres to harvest which are valuable zones to control and others won't.There are a variety of units available in each faction and more can be unlocked via the tech trees. Units each have strengths and weaknesses and through combat can be promoted in battle to become stronger. Etherium has a decent mix of infantry, tank and air units. My issue with them is that each factions is very similar in appearance to the next not just in aesthetic but in gameplay too. You also have turrets available to protect your bases but you are limited to three per region.One thing I love about the game is the indigenous sub factions on the planets. These sub factions can either be ignored, destroyed or even rallied to your cause in battle. By converting the necessary extension you build up points with a sub faction over time once the bar is full you gain control of these powerful ally's which can literally turn the tide of a battle. The enemy can also rally these sub factions to their side and it can often be a race to gain control of them.At the bottom of the screen you can see several abilities known as command skills. These skills are different for each faction and use up command points in battle which replenish over time. Command skills come in handy in a variety of situations, such as the orbital barrage which can be used to destroy units or buildings quickly.Another great feature of Etherium is the environmental hazards in battle known as climatic events. Depending on the type of planet your on you'll get a timed weather event that can have different effects. An example of this is a volcanic planet having eruptions that destroy units or electromagnetic storms that play havoc with your ability to use command skills. These events can hamper your battle plans but can also be used to your advantage.Battles are pretty fast paced which is something I like to see, it doesn't mean matches can't be long but it does mean than your kept on your toes often. I personally enjoyed that there is a variety of tactics to employ in battle and of course to ultimately win. I was also pretty impressed with the enemy AI as on the harder difficulties it was a serious challenge to compete.One to four player online multiplayer is available too which can be very fun. The fast paced nature of battles and with all the skills, environmental effects and sub factions in play, multiplayer can be a lot of fun. It certainly adds to the longevity of the title and I feel without the multiplayer component the game would not be worth the price tag.In all I feel that Etherium provides a good competent RTS experience. It's complete focus on macro-management rather than micro management leaves it feeling somewhat without the depth of other more renowned RTS games. It certainly has lots of room to improve, I think a larger conquest mode would have been better allowing for a longer campaign. Like I have mentioned I would have also liked to have seen more diversity between the factions units and play styles to give the game more replayability. However that being said, it is in my opinion one of the better RTS's to have been released in recent years. "

Etherium ReviewDeveloped by Tindalos Interactive (known for Stellar Impact) and published by Focus Home Interactive (Cities XL Series, Trine 2, Farming Simulator), Etherium is a daring new multiplayer RTS game looking to pump fresh energy into a slumbersome genre. Not since Starcraft 2 has there been such a relevant sci-fi entry for a 4X multiplayer game. Tindalos is a small, independent studio so much credit is deserving for even attempting such a monumental task.In Etherium players will choose one of three different factions, each with their own unique abilities. These factions battle across multiple maps for control of a precious resource called etherium either against other players in multiplayer games or against AI players in single player skirmish mode and conquest mode. There are a multitude of units and upgrades available and units can level up through combat. Aside from the main factions, some maps also include a neutral faction which can advantageously be swayed into aiding your cause and be a nuisance for your opponents. The maps offer a variety of terrain features and can be used to your advantage as well. Additionally, Etherium contains a weather element based on terrain that can greatly impact battles and strategies.Etherium gameplay will be similar to most other RTS games of the genre and easy for veteran gamers to become familiar with early on (there is a tutorial included for newcomers), but in a much more direct approach. Instead of expansive base-building elements, Etherium introduces the idea of dividing the maps into zones with a central node where players can build a multi-functional ""control structure"" to gain control of that particular region. Each of these structures have a variety of upgrades and expansions available, offering a lot of flexibility in your strategic approach. This stream-lining concept allows for more focus on the combat element of the game while still offering a full compliment of benefits and options for your faction.While the graphics aren't going to leave players with that ""Wow!"" feeling, they are solid and more than get the job done. Zooming in will show some greater detail but is wasted since a game like this requires players to have a broader visibility of the map. There is a good soundtrack and the cut-scenes offer up a back story of sorts, which is good since (for unknown reasons) the developers chose not to include a lengthy single player campaign. The different factions are well-balanced, which is important for a mutiplayer combat game. This game has low system requirements and runs smoothly on most systems even using the highest visual settings. The AI is very intelligent and the combat is very direct so players can fully expect to be challenged even in single player skirmishes. The Good:=======+  Balanced and unique factions+  Variety of units, abilities, research improvements+  Challenging gameplay+  Various maps, terrains, weather elements+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements+  Multiplayer Combat w/ Leaderboards+  Quality Graphics & Sound+  Smooth rotating camera with simple controls+  Comfortable UI+  Moderate replay valueThe Bad:======-  No single player campaign-  Combat units lack intelligence/must be controlled directly-  No combat formations or advanced control functions-  Graphics are dull & un-interestingFinal Thoughts:===========While Etherium doesn't reach its full potential and may fall short in comparison with some of the most renown 4X Space RTS games of our generation, it is still a solid game and offers many hours of entertaining gameplay. Everything this game does, it does well and could be the building block for a successful series with a few tweaks and additional improvements. Time will tell, but for RTS fans who have been neglected by the genre for a long time, this game is one you definitely want to get your hands on. I thoroughly enjoyed it.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												It's been a year and the devs still won't fix the game-breaking bug that causes it to crash after almost EVERY campaign battle.  They have proven they don't care about the consumers with their outright refusal to even address the issue after the thousands of complaints.  The issue could be somewhat mediated if they allowed you to save the game anywhere but at the main menu, but the devs were too lazy to implement that either.  I mean seriously.....how does this even get past playtesting?   Did nobody at the company ever complete a single campaign battle and realize that something is ♥♥♥♥ed up?   What a disgrace.			"

												The game is overwhelming.Campaign or the Conquest Mode is very good. What most Impressed me is the AI.In almost every other RTS ,Sorry AI is just pathetic,In Etherium you get a real and fair challenge on medium,and its really awesome vs Hard AI. You can change the Speed of the game bevore the mach, like 20 or 40% faster.Its fun to play online in Teams.Ground buildings are limited, there are a lot of upgrades for tech ,and unit limit, space cannons, command points, boost up money, repair units and much more. You can ether destroy enemy fleet by ground buildings ""space cannons"" or ally with neutral faction on the map, so you have to be good organised if play in team. You have 6 different planets each planet is with 4 maps. Factions are really good balanced. You have a lot of strategy options and units. So give it this RTS a try.			"

												Etherium is an interesting Sci-Fi, Real Time Strategy game. It feels like a lot of other RTS's out there and doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table. It has a playable tutorial which makes the commands and controls easy to learn. The story in Etherium doesn't really shine through in the tutorial and seems fairly generic. It isn't a bad game, it just feels like a lot of other RTS's lately. I would have liked to see more base building in this game and felt that aspect was very limited. It didn't seem like there was a big difference between the different factions, but there were special abilities you could unlock once you expanded a colony with the technology center, and those were sort of neat.All in all, I think the game could have been a lot better if they had some diversity with the factions, and allowed the bases to be more expandabe. The game does offer single-player campaigns for each faction, as well as Skirmish mode, and Multiplayer Mode, but there appear to be long waits for some of the Multiplayer games. Graphically speaking the game is bland. My advice, Etherium isn't a bad game, but you can probably do better.			"

												I'm going to answer all of your questions and give my opinion about this game.Is it worth 20 bucks? Nope, it is not!Maybe around 5 or 10 in a sale. But why, you might ask?Well...The good things:-Interresting conquest mode.-It's not difficult to learn how to play.-Epic soundtracks. (My opinion)-A good overview on what's happening on the battlefield.-It looks nice. (The skybox is also amazing!)-There is more combat and less base building.-Great in-game features that can change the game in seconds. Such as secondairy factions you can take controle of and weather effects. The many bad things:-It crashes alot, this isn't just me. The entire community was screaming about it.-Gets repetitive after a while.-Bots can either be really smart or crap.-Factions are not very different from each other. Sure, there are some different units and abilities for each faction. But compared to other RTS games. That's nothing! Each faction is basically  a re-skin from each other.-The player base is dead.Yup, I couldn't find any players online!The game developers left the game like trash. Etherium could have been so much more!Proof: http://steamcharts.com/app/245370My opinion:So please take my advice. Yes it is fun to play with friends and all that. But it's not worth the price. There are many other great RTS games out there... Etherium, just didn't work.			"

												>not using the UI to display anything useful>not having hotkeys in an RTS>crashing>2015ISHIGGYDIGGYYou want details? Here's your details.The tutorial is largely overbearing and will barely let you do anything outside of it's very specific order of events. It will also crash when its finally over. Because why not, we're already thrusting towards whatever planet we're attacking so lets not leave the job half-cocked.There's multiple things in the interface that don't have any information about them because tooltips are non-existent except where they used arbitrary bars instead of numbers. Because those are always great, especially when the bars are different but the numbers are the same. What did I say about ""useful""? Yeah. This is the polar opposite.Are you going to tell someone new to your game why that unit/category is locked? Maybe what these seemingly meaningless icons/""buttons"" on the screen are? Apparently not. Weather might as well have been background noise because the game certainly wasn't telling me what it did, a great candidate for using the UI.Control groups are the only useful hotkeys they put in the game. Meanwhile they declined on adding them for anything related to construction or training. Which for an RTS of all things, means you might as well not have them. Trying to play SC2 on my Intuos4 was more enjoyable than this.There isn't an indicator for the space a unit will take up for placement. Coupled with the bright idea of not displaying where incoming units are, flares are nigh meaningless. Even for indicating somewhere is invalid because of terrain, the best you get is a different cursor. Why is there even manual placement for such a miniscule valid area again? Anyone? Was it not skillful enough?The crashing was also rearranging hotkeys at random. It's easily the worst RTS I've personally played. It took all the lazy routes to design from hard counters to RNG snowballing veterancy and feels incredibly half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Maybe they should've tried figuring out what the good parts were of all the games they took a scalpel to.

												Really good classic style RTS game.  Has a command and conquer mixed with supreme commander feel to it.  I really like the gameplay and this is quickly becoming one of my favoite RTS games.  My only concern about the game is lack of promotion and playerbase. Right now, 3 days after launch, it's still hard to get a game going. Wish the developer would have done more to promote the game, the launch was very quiet and not many people know about it.  If they can attract some more people to this game, I can see it really taking off.			"

												It's like the most mundane rock paper scissors Relic-style ""tactical"" RTS. While Ground Control's so-called spiritual successor World in Conflict boasted roughly one active ability per unit that you needed to micro to achieve victory, Etherium does away with them altogether, and Relic's must-have cover bonus system is also marginalised to use only for sporadic forests. Probably geared towards the 20-40 minute match duration popular in the oh-so-modern MOBA genre, matches are not only on the short but also on the simple end. To provide jolly ol' strategic diversity, there's even a way to turtle your way to victory by defending a few structures that damage the enemy's Magic Off-Map Life Force for ten minutes.Urrrgh.It doesn't help that in my second game, it first crashed for my friend, and then after about a minute crashed for me too.Pick this one up when it's in a bundle.

												I bought this game awhile ago. There are two major problems:1. Lack of cutscene/campaign. Some of us strategy gamers like a story with their RTS, this doesn't have one. It's just a bunch of skirmishes.2. The more important problem, repetitive game mechanics. The opposing players always, always attack your base every turn, like clockwork, 2 attacks per ship, with 2 players attacking.... That's a minimum of 4 battles/turn before you can do anything..And it's always the same deal with that, build the biggest, strongest X unit in the biggest Y number in every battle. Then, when its your turn, land grab 2 territories per ship. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. If the game is minimized, or not in focus. It likes to crash, meaning you can't pause, and it only auto saves once in awhile...so... I wouldn't bother buying this game, your better off playing Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3, at least that game has fantastic fan service shuffled inside of a awesome RTS with a STORY, and minimal bugs.

												Not a bad RTS. Nice touches, battles can be annoying if the AI repeatedly builds turrets. Enemy AI also tends to follow the same path for troop drops in your base and wont try anything different - especially when they are greeted by a wall of turrets.Not a fan of a various turrets. WIth a nice Tech tree, the option to let us choose the upgrades for turrets would be a better choice, instead of 1 for troops, vehicles and AA.  Another huge flaw is that I just finished a long battle and then fell under attack again by another faction. However, its late and I am tired but I am unable to save the game - which really pisssed me off.Having said that, it is fun, the battles are great to watch and the options to improve your bases are cool too.

YouTube™ Video: Etherium Gameplay 

			Views: 870		

			Subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheTroublmaker/ With release around the corner it's time to show off Etherium in it's entirety. Troublmaker plays a 2v2 skirmish with 3 AI.		

Etherium is not the scifi RTS game you are looking for.  The game has some really interesting concepts, but overwhelmingly fails to provide a rewarding experience.At $30 the game simply doesn't pack enough content to be worth the time.  An average RTS game is going to be worth hundreds of hours of gameplay, this one might not pass the 20 hour marker.Balance in the game is pretty awful with one faction just being overwhelmingly better than the others.What the game does offer is a unique take on base building giving you a lighter version of it.  Your home base can build a number of attachments.  Logistics allows you to build more units, tech allow you to build better units, and refineries allow you to earn more money.  Then there are more specialized buildings that can be used as part ofa strategy, like the military industrial complex which reduces costs from losing units.On the map are various points that need to be captured.  Each point will build 1 or 3 attachments.  Building with only 1 attachment can build a refinery.  Ones with 3 cannot.The main problem of the game is that things sort of snowball out of control fast.  Holding on to an extra base gives you a definitive advantage over your opponent in which case it's less likely you'll be able to come back from a loss.The game also features the option of buying out neutral factions.  Neutral factions will only attack you if you attack them and are place in areas that would eliminate a potential flank.  Buying out factions is a huge investment and honestly... a waste of time.  The advantage is gaining a few extra units that don't count towards your unit cap.It's a very disappointing game in a poorly planned series.  Hold off on buying this one indefinitely.			"

												Easy to handle but very deep strategically, Etherium is well worth it's price and adds lot of great new elements to the RTS genre. The game seems pretty well balanced so far and looks very promising. If you like strategy games and are looking for something new and really interesting in terms of build order and competitive strategy, give it a shot, you won't be disapointed.			"

												I am huge fan of RTS games (17 years StarCrat, Total War series for years, Age of Empires etc ...), because RTS market is relatively small, I am always eager to buy new position ... Here is what I find:Pros- sectors based maps (something new)- round + RTS game like (Similar to Total War series)- weather conditions affects gameplay- variety of maps and planets- nice looking- runs smoothlyCons- I'm having a lot of ""explorer"" bugs game crashes back to windows (A LOT!)- AI sucks, game is too easy- no campaign mode/story mode- paper, rock, scisors unit structure (A beats B, B beats C, C beats A)- poor technology tree- small variety of units- races are relatively the same- poor weather changes- game does not offer anything new- small popularity (guess why?)- I did not find much place for strategy and tactic- interface is not transparent- unit production is instant so everything comes down to money ...- no combat formations or advanced control functions- is this game have any hotkeys?Overall 5/10. It is not bad to play, but you won't spend years on it (like with SC case for me), worth trying when on 75% discount promotion ...			"

IT'S DESIGN IS SOUND AND THE GRAPHICS ARE WELL DONE.THERE'S JUST ONE MAJOR PROBLEM:       THE DEVS ARE COMPLETE TRASH AND LACK ANY COMPETENCE.

AT RELEASE THIS GARBAGE WAS $30, THEN QUICKLY WENT TO $20. THEN STEAM GAVE IT A WEEKEND FREE TO DRAW IN MORE PLAYERS AND AFTER THAT FREE WEEKEND IT WAS $20 TO BUY. THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME FALLEN VICTIM TO THE ""GET-YOUR-MONEY-QUICK"" DEVELOPER SCHEME.********WARNING TO ALL READING THIS, THESE SAME DEVELOPERS ALSO WANT YOU TO BUY GOTHIC ARMADA.

												This game is different to how it was marketed. It is definatly desinged more for the RTS culture and not casual gamers. It has good flow, feel and balance but I also feel that it could have used more unique units, and more available play styles for the idfferent factions. While the factions all do play differently, they all share the same three abilities before branching into three unique abilities, and they all have the same (general) infantry/tank/air combos. The developers could definatly been more innovative here.I hope this game gets alot of features added to it, but my experiance with modern games within the last few years gives me doubts.At the end of the day it is a solid RTS. Enjoyable to play, has good depth to it that RTS veterans will appreaciate and I would recommend the game. It just feels like it could be so much more with a few additions.			"

												A Small and Simple RTS with potential that is wasted upon a horrible presentation. With some polishing and bug fixing, it   would be Okay (Nothing really unique about it). Unless you like a Simple, Casual, RTS, then this game probably isn't for you.Negatives   1. It Crashes a lot (any Quality of computer).   2. The Tutorial is confusing.   3. It has no real Campaign   4. Key Bindings for Conquest mode (Space Part) are messed up (Q to go Left, D to go Right, Z to go up, S to go down).   5. Its focused around Multiplayer, and even it is lackluster.   6. All factions are quite similar (minor differences).Negative OR Positive (depending how you look at it).   1. It is a Simple, Casual, RTS.   2. It's price is lower than other RTS' (is it worth $20 though, is another question altogether).   3. Backround Story for each faction (although thats all the sory you get (and all most every other RTS has this)).Positive   1. Decent Graphics.   2. Random Destructive Weather Patterns (Not the first though).			"

												By trying to streamline base construction and resource management, Tindalos has created a game that strives for simplified...and ends up simplistic. No true single player campaign to speak of, all units use the same sound files, and and simply doesn't live up to the badass self-image it tries to portray on its store page.If you want territory-based RTS fun with a sci-fi slant, stick with the Dawn of War series.

												Etherium plays like a slower paced RTS-lite with a focus on resource management and control in conjunction with unit management. There are three interesting and visually varied races with their own uses of the resource, and the units, structures, assets and graphics in general are pleasant to look at, but combat is mediocre, gameplay is bland and gets very boring very fast and when considering the frequent crashes and problems, this might well be worth completely passing by. I feel like the developers have tried to emphasize the battlefield as a whole and the player choices and routes to different areas, and have tried to strip the standard building/production mechanics down to a minimum so that the players' focus is more general and overviewish like in, for example, Supreme Commander, but it hasn't worked very well and honestly results in the game feeling bland as a whole.There is no focus on single-player other than a very lacklustre vs A.I. Skirmish series which doesn't offer any story or anything you'd expect from the big players like the Age of Empires', the Starcrafts, etc. I understand that it's a smaller title with a lower budget, but the lack of single-player element really is a big turn off.So then the focus is on the multiplayer, which has its own problems. All there is to let you know how you're doing overall is a rank in the top left, and with no stats or information on your matches or even your games as a whole, it's basically a matter of finding and playing games for their own sake, which sounds fine in theory, but in reality is another bland, boring aspect of this game.That's not even mentioning the fact that multiplayer is essentially dead. It took me 12+ minutes to find a game, during the free trial no less, and there was no alert or notification that I'd joined a game, but that didn't matter because my opponent was apparently afk anyway. For a game focused entirely on multiplayer to have so few players and nothing to encourage team-building, tournaments or improvement is simply an appalling failure.HighlightsThe visual styling and art styles of each of the three races are mildly interesting and generally pretty good. The maps are all fairly varied and the map assets are interesting. In general, all the visual elements are fairly good in Etherium.Node management is very smooth and quick. The ability to replace or move a Spaceport across the map for example, takes just two clicks and 2 seconds.* Despite the games many design issues, the gameplay as a whole can be fairly fun when against evenly matched opponents.* The different routes to victory are interesting and add a little depth that could've otherwise been missed.MistakesThe main problem with Etherium, at least at the time of review, is technical. Unexplained and seemingly random crashes are very frequent and even completing the tutorial for me involved 3 crashes and re-openings of the game. With no patch notes from the developers this is simply unforgivable and means buying this game is a risk. Though there are user suggested fixes in community posts. There are also a number of smaller problems that bring this title down.* Units are very basic, and provide hard counters to other units. There is no real depth of combat strategy, it's more about area and resource management, which is fine, but something more than rock/paper/scissors would've been appreciated.* The U.I. is very unintuitive at first, and takes too long to figure out, and the tutorial, while polished, does a poor job of keeping things simple, especially when continually crashing.RecommendationsI've given this a fairly hard time, but at the end of the day the game would actually be an average to above average RTS title if the Multiplayer existed. Unfortunately the genre has far better options at better prices, and for £14.99/19.99€/$19.99 at the time of review, it's just not worth it unless you're an RTS fiend. Had the multiplayer been a success, this would've been a fair choice and average+ game but for now, there are better options on Steam and elsewhere and you're better served passing this by.* Looking for somewhat similar but more solid RTSs' on Steam? Supreme Commander Gold Edition is equally priced, has far more content and does the world overview feel much better. Supreme Commander 2 is also worth checking and is cheaper and more highly rated. Grey Goo also focuses on decision making and resource management but has much stronger story and single-player, but it's twice the price of Etherium.* A seemingly successful fix to the after-game crashes has been posted on the Community "

												Etherium is a great new RTS title. It's good balanced for an initial release, and the AI is really challenging. So if you're used to smash the hardest AI in other games, try ths one.You can choose between three factions. Each faction has a unique bonus (one has four slots for units, the other four slots for turrets...) It is not a classic RTS with basebuilding. You basicly conquer the map and upgrade your mainbase and the facilities for each sector, which makes it simple to get started and still is interesting because you still have to make the right choices or even be capable of change the choice and your strategy. The units are well balanced. For each unit of the enemy you have a unit that can fight it, as long as you have enough Etherium, as long as your techlevel is high enough. And that's where the difficulty starts, in a positive way. It also has potential to become an entertaining esports game. But...--------------------------Updated 31.03: Soloplayer Campaign Review:There are three ""campaigns"" for each faction. After you've chosen your faction, you'll get introduced by some pictures and voiceover/text to the motives and backgrounds of them, which is interesting, though it could be implemented better (cinematics would upgrade this alot). Then a little tutorial and the thing starts. You can imagine this as sort of a round based board game, with 6 planets. Each round, you can make your moves with the fleet, upgrade your techlevel based on the techpoints you hold. Per round you have general action points and fleet specific actionpoints.  With the general action points you can buy cards (you get a card each round), play a card/cards, spy the techlevel and missions of your opponent, or - if you can - buy a new fleetWith the fleet action points, you can shoot the enemy fleet which is in the same orbit, repair your hull, conquer/attack a sector of a planet. Goal of the game is to hold at least 12 winningpoints for one round, or - I'm guessing now - to hold the most points by the end of the last round (I think it was like 16 rounds). You get those points by completing missions and play the cards giving you those points. Resumee: I really like this gamemode. It will be a different game everytime you play it, especially with the tough KI it won't bore you too much. Though the fights are always the standart fights. I hope for more diversity in future and I also hope for a real story campaign and addons for this conquest mode. ------------------------------------------------ To the negative points:...I believe the distributer and the developers made some big mistakes. First of all: You can't throw a game on the market without having made anything in terms of advertising. I just heard about it one day before it is meant to be released. I know more about the smallest indiegame starting on greenlight - no joke - because of twitter. You probably wanna try this one too.Second: I don't understand, why the developers say ""by the devs of Stellar Impact"". It's nothing you can be proud of. Not because it is a bad game, because you left this game alone and still sell it, though you can't play it without others. You should have make it f2p, if you do not want to shut it down. Guys, this is your second chance. If you mess it up, I will never ever buy anything made by you guys again.  A last negative thing: It is hard to find anyone in matchmaking. But this is of course because it has a low playerbase. So buy this game, give it a try and change it. It's worth the 30 bucks.-------------------In a previous version of this review I critizized that the game's Solo Campaign isn't released. This was  a bug I experienced.			"

												Despite being a game that gave me 5 days of continuous fun, it still isn't worth buying, especially at it's original price, that is more expensive than CS:GO and Supreme Commander 2.The positive things about it are that :-It has a conquest mode(Singleplayer), which doesn't let you be bored while waiting for your friends to join you in MP.-The designs and concepts, special attributes for each faction are kind of unique and enjoyable-Units are very well balanced(you can defeat a colossus with a few divisions of infantry if you do it right)At least the majority of the other things are perfectly balanced too, by the way.-Modelling is very detailed and properly done-Lots, lots and lots of ways to win a matchFor example, you can either slowly grow your army and make it powerful, then split infantry and vehicles to surround the enemy base through the forests/ruins and open areas together.You can make your enemy waste all of their resources by counter-attacking them every assaultOr you can completely fortify yourself and focus on building orbital cannons to eventually destroy the enemy fleet, and there's way more than just that. Including making an army of colossi and completely wiping everything off on your way to the enemy HQ or (teleporting/transporting with dropships) your army of infantry straight to the enemy palace.-It has a few unique features, such as dynamic weather events that can destroy you or aid you in your battle.As for the negative things though...-It lacks content, although it has every unit specialized for everything.(and it has 24 maps, only 6 of which can be played 2v2, also approximately 22(at least for Intar) units for each faction)-No mod support-Random crashing after battles(only during 1st session and then super rarely) and a few corrupt, unedited files-A few annoying glitches, such as being unable to kick players from your lobby if they joined while you were ready, unless you manually fix that by swapping the player's place with someone else.-Semi-poor tutorial that still leaves a lot of content in the game unexplained.-Impossible to cancel connection, forcing host and other players to wait for someone to disconnect because someone crashed(or is lagging)-Doesn't display the latency of other players,.. At all.-The AI is very stupid and annoying, completely focused on rushing. First it goes with a weak bunch of infantry units straight to your HQ, then it keeps pounding you with tanks and slowly expands while you already probably took over 75% of the map. Keeps repeating assaults(sometimes organized ones though) until you completely demolish them with something strong, like 2 war colossi with a support vehicle, covered in shields.-The OST gets repetitive after a while, but you won't notice it much because you'll be focused on figuring out how to get rid of the rushing enemies most of the time.And by the way, the ""Air Fortress"" thing isn't really a fortress, it's just 2 bulky-looking dropship-like bombers with lots of health. 10/10 would get disappointed again. If you want to see a real aerial fortress, play Supreme Commander|Forged Alliance with mods or Supreme Commander 2.Sorry, I honestly can't recommend this game, it's only enjoyable while it's free to play or super cheap, as long as it doesn't support community mods.

												After purchasing the game on a whim and playing it for a couple of hours, I am rather enjoying it. Personally, I am a pretty big RTS fan and I am always looking for fun, new strategy games to spend a bit of my limited free time on.The game is interesting in that it is easy to get into but offers a surprising amount of depth. The emphasis on direct unit counters and map control is appealing and presents different opportunities for both micro and macro strategy. Furthermore, resource management is very important and learning to make compromises between units, buildings, and turrets is important.Another thing I would like to point out is the AI. Its kicked my butt quite a few times. I lost my first 4 skrimish games against a medium AI, and I didn't win until I conceded that I have more to learn and dropped to the easy difficulty. Its pretty good and there is certainly enough challenge for me.Overall, I find the game to be both fun and satisfying. I would definately recommend it, although I would caution to anyone who purchases, to be patient with a few bugs and optimization issues (which the developers are already working on).Here is a breakdown on my thoughts:Gameplay: 7 / 10 Strategy: 9 /10Graphics: 7 /10Sound: 5 / 10Fun: 9 /10Challenege: 8/ 10Replayability: 7/10 "

												It's got the classic RTS vibe of various CnC games mixed with a few other notable strategy games. Conquest mode is a little smaller than I would've liked but definitely still a nice addition. The game revolves around the resource Etherium, as you will find out. Etherium is basically interdimensional space whale eggs that you mine. Best feature? It feels incredibly balanced, from unit types to call in powers. Now excuse me, I'm going to spread my militaristic megacorp across the galaxy through mass egg genocide! Anyone wanna call PETA?

			The Commissar shows off the recently released RTS from Focus Home Interactive, Etherium! A lot of people were interested in the Conquest mode so I thought it would be a generally good idea to show it...

												Neat graphics, but stale and generic gameplay. Not as innovative as many people say, the base building mechanics are nothing new - just different from traditional RTS's. Can't really give any reason to play this RTS over any other.			"

												I'm a huge fan of RTS games and have been playing them since Warcraft 1 came out and I have been looking for a successor to Supreme Commander and as such really wanted to like this game.I couldn't get past the tutorial - I uninstalled it after I spent over 10 mins scratching my head trying to follow the first 3 instructions. It was so confusing and unrewarding that I uninstalled it.Currently there is an option to try it for free for the next 3 days so well worth downloading and making up your own mind but I don't like being unnecessarily frustrated by poor design and implementation.

												Pros-It's pretty to look at.-Runs smoothly-I like the idea of weather conditions on certain maps.Cons-It's all ""been there done that"", and gives nothing new.-The units are all very small and unecessarily difficult to work with, especially when in a hurry.-The game is pretty slow paced, and even the action is sort of awkward to sit through.All in all I have to give this game a 4/10, it's not worthy to sit among the greats but it certainly isn't so bad to be unworthy of a try, but only if it's free.

												Tried this out on its free trial period. Went through boot camp, the game's UI was very unintuitive, everything seemed really simplistic, there was a sound problem, alot of character animations and unit attacks were barebones, I struggled to maintain a proper framerate (though that might just be me and my toaster computer) and once I beat the first level, my game crashed! Thank gabe that I didn't buy this, or I'd be pretty disappointed.			"

												Terrible complicated game with bad user interface and terrible Controls (like selecting units). You can't beat enemy AI in micro management. It just sends 10 divisions around at the same time - healing, attacking, refilling troop count, evading special attacks. The player AI on the other hand just hunts down enemy divisions while you try to handle the 20 other divisions you have instead of attacking the enemies nearby. Battles are just decided by spam. Units die so fast you are just busy spamming reinforcements all the time. But since you can only drop them manually on drop spots you also have to scroll around the map while fighting the enemy, which adds up to the combat I mentioned above... The game has potential but is completely frustrating in terms of control.			"

												I bought the game after i was allowed to download and play it for free for 12 hours, sadly i can only say now i wish i didn't. The campain is quite badly layed out and it forces you to replay the same maps contiuiously again and again over and over as poor ai keeps assulting the exact same place on the same planet, also even though in the last turn you took every zone on map and built into it when the ai assults the planet again all of your previous work has vanished... forsing you to quite litteraly repeat the last 2 hours of map every turn.sadly the entire game feels quite poorly put together from the cheep looking and hard to navigate build options, to the lack luster effects on the gun fire (lazy colour lines as there lazers), also the game play is very tedious and dull after a single skermish largely due to limited unit cap's + unlimited resourse so dominating a map dosnt really give you a huge advantage.all in all its a huge dissapointment 3/10 at best, its not unplayable but its just to poorly put together and far to generic to make it stand out in any way at all in my mind			"

												1: This game conmstantly chrashes.2: it's a nice game but for a few things:- IT CONSTANTLY CHRASHES!!!!!!!!- It makes you do the same maps over and over in conquest mode. the AI has noimagination whatsoever so you will be defending pilo at least 1000 times. Yes, that means the same 3 maps over and over and over again. - As far as I can read developers have been asked to fix the crashing bug a billion times but fail in every possible way to do so. these are really very very bad developers. they suck goatballs in their free time. ♥♥♥♥ these developers. Did I mention I hacve no heart for people that sell a half finished game? Those people deserve to be hung from a tree. DO NOT BUY THIS CRAPPY ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. "

												Ever since I heard about this game back in January, I always wanted this game. Why? because I'm in love with sc-fi RTS.This game has high potentinal and really looking forward to more updates and features. This game is based on how everyone plays. My usual play style is build up on one flank and completely demolishing the AIs flank and finishing the game.(My Opinions)PROS:~Great Atmosphere~Conquest Mode is Unique~Weather features that changes the gameplay. Water freezes in blizzard allowing you to cross. ~Can ally with the secondary factions that are good for defense and offensive (Guardian and Parasite)CONS:~Crashing before victory/mid-game(Yet to be discovered)What I want:Space Battles where you can control your fleet not like in conquest.Overall, this game is great for many RTS lovers. Most people who write the negative reviews is probably the constant crashing during the game which is understandable. This bug hasn't been fully fixed, but I believe soon the game will be fine once the developers and optimize it and fixed it :)			"

												I specifically got the game to see all of the cool units and such for my RP group, and on that respect, it's a home run. However the gameplay is very difficult to get the hang of, and I ended up not even playing it that much, and eventually deleting it. Good Graphics, Difficult Gameplay, no multiplayer, and absolutely zero-to-none on the lore. (I made up my own for my RP)			"

												I only have one word to describe how this game was, boring.I went into this game hoping it would be a ""Starcraft like"" RTS and maybe I should have gone in with a different mentality. Either way though I gave this game a solid attempt and after the first crash and the thought that I had no capability to save/load mid level my frustrations got the best of me. I do see potential in the game but unfortunately I was bored very early on and had little desire to redo the same mission when I was not all that entertained in the first place.			"

												Worthless at any price.  The ""AI"" simply cheats.I played a 4 player game with the highest ai on my side against two weakest ai.  The so called strong ai on your side does nothing and the so called weak ai attacks immediately giving you no time to do anything.  If there was any multiplayer presence then it would be a way around this but no there is not.It was unplayable, so I deleted it.  I feel completely cheated.			"

												This is a bad attempt at a real time strategy. Graphics are below average, limited unit types and effectiveness. The enemy seems to cheat at times on difficulties. Unit caps are severely limited as well. For all the hype they give it, it was quite the letdown...

												Etherium is a neat RTS. Etherium is a game I had never heard of until the free week, and I have got to say I don't understand why. The game seems to be made well. the art looks nice and the game runs well for me. From what I have played Etherium seems to be a more multiplayer focused RTS. There are three playable factions each with a variety of playable strategy's from what I can tell.   Now I have not played Etherium long enough to make any end all judgments about the game, its an RTS and those take a lot more play time to really ""know"" it. From what I have seen however Etherium is nice enough to recommend. I don't know what the multiplayer populations is like during normal times, but here is to hoping its good enough to keep the game going!			"

The enemys crumble again.Collecting my forces to attack one last timeBOOOOOOM, The game is gone. Restarting... rebooming...restarting...rebooming..checking for patches - nothing in the last year.I am so SO sad right now. Why is it so atypical to finish a game before selling it,or at least provide patches until it is playable for more than 30 minutesWell, i guess they have my money already, so the game did it´s job. Just don´t buy this game - it will make you sad!			"

												Cute.I'd say it is 60%-80% strategy, 40%-20% tactics.Even the tactics portion of the game (the RTS part where on-planet units battle) has some strategic overtones.See, there are two parts to this game, the ""space"" part (turn based), and the on-planet part (real-time). You start out in space, build your space fleet in your home planet, and you invade planets with it, sending down invasion forces down on planets. Your fleets can battle other fleets in space, and your on-planet base can be upgraded to be able to attack the enemy fleet in space. There are two paths to victory: Either destroy the enemy on-planet (their main base) or send their fleet packing, abandoning its forces on-planet.Graphics are not too heavy. Should run well on most PCs. Music and SFX are eh.I suppose it is fine. Recommended, sure, but not my cup of tea.			"

You can just build 5 units rush enemy base and win. That's all you have to do to win this game under 3 minutes.

												A decent game, although it could use some improvements. It looks very nice, sounds alright too, but feels rather dry. Gameplay is solid, but lacks variety, and seems rather 'stiff' - the way units move and behave, similiar factions, monotonous unit voices contribute to making this game kind of 'soulless' - as if it was just a proof of concept or a tech demo. Still - it can be quite enjoyable at times, and RTS game are few these days, so I'd say give it a try.			"

												Hmm I was going to give this game a good review but since playing it I have found out that the AI cheats. It creates far more units than it should be able to afford with the area that it has conquered and I can't forgive stuff like that. The single player campaign has no story which is another big minus for me. That being said I do like the general attempt to bring both 4x and RTS genre's together unfortunately this time its not been taken far enough to impress a fan of both of those genre's.This game is a good idea poorly executed.

												I got this game free for a couple of days......My god this game crashes like every minute and even in the worst times of battle i cant even actually finish the game because one it crashes randomly time to time and for some reason everytime litteraly right before im about to win a battle it completely hard crashes and even once it deleated the saves.dont install this not worth anyones time.however if it gets its crashes together and fixes it. It would be a decent strategy game not really particlary good but simple enough. campaign seems like a bore drag but i cant give an official oppinion on it seeing that every battle i go into just crashes and if not it crashes right before i win. im not joking it really actually crashes like 10 secs im about to end it and even once where i completely won but somehow at that moment it crashes and i have to completely start over.EDIT:I mean it i litteraly cant do a battle in campaign it just crashes ether at the end or during the battle i keep trying and it keeps crashing.

												The graphics are kinda all over the place, in that they're really good, but to be able to see anything you have to zoom so far out that the quality isn't noticeable.  Further, you have so few units at any one time that the levels feel empty.There is no single player campaign, it's only a narrative free (save for the intro) battling across several worlds.  Each faction feels almost the same and the AI plays them similarly.An interesting / different take on area control than similar base building RTSes but feels like it borrows on a mechanic long since superceded in qualtiy.  If you're interested in seeing another method that could be used for RTS, take a look, but fun it is not.			"

												Honestly, most people dislike this game. However, I don't really agree that it is a multiplayer only: the AI is a hard as nails on difficult. The campaign is not great.

												2/5 in theory, 0/5 in practice.  Dear god the crashes!  I can even replicate them at will.  Steam really lowered the bar on aplha.... WHAT? IT'S BEEN FULLY OUT SINCE MARCH?  I guess they decided to skip all the testing and QA phases.Read below or pretty much any of the other reviews that aren't obvious shills and you'll see.  With bugs like these this game should be considered a Beta right now at best, and it doesn't look like the dev's are still working on it.STEAM, PLEASE PULL THIS GAME UNTIL IT IS NOT BROKEN.When the game works, it plays a lot like Empire At War and has command weapons ala Red Alert 3.  The bots are smart and the board-game style galaxy conquest, although not unique, adds some replayability.  There is no actual campaign other than the galactic conquest.Multiplayer has no public matches option (either that or shows no matches by default and you can't search for """").If the game worked and had real multiplayer and a campaign it could be a really polished title.  However, even getting passed the crashes, the game is a mess.  Here's a few reasons why: - AI goes from retard to genius between Easy and Medium. - Badly designed load screens (press to continue after match loads will press itself after a few seconds) - Unbalanced species - Bulky and poorly laid out UI (keyboard shortcuts suck by default too)- Important messages disappear quickly and/or get replaced by useless information (like letting you know your division is under attack during this firefight that's been going on for the last 5 minutes rather than the volcano is about to erupt) - No save game option during matches (so, when it crashes at the end of a match, which it will, you have to start that part of the conquest over again)Overall there isn't really anything unique about the gameplay itself.  Between command and conquer, starcraft, empire at war and supreme commander, it's all been done before and better.  The only originality I see is in the galactic conquest - kind of like the EAW version only with trading cards and no space battles.  If you see me playing this in the next 3 days (free), it's because I want to finish ONE conquest before I uninstall it forever (right now certain territories crash after I beat them so it's a mini-game in itself.)DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS. - INSTALL FOR THE FREE WEEK ONLY IF YOU WANT TO BE FRUSTRATED			"

												Etherium is a great game to play, it uses your skills of stratagy to attempt to win the battle. Although, in the game, I have noticed that the developers have not fixed the crashing problem and limmited the ammount of units you can have on the battle field, along with other limmitations. It is an excellent game, but the game no longer has anyone playing it any more. It would be better if more people would battle/play on multiplayer. I see over 800 people in the game but none of them are in multiplayer!Although, the only thing that I suggest to the developers are these:Increase the number of units you can have on the battle field, increase the numbers of turrets you can place in a territory, add more units, modify the building layout to allow the players to build where ever they would like (this would mean changing the entier way of how the game will be, such as location of colonies, ammount of colonies, and more), add a way to upgrade the main control center to a ""Palace,"" add more structures such as walls, and a game play mode where the player/players can battle in space! :) "

												I need an RTS that takes the time to explain why should I give a !@#$ about anything, buildings and mechanics to collect resources don't make much sense and the bases don't change visually. doing the training mission was painful and I could not finish it so I went for a single player campaign just to find out this game is an MP game.RTS and RPG games need a story and a reason for things to be there and happen, this game don't have any of that.IF you're looking for a quick fix of a good looking RTS then this is your thing, but I love games like Starcraft, Warcraft, AoE and Total War series.I was left with the same feeling I got from Supreme Commander, this is definetly not for me.

												Since i heard of this RTS i ever wanted to Play it. Now i had the chance to.. glad i had it!It´s a really good game after you´ve learned the Tutorial.Still the game just released with a very Big BUG that makes you´re fights useless.When i´ve played the Tutorial it crashed a lot! When i finished the Tutorial it crashed.If you can play it seems yuo are lucky since a lot of ppl have this bug with crashes.Dump´s Up for the gameplay and Dump´s Down for the Crashes that makes you´re fun fading.Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:Gameplay: 8/10 (is good and easy to master it!)Graphics: 8/10 (Looks nice)Support: 0/10 (never had Support, leave it from impression!)Price: 4/10 (as it is now its only worth 1-5€ with the crashes dont appear i would say cuz it doesnt feel new and has the crashes its not more worth, sadly)Story: 0/10 (since it crashed any time i´ve opened it i just leaved the SP out cuz Tutorial was already bugging so much with crashes)Sound: 7/10 (good sounds, troop sounds can be annoying after a while i think. Music is good)Performance: 7/10 (Perfect FPS on hightest Settings but the Crashes are so worse..it would hve get 10 for the perfect stable FPS even in Battle´s)FAZIT: 6.8/10 (Wait until its on Sale or no crashes anymore! I recommend it because its good if you leave the Crashes away of your impression)			"

												Every once in a while, from time to time, you find something awesome among the tens of titles produced by small studios, Etherium is one of those games and the more you play it the more you will enjoy it.The game (developed by Tindalos studios and published by Focus Home Interactive) tries a few things which most game companies would avoid in these times of fantasy themed MOBAs, namely to create a hardcore-scifi RTS game, from the very first look you know the developers took heavy inspiration in the likes of Supreme Commander, Starship Troopers, Aliens and other classics of scifi, no Warhammer 40,000 though, there are no chainsword melee oriented units neither blatant ""magic"" psychic powers although there is a considerable reliance on Clarke's Third Law.from a gameplay perspective you will find a very interesting mix of concept which includes territory control, squads and hard-counters, all of this is quite well balanced as no faction really is overpowered, a lot of this is helped by the fact there are many mirror units, but worry not you will still have enough variety as every faction has special powers which make them unique and show a wider array of possible tactics. For instance, you can use the human Consortium financial support to boost your resources in order to get an economic edge over your enemies, the intari on the other hand can automatically level up their units from some command points, allowing for greater shooting accuracy in the battlefield, the Vectides on the other hand have deployable healing and evasion fields, which allow their troops to stay longer.Some other options will make you choice different tactics to defeat the enemy, should you tech rush your awesome heavy walkers while holding the line or should you try to break the enemy's early economy through raiding units? Shall you go for a full military assault or turtle while your orbital cannons force your enemy to evacuate his fleet? Take also in consideration the special events of the maps, which depending on the planet may come from volcanic eruptions which cut certain map sections to hurricanes which may destroy everyone's airforces.The implementation of subfactions also brings other possibilities, you may get these powerful forces through the sacrifice of certain kind of incomes such as command, tech or etherium points, indeed, you may also just wipe them out to capture their territories for further resources and experience.From a background and visual point Etherium brings three unique factions which have been invited by a mysterious entity known as the Smuggler to fight for this precious resource:The human Consortium, kinda like your OCP/Futuretech/Clonglom-O/Weyland-Yutani/Atlas on steroids, through economic power and illegal actions they have become most powerful human power in the universe, eclipsing the old nations of Earth, they relay on monetary and construction tactics and bring an army with the high-tech blocky look you are used whenever someone portrays humany in the coming centuries, no utopia for mankind here, but you still have a solid Starcraft Terran looking arsenal.The Awakened of Intar are your cool scary dogmatic aliens, older than mankind, focused on battle and tactical prowess, with a marble and crystalline stylized look which speaks of a fanatic and spiritual drive, this is perhaps the most ""magical"" faction, with a bit of protoss and another bit of eldar in the mix (without going as far as psionic blades or psychic swords), they use teleporting and time predicting capabilities as well as levelling up powers, great for wreaking havoc across the battlefield.Finally the Vectide Empire is the bio-chemical looking faction, with insectoid looking units, lots of glowing green stuff and the classic martian vibe, they may also remind you of the Hierarchy from Universe At War, long story short, these guys managed to transfer their consciousness into etherium, so if you are thinking about the necrons yes, there seems to be a bit of influence on them, and also the daleks for good measure, take advantage of their healing and evasion drones as well as their infantry boosting structures to overwhelm the enemy through sheer resilience.In the audio department the game makes a decent job with the sound effects and the voice, although it's a bit sad all units have the same stock phrases at least they may remain solid. The music is okm even nice to bring the scifi atmosphere, just' don't expect anything like what you get whenever Frank Klepacki is around.In conclussion, for 30 bucks you get an awesome game, if you have any chance try to get it as soon as possible, you will not regret it.

												This game has some interesting concepts but the bad programming really makes it unplayable. Things you can do in the campaign do not work in the tutorials. There are some really bad things, like you can not save during the enemies turn (space turn based section) and the game tends to crash after you play the Real Time Strategy fights. These fights can last up to 30 minutes easily per fight. With multiple enemies attacking one or multiple worlds, means you can spend hours defending territories after you use your turn for whatever you want. At any given point the game can crash and you have to undergo the entire enemy turn again. So even if you have defeated 3 invasions and are working on your fourth, you win it and just as you are supposed to return to the turn based space view, it crashes and you are back to the start of the enemy turn and have to repeat all the fights. Really makes it unplayable. Other than the obvious problems of this games programming, there are other options which are clearly lacking.Many of the standard options you would come across in games these days like easy to control rally points or grab all military units commands are not readily available. It leaves a lot to be desired and that is good in a beta but not in a completed and packaged product. A lot of the concepts are well thought up and fleshed out but don't really make for a very entertaining section. Maps having lava cut off ALL avenues of attack for minutes at a time or weather features that randomly will take out your army and leave the enemy completely unscathed. Most of the options are pretty useless and smaller maps are really just a fast build up.The speed of the game is a bit slow but that is really personal preference. Most of the options are just not worth it.			"

												Mediocre graphics, kinda stiff animations and okay sound? Units mirror between factions and only a handfull of distinctive units & abilities? True for the first look at Etherium, but if you stop playing right there you missed all the fun.The true game potential develops once you get into the deeper mechanics and realized how different the factions are and what a wide load of strategies and buildorders Etherium offers. Even if the game has a strict rock-paper-scissor mechanic with hardcounters all over, there are plenty ways to win without missing possibilities to an individual playstyle.You will see a very good programmed AI, funny but repetitive singleplayer mode, a huge variety of maps, decent balance with just some minor issues, ingame ranking system and a league system similar to SC2. Unfortunately, the game suffers from a very common issue nowadays, a small playerbase.Buy it if gameplay is more important to you than graphics and if you want a straightforward RTS to fill some of your freetime by playing both singleplayer and multiplayer. Otherwise, pass it.EDIT 21/04/15: By now the number of players has reached a point where it become very difficult to get a multiplayer game up without directly inviting a friend. And this downtrend continues.The game itself is great but at the current prize and without the possibility to play decent multiplayer matches I cannot recommend it anymore.			"

												The concept of the game is nice, but very generic. I decided to give t a go anyway, something that I did regret in the end. The game doesn't run very smoothly and I am experiencing quite a bit of lag. In addition to that, there is (at least in my game) a thick layer of fog which I find uneccesary because all it does is limit your vision over the map to a level where the game because nearly unplayable. With these two things combined, it is impossible to play the game properly since the ai has a huge advantage because of this. The combat overal is very rock-paper-scissors like: Each unit has an obvious counter unit, which can be interesting when there are loads of classes, but this game has three main classes. I also find it dissapointing that there are no space battles implemented. When you attack a fleet, it's just dice roll mechanics. With all this said, I think I would reccommend the game if it's on sale and you want to play some RTS every now and then, but if you are an RTS fan and you want an awesome in deth sci-fi RTS experience, stay far away from this game.

												It's a bit of a shame that Etherium falls short of the mark. Clever ideas and ways to introduce people to the RTS genre without bogging them down in tactics and mindgames ultimately mean nothing without a community to stand on, and it seems that Etherium's playerbase has all but vanished. Though it may sacrifice some tactical depth for the sake of making the game more accessible, other changes to a tried-and-tested formula are far less defensible. Hopefully Tindalos has learned that relying solely on multiplayer doesn't always work, particularly when you sacrifice other content for it.			"

												I'm relatively new to PC gaming and I thought I'd try this one out for the promotional week. Fun but laggy on my computer (I'll be the first to admit my PC setup isn't high end by any means), but I had trouble really immersing myself in it. Movement was fun and reminded me of Age of Empires (though I'm sure there are many games that have that sort of mechanism), and I liked the capturing command post aspect reminiscent of battlefront. In all it was an enjoyable few hours and would recommend it for anyone looking to blow a weekend on a new game, but nothing much more than that.			"

Verdict: check back again if the devs ever decide to finish this properly. This feels like an incomplete and still very unstable Early Access title.What it has in its favour: I absolutely love RTS games. That in itself could practically outweigh almost anything. AI is decently intelligent in its decisions (seeks you out, attacks weak points, retreats indefensible/dying units, aware of the environment). UI looks good and is functional. Graphics are good.What it has against it: No single player campaign. A big negative. You only get the equivalent of a skirmish/quickmatch setup screen against the AI, and basically all you can do is try the different maps. Multi-player option suffers from very small player base, even on a free weekend event. The AI at the moment does not have much of a defense against a rush right at the start. All that intelligence wasted cause it never gets past being bombed to pieces right away. Several of the side and float panels can be very obtrusive and tend to get in the way of big parts of the battlefield. Gets very annoying very quickly. The default keyboard hotkey controls are a mess. SQZD instead of WASD to move around?? Randomly chosen letters for 'Skill 1' to 'Skill 6', instead of 1-6, NumPad or F keys. They can be redefined, but for some reason sometimes they reset back to the wacky default. HUGE NEGATIVE: unstable as all hell. First couple of starts didn't even get me into the menu. Then just trying to change the graphics settings to use my native resolution (nothing exotic, 1920x1200) crashed it again. Several attempts at running the tutorial had it just get stuck right after the mission intro cinematic, with no error whatsoever, but completely nonreactive to anything other than Alt-F4. Changing to a smaller windowed mode finally got me into the tutorial, only to have that crash in the end too, which persisted with every skirmish match I tried.There are a couple of nitwits on the forum going around blaming the crashes on people having crap systems or old drivers. Don't let that deceive you: the game does not even come close to straining my rig, during the moments it does run. The fault is in the game (or engine) coding, period.Judging from all this, this title should not have left Early Access yet. This is neither complete nor stable. A game with potential but let down severely by releasing it in this state, and unless it gets some major additional development, patching, and (single-player) content, not worth the current price-tag even at 50%. Devs: please debug and complete this game.			"

												The game has potential, but I can't recommend it at this time.   If you like Starcraft style games where you gather resources, build your army, then kill stuff, then you'll like this game.    The reason why I can't recommend it is because of how buggy the game is.   The game is constantly crashing after missions.    If you're lucky you can play one mission and save the game, but you'll never be able to play 2 missions back to back.    Until a patch comes out that fixes the serious problems with this game, save your money and buy something else.			"

												this game is certainly worth looking into. it has a tutorial that is easy to follow, so learning the game isn't that hard. there are three factions, each with different strengths and weaknesses. it has territory-based gameplay, possibly allowing you to choose effective chokepoints. there's a small variaty of planets, with 4 maps each, and even the map itself is a danger! from sandstorms to earthquakes to the freezing and thawing of lakes, not to mention third party sub-faction which one could destroy or convert them to your cause.                             overall, i'd say it's worth 10 dollars.

												Etherium is a nice RTS which good ideas but is a little 'small' which makes it boring relatively fast. ( for long term usage ) But a nice game for a 30-45 minutes break.The outposts & Hq's are a little inflexible due to the -single- base upgradeability. And the default problem in RTS is also 'available' :_you_ have to build as fast as the KI - and scroll up&down equally fast( nothing for slow guys like me ;) ) And the 10th times of sectors would be much more challenging.~d			"

												Pros:- Faction and Unit Diversity, muliple unique infantry units, eveything has an intended use and purpose.- Large scale conflicts. - Unit count for each faction: approx: 30+ per faction and several turrets each.- Airdropped supply and resupply is cool.- Another RTS type of game, has been and always will be my favorite genre.- Interesting and unique strategy possibility with sub-factions - you and the AI can use them against each other.- AI is fairly capable, it will befriend sub-factions and build an array of units to assault you later in the game.- Two colossals for each side, nice surprise.-Weather system is a lot of fun, seeing a hurricane come when you in the middle of an air assault is great.- Overall, I'm really enjoying this game, the uniqueness of each faction is really nice, totally enjoy the Vectides look and feel.- Stable, no game breaking bugs noted.- Ability to upscale image in game, pick higher resolution than your monitor and then have it downscaled to fit your monitor, no this is not AMD VSR or Nvidia DSR - it's within the game itself, I'm using Nvidia 770m.Cons:Intar just looks as if each unit were comprised of about 50 polygons (being somewhat generous here). Whoever did the graphics for this faction needs to SERIOUSLY take a moment to reflect on their overall level of effort. Quality wise, it's Vectides>>>>>Consortium>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Intar- No articulated parts on tanks and many other vehicles, i.e., tracks that don't move, units that literally glide over the terrain = painful to watch.- Units do not emit any type of munitions, for example a multiple rocket launcher - never truly fires a rocket, everything is supposed, no rockets ever leave the tube.- Maps, horrible looking, think red, red, red - everything, the one world where it's supposed to look somewhat similar to earth, more red. Everything is flat, meaning there are minimal shards of vegetation, you'll see things that look like grass, though they are lifeless, as are the planets themselves. They have a low resolution cell-shaded appearance. - Sound has static throughout at random times.- No way currently to offset teams, 2 vs 1 etc. everything has to be equal.- No save game function in skirmish mode.- No advanced movements, formations etc.- Units will not engage often unless directly forced to, your base can be under assault and your units unless they are directly in the enemies line of sight will not engage.That said, I really like this game a lot, would love to see a fourth faction via DLC and some more maps offered.

												In the grand scheme of things, there's enough here to justify the price tag.  Most matches take anywhere from 20-60 minutes to beat and if you're playing ""conquest"", expect to be at it for a while...not because the map is large (it's in fact only a few planets with 3 locations on each), but because the AI attacks the same spots/locations over and over again.  This can get very tedious, especially when there's no auto-resolve button.  Like Grey Goo, I was disappointed with the skirmish options (1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2) and honestly miss the Warcraft II days where I could do an 8 player FFA.  Everything else is fairly interestering, taking ques from both Star Wars Empire At War and Company of Heroes.  There are some things it can do better, but it offers enough to get a recommend from me.

												Would like to recomend this game however I can't due to the fact it crashes EVERY hour.Reasonable but very repetative game play where the AI can right out of the gate attack you multiple times and you can only take 1/3 colonies on a planet, which has 3 small maps. Tech tree is short and to the point and unit variety consists of basic infanty, heavy infantry, scouts, light tanks, heavy tanks, artillary and air to air and air to ground air craft. Defensive structures are the same cookie cutter anti infantry, anti armor, anti air, and artillary.Maybe with some polish, bug squashing, and a large injection of new ""balanced"" ( key word there ) units, and some larger maps this game could have some real potential. As it sits at the moment gotta give the thumbs down even at 50% off ( 9.99 )			"

												I really like Etherium as a fast paced RTS style game. It's a really nice spin on the traditional setup the major companies have been putting out. My review is more on the single player side (conquest).Pros:The AI can be a real challenge.~It uses player style tactics for run and gun~Base developement relys on a ""territory/node"" structure, which is unique.~Forces newer players to expand and make tactical decisions quickly~Cons:At the current moment, its too buggy in the conquest mode. The game randomly closes out at the end of a mission and the units suddenly become uncommandable.Also, not being able to save in the middle of a mission is a problem. If any of Etherium's Developers are reading this, there are times that real life calls and we don't want to loose 18 minutes of progress.A minor one, but all the units (whatever race you're playing) seem to be the same minus the skins. Would be nice to see different animations/graphics for each group.I think that this game could really shine, it just needs a few more patches.6/10			"

												Okay, so who would like to play Dune? The race for spi... err.... etherium is on!Played a couple of skirmishes and a bit of conquest, had a lot of crashes. While the games little campaign in the form of Conquest is a very nice idea with building fleets and conquering planets etc., I found the rts elements rather weak. It seems like it depends way too much on just statistics, although the forests/buildings give infantry a pretty goodd chance even in late-game, and the maps are designed with the idea of infantry using these covered areas for flanking.For an RTS game it lacks some control options too, which makes the experience a bit difficult.Along with the crashes I've had, I simply can't recommend this game to anyone.

												Fine, I recognisethe small budget outfit and the indie title. That aside, the game still remains buggy, crashing for me after each mission. So minus major points there. Graphics-wise, I'd be impressed if this was the early 2000s, but I wouldn't complain so much. Graphics in games, well, the units in the game collectively act as a squadron, which means each unit has to be animated, and controlled, while reinforcements do come in to replenish fallen squadmates.That mechanic, quickly gets boring and, since reinforcing fallen squadmates don't take resources, it's easy to defend, tough to attack. So what's it like? Well, Etherium is kinda like leading campaigns on a world map (galaxy map), targetting specific planets to gain territory. Unfortunately, I've only played less than 2 hours, and I fail to see the appeal here, as more planets should automatically mean more resources to bring to war but to avoid unbalanced the developer didn't put too much into it. Once you've selected a territory to attack, it enters this real-time strategy mode, where its the basic gather resources and pump units and attack. However, the battlemap is divided into areas where you control via building outposts, sort of like the WarCraft III ziggurats of the Undead, where you just expand your territory, while the enemy expands his.On the early onset, there's some early skirmishes, where the faster units start harassing certain locations of base. However, after a while, it drags on into this sort of trench warfare with the AI, which sends units forth, your defense leave them running, and they go back to their outpost which heals and reinforces the squads, and rinse, dry and repeat. Victory comes either by quickly overruning the opponent and sapping his resources in the early game, pulling out a technologically superior unit or taking control of one of the various neutral spawns on the map. I find myself overrunning the opponent with a mix of heavy tanks, and long range mortars. However, because of the ""tech tree""is in the larger world map, instead of the ingame battle map, you gotta choose which tech tree to upgrade in your war against the opponent. Fine, this means that if you got rocket infantry, while the opponent chooses to upgrade only his air units, you got him beat and overrun, and it would take many turns before he will have sufficient tech points to muster a counter. This would make for some painful games. Learning curve is steep, the game has too many mechanics to overcompensate for its lack of tactical debt, and one of my biggest annoyance is the unit voices. Storyline is uninteresting, and only meh. 4/10 4/10 with rice.			"

												I have played Etherium during it's week free to play time. In this time I have done a few missions and I must say I quite liked the entire set up it has.The thing that worries me the most, however, is that it is riddeled with bugs and has an unfinished feel about it because of that.Several times it has crashed for me, mostly after missions. But it has even happened in a mission.If you can bear with several crashes and hold out hope that they will fix all of it's issues, good on you and I hope you enjoy this game.If, however, you wish for a more finished RTS, do not buy this game, for it has bugs and missing data that will crash the game.I shall most likely never look back at this title because of the poor first impression it left me.

												After playing it during this July's free week (2015), I've decided to purchase this game, and here's why:1. A galactic battle map aside from the planetary tactical battle map adds a layer of strategy.2. Gameplay mechanics focussing on resource management makes a tank rush strategy virtually impossible and thus, fun.3. The purchasing and selling of base upgrades allows for strategy changes mid-game and thus adds to fluidity of battle.4. The ability to look up at the sky and see orbital battle between fleets while conducting ground combat gives off an epic feeling.That being said, there are some caveats:1. The game crashes quite a bit. This can be frustrating in the heat of battle.2. The AI could sometimes be quite dumb. All in all, I like this game. This game is recommended if you like the Tiberian series as well as Dawn of War II.			"

If you like Starcraft style games where you gather resources, build your army, then kill stuff, then you'll like this game.    The reason why I can't recommend it is because of how buggy the game is.   The game is constantly crashing after missions.    If you're lucky you can play one mission and save the game, but you'll never be able to play 2 missions back to back.    Until a patch comes out that fixes the serious problems with this game, save your money and buy something else.			"

												this game is certainly worth looking into. it has a tutorial that is easy to follow, so learning the game isn't that hard. there are three factions, each with different strengths and weaknesses. it has territory-based gameplay, possibly allowing you to choose effective chokepoints. there's a small variaty of planets, with 4 maps each, and even the map itself is a danger! from sandstorms to earthquakes to the freezing and thawing of lakes, not to mention third party sub-faction which one could destroy or convert them to your cause.                             overall, i'd say it's worth 10 dollars.

												Boot up, play the tutorial, get the achievment (or not) and the game fatally crashes. Play in Conquest Mode, and while not always, but 3/4 of the time, the game will crash when the battle ends. Does it save your result from battle after sometimes a long fought conflict? No. It only saves in the Conquest Map (prior to battle) and you must fight that land battle all over again. And sometimes, again, and again, again. And the AI lovers land battles, so there's no avoiding them.The game itself, while playing is enjoyable with a flashy UI and good looking units (even if all the races are the same, just re-skinned). For a fiver, it's worth it. Looks good, plays well and has an interesting approach to base-building.However, with the crash problem never to be addressed by the Devs (they have even taken down their support email address) avoid this mess and don't be fooled by the pretty pictures.Sure, it doesn't crash for everyone (PC's vary as much as wiildlife) but it's a coin toss to find out if you are one of the very lucky few.

												In the grand scheme of things, there's enough here to justify the price tag.  Most matches take anywhere from 20-60 minutes to beat and if you're playing ""conquest"", expect to be at it for a while...not because the map is large (it's in fact only a few planets with 3 locations on each), but because the AI attacks the same spots/locations over and over again.  This can get very tedious, especially when there's no auto-resolve button.  Like Grey Goo, I was disappointed with the skirmish options (1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2) and honestly miss the Warcraft II days where I could do an 8 player FFA.  Everything else is fairly interestering, taking ques from both Star Wars Empire At War and Company of Heroes.  There are some things it can do better, but it offers enough to get a recommend from me.

												Etherium is a really fun RTS game, in fact it reminds me of Gray Goo.I'm not going to make a complex review i'll just leave the pros and consPROSVery fun gameplayTedious A.I at timesA semi wide range of maps to choose fromInteresting backstories to the 3 nationsCONSNot many units to choose from (not a small amount yet not a large one either)Frequent crashes (For me at least.)I rate this game a 7/10, it's fun for the time being but after a while it becomes routine. I also gave a low-ish rating because for me, every time i won or lost a battle the game would crash every time. Worst part is in conquest mode i can win a battle and it will crash before the auto save kicks in. Meaning all my progress... Gone..			"

												If you haven't bought this game yet, don't bother. It isn't good. Animation quality is horrible and hilarious at the same time, tech-trees and base expansion mechanics are just weird - it looks like they wanted to make decent base building mechanics (like in StarCraft), but then changed their minds and created something new - a total mess. If you want something like a classic RTS, just buy Grey Goo - that game isn't special either, but at least it has some quality standarts. But if you still want to give it a shot - be my guest. You might just like it, but it will take a lot of time to get used to it.			"

												English and Italian Review (Recensione in inglese e italiano)English:Etherium is a good RTS that will give pleasure to those looking for a different approach to the genre but who grew up with Westwood or Blizzard RTS  might turn up their noses because the lack of an exciting plot and a monotone campaign for all three factions could bring down the initial enthusiasm for a title, however, longevous that presents interesting ideas thanks to some successful stylistic and gameplay choices.Italiano:Etherium è un discreto RTS che potrà far piacere a chi cerca un approccio diverso al genere ma che potrebbe far storcere il naso a chi è cresciuto con i titoli Westwood o Blizzard, in quanto la mancanza di una trama entusiasmante e una monocorde campagna per tutte e tre le fazioni potrebbero far calare l’iniziale entusiasmo per un titolo che, comunque, si dimostra longevo e presenta interessanti spunti grazie ad alcune riuscite scelte stilistiche e di gameplay.Articolo completo: http://www.gamesource.it/etherium-recensione/ "

												the game has some very good concepts such as sectors, hiding infantry in trees, dropship reinforcments and the three different styles of the facions with their own unique strategies and abilities. But some of the gameplay is confusing like getting the war machines ('mega' units) and has an easy alternative to winning by attacking the fleet rather than destroying the base.			"

												this is a good game, i'm not going to lie. but there is this way to beat your enemies thats cool, but way too overpowered, you can build cannons that shoot at your orbiting fleet AKA your only source of more soldiers. the AI builds tons of orbital cannons that blow up your orbiting fleet as your fighting. I cant think of any thing more dishonorable than that. plus its way too overpowered. I got completely destroyed by the AI in five minutes by they're orbital artillary cannons and I blew up they're bases multiple times each. It didn't help that they had highly elite war colosai either. and the sub factions are badasses, if you don't rally them you get blocked off from half the map . and there are huge weather events that either disable your abillities our kill half your army. I thought this game would be very good and it is but I wouldn't play this until they tone down the AI badassness			"

												as gameplay goes, I can best describe this as ""RTS for Newbies"" as it takes a semi streamlined style of RTS base building akin to Company of Heroes or Dawn of War 2. Not an amazing game, but it was easy enough for me to pick up and play. Though I must say it does feel a bit incomplete at times and the tutorial leaves much to be desired and the HUD is a bit chaotic and hard to follow. Once you get into it though it gets a little better, but it still leaves much to be desired.Do I recommend this game? yeah i think it's worth a play if you like Dawn of War 2 and COH. The gameplay might get old rather quickly, but I still stand by what i say. It's fun to kill time with. You have 3 factions each with their own special units and their own special off-map abilities with different types of economies and population growth. For example one factoin starts off with 4 ""Division"" (unit) slots and a special unit that specializes in tactical espianage while another faction starts off with 3 ""Division"" slots, requires a research level 3 to access their Special Elite units but in the mean time has an off-map support that allows a player to rabidly promote basic units to higher, more effective levels so as to outclass enemies in the battlefield. The three factions are easy to learn but difficult to master and and you can choose 1 of 4 different maps from up to 6 different environments, each with their own unique environmental hazards that can make or break unit deployments. during key points in your skirmish. So yeah, I can recommend this game for the price that it is now ($20.00). It's not the best RTS I've ever played but it's more certainly not the worst. Some good effort was put into making this game and it shows.			"

												It tries to do too much. The outpost system, limiting units, limiting structures and a dumbed down way to upgrade your tech level (ways to unlock more powerful units/turrets) just dont mesh well here. Add to it the minor factions that may or may not be on your map, and its a game that tries too much, and fails.With limited access to units, you are left with either expanding rapidly, or build turrets to attempt to slowly turtle forward to new outposts. However both methods have major disadvantages.-Expanding rapidly leads to issues with making the ideal unit comp. With so few units possible to command at one time, you either have to guess at what you will be fighting or move forward with a very generalised comp. -Crawling foward has the issue of being low on resorces. Since you need to expand to increase income, slowly moving forward leads to being potentially left behind in tech level and unit production. That is an issue because of the limit on turrets per outpost (territory under you control). With only three turrets to defend with, you must (again) guess at what is going to be thrown at you, or generalise. Ultimatly, the game has interesting ideas but is crippled by the extreemly limiting population caps. Going forth and hoping that your comp will be relivant when you enter combat is never fun. Add to it the limited locations that you can call units from (you CAN get them to your front line faster, but that has major drawbacks depending on where the front line is), and sending in your few precious units to get instantly destroyed can become extreemly costly.

												This Game is Great if you like stratigy games like Supreme Cammander And Age of Empires. This is the game for you!Hints/Tips: The Vectide is an Assaault Type Class. But can have 4 turrets at/on Tile. It is more of an infantry TypeThe Consortium is a Human Based Faction that is  more of a defense type. It is more of a Vehicle and Air  type.and the Intar are the mid type class it has decent defence and decent attack. it is more of a Experimental type.you should go on the defensive at first and save up recources to build some expierimentals. You should also try making friends with other factions like the Gaurdians and the Parisites those are the best friends that you would want.There are 2 gamemodes there is the Classic 1v1 or 2v2 and then there is the singleplayer match called Conquest it is a game were you travel to diffrent planets in space and take them over. you can build more ships for a stronger Fleet. But sadly in space its a turn base game. But you can battle other fleets for control over a planet. It is a Realy fun gamemode!If i had to rate this game i'd rate it a 10 out of 10! The Game is difficult but if you get the hang of it then try fighting online if ai isnt hard eanough for you! it can get pretter crazy up there!			"

												Nope! Crashy crashy crashy crashy. The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, always chooses between a very limited and like minded attack pattern that is easily predictable and counterable. On 'Hard' mode, instead of increasing the AI revenue of strategies and reaction times, they just copped out and give it resources bonuses and buffs. That's not innovation, it's laziness. That is, if you manage to go between games without crashing. Finishing up that hour long hard fought battle for your single holding while invading a planet? NOPE crashed right as you won. GG bro. Going to redo it? NOPE crashed again. Think you're smart and attack somewhere else instead? Kill their Main base? Nice. Do you get to keep the victory? NOPE crashed when you tried to go back to the conquest screen.Here's the tenants;They managed to take most of the base building out of base buildingThey created a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI and buffed it for difficulty - successful granted.Quadrupled the time it takes to play conquest due to well placed crashesRepublished the same units over and over with different skinsAND made an overall poor quality RTS that's hardly stable, and very generic.

												EtheriumI did enjoy this game but it has no story and the conquest is just repeating battles and this game does not have a big enough base so no-one is playing multiplayer.Pros:-Each factions have 1-3 unique abilities.-The units have a unique look to them.-The maps have unique features and abilities which affect the turn of battle (they hugely benefit the Intar).Cons:-This game would have been better if each of the factions were more unique and had more unique units (The Intar have only unit which no other faction has).-There are not enough maps maps becasue it is just the same 4 planets with different zones and they only have 4 2v2 maps and 2v2 is the better mode.-The AI seem to be really easy to beat on the hardest mode.-They have not added an content to the game in the 6+ months it has been released and they have only patched a few problems and they still have other problems to fix.I would not recommend this to anyone who has played other RTS like Starcraft 2 because it does not have the problems this game does.Date:25/10/2015			"

Play the opening tutorial game several times just to get the hang of it or you'll find yourself overstretching resources and extensions and getting swamped by the enemy before you've built up enough power in depth.  Can go from easy-peasy to infuriatingly difficult in just a few seconds if you don't keep track of everything on the minimap, and develope a strategy that consolidates newly claimed territories, and deploying infantry units, before moving on to conquer the next.  In the end it all comes down to numbers....			"

												The game crashes all the time. I never had to normally close this game so why do they design the 'exit' button.Sporadic crash is critical bug and should be addressed immediately. However it seems this company never had a chance to address this issue and provide feedback to customers since the release of the game, which makes me suspect that this is a result of a) ineptness of management and prioritization or b) engineering failure of the product. In either case I'd avoid this company in the future.It seems after releasing a game everybody moves on to the next project - lack of quality assurance and lack of maintenance seems not to be an issue for them. This is incredibly bad practice in software development and total ignorance of engineering ethics. I myself is an engineer and I have zero tolerance to that.			"

												In light of the failures of the Command and Conquer series to produce anything resembling C&C: Tiberium Sun to C&C2: Yuri's Revenge in the recent years, it only makes sense that a company push into the RTS business to try and pick up a broken market.Etherium isn't that push-company.Mind you, I only played through the tutorial before the game crashed, so that's all this review goes off of before I uninstalled the game. If I can't play through a tutorial before it smokes itself, then I can't be bothered to play it with more than a hundred games in my Steam Library. #PCMasterRaceThe graphics are gorgeous. The scaling in and out is perfect and works well with the resolutions, and I picked a medium-sized 2058x1128 or something with Maximum-everything. #LoveMyR9290XThe gameplay is a bit clunky and slow-paced, from what I managed in the tutorial after it ends and allows you to finish the level out. Building troops is meh and there's little instruction in the tutorial on the slots per command post (some have 1 and some have 3), however its your call once you discover that a slot can be filled with tech, repair, more troops, etc ... but these aren't covered in the tutorial.The vagueness of the tutorial is also irritating. There's no indication that once air transport has lifted comms troops, and you move them, of how to drop them. So you're looking all over the map, re-reading the directions of what to do next and eventually you'll find the drop-circle over the air transport. Seems obvious, but there's 1000000000 buttons on the HUD for every little thing and you're clueless as to what everything does in the beginning.Suggestion: Grey them out for the Tutorial until they're usable. A bit overwhelming.And in the end, I got Raiders to join me, picked up some little rocket buggies, orbital struck the enemy base for ... 0 damage, pretty much, like the tanks, a bit depressing when it comes to tactical firepower and then you just overwhelm the base with like 30 troops and the game crashes.</the end>My windows manager showed that the game was taking something like 2M K of memory at the time of crash (on 8 cores with 16 GB of RAM isn't much, but I digress) and tried to freeze up my system.Not sure why. Nothing is out of date. No explanations. And in reading the forums or community board, only morons claiming that ""your PC is a potato"" is the answer for crashes and you have bad drivers. To him I say, ""Blow me, trollfays. Your nubile PC is no match or comparison for my Kingslayer. Uninstall."" ... or something nerdy like that.Stick to old C&C if you need your RTS-cravings satiated.			"

												This game has potential but it crashes after every other battle.  Since there is no campaign but instead a ""conquest"" mode it makes it impossible to progress or really play the game at all.  Glad I go to try it on the free weekend, because this game needs some serious patching.  I would give it a 7/10, and actually for a small company this is an amazing game with some interesting game concepts, but the crashes kill it.			"

												As of now, don't buy this game. The lack of an option to SAVE YOUR GAME during a skirmish is idiotic. Especially seeing as how the single player skirmishes can go on for quite some time. Also the frequent crashes means having to redo missions I already did, again because of the lack of a save option. 6 hours in this game so far. 4 crashes and I've only finished 3 skirmishes because I keep having to redo them... Singleplayer is worthless as of now, multiplayer might be fun though.			"

It's like they just picked at random where to put specific buttons.  The game needs some serious interface design rework.  All this and random crashes, too.  At this stage I just can't recommend it.  Hopefully they can fix it.			"

												Have you played an RTS within the past 10 years? Then you probably have seen everything worth seeing in Etherium already. The biggest issue with RTS games nowadays (and other ""dead genres"" being ""revived"" lately) is that they try to get away with being just ""good enough"". There is nothing groundbreaking, nothing creative or inventive, no new game design ideas present here and, despite having its release pushed back multiple times, feels like instant bargain bin fodder during a genre drought. Outside of the mandatory multiplayer, you have a campaign with convoluted rules (with each side having their own secondary victory conditions) and a skirmish mode. The campaign is very frustrating because of simple oversights, like not being able to save during your opponent's turns and a star system UI that doesn't provide enough information. I spent easily almost two hours defending my territories during opponent's turns simply because quitting the game meant restarting the opponent's turn. This is of course on top of all the issues present in the actual gameplay......of which there is little to mention. The main objective (and single game mode) is to either destroy the other player's main base or deplete their tickets by bombarding their mothership with turrets high in the tech tree. Regions of territory are strictly defined and can have only one base inside for adding upgrades onto. The problem with the territories having a fixed size is that smaller territories only allow smaller bases. This creates claustrophobic maps, with clearly defined chokepoints that force you down a corridor to your opponent's base. Most of my campaign victories were from converting the neutral factions on the map and attack-moving them into the enemy's main base. The absolute bare minimum went into Etherium's factions and their unit design. Units for each race have creative names like Standard Infantry, Siege Vehicle, and Bomber. Races share all the same units (!) with each having only 4 unique units. This might be acceptable in a turn-based strategy game where you have 20+ factions or dozens of units, but here you only have about 6 different units for each unit type. Each race also shares 3 of their 6 faction skills, similar to Dawn of War's faction ability system. Everything about the races just feels very cut-and-pasted and bland and makes me wonder why this game's release was pushed back multiple times.I am ashamed to have fallen for the hype for this game. If you are thirsty for a good (or great or amazing, whatever) RTS, then revisit an old one instead of wasting money on this. This game couldn't be any blander or generic if it tried. If a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter could eventually type out the complete works of William Shakespeare, then this game is proof that they can code a video game too.			"

Although the narrator and background stories are very impressive the game just doesn't have a spark to it. After about 2 hours of playing I got bored and moved on to another game. The game is only worth the price while its on sale, and that is why I cannot recommend Etherium.4/10			"

												I will say one thing, the AI is very good, but because of the unit balancing and limited map/resource it eventually just becomes a grind on each combat game.  Some of the maps feature big fixed obstacles which forces you into a very specific mode of play, attack here - defend here kind of thing.  Which is frustrating when coupled with the early limitations on unit sizes and tech trees.Space combat - yeah six planets.  You can dart between locations and point and click at an enemy fleet or the ground.  No actual graphic intense combat scenes ensue.  A lot of the intro videos allude to much more in the game, but sadly there isnt.  The developers have made a very good AI and if you do play the campaign you'll find the only way to successfully hold your own is to mercifully squeeze every resource and exploit possible.It is what it is, but its not what they selling it as through their videos.  Can't compare this with Planetary Annihilation or Empire at War, if thats what you want - buy Grey Goo at twice the price.  Because this is not comparable.Also: not being able to exit to desktop from any level in the game.. ?  Why?.... "

												Etherium is a little title with big problems. It is mainly a little title, because for the price asked, 29.99$ on launch, it simply doesn’t pack enough content to be worth the hassle. Outdated graphics, lazily-created assets and the lack of innovation bring this title down to the rank of a mere husk of what similar titles in a similar price range can offer. Etherium does actually sport some innovative concepts, such as differentiating between macro management of a full-scale interplanetary invasion with some table-top gaming features and singular battles or dynamic weather changes across the maps which require players to adapt in order to survive, but these are executed so blatantly that any sign of innovation gets lost in a sea of repetitiveness, and in the general lack of originality this title seems to ooze. Were players able to look past the lack of lore, the unoriginal factions and gameplay, they would be stuck with a brain-dead AI, which will do stupid things such as walking their units straight into an orbital bombardment or a volcanic eruption, randomly stop playing by simply amassing resources without creating any units or, especially on Easy difficulty, stubbornly try to do the same thing over and over again expecting things to change, while retaining the ability to become a great challenge if set to the hardest difficulty possible. All of this makes Etherium, in its current state, a game that should not be bought. If looking for an RTS experience, players would be better off buying similar but more fleshed out titles or, in any case, direct their attention elsewhere.Read the full review here: http://www.gamerheadlines.com/reviews/etherium/ "

A real-time strategy game much like Command and Conquer but more on the faction of mining ""Etherium"" and preventing and/or eliminating the enemy from stealing more than you.The tutorial is pretty helpful but there's so much to look at it's very overwhelming, I myself am not very good at RTS' and furthermore don't really care for them.Pretty interesting game.6/10 "

												I know this is an opinion but! i realy like this game. sure i dont have many hours but still. there are a few pros and cons but from the start im just gonna say that there is a mode that  is not rts at some parts.Pros1.There are 3 different faction and so many possibilities!2.I personaly found the conquest fun.3.There are so many ground units.4.There are abilities5.There are 2 ways you can lose:1: defeat the enemys temple. 2:defeat the enemys fleet6.You can put buildings on your city to defeat them.7.The game is pretty tough to me im still stuck at fighting 1 normal and 1 easy together on the enemy team with my friend.ConsSorry i cant think of any cons right now...And thats my review.

												I love RTS. That being said, I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you like RTS games in general and want to fiddle with one for a short while.The game's singleplayer is really just a tie-in, but it's not even a good one; there's almost no lore, the game works in a tutorially way (start at low tech, go up to high) but with no tips for beginners (ie, you probably want to study the game a bit first before jumping in).The game is more fun multiplayer; but if you're looking for a good multiplayer RTS experience there are already plenty of better games out there; the only intrigue this game provides is the weather system which offsets how you play the game on that particular map.

I'm not a Chicken!It must suck to be a chicken, you lay eggs and people eat them, you don't lay enough eggs and people eat you.It's little wonder that chickens have a nervous disposition, If I were a chicken, I'd be a chicken too.Avoiding the EggcupThere are plenty of other less tasty creatures that lay eggs, most of which have some sort of strategy to keep them safe until they hatch.Turtles will bury their eggs in the sand, penguins will shuffle about with their eggs balancing on their feet (Happy Feet was a great film wasn't it!) and Xenomorphs will lay their eggs in the chests of Colonial Marines.Inter-dimensional ChickensNow there's another creature, the Madrith (some sort of giant inter-dimensional chicken), which has a unique strategy to keep its eggs safe, it lays them in another dimension where I assume it hopes that they'll be safe from their natural predators.Unfortunately this strategy doesn't really work out too well for the Madrith as the dimension it has chosen to be its safety blanket is ours.What came first, The Madrith or the Egg?Well, from our perspective, that's an easy one. The egg, it's always the egg, there's a perfectly good planet floating around minding its own business when ""Boom"" a ruddy great egg appears on its surface, no sign of the Madrith, just the egg, it's always just the tasty, tasty egg.Egg and SoldiersThese particular giant eggs are far too valuable to be left alone whilst nature takes its course,  they're so valuable in fact, that when they start appearing once every thousand years or so, the whole galaxy gears up to fight over them.Free Range Spicy Tiberium AlternativeYou see, these eggs contain a unique and amazing resource, a minute quantity of which can produce enough energy to power a large colony and enable vast vessels to travel through space at the speed of light.This eggy gas is so valuable that the three dominant races of the galaxy, in anticipation of a visit from the extra-dimensional Easter bunny, build up their forces and the millennial ""Egg Wars"" begin. Eggs-ploreLuckily for us, the  Madrith are creatures of habit, they always lay their eggs on six ""deposit"" planets, each with their own varied environments, ranging from"" Hoth-like"" Ice Worlds to ""Tatooine-like"" desert globes, each environment provides its own challenges, it's own weather events (which is a nice touch) and each will require a different strategic approach.To get to these planets you're going to need to construct fleets and park them in orbit, from there you can clear out any enemy fleets before sending the troops down for the ground warDon't expect a ""Distant Worlds"" or ""Sins of a Solar Empire"" type experience here though, this is a simplistic ""space layer"" used primarily to select which planet to fight on next with a little espionage and research mixed in for good measure.Eggs-ploitWhen you've selected your battleground of choice, you'll be treated  to a cut scene showing the seed of your first colony drop down from space and establish your initial base.You'll quickly want to sniff out some eggy goodness and start gathering its Etherium, this will be the resource you'll be using to build units and structures in the game.Eggs-pandEach planet is divided up into territories with each territory having a monolith which you need to take control of.This is achieved by building a ""Comms Infantry"" which you can send out to establish an outpost at the monolith site.These outposts can then be expanded with a choice of extensions, each of which will provide a bonus regarding Etherium production, research, number of units you can control, etc.You can also build a limited number of turrets to help defend your interests in each territory. There are a few different types to choose from, each with their own particular strengths and weaknesses.Eggs-terminateThey say that attack is the best form of defence and that certainly holds true in Etherium.You're going to need an effective war machine to remove any unwanted intruders from the map and there are plenty of units for you to construct, providing you've had chance to research them, the command points to control them and the Etherium to pay for their construction.This research mechanic does  make the initial combat encounters of the game a slightly shallow affair as you'll only be churning out basic infantry until you've managed to build up a few research points to unlock the more interesting units.Egg-straIn addition to the three dominant powers in the game you also encounter three minor races.You can steam roller over these and wipe them out or if you want to be a little more subtle, you can try and bring them round to your side, this is achieved by converting some of your Etherium refinery improvements in to a black-market service which will gain the minor factions favour, you might even benefit from a unique unit or two if you take the time to play nice with the little guys.There are also a bunch of special abilities you can utilise to give you an edge on the battlefield, these range from temporarily dispelling the fog of war in a certain place on the map to blasting the hell out of an area with an orbital cannon (which is hugely satisfying!).There is also a political card mechanic which you can play in the space layer of the game between battles, these could help you ally with one of the previously mentioned ""little races"" or maybe even force an enemy to miss a turn. This is a welcome addition to add a little more depth to the game.FabergeLike a Faberge egg, Etherium can be quite pleasing to look at initially, holding the right mouse button down lets you look around the landscape, you can even look up to the sky where you'll see ships in orbit taking pot shots at each other.However, the more you look  at a Faberge Egg, the more you realise it's just a glittery egg, the same can be said of Etheriums graphics, once the novelty of the right click free cam wears off, the graphics themselves begin to look a little mundane, not awful, just not as special as you'd initially hoped.""Cut"" ScenesDon't go into this game expecting rich cut scenes and a detailed narrative thread interwoven between the battles or you'll be disappointed, the fight for the eggs premise is about as deep as the plot gets, which is a little disappointing, I've always viewed little narrative cut scenes in RTS titles to be a reward for winning the preceding battle.Hello, Anyone There?Etherium also really wants to be a multiplayer title, which is fine and probably explains the lack of narrative, but online play does seem a little on the quiet side, especially for such a new game, that's not to say that by the time you read this a healthy community won't have built up around the multiplayer experience....  I hope so because it's needed to increase the longevity of the games appeal.However, the single player campaign and skirmish modes whilst not dazzling  are perfectly entertaining in their own right and the AI seems competent which is always a huge plus for an RTS title.Egg-eriumEtherium is a competent RTS and it ticks a lot of the right boxes, if your looking for a straight forward no nonsense experience you could do a lot worse, the downside is that whilst its a perfectly playable RTS it doesn't really bring anything new to the breakfast table.It's like an egg, it's nice, you know what to expect, if you're in the mood for it then you'll probably enjoy it, but sometimes you want something more than an egg for breakfast.For the full review and others please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ "

												Yet another rock-paper-scissors RTS clickfest in the vein of WH4K: Dawn of War and Starcraft. If you like strategy games where your ability to issue orders quickly is more important than long-term planning, you should consider getting this. The three fractions are varied, graphics and visual design are nice, the battles are fast and hectic. I prefer deeper and slower games like Supreme Commander and Wargame, so I don't recommend getting this.Note to TA/SupCom fans: I bought Etherium because of that one review claiming it is similar to Supreme Commander. I was dissapointed.			"

												EDIT: online is dead. Zero movement in rankings. Good game, bad marketing, ugly reviews. It's like everyone in modern world has the right to vote: kids at their 18-teens, housewives who produce nothing; former prisoners and just arrived imigrants. For most people RTS is just like Windows solitaire: they're are playing on scripted maps to achieve 1 single result set by designer(s). They don't know what competitivness is, but they do write reviews. Anyway, if you wanted to play a game with complex build-orders like SupCom (not degenerative ones, like in CoH2) and much more than 5-phases-escalated gameplay(it's very very parallel), then your chance is lost (but wait, you could always play with me and some of my friends, if you don't mind, because community is dead too).And if it's proper for me to advise, don't buy Grey Goo instead of this. It's primitive. Felt like 2003-'s. Not bad, but worse than warcraft3, generals, AOM, any successfull title of the past. And yes, it was made by Petroglyph, ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, who was kicked off after Emperor:BFD has failed, (was a good game, actually) and the greatest game of C&C serie was made without them. They made that Universe at war instead which I still want to refund.***It looks like the game designed not in a way that favours the most. Well, units aren't individually voiced and graphics could bear some amount of detail ) But game do have it's rich side, it's internal design - mechanics. Conventions is complex and at the same time wouldn't terrorize you with extensive detail.Can't say a word about the singleplayer, but may bring you a tale from the past: C&C3 1.03, crashing on start, F-U most of the WinXP users - So, where is everybody now? - Playing campaign.If you think this game is not good enough for it's money, think again: there was that Planetary Anihilation thing, and someone pay for NO current orbital bombarment and NO current planets collision, like, 49,99£ or 49-99$ (personally took it on the zommer sale for ~ 29zi). And somehow, PA by now got Postive user reviews, while Ethrium is currently Mixed... At the very least, you'll get complete game with no dropped features, balanced and stable.Considering bugs. The only one I had was when the game randomly redefined my control keys(pretty strange and was only once). And yes, there is a good connection on the multiplayer, and, looks like, no lag-compression(or it's tuned just fine; anyway, no missing orders here).Good-made RTS. Took what is needed from the genre and expanded it with it's own content. Not a revolution, of course, but may be a good start for a new serie.If you are fan of RTS, getting bored of your current rank, or just in search of smt adequately new, this game is for you.			"

												No Manual and the tutorial really didn't help much either.  It didn't go over the basics of what is on the screen like what do these various icons do? All it did was list a few things I could do and how to do those things. Thumbs down on the manual and tutorial.I also didn't see an obvious way to pause the game to be able to see what was going on without pushing the 'esc' button and that put me to a different menu.I couldn't get into the game. It had more of an arcade feel than a strategy feel though it certainly had strategy elements. Maybe if there was a good manual, a good tutorial and an obvious pause button (I may have missed it), I might have been more interested in going further.  It was a target of opportunity on a Steam free play period.It also had the feel of a small unit tactic game, rather than a strategic game.The game maybe fine for people who are more interested in the genre than me. I wish there was a neutral rating so I'll give the game the benefit of the doubt and go with a thumbs up particularly with the note below.On the plus side the game could run on a machine with a smaller video card than that listed under requirements.  It said it needed a 1024mb card when I have a 256mb card. The tutorial ran fine.  I didn't bother getting beyond that though I don't see any reason why smaller scenarios wouldn't run OK as well.			"

												The game crashes after the first mission for me.I've made the 'Conquest' mode twice, crashed twice and did not find the save option twice.I don't have a huge opinion about this game, but I'll say what I think.For what I've played, it is insanely good. At the beginning of the game, I've felt some lack of units. There is only 4 units to choose from and even upgrading the tech level, other units are blocked. I've felt that it is quite simple too. The upgrades are made with a simple logic of building tech centers and done. There are no unit upgrade.I didn't like the IA, thought. If some random unit comes close your territory and you have 10 units, but only one have the enemy unit on their line of fire, only this unit will attack. So, it's really weird to see 9 units watching 1 unit fighting alone and dying. I'm old RTS fan and I do enjoy low-paced games, but I need some time to enjoy it, to play it. Must me something wrong with my PC crashing the game, so I will give a thumbs up because I did still liked the game.			"

												I do recomend this game mainly for the fact that while the game can be short, it is still fun, especially since I am a fan of RTS games. However, the only downside I have of this is thefact that this gme does have some bugs.The first which is infuriating in a way is that whenever my teammate eft early in game, I couldn't take anything, and by that, I mean I could, but nothng happens after that, it is like a neverending build time.The second bug that I have found which made me very♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off however is where I somehow couldn't use either the air trsnport option or even sell anything. This bug has only happened once, but completely ruined my gaming mood when I was in a actual game that had players that weren't the usual afkers or the ones who are obvious newbs.Despite those bugs, I still say the game is good.

												Decent graphics, that is all i can say from what i saw.The rest of the time - almost the whole time i spend on the game - was trying to figure out why the game randomly crashed, like being in the middle of a game and bam, CTD or having it in the background or idle while switching thru menues, playing in windowed mode doesn't fix it, using lowest graphics settings didn't, using highest didn't, mixing all settings together didn't aswell. In highest settings it performed pretty well though but i gave up on it after losing ingame progress several times attempting to actually play the game and i rarely give up on technical difficulties, until i could fix them on my own but i couldn't.If i had bought it, i probably had asked for a refund, since the last update was 2 months ago, it's safe to say they are done with it development-wise and not seeing a single dev in the forums for the whole week, knowing they may get a decent income of new players and possible customers, was a big letdown for me, it shows there is no official support for the game whatsoever.I had a bad experience with it, i can't recommend buying the game because it has serious crash issues and may or may not work on your current system configuration and the issues may never get patched out in the future.

												I do not see why people do not like this game.pros-weather: a very interesting addition that can wipe out entire armies and change the tide of battles-zone-based bases: an uncommon approach to rts games. You capture zones and use them to house certain extensions that can bring down troops, repair them, or even make your legendary units more powerful.-command points: use these to call down orbital barrages, spy on the enemy, or even make your units more powerful.-Squad-based ""divisions"": The units are organized into divisions which are grouped together in groups of either 10, 5, 2, or 1. These divisions can level up Halo Wars style and even become legendary, which gives a massive increase to accuracy, dodge, and health.-Colossi: Colossi are massive walkers capable of levelling entire bases or armies. They are the super-weapons of this game, and are certainly cool.-Multiple ways to win: you can win by destroying the enemy's base or their fleet with orbital cannons.-Fleet gameplay: A fun, fleshed out experience in conquest mode.-Secondary factions: Sway these powerful factions into your favor and you may just get some sweet allies.Cons-Multiplayer: The userbase is rather small, and therefore, the multiplayer is usually hard to find matches on.-Crashes: This game sometimes crashes after certain battles, and you may have to replay them.-the different factions are rather ssimilarTL;DRThis game is fun and rather well made. It has some refreshing ideas, but the multiplayer and crashes are definitely disheartening. This game is a very fun game. I highly recommend this.			"

Posted: July 27, 2015
												I gave this a try during the free trial they had a while ago, and after stewing over the experience for a while, I can safely declare that I will not be buying it. I'm starved for a good RTS. Strategy games like that are an old love, and that's why I gave this a try. It has potential, but it just doesn't tick the right boxes for me.First of all, the tutorial is extremely constrictive. It refuses to let you do anything but what they want you to do. This means that anything but basic controls has to be learned in the game proper.Although there is a skirmish mode, it's only part of the game. The conquest mode is a series of skirmishes, where instead of one victory, you'll have a series of several, where wins and losses will determine your abilities for the major part of the game, and where I spent my time.Right now, I can say that it's broken. The controls in Conquest Mode are unituitive, and I've spent at least two minutes trying to control one of my battle fleets. Fleets at the southern end of the galaxy risk being ""out of bounds"", which is my way of saying impossible to select. It didn't cost me the game, but it cost me a few minutes of game time.Victory in the game is determined either by being the first to maintain 12 victory points, or by having the most victory points at the end. How to gain victory points is mostly randomized, but holding territories for extended time is a guarantee. Outside of that, holding specific territories, successfully destroying enemy fleets or palaces, or simply playing the right card will gain you a foothold.And the cards are something that I like the theory of, but have one fatal flaw. They're supposed to provide tactical advantages, like speeding the development of a planet, or letting a fleet move again. All I ended up with were cards that reduced all player relations towards the rogues. Haven't the foggiest idea what that's supposed to be, but they just sat there, preventing me from getting a card that could have won the game.Conquest Mode also determines what technologies you can use. At first, you're very limited in what you can deploy in a skirmish. But, as the turns go by, you can spend technology points on techs, which you then deploy in skirmishes. To keep this in check, you can't deploy them all on the first turn. You need an equal number of technology stations installed in your bases in order to call in or construct something of a specific technology era.And finally, the skirmishes themselves. It's very unforgiving. All you have is Etherium, a currency that you use to buy reinforcements from your own faction (rather rude). Controlling more territories means more Etherium, and more stations to increase either the number of units you can deploy, the tech level you can use, or special commands to your fleet, such as orbital bombardment. Generally, someone who grabs territory early has the upper hand, just deploy turrets wherever they're needed. Although having a tech that the enemy just can't counter is a help (using Bombers when they enemy has no AA units, for example) in the end the fastest land grab will win.Skirmish Mode also lacks a pause button, so you spend a lot of time flicking between your landing bays and the front line. If I want to reinforce a battle with, say, a mortar infantry unit, I have to go to my nearest airport, purchase the infantry, wait several seconds for them to arrive, and then assign them to an airship, wait several more seconds, and then order them to the battle, and finally air drop them into the battle. All this is time that I need to spend keeping an eye on the current battle, because at any moment, the enemy could start construction on a turret, call in an orbital bombardment, or sound a retreat that I want to fire my own bombardment on. Either allow me to queue up orders, or give me a pause button.This is mostly just a massive rant, because there's something about this game that just brings out the worst in me. It isn't an RTS like I'm used to, and although it has potential, it certainly isn't something that I'm interested in paying for.			"

												It's an interesting game but it doesn't so much scratch an itch, as pick a scab.I'm willing to give props to any studio that's willing to make an RTS these days, especially new IP! But there's no hook here. The gameplay is simple, the campaign is novel in a board game sort of way, the factions add a bit of asymmetry while remaining faceless... It's got an arcade quality, like hey, I've got a few quarters in my pocket and nothing better to do. But it's not something I'd come back to, once I ran out of quarters.			"

												First of all, it may not be worth the full 20€ price, but if you manage to pick it up during a sale (I got mine for 5€), it's worth the cost. The strategy itself isn't very deep, but its a fun little timesink if you enjoy this kind of games, but after a long day just don't have the mental fortitude to go through an actual strategy game.All and all, it looks preety, runs smoothly and wastes time in an enjoyable way. You will get at least a few hours of fun out of it and that would make it worth the small entry cost if you get it during a sale. Even better if you find a friend to go along with it. I wouldn't bother buying it for the full price though.			"

												I've played my fair share of RTS games. This RTS will NOT be one of my favorites. The problems with this game are far from few. The game struggles with an easy HUD interface. Next, the games controls overall are poorly mapped as well. The game is far too challenging for entry level players and is NOT balanced what so ever. The texturing isn't half bad and neither are the audio samples and in game sounds. However, this doesn't aquate to a meal of commands that has been vomitted by some coder. Now, I am not a coder myelf. However, I do understand that user interfaces are USER interfaces and should be USER friendly. This game is far from that. With few units and a far too simple resource system, and an overcomplicated section control ""system"", and a standard tri-team pick it yourself, and with... and so on and so on. The problems are just really basic and I personally feel that they could have been avoided. Don't download this game.			"

												I had fun with it, playing through the tutorial. It didn't crash on me either, though there seem to be a lot of stability complaints in the reviews here.I love the mechanics in the game. Reminds me a lot of Ground Control II, which was a favorite RTS of mine. Etherium is missing some things from Ground Control, but it has its own additions, too. I like the way the tech levels unlock the various features, and that tech levels and unit cap are decided by how you build out your colonies. Gives you a lot of strategic options.The limited number of units available in the tutorial were a bit lackluster, but I assume there is more variety in the full game and the various factions.I'd say this is definitely worth picking up for the 50% off $10 price it was selling this week! Even if you never play multiplayer, you'll easily get $10 worth of fun from the conquest mode!			"

												The only major issue i have with the game is that there is no Auto-resolve option in the single player Conquest mode. While this isn't a huge issue it does make the game feel rather long. Each fleet has two actions per turn. This means that in single player Conquest you can end up fighting two battles per alien turn because they seem to enjoy attacking you over the other faction. When you start getting to the point they have two or even three fleets in orbit of one of your worlds and each fleet can attack twice thats a LOT of battles to fight without an auto-resolve and since most battles take 30-40 minutes for me... Its a good game and i enjoy but please for the love of god add in a auto-resolve :)			"

The way you create units that can only be dropped at your base point might not be a problem if you didn't have to be at your base telling it specifically were to drop the units rather than setting a waypoint or points that created units get delivered to which means you can never concentrate on your battles.  By the end of the maps your base is far from the final battles that you just spend time mini map jumping.  The idea of nodes on the bases is a promising one but it never really delivers much.  I know this is not made by a big studio and it is pretty cheap to buy but if all it does is frustrate then I would say save up for Deserts of Kharak, Grey Goo or Ashes of the Singularity all of which are far superior RTS games.

												Its a fun game with lost of unique stuff.But its the same thing over and over agin.It would be better if there where  larger maps and more units of different kinds.I do do not recommend this game and it does not look like this game is at all going to be improved apon			"

												It's pretty obvious that this game has a negative conotation. I don't support the developers abandoning the game but their recent titles are pretty good. If you're one of the lucky ones like me who can get past the constant crashing, you'll find that the gameplay isn't spectacular, and neither are the graphics. The grand strategy is very interesting and very well done, but the constant land conquest will eventually get any player to wish they were playing another game. Ultimately, this game is like No Man's Sky. It could've been so much more but ended up falling short.			"
