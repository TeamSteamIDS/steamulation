Early Access Review
								This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly simple-minded and boring; that is my rating! It is not worth the $30.00 USD that it is being marketed for. Now what may I mean by that you ask; well allow me to explain.Blitzkrieg 3 is nothing like it's predecessors; the infamous Blitzkrieg and Blitzkrieg 2. Both of these games were traditional RTS with different twists in game mechanics and plot lines. Blitzkrieg 3 has no plot line, and is more in line with a crappy Warlords or Clash of Clans (yes....dare I speak that name) in the sense that your only goal is to either bash endless amounts of ""player-owned bases"" or engage in poorly designed ""Historical"" missions. It is not an RTS but is more like a Mobile App game that has been given the skin of Blitzkrieg. There is no Map for you to conquer, only 3 Factions to choose from (typical German, U.S, U.S.S.R), and you are only able to use the same 12 units (6 Inft. and 6 Armor) throughout the game; as well as a few ""Support"" abilities (like Mortars/Smoke). I say all of this because it's system seems more like App graphics than a professionally designed PC ""AA"" or ""AAA"" game. Indeed I'd dare say this systme runs very much like War Commander; the MMO-Base Builder game on Facebook. Thus, in this writers opinion, it is not worth the $30.00; let alone does it belong on PC (should be a IOS game IMHO).But you may ask what about the Gameplay, or the Graphics; for surely those must mean something with all those positive reviews. Allow me to explain from my first-hand experience. The Blitzkrieg series has always been more about large size battles and epic ""on-map"" destruction that leave the player feeling part of some epic war drama film. This, at least for this writer, is what made the past games so alluring. Burning wrecks, destroyed buildings, massive arty bombardments, and craters everywhere; all of these made Blitzkrieg a great game (and predecessor to todays total war-style games). Blitzkrieg 3 shows none of this, and in fact is a step back from it's traditional roots. Both the Graphics system and the Game Mechanics run more akin to Clash of Clans (yes....dare I speak that name again). Wrecks do not remain on the battlefield, gunfire is simple even on Ultra setting, maps are barely decent at best, the defense/offense systems are poorly balanced to the point of forcing a player to use mainly Armored units to succeed. While I could continue commenting on the poor Gameplay/Graphics I leave it to you to imagine your disappoint if you waste that $30.00.In this writers opinion there are only 2 good things to take away from this project. The first is the base defense system; which is decent at best. I did enjoy the fact that my map extended beyond my given base design, and that I could move my defense where ever I pleased on the map. That being this very same system is broken because the defensive weapons tend to out perform even the Lvl 6 Armor/Inft; thus making it hard to swipe anyone's base on your own lvl and up (I can see the Trolls enjoying this). The other good thing was the nice Tutorial, which was very helpful (minus the glitch on the Panzergrenedier Mission). That being said it seem too.....bland......for this writers tastes. Could this game become better, you may ask; worth it's $30.00 price tag. Sadly I'm afraid not, as many of my fellow gamers are slowly discovering. As I stated earlier this game is more akin to Clash of Clans, and not worth $30.00 (more like $10.00 at most). Even if the Devs added a map, fixed the Graphics quality, added more units, made more buildings, or even put a good plot line in place the game still have one problem. It's a Massive Multiplayer Online Base Building game.....something most gamers will only attribute with Mobile Apps and iPhones/Androids. It is nothing like it's predecessor, Blitzkrieg 1 + 2, and it angers this writer to know how far the Devs have taken this game out of it's normal setting. Finally, even if fully upgraded and sold, it is not worth $30.00 freak'in dollars. Anyway I hope this is both a helpful review of the Devs, as much as a friendly warning for my fellow gamers. Waste your money at your own risk, but your better off finding a good FB MMOBB like CoC, War Commander, or Martian Invader that are cheap or FREE (key word FREE here kiddies).			"

								Below is my original review, unchanged from when I published it.  I wanted to write an update.  As of 6/27/2015, the devs are adding real PvP against real players.  While I admit in my review that it isn't my cup of tea, it was also why I felt some may not like this game.  The fact that they listened to those who wanted real PvP is awesome-sauce.  And I wanted to send a big kudos to the devs for continually making this game better.============================================The single player campaigns are similar to Blitzkrieg 2, albeit the RPG element of it is lacking in comparison to Blitzkrieg 2.The multiplayer campaign can be explained very simply.  It is Clash of Clans...world war 2 style.Before you say ""Cool"" or ""No way!"" (depending on how you feel about Clash of Clans).  There are some differences.The main difference is no waiting.  You don't spend ""gems"" or some equivalent resource which can only be obtained with real money.  You build your army, you go to battle and then you battle again and again and again.Your whole army gets wiped out?  No problem, they are immediately available for the next battle.  No waiting for buildings to finish, no waiting for troops to build.  If you can afford to build it, you get it immediately and it is always there.So, in my opinion, it has the allure Clash of Clans has minus the moneygrabbing nonsense clash of clans has.  If I want to play Blitzkrieg 3, I can play for as long as I wish.  I don't have to worry about troops or waiting, it is quite refreshing.The RPG element is similar to clash of clans.  You want that Panzer IV?  Well, you need to upgrade your tank depot...but before that, your HQ needs to upgrade.  In order to do that, you need 3000 fuel or 5000 supplies, etc.  The only way you get it is to raid other players.On the other side, your base is something you need to defend.  There seems to be a variety of maps players can start off with.  (You don't get to choose) and each map has 3 or 4 ways to infiltrate your base.  Your defenses are limited and you need to place them strategically.When you raid others, it is awesome when you hit someone who has the same map as you...then you can say, ""Hey, why didn't I think of that?"" and improve your own defenses.  My hours aren't that deep at the time of this review.  I can't comment too much on single player.  I've been having so much fun with  multiplayer.  It really is odd, because my library of games is single player only.This game stole a bunch of ideas from Clash of Clans.  It is NOT Blitzkrieg 2 reskinned.  I'm concerned about long term playability and freshness of new maps, but it is not an issue at the moment and the devs are updating the game frequently.How does this compare to Company of Heroes?  In my mind, it doesn't compare.  COH1 or COH2 are true RTS style games where you gather resources and build armies, and attack and replenish losses until one player out attritions the other.   In this game, you have a squad of tanks and infantry.  You attack another player and you both have a static number of troops.  The other player has static defenses which are managed by the AI.  (You never actually duel a live human, only the defenses set up by that person before they logged off)For many, this lack of true multiplayer may be a turnoff.  I'm a self professed lover of single player games...it doesn't bother me at all.  This game is more of a puzzle than COH.  You have a limited number of troops and you are trying to outwit the defenses.I can see some folks truly disliking this game.  I hope I explained it well enough so you can determine it for yourself.  I did compare to two very popular games and apologize if you have never played Clash of Clans or Company of Heroes and were unable to garnish anything from this review.  Happy hunting.			"

								Absolute trash.I want to like this game.I REALLY want to like it, but as of now this game is almost a chore to play.Infantry are near useless, Allied tanks out perform Axis armor, building up defenses for your base is fun, but good luck actually defending it.Please avoid until they fix the gleaming difficulty disparity of defending your own base.Please avoid until they fix the marshmellow shooting AT emplacements .Please avoid until they fix the bore of attacking the same map over and over to farm for materials just to make minute changes to your semi permanent base.Please avoid until they fix the overpowered artillery and air support. Please avoid until they fix the game.It spits on the entire franchise.			"

								This could be the first clash of clans ww2 mod for pc-games as of yet.The graphics are marvelous & stunning, the way bullets ricochet of structures and how the tank engines whirl. 4/5Micromanaging basically leaves you a bit wanting.Regarding gameplay, you place about 3 main structures on a map and also a couple of defensive structures, then you get the opportunity to attack another players same setup and your repeat this, you repeat this and you repeat this x4 then you are out of tries for a day and get to wait another day to do it all over again.In between this you get enough loot to upgrade about a tank, a soldier, and if you are doing really good, also a building.There is absolutely no resemblance to the blietzkrieg 1 or 2 in the way of multiplayer battles of epic proportions that we are used to, none whatsoever. You dont have any communication with other players ingame at all, period.I just paid 30€ for the opportunity to raid the same maps, and basically the same base setup about 10 or 15 times a day. Ill give the developers the benefit of a doubt and hopefully they will change the direction this game is heading. When that happens (hopefully) ill be the first to thumb this game green.I cant get rid of that annoying feeling that I feel cheated of a good game somehow......			"

								I don't quite have a good feel about the game just yet,But i can say,Nival shows us how a Early acces tittle should be, The basic game is working there are no obvious bugs.They keep the players informed and post Polls ingame.Whats not to love about this approach?For this alone i'd recommend the game.Edit: 10-10-2015Now the good, the bad and the ugly.Blitz 3 is a ""proper"" RTS, a ""Zerg"" rush will end in disaster,Currently it is a Attack/Defend game, Where you build/Upgrade your base and Tech,Place your defences, toss in a few units in there and wait for some poor sod to attack your base.Or Pick a general, Assemble your army and go look for someone to pick a fight with.Your base can be attacked when you are online and you can lead your defence, but you can also be attacked when you are offline.There currently are a few Generals to pick from, From Air to Tank to infantry focusThese generals have specific unit limitations and offer bonusses to their specific field,There is also a Jack of all trades general in which you have no limitations to what you deploy but  no bonusses.Generals gain experiance for battles fought, but what that leads to is currently not implemented.The good.-Details! lots and lots of details,-Includes all your favorite pieces of WW2 hardware, well most anyway ^_^.-Interesting concept.-WW2- Large variety of units- Enough types of defences (But we can always use more!)- Proper RTSThe bad.It is Early access , with content missing/not in its final form, the game can get boring when you max out your Nation, which can currently be done fairly quick.- Only 1 game mode atm.- Depending on your tier, The enemy can be hard to defeat or be too weak.- Currently i do not really see any ""Faction specific traits"" which is a shame.- Infantry combat is ...""Meh"" it just doesn't feel right as most Defences are supression/Splash damage based there really is no reason to use a core infantry army. - Large variety of units,  but only 1 type per Tier- Some units feel useless currently or just dedicated scouts..well Cannon fodder.- Needs more variaty in units/tech/defences.- Needs more flexibilty.- Economy needs work.The ugly:- Static linear maps There are a few maps and everything is fixed Limiting what the player can do to maximize his/her defence or attack routes. this also causes some Copy n paste designs. and forcing to use specific points due to their natural advantage, altho everyone knowns something will be there.some dynamic destruction in terms of blowing up a bridge,Bridge collapsing when damaged blocking off roads.- Border hugging (Being adressed)- Spotted Defences remain spotted even without LOS.- Artillery strikes/Mortar strikes are ""OP"" due to above reason.What am i missing?A little more depth, some more variaty and its currently lacking 2v2etc or Lets call it Group content,Defend your groups base, Maybe a Faction war map in short more Group PVP Elements.If you Prefer Zerg rush RTS, leave itIf you expect a finished game, Wait for it to be released.If you like to be challanged, think and use tactiics, You'll like this.This is early access anything can happen,Many of us have been burned by Early acces titles myself included,So its really up to you the reader if you like this kind of game, Check out video's before you buy.If you buy it Enjoy it!i can only add that Nival(1998?) is a established game studio. And as you can see by the Dev response below, they do seem to care about their community.Which is very important in my book.Need to see it ? Krebs made a nice video

								Blitzkrieg franchise... one of the finest real time wargames I ever played. So many sleepless nights and short days with the common feeling  - just one more mission...Years have passed, many new wargames were released and I did my best to try them all. Some were good, some not that good ... and the rest just plain awful.And here is where I would place Blitzkrieg 3. Shameful use of the old franchise name to make a game, that has hardly anything in common with its legendary predecesors. If you loved the first (still the best) and the second part (had potential). Then please DON'T spoil yourself your memories on those great games and avoid Blitzkrieg 3 as a plague.I did try to like this game, I really did. But to no avail. The core basic of the new game is flawed and no matter what they update this is still a dumbed down wanna-be wargame aimed at... God knows whom.So in short:- forget about nice missions from the originals. You will get some annoyingly scripted missions without a darn auto save.- forget the use of single soldiers (except snipers), here you get a whole squad as in Company of Heroes series- forget the usage of combined arms as in the original. Here you only need a ton of tanks/tanks destroyers and a sniper/scout vehicle. Infantry you say? Not really needed here where you are on offence and a really limited value on the defence only.- graphic are nothing special for today's standard. Animations are ok. Maybe too spectacular... but hey... kids like BIG BANGS.- Multiplayer is boring. Base building in Blitzkrieg franchise? No thanks...My final score would be like 3 of 10. 3 points because of nice memories of the original games. Get the first game and enjoy some nice battles from the times when Nival still knew how to make a nice game!Rest in peace Blitzkrieg franchise and thank you for nice memories.			"

 Blitzkrieg 3 - Review Story:Blitzkrieg 3 takes place in WWII Europe, where you control three forces through their battles:Germany conquering France, Russia conquering Germany and America fighting for Sicily.Gameplay:In singleplayer, the game is a typical RTS, you command units, that are either added to your forces by you freeing them, fullfilling objectives or just as reinforcements. You have no impact on the types of units that your army is made of, so you basically have to adapt to your army, and not the other way around.The three nations have the same units, maybe with minimal slight variations, but the overall gameplay is the same for all. And this is where strategy comes in:The game is basically beatable with very few, very basic strategies, once you learned an effective way to defend/attack you can always go back to that, sinceall nations play the same. Thus the singleplayer is nothing special. The multiplayer on the other hand features something very unusual for this genre: You are provided with a base, the size of which grows with your level,that you need to build up and defend with units and structures from other players. Upon an enemy attacking, your units are controlled by AI. You gain resourcesover time, that you can use to buy and upgrade units and structures. When attacking, you are matched against a random player of similar level and have to fight their setup. It is an interesting concept, very often seen in mobile games.Pros:+Nice graphics, creating a fitting atmosphere+Troops speak in their native languageNeutral:~The multiplayer gameplay is new for this genre, but often seen on mobile devices~Singleplayer offers nothing specialCons:-The singleplayer is very basic-All nations play the same-There is no straightup 1v1 battleConclusion:I don't think I can give this game just one score, so I went ahead to give it a singleplayer-rating and a multiplayer-rating:Singleplayer: 6.5/10Multiplayer: 8.5/10If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

This is a quite interesting project so far and it's going to be even more promising in the future.Pros:- Two big modes are sure to make it into the release build: Singleplayer Campaign Mode (somewhat close to the BI classical campaigns) and Multiplayer Campaign (imagine a Clash of Clans in WWII setting... without constant donations reminder and the urge to watch the progress of your base each few hours).- Classical isometric view on warm and homey 2,5D graphics. Just like the old times, but with better effects.- Rock, Paper, Scissors gameplay in a whole - vehicles are good at destroying defences, infantry has something for everyone (apart from defences), and defences/obstacles when put in place can cripple any advancing enemy. - Developers are listening to the community, setting the highest priority to bug hunting and making the most wanted features come out first. - Great oldschool music, artwork, map decorations (some - with borderline humour)... You'll like it when you notice it :)Contras:- It's not BI as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong - It's a fun game to play, but it's just not Blitzkrieg I. Not yet.- BIII is kinda poorly balanced on higher, advanced levels. I believe it will be fixed soon, but atm t5+ of the headquarters can be pain (imagine fighting Pershings with your KV-1s). - It's still Early Access. Expect to have some minor pathfinding bugs (I've met no other).Overall result? I'd say it's 7/10 for old Blitzkrieg players, 8/10 for Clash of Clans players and 9/10 for those dissapointed in Company of Heroes 2 fantasy-like setting (such as myself).Update 11.24.2015Game has surely evolved a lot since the last time I've launched it in the September. All sorts of improvements are here and ready to go:1. Pathfinding got fixed in a small unit groups. Yes, tactical combat still requires a lot of micromanaging but hey, it's what the Blitzkrieg series was about since like forefer.2. Developers really DO listen to the Community. All of the suggestions I've made as a regular Community member were answered to. Some made it into the game (like treating fortifications as if those were units in the means of a balance). 3. Generals provide a unique experience with each and every faction. You can customize both your army now and the defences of your base like you see fit. 4. Most balance issues are now gone, whilst 'Sauron's eye' should be fixed IMAO. It is a little bit too much OP.5. Numerous UI improvements here and there finally made the game easy to navigate. 6. Should be first, actually... Now you can switch maps in Multiplayer Campaign. Yes. You can.			"

								Grew up with Blitzkrieg 1 , loved it. Never played Blitzkrieg 2 because of the bad reviews and it wasn't really that much better. But this game is a completely different story.You must know that you are buying an incomplete game which is still being updated, so dont get too upset about some bugs. i find it well playable.Now the great thing about this game is that it is being developed exactly as the community asks. The developers regularly put polls in the main menu of the game and are also very active on these forums. Looking forward, this game is going to get much better. they are working on a new gamemode which allows for more than 1v1 combat (2v2, 3v3), which is where my roots of blitzkrieg are. (large battles, reinforcements and such).Also, If you are comparing this to CoH, Don't. this is different.Because in that game (loved that game also), you are building a base while fighting and build new forces while in the match. in this game you pre-place stuff and use that to fight untill you are annihalated (or time runs out).With the new gamemodes it will get even more different from CoH.I hope to have steered your mind into buying or not buying this game by writing this review :)			"

								So after 6 hours of gameplay and 32$ -_- I'm saying this game is a no. Why? because it's a watered down Company of Heroes 2 meets Clash of the Clans. Now I like Clash of the Clans, and I enjoy Company of Heroes but this game is missing a lot of the core concepts maybe they will add them but at this moment it's a no. This is only for multiplayerPros (+)-easy to learn- Hard to master- Setting up base defenses can be fun- Assaulting can be funCons (-)-Maps are not balanced- little to no differences between countries. Every country is the same- those stupid 3X multipliers- the combat just feels dumbed down a lot. (by this I mean, only two types of cover for infantry, buildings and bushes.)- I loath the battle timer, you have 10 minutes or shut down. This makes you feel extremely rushed, you can't do proper scouting missions and plan any type of assault. Make it a bonus to do it within 10 minutes not forced.(What feels lacking)- Proper cover mechanics- Countries, I signed up for germany so why am I assaulting German Bases?!?! If you're going to do Countries, make us feel united. Give each country strengths and weaknesses, Germans should have better armor, americans should have better infantry and russians should have better support or something that justs make dividing lines and give us a country chat, allow people to form divisions and build together a unified base then if someone wants to assault our unified base it would be 10 players simultainiously assaulting it together. Make this game feel like a world war!- This game has great potential please use it :)- Also I know this is an in development game and all but 32$ atm is too much. Have a nice day and I hope this makes you add it to your watch list!			"

								I was hesitant at first to review Blitzkrieg 3, due to its “mixed” reviews on Steam. But given that it’s still in development, I figured I’d give it a shot, and I’m glad I did.Blitzkrieg 3 is a fantastic strategy game, with features I haven’t seen elsewhere. The key thing to remember is that it’s not Company of Heroes. It isn’t about moving your troops cover-to-cover. It’s about blitzkrieg—lightning war. It’s Patton’s no “holding ground” strategy, and the strategy that allowed the then-evil Germans to steamroll half of Europe.It also doesn’t feel like a WWII game. You can play as Americans and still fight against Americans, and the same goes for the Soviets and Germans. It feels more like a post-apocalyptic war-game with WWII weapons, where you build your defenses and raid the camps of neighboring tribes.Now that we have that out of the way, let’s get to the point: these factors are what makes Blitzkrieg 3 fun. While one side needs to try and plow through the enemy, the other side needs to build a base to defend against the attack, and this means finding all kinds of creative ways to ambush them.The game starts with you at your base. You get a set number of fuel and supplies to spend on upgrading building and units, or on your defenses. The base building is a game in itself, because your base is technically a full map that other players can attack at any moment.Think of it like Home Alone, only with tanks and guns.Read my full review here: http://techzwn.com/2015/07/blitzkrieg-3-is-like-home-alone-with-tanks-and-its-awesome/ "

								If you enjoy incredibly simplistic RTS games that only require you to point and click without thinking this is for you, if you enjoy crappy Facebook games this is for you, if you enjoy clash of clans or boom beach this is definitely for you. I haven't played enough of the original BK games to judge them but this is one of the most bland, boring and simplistic RTS games I've ever played apart from the stupid mobile ones. If you've played COH,COH2, Men of War or ANY RTS game post 90s/early 2000s this game is gonna make you want to physically torture yourself because atleast that wouldn't make you as bored as this game does. Tank combat is pretty much just really vague flanking or tanking from the front with no form of special abilities you can use to gain an upper hand or change ammunition types, its just point and click. Infantry combat is even worse, I can't even firgure out if there's a proper cover system in the game but right now its just about having better/more guys or placing them in buildings. The base progression thing is kind of cool...if you've never played a mobile game/facebook game in your life. I honestly don't know what else to say about that. Now the least important but worth mentioning anyway are the graphics, animations and sound. First off the graphics are not awful but they're not amazing either, especially when you zoom in. Animatons are pretty awful, they feel really cartoony sometimes especially with tanks as they look like they're toys or something out of a cartoon and lastly are the sounds, music isn't memorable which I don't care too much and all ambient, gun/explosion sounds etc are bland and boring. I would complain about the fact that all you can do is attack other peoples bases but we got PVP gamemodes so maybe that might improve things. I honestly suggest you buy a game like Men of War AS2, COH or COH2. Hell maybe even go back in time and grab the game Stalingrad, based off the old BK engine yet the game seems to have more depth and complexity than this one. Maybe a year from now Ill check the game out again and maybe it'll be better, who knows.			"

								Here's a basic idea of what Blitzkrieg 3 is:You have your base. you can't buld production buildings but you can and will build defence buildings. From that you then build your army and attack bases like any IOS/FB strategy game. But unlikse those who are all F2P and nickle and dime you, B3 gives you everything at the start all the buildings, you just need to upgrade them to get higher units or defences.I'd recomend the standard edition of this game. Most of the stuff that's in the dlux isn't in the game get from what i hear.Here's my list of Pro's and Cons.Pro's:They take a IOS/FaceBook strategy system and make it fair. No timers or pay to speed ups.It's quite tactical in both offence and defence.Quite fun.It's getting patches/update.Base defence.Cons:Match Making will screw you over ; eg. going up against a base with units a level 1 or 2+ higher than you. You won't win but might get a cap zone before you lose all your units or time ends.The Match Maker. More or less same as the first point. Saps fun real quick but doesn't break the game.Pathfinding is non exstant.The FaceBook/IOS strategy style. Quite off puting till you see a bit of the gameplay.Really my big beef is the MatchMaking but that's getting fixed this week.Over all i'd give the have a 5/10 right now with the♥♥♥♥♥of a MM. But when the MM gives you a base fitting of your army it's a 8/10.			"

Just a modern version with refreshed graphics, easy to use interface with standard rts controls that most are used to and some new inovations that definetly make this game compete with other rts games on the market today!

								The game is doing everything right in terms of different strategies deciding for victory or defeat, while cutting the ressource management and basebuilding in favor of more pace in the game. It's also refreshing that the factions are balanced by having different strengths or weaknesses than a pure mirrored factions approach.It also runs remarkably well for an early access version, with patches and insights coming weekly, often incorporating player feedback. Now let's just wait for the single-player missions and a better tutorial and I may just double my game time.Who am I kidding, I'm hooked anyways. Multiplayer and theorycrafting about the defense mode is just too addicting for any armchair general.			"

								After playing the game and going thru all the teirs and up grades that are available,it is a great game. Not one who plays a lot of online games, But a fan of the blitzkrieg series it is some what of a challanging game. like most all games there is a point where it could get repetitious but where this game is different it allows you to challange your self if you take the time and effort to do so,even at this point i have learned new things to challange my self as well as others in pvp. The pvp is the best part of the game in my view,and the game has not even released yet.			"

								Blitzkrieg feels like it is now a franchise which has lost its soul, the essence of what made it fun and unique. The first Blitzkrieg was and still is unique in how it handles strategy, it gave you huge amounts of detail and background information to every unit and plenty of information prior to each battle so that players could make informed and calculated choices when executing their strategies. the gameplay itself was almost Total War-esque in its execution, you start each real time battle with a limited pool of units and make use of their individual talents to overcome the enemy to secure victory, Infantry for Urban battles, neutralizing garrisons, scouting, and cannon fodder. Tanks were used to overwhelm infantry in open spaces, combat enemy armor, and execute rapid, aggressive advances. Artillery was the hard counter to everything in the game (except air units) but is practically useless without effective positioning, thorough recon, and a little luck and patience. Tanks and artillery both carried veterancy through missions so if you could keep your units alive for long enough you would start the game with a sizable advantage over your enemies units but if they died you had to start from scratch with a new unit. Air units were often the deciding factor in each battle but were almost useless if you hadn't neutralized the enemies anti-air and air force prior to their deployment.As you have read, each unit felt like it had a purpose and had to be used intelligently to attain the most beneficial outcome and make progress. Blitzkrieg 3 feels like it is trying to be something it is not, and by doing that is losing what made it so special in the first place. Blitzkrieg 3's revolves around the same stale selection of maps, a hard counter combat triangle making it so units lose their versatility, practicality, and individuality and also game mechanics and campaign missions that fall flat due to their shallowness, lack of meaningful engagement, and cookie-cutter nature, you feel more like you are grinding through a chore than actively participating in grand strategy. How would I improve Blitzkrieg 3? I would advise Nivals games designers to go back and play the original game so they can recapture it's essence and improve on its mechanics with more modern game design ideas, then play the mods for the game such as Achtung Panzer! so they could see how to improve mission structure and presentation to the player, then finally openly and actively engage their community since in this new games development environment having closed communication channels for your audience to engage you will only prevent you from seeing how passionate fans want to help make this game great and live up to the legacy of the existing franchise.I cannot recommend the game in its current state as it is not a Blitzkrieg game, it is currently a bland, generic, cookie cutter, attack / defence style strategy game which genuinely feels like it was built for a microtransaction style economy and still feels and plays that way.TL;DR This game mechanically needs to be Blitzkrieg 3 and not Clash of Clans. I love you Blitzkrieg but you need to go home, you are drunk.			"

								So Blitzkrieg 3 is in my opinion a WW2 light RTS game. The multiplayer is a carbon copy of Quest for epic loot with a WW2 theme. You dont actually fight online opponents. You build upp a base with defences and raid other players bases to get more resources and upgrade your base.During these raids the opponents base is controlled by an AI same goes for your base when invaded. If you are into that its ok. But dont expect VS multiplayer couse there is none yet.My biggest gripe at the moment is lack off control of your units, by that i mean you cant tell your tanks which way to face and you cant give your infantry units orders like throw granades, run, or take cover.. Your units do this bythemselves hence why i call it a light RTS game.The graphics are Ok. The sound's are mediocer at best, machine guns sound more like pee shooters instead of machineguns. It has destructible environments but nothing compared to CoH2. Unit movement and behaviour is not very realistic. Tanks move and turn way to quick instead of feeling like lumbering metal beasts.If you want a more standard WW"" RTS i would reccomend CoH2 instead. Better audio, visual, and better control of youre units as well as a better singelplayer.If you are more intrested in deep historic WW2 RTS game with maximum realism i would instead reccommend the Men of War series.They have time to improve it since its early access but for now its a shallow RTS light game and i would pass..

Early Access Review
								As an early access game, Blitzkrieg 3 has a lot going for it.  However, early access also implies that you'll be receiving an incomplete or flawed experience from that of a retail (launch) game.  All of that said, I will try my best to provide an unbiased and objective review, detailing the qualities and deficits that Blitzkrieg 3 currently has.Pros:[+] Excellent graphics.  Beautiful, highly detailed maps--there are animals, roaming vehicles (trains, cars, etc.), and people who are doing daily tasks.  Trees fall down as tanks run into them, fortifications explode and crumble, and shots richochet off of vehicles creating an impressive realism.[+] Base building.  Organizing your upgrades is always fun.  There are tradeoffs to consider as you are leveling up, because you can't possibly level everything up at once.  Do you want improved infantry?  How so?  Do you work on individual upgrades to existing units, do you upgrade research options or upgrade the barracks itself?   The tradeoffs aslo exist in how you upgrade your defenses.  Do you want a widespread defensive network, or do you want a few key structures that are hihgly upgraded?  The options are impressive.[+] Strategy.  Despite what others are saying, there are lots of strategic options that open up conisderably the more you unlock and play.     -Command points can be spent on a variety of support options.     -Artillery to weaken defenses     -Smoke screen to hide advances     -Spies to scout the bases     -Reinforcements[+] Army composition.  The options are pretty limitless here.  There are four classifications of vehicles and five classifications of infantry, and determining how many of each can be a very important decision going into battle.Cons:[!] Pathfinding.  This is something that will presumably get better over time, but right now tank pathfinding is horrendous, at times.  This becomes even more apparent the larger the vehicle is.  And taking into account that as you upgrade your vehicles, you replace them with a larger chasis (stug to jadgpanther for instance), this makes it even more problematic.[!] No expanded multiplayer options.  Currently, there's only 1 v 1 asychronous battles.  I love the asynchronous battles, by the way, but I'd love to see 2 v 2 and greater options implemented.[!] Building off the above, there are no integrated community options.  No friends list, no chat system, no way to invite others to look at your base and basically zero player-to-player communication.  [This is a huge negative][!] A lack of unit explanations.  I would love to see a detailed tactical tutorial or in-game guide.  Right now I have no idea how to use an MG squad versus an assault squad versus a normal rifleman squad.  All three seem relatively ""samey,"" and I don't have a clue what their operational differences are (if any) besides different stat adjustments.			"

Early Access Review
								I heartily recommend holding off on this purchase at the time of writing.I see potential in this game. While the people comparing this to offline defence mobile games are not wrong, I believe this kind of gameplay can be an engaging experience. Others will talk about high-level balance, but I have only been able to sink a short time into this game due to the following concerns:1) Unclear instruction. The tutorial currently gives brief highlights of where the first couple of buttons to press are, but after that, nothing. It is a trial-and-error system to figure out what you must do. I was confused. Still am, although after two hours I think I have most of the interface figured out.2) Bugs. Yes, the game is early access. But you knew that, it's an early access review. Regardless of the release state of the game, I am here to say that the current state of bugginess impacts the playabilty of the game. Objectives dissapear from your screen and there appears to be no way to get them back. Unit pathfinding struggles immensely. You cannot target units behind buildings (you will target the building itself). There appears to be no way to adjust a unit's heading when controlling it in battle, causing micromanagement dances when trying to get a tank to stop reversing into the enemy.3) The game seems to spazz out pretty horribly if you have a less-than-stellar internet connection. I have a less-than-stellar connection, but I am able to play other online games without major issue. This game freezes near-constantly, and for seconds at a time while playing. Worse, it does this WHEN TESTING AGAINST YOUR OWN BASE. Meaning, even what should be a local single-player experience appears to communicate through the game's servers.4) Attack/Defence balance does seem to be massively off, though others with more time in the game will have better opinions on this. Simply put, the defender and attacker appear to get the same number of units. As any RTS player will tell you, this is an automatic win for any semi-competent attacker. Concentrate on one point in the enemy's defences, and it's pretty much right-click to win. The attacker can even continue to call up reinforcements to replace any lost units.Until such time as all of these issues are resolved, I must strongly advise against purchasing this game.			"

								One of the best rts I have for years.Good:-They manage to rebuild the art style of the first game,visual,sound and atmosphere.In 3d and much more details.          -The clash of clan mode is fun and tactical,well balanced.Maps are much bigger and with multi route,it is more of a slow pace strategy game than the castle rush type.(You got 10 to 15 minutes,but you will punish hard if you rush into any defence line.So no rush,take your time.)Make it both fun to attack or defence,and grow your army.          -No simple A better than B counting,try rush any of your tanks into enemy's infantry and you will be nail.Bad: -Unit's path finding is a mess.        -They are still working on the pvp mode.        -No countries advantage(Allies tanks are smaller,I wounder if that count),which is easier to balance,but I wish they could bring up a division system.        -This is a DRM game,you may alway be online,but the DRM server wont.The game is still in development,so alot more could improve.But overall this is a fun beta game to play,or you could wait to see if the full game worth the 30 dollars price tag.I personally cant wait.

Early Access Review
								Game can be fun when it`s completly ballanced out. I really like the idea behind it. But at the moment it`s still dissapointing.Line of sight is completely ruining the game in my opinion, you can use one infantry unit to scout the enemy positions and then♥♥♥♥♥♥a defence with way too many howitzer barrages. I spend hours on creating a good defence with measuring out killzones and positioning my fortifications only to find out my opponent can take one infantry unit and use it`s line of sight to call in way to many barrages and wipe out all my hard work without being able to counter it with anything at all. After bombing down all your defences they just roll in 8 heavy tanks or tank destroyers and destroy what is left of your fortifications ( with of course using the line of sight from an infantry unit and the massive atack range of the tanks ).Since the opponent bombed out all your units allready you don`t have any line of sight yourself anymore, and your opponent just takes out what`s left of your units using the fog of war. Any tank you roll in to defend gets spotted and destroyed before you can even see your enemy. Exept for spotting infantry is completely useless. If you garrison them in a building they will just get bombed to hell or taken out from a distance by a tank destroyer, if you leave them in the open, well... nvm.Not going to be only negative about the game. I like the idea of building a defence and getting the time to make it as you like it to be. Other than a game like COH where you don`t get any time to organize defences and get overrun before you can even place one building, this game let`s you choose when you are ready to be attacked, so no stress and when you are ready you just accept a battle. At this time i think 30 euros is a bit too much for the game because the part i would spend the 30 euros on ( building and spend time in sorting out a good defence ) is not working for me. As an attacker i`ve won like 40 out of 60 battles in total, defending 3 out of 30 with 60 hours of reviewing and modifying my defences.			"

								Blitzkrieg games feel empty without a proper single player campaign, but so far so good for an early access game.The only problem I see(aside from a very few content) is the connection issue; even single player campaigns are in risk of connection time-out/cuts (devs, please do fix this).Anyway, if you're new to Blitzkrieg games and should this be your first, I recommend to have a little more patience until this game is fully released before buying this or try the previous games; well, either you're a Blitz veteran or not, BK3 will feel different as it has much more arcady approach. Unless you're interested to WW-2 themed asymmetrical multiplay, then grab the game.Pros:+gameplay is interesting and fast+asymmetrical gameplay is addicting +graphics are aesthetic and looking fresh (the battleground feels quite alive)+it still has the combination of realism and arcade just like BK1 and 2 (realistic vehicle armor value plus HP bars)+each countries are uniqueCons:-connection issues-off map artillery (except rocket arty)tbh, I'm a bit disappointed, but then again it's early access - too early to judge since the game has a lot of potential and the devs are quite approachable (compared to other RTS games *cough* *cough* CoH2)			"

								Early missions are ok but getting really annoyed at hitting a brick wall with heavy armour getting chewed up by infantry, AT rifles and MG tanks - a char B-1 in the open desert front on to a single infantry squad with no cover should not get obliterated. No repair units means the longer missions are basically impossible without a step by step walkthrough to pick up all the timed cannon fodder reinforcements (e.g. first N Africa one - why can't my assault squads kill off heavy tanks from buildings and their infantry can slay entire divisions with impunity from open ground??).Really cannot be bothered to fight my way through mission on mission where you are always faced with being lower ranged line of sight terms than the defenders so losing units before you can see the attacker, having to do a mission as kamikaze 3 times to figure out where the overpowered defence is sucks - panzer IV-E vs dug in rifle squad is a no brainer but if I get to range they grenade me to death so I can't back off and use the gun.Really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off I paid for the deluxe edition as it's going off the drive permanently, load of crap.

Early Access Review
								Early Access Constructive Criticism :D No Donkey sh1it!1.	To my pleasant surprise, the narrative in the tutorial mission alternated between Russian, German and American forces. I love the way the developers choose to give different perspectives during the same session. It’s an interesting way of displaying what kind of impact, your actions have on your foe, as the perspective changes. As you get the chance to play thru the eyes of your rival, you immediately see the aftereffect of your consequences. It’s a new take on storytelling, it’s very entertaining and refreshing. 2.	Cool moments: During a tutorial mission, you are given a few German infantry to clear out a poor Russian village. And here I was, in the middle of nowhere… hoping to spread democracy. Oh, well! We musn't disappoint our fuhrer, maybe we will find some MANA vodka.I split my infantry into two squads. I started off by sending squad one to occupy an empty house on the outskirts of the village. This immediately started a firelight, my first squad was taking incoming fire from a house further up the street. I tactically maneuvered my second squad thru a forest into an assaulting position on the flank. Using the new ability “assault building”, my second squad dashed forward out of the bushes into the house, screaming, pulling ears and vomiting on a chicken, ending up with five Russian KIA inside, oh and we found really fluffy teddy bear in the basement, to celebrate our victory, my heroic soldiers baptized it PUTIN. 3.	Sniper Unit - Sounds inaccurate in game. Last time I checked, yelling wasn’t part of the sniper weapons inventory. I swear to God, every time you give the sniper an order the dude goes ape sh1it, and starts screaming patriotic slogans.  The entire idea of having a dedicated unit going stealth, is silence. At least put some effort into making him act covert and whisper in response. Small changes to sound, can make a big difference to the atmosphere and characteristics of a unit. 4.	There seems to be no function at the moment to see your troops behind objects. And with such a rich and beautifully detailed environment, sometimes it’s hard to pinpoint your units in the field, you constantly need to reselect the units to find them.  Sorry, but I don’t want to spend my time searching for my troops on the battlefield. Especially when there is a mission timer involved.  Some sort of highlight is needed to distinguish your troops from the background, Men of war dose this brilliantly. Take note.5.	Ability “About face” - Being a Company of Heroes player for many years. I found myself selecting a vehicle and trying to drag the front armoured part towards the enemy. I’m abruptly, startled and confused when I realise that no such function is available in Blitzkrige 3. It’s 2015, happy new year! Ability’s like “About face” should be at my fingertips, and not hidden away in the far-flung-bottom right hand corner of the UI menu.Yes, yes, I know! There is a Hot Key, you can press “R”. But that’s so… 2005, I’m not stating that simplification is bad. But coming from a CoH frame of mind, my RTS behaviour is tuned to having fast and responsive controls. In the current state, I don’t feel that responsiveness is coming thru in Blitzkrige 3.I know there is a red compass-marker you can utilise to set your vehicles direction, but that option is way too sluggish and clumsy to use. Having an instant clock, with an arch of fire, popup underneath your vehicle is faster and better way to do it.Why not include a more fine-tuned approach of controlling your vehicles for those that want that possibility. Instead of this barebones, point and click. There is definitely room for improvements to be made regarding this issue.6.	At the current state Blitzkrige 3 does not offer any cover system for infantry. This is something that we should expect by today’s standards. There is a missed opportunity here in NOT letting the player use destructive environments as part of cover. A lot of effort has gone into creating a detailed destructive environment for Blitzkrige 3. And the developers have succeeded. I just wish the developers made the collateral damage more than just eye candy.  Let me illustrate an example.  - Battle for Monte Casino, On 15 February 1944 the abbey was almost completely destroyed in a series of heavy American-led air raids. The bombing was conducted because many reports from troops on the ground suggested that Germans were occupying the monastery, and it was considered a key observational post by all those who were fighting in the field. Only after the bombing were the ruins of the monastery occupied by German Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers), aiding them in their defence, because the ruins provided excellent defensive cover. The point I’m making, is that the destructive environment in Blitzkrige 3 could have been utilized to benefit both sides. This could have created some unique variation of strategies in battles. What you get instead is repetitive gameplay, with limited paths of approach.   7.	Which brings me to my next point, I find it odd that the developers of Blitzkrige 3 strongly incentivise the concept of artificial intelligence for defensive purposes, in base mode. Calling it “core component of the multiplayer experience.”Yet, the game is lacking any meaningful Ai behaviour, the way Ai responds to human players is with basic triggers, which activate on conditions. Example: A is true, there for activate B and repeat, basically. Someone once said, “The best defence is an offense!” So far, I haven’t found any way to change Ai behaviour perimeters when defending your base to aggressive stance or turtle defensive, hit and run or balanced tactics.It’s not fair to say that the Ai is inadequate. It dose its job, but it doesn’t like to deviate from a set path. Doing anything complicated like taking the initiative or making a surprise manoeuvre is out of the question. It’s all scripted and predictable behaviour, don’t expect to encounter General Rommel in the field, anytime soon.8.	One more thing, the tip popup in the tutorial disappears to fast, it’s stressful and should be fix. This problem is especially hard on new players, who are trying to learn the game.  Your popups don’t have “next tip” or a “back to previous tip” buttons. WHY! WWwwwwhhhyy!!! WHHHHHYYY!!!!... . .. .why!9.	OMG! I have no idea what the designers or concept artist were smoking when they created this Modern-bluish-sci-fi-metallic-transformers looking UI menu, I’m pretty sure it wasn’t water vapour. For the LOVE of GOD, the current UI doesn’t fit the WW2 themed framework at all, change it.Other than that, it’s a good early access start.Dont forget to thumbs up if you like my preview and would like to see more. Dont be a stranger leave a comment. Cheers 4 reading. With less love BatSithCrazy!			"

								Even though i've only had this game for a short time, i enjoy the hell out of it. One of the main reasons is that its a new concept. It's similer to ( but absolutely nothing) a nation builder were you upgrade your defenses, buildings, troops, etc.The tutorial needs quite a bit of work but is thankfully skippable. Once you're past that, the game is terrific. the RTS aspect with that special twist really makes it unqiue and oddly enjoyable. I myself am horrible at RTS games, but i really do enjoy this game! There is a lot more to this game that makes it such a unique experience, but dont hesitate to buy this game becaused of the mixed review. "

								Vorab, es kann sich noch viel ändern den es ist Early Accsess. Wer ein Spiel erwartet a la Blitzkrieg 2 wird möglicherweise enttäuscht sein den so wie es sich jetzt präsentiert liegt der Schwerpunkt eher auf den Multiplayerpart.Das Grundgerüst dazu ist gut aber die Umsetzung gefällt mir nicht. Es geht darum die Basis des Gegners zu erobern und dafür hat man 10 Minuten Zeit was dazu führt das es in hektisches geklicke ausartet. Für ein Spiel auf dem Handy wäre es ok, aber für den PC reicht es einfach nicht.Ehrlich gesagt habe ich mir mehr erwartet.			"

								Great oldschool realtime strategy game.  WW2 subject matter has been beautifully addressed with a serious tone throughout and a focus on squad tactics.  A overworld map is shown during mission selection and loading screens that could possibly mean there will be branching missions and even more exciting, strategic decisions and maybe turn-based modes implemented?  One could only hope. Supposedly multiplayer modes in as well though mostly a SP and AI skirmish player here.Will comment or change / update review if impressions change.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game on discount because I spent many many hours on B2 and loved the saga overall. I wanted to try this new version which promissed and delivers great graphicsI cannot really say this is a successor to B2 like B2 was to B1. I miss the amazing music, the unit descriptions showing armour/penetration/damage, the healthbars are OK but it's not my personal taste. B3 is a good game and it is fun, but I wouldn't have bought it without that Blitzkrieg name that conveys experience from the past and it must be understood I am reviewing this both in EA and in a B2 mindset.My focal points for improvement would be to reduce the size of the incredibly obtrusive interface (I don't like when an interface eats 40% of the lower screen) and please allow the camera to rotate like in B2 (or in my short gameplay time I didn't find how to do this). The unit descriptor especially for tanks, with armour thicknesses and gun damage/penetration is also a must for my personal appeal. Finally, offmap support is a little bit accurate for my liking as well.I'm sure the game will improve especially so since I am sure many people, like me, are buying it thinking of the B2 follow-up, and hence there will resources and time during and after EA to do so. I'll be standing by to change this review where appropiate.			"

Early Access Review
								Awesome game! Some new word in gameplay, currently available only pvp. it's kind of a tower offence style with managing own base defence but without controlling the defence in combat. I didn't like world of tanks, because I'm an RTS/RPG player and finally I see something great. Looks for me like a merge of old Z ideas in gameplay and C&C generals style and appearance. There is also one pve mission available, was surprised to win it after 6 tries! Just 2 stars out of 3 though. Reading up developers blog - they promise a complete pve campaign with most famous historical combats, also coming up controlled defence mode. Hard to explain with words. Game is cool, there are still a lot of work to do, but for an early access - a complete pvp mode is really more than I could expect. Also for me as a freak of RTS game, long pvp tutorial (4 first pvp games runs in ez mode) seemed bored and I almost left the game at first. But then, it gets harder when you meet other people defences and can't pass through. Some defences are really challenging.Also a good thing I heard in discussions - it might become free to play pvp with only chargable pve. So will be possible to play with friends who didn't buy it. But I bet pve will be great.  "

								I've played it only a few minutes then I just had a Rage Quit. why? because even with a STABLE 150k Internet connection I suffer from permanent server problems. The game probably could be fun and I cannot agree with people downvoting because it is not blitzkrieg 1 or Blitzkrieg 2. but the downvotes because of server fails which even affect singleplayer are more than justified.it is just not yet done. another good game which got screwed because they had to release it WAY too early.Greed just killed another good game.

Early Access Review
								I believe that this is the first time I've ever clicked the ""No"" on the wether you recommend tab when typing a review. This game had me hyped for so long, Blitzkrieg 1 was the first videogame I had ever played, I loved Blitzkrieg 2 and the hype for Blitzkrieg 3 had been growing especially after buying Blitzkrieg 2 again 2 weeks ago and finishing it again.Blitzkrieg 3 will be amazing for 'newcomers' to the series as it will seem like a fresh, new and exciting game (which it can be at times), but the game is more linear now. There are less ways to tackle your missions, a terrible reinforcent system (at least compared to the last two) and the game isn't very optimised. I could be in battle, explosions going off, gunfire flowing down range and I'll get 60fps, then I'd be sitting at the back with just one sniper taking out another enemy in a tower and I'll just randomly drop to 15fps. The game isn't consistant with frames and just overall this game seems rushed to cash off it's long time fans.I will continue to play this game, but I suggest waiting for a sale like I did just in case the way it turned out the way it did. If there was a 'Neutral' recommendation I would use that but I think the bad does outweigh the good. Good game none-the-less, but it has a lot to prove and needs a lot of improvement before it's a great game.			"

								I really like this game! I vaguely remember playing the original Blitzekrieg on my parents' Compaq, but I was seven at the time and quite frankly don't see why we're talking about that in a reviews for a game made 12 years later. It's kind of like Clash of Clans in that you place and upgrade your base in one portion of the game and do battle in another. Different from Clash of Clans, however, is that you get direct control over your soldiers, the maps are much bigger and defensive placement relies much more on catching actual humans off-guard. I like the feeling of persistent progression and that the grind to the next dope unlock is never too mountainous. It's easy to jump in for five minutes and end up staying for a few hours. Personal preference is important, but I recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								This is my favorite type of strategy game, i'm giving it a thumbs up because i had fun playing it even tho it was too difficult in some places. I'm talking about the single player campaign. The average Joe, new to the series, will not be able to play this, especially with out difficulty settings. I was able to play the first few missions, got stopped at the 1st Russian mission, part B. In part A of March on Davgavpils i failed on the 2nd objective (hold the 3 mortars) over and over again due to unlimited Russian reinforcements. I started ignoring the scenario instructions and found it was easy to complete. On part B all my units disappeared and i only had a few light tanks and inf. I gave it my best try, scouted with inf and called in arty but it wasn't enough. After 4 tries with different strategies i gave up.I know it's your game and you can change things to fit your needs but i find it very irritating when things aren't accurate. A few examples: Stug III A is not a tank destroyer. If i'm not mistaken models A-E were labled self-propelled or assualt guns. They had low velocity 7.5cm guns to destroy bunkers and inf. Wasn't till the end of 42' or maybe 43' that some were upgraded to long barreled high velocity guns. Maybe thats why it takes a Stug III A. 11 rounds to kill a mortar, you only gave them armor piercing rounds and no HE. Another example: PTRD-41 Russian anti-tank rifle. Even with the best ammo it could never penetrate the 50mm of front armor on my Stug but it only took 4 shot to kill it. It took my other Stug 8 shots to kill the AT rifle. Other things i didn't like:Sdkfz 222 labeled as a great scout but has the visability of a motorcycle helmet with the visor down.AA guns shoot down aircraft with out being seen even tho aircraft should have the best unit visability in the game.Wish there was supply and repair. Tank crews were trained in basic repair, inf squads had medics. Maybe add those to the game in a difficulty setting.Why can't i capture mortars, anti-tank guns and move them?Would like to see a bigger impact of XP on units.I don't like your hot keys, why can't i rebind them?I didn't get far enough to find out if the supply limit is increased, i would like to play with more units.I didn't get far enough to find out about all the units in the game, do you get your own arty, mortars, anti-tank guns? These seem like basic units why aren't they in the game at the start.Why can't i force fire my units at a location?Can i have a few seconds to look around before the battle starts.I bought this game for the single player campaigns, i hope they are extensive and detailed with lots of choices. Please don't skimp on them in favor of PvP. "

Investment in a better server so there are fewer disconnects. Improved stats. Nerf USSR. Count games against friends in chat toward stats...after all they are tougher than playing AI and would increase fun factor and real player games. Map rotation would be great.

Early Access Review
								Review update on ver 0.9.3.1After many month of not playing the game i see the game have developed quite significantly due to hardwork and passion of the developer making the game. I really appreciated it because not many EA game do this (props to guys at nival ;)). Now I will breakdown my review on 4 major point as :1. Campaign I REALLY LOVE the effort on the campaign because the map look beautiful, the voice lines narrating the game match the nationalities, and the level of difficulty on each scenario.2. UIThe UI feels less wonky and clutter from the previous one which is nice addition to the game. Also i love the new potrait style commander. But i dislike when you boot the game you jump directly into the worldmap mode where campaign and multiplayer option placed in one big map. Maybe split the page between campaign and multiplayer would be nice3. Realism I miss realism part of blitzkrieg where supply play major part of the battle. Good progress on armor rework, i like that !4. MPMP game are split between base assault and traditional 1v1 2v2 or 3v3 format. As for base assault it got huge improvement as the ai call unit to recapture the flag and so on. But this type of gameplay is not fun to watch and play (in my taste). Maybe some people like it but i personally dislike it. Now the traditional format. Skirmish in my opinion are too barebone. The reason i say this because in 1v1 (the game i played) the objective to capture 3 victory point. The problem is when you already cap this point, you can simply ambush his spawn point until he out of reinforcement. This make the game boring because you cannot comeback nor do some tactical move because as soon as you spawn, your men will die as fast as you cook oatsmeal. On the other point the map you make is really good. My input to this is increase spawn point further from enemy spawn point or give cue where your unit will spawn with some protection or base defense.My point is the MP matches is too fast to end and don't give the excitement when played. But i liked the loadout system now before going to combat because it make your army comp varies (as before i disliked it). So TLDR i dont get what concept rts style are on skirmish as is fast as CoC battles but have concept like defense in-depth, trenches, mg, smoke,etc. Now the bonus part, Technical part. The game run average on my rig, consider this is are EA the subject may change. Also skirmish servers are lag which is annoying in my opinion (curios about server location, because i played COH2 quite fine). I like your bug department which is fast in fixing bug (+1). =================================================================So TLDR Blitzkrieg 3 is a beautiful game with OUTSTANDING campaign scenario and voice over but WEAK MP due to lack of strategic and decision thinking made in the game . If you buy only for the campaign and Base attack style game (CoC formula with some addition) then open your wallet and buy this game as soon as your money available. But if you like me where you seek pleasure in MP game where moving troops, tactical decision matters(when to cap vp, push, etc) and become a salty person as soon as you lose, avoid this game and reconsider to buy it when it mild sale or heavy sale because the MP in the current state is too barebone and boring. Hope it helps you guys :)			"

								I played the original game (B1) for a while , I never actually finished but I remember having fun with it , the game was good , detailed enough (even for 2009 lol) , lots of units , of abilities.I remember having a lot of fun being able to use a lot of units on huge maps , and being able to have endless possibilities.Being able to move PAKs and Artillery gun was also a fun thing I always liked to do for a reason , I always loved AT guns and Artillery guns (Especially the Flak 88).I think was this game lacks is this. I do like the game , and it really has potential in it. Devs often communicate and listen to our requests. Now in it's current state , it shouldn't be considered as a ""Blitzkrieg"" game. I'm not a die-hard fan of the series as many can tell , but I think they need to put aside the name to fully see the game.Though the game does indeed need to be changed , I believe it's better if we waited and gave our opinion on each update and saying specifically what should be tweaked or changed.No need to be mad at the devs , they are already doing a lot of work to create the game to their liking and ours. Which is a really hard work by the way.It's still an alpha and therefor time is needed to fully finish the game. We haven't seen many units , but I do think the devs are working on it.I would say it's better to wait for the updates and help the devs with bug fixing and balance.If we help them , they help us.I still recommend the game as I think we need a big community to help. Maybe grab it on a sale.			"

								Nival has shown a master class on how to completely ruin a legendary game. Take everything you've known about (in-) famous Blitzkrieg series and throw it out the window because this is a completely differen beast.First off the most important part of any BK game - MP - is clash of clans style junk (0.9 release doesn't help it much). It's nothing like it used to be - massive BK battles is a thing of past. Seriously, whoever at Nival came up with this idea of asynchronous multiplayer - go design mobile games, this crap has no place in PC gaming.As for SP, it is featuring poorly deigned missions that lead to difficulty surpasing that of BK:Fall of the reich (I hated it, but in the same time have massive respect as it was designed with hardcore fans in mind and everyone knew that).Only positive things I honestly see are the idea of building up your army with recently introduced reward system and somewhat decent visuals. Core gamelay mechanics (with classic BK in mind) are pretty much broken in every aspect.It really hurts me to press that ""No"" button under ""Do you recommend this game?"" because I really wanted this game to succeed and bring back the series. However a series of poor design decisions on Nival's part are really making me doubt Nival's capability of turning this mess around and making another great BK game.I believe guys at Nival should launch BK 1 and 2 (surely they must have a copy, lol), study on what made those games great and build on top of that, not, completely out of blue introduce some weird mobile game style elements and ruin core gameplay. If weird mobile game style is what You want to do - don't call it Blitzkrieg. Have some respect for a legendary game - even if you own the franchise.			"

Unfortunately, this game plays like a mobile app from a developer who never saw the originals.Do not waste your time or money here. This is a strange action RTS with no depth of strategy or tactics.

								I like the game overall, however it has its downsides. For example the main thing I dislike is that its not historically accurate. The pz 38t has like 20 something mm of armor in game but in real life it has 50mm. Also the tiger p has 101mm of fromt armor in game but had 200 mm of front armor in real life. The second thing I dont like is that at the start of the game I keep getting roflstomped by people who charge me with 10 m3 stuarts (at least thats what model I think they are) and my only defense towards tanks is one Anti Tank Rifle group 2 pz 38t's and 2 groups of Anti Tank solders that need to stay in a building to even have a chance. However the attacking is very nice and strategic and I think needs very little tweaking. Overall at the moment I'd say its a 68/100.			"

Early Access Review
								OK, So lets do my first ever game review ~ The review is a general review, I do allot of expounding after admittly so as to this new reviewing partnership we are forming for to review games.The game is great & its coming along well.  I will be posting a video game play, with review on you tube before the end of the month geared towards the first time Blitzkrieg'er or anyone considering entering the genera for the first time ~ I encourage you! Its allot of fun..  The company responsible for its resurrection and new found internet game play fundamentals is doing a hell of a job with that ~ without sacrificing Sudden Strike / Blitzkrieg doctrine and tradition.  Its still in Alpha and I would encourage people to buy the game now and become part of the Alpha testing community.  Finally the great thing about this game and its creators so far is the fact that **THEY ARE LISTENING** TO US* and the game is getting better as a result.  The vehicle modeling is outstanding, the sub animation routines and effects are terrific. The sound sampling is top notch and very pleasing to the ears. Blitzkrieg is just pretty to look at ~ it gets even better when you start blowing everything up! This is not a full review so Im not going to go into allot of detail about game play.  You start of small and grow your army ~ this is done by growing the structures in your base through research.  As you grow your base  so does your army.  At one point there seemed to be no limit as to what I could research, upgrade and or improve. You can select & grow Generals to lead your armies. I have 3 categories to my rating system, very simple 1 through 5 Stars ~  This rating is based on overall game mechanics ~ 3d graphics quality, graphics scaling & modeling, rendering speed and smoothness, mouse & keyboard interaction(Sharpness, Response time) and finally sound quality. In addition though and maybe more importantly ""genre fit""--->  Does the game play as advertised.  That said all this is considered as well ~ Game play as it relates to the game Title, stated  and as it is advertised in the trailer.  Basically did the game live up to its Pre-purchase advertising ~ Trailers, forum hype, and page Ad's etc.. If your wondering why this is so important to me ~ its simple so many times we go to purchase a game based on what we see in the trailers or read in the game information briefly provided on the sale page.  Sadly often times the game doesn't have anything to do with the trailer in the way of mechanics, game play or even story line.  Sometimes isnt even advertised in the correct genre. Example Action vs Strategy vs simulation vs RPG vs RTS etc.  Often games are advertised in genre's that once played it becomes obvious you were misled or it was framed in the wrong genre.  When that happens you dont figure it out until you have spent your hard earned money and as many of you have probably felt, I know I have ~ cheated into procuring a title that does not meet the standards of the genre it was being marketed in or as. Second is a simple 0 though 10 fun factor & game polished rating ~ & yes 0 is an earn-able score.  Third is just the good old thumbs up, a single thumb means its good you should investigate the game yourself and buy it. Im taking it one step further than Steam though ~ if the title is really good and it makes it into a favorites slot in my Steam Library I'll give it 2 thumbs up!!  That basically means look no further buy the dam thing and get busy playing! Since this game has not yet been released I will be grading it again after its official release. I've played more than 450 hours and these are my conclusions so far.  As of right now it gets 4 and half stars (****1/2)STARS well earned stars. It well earns a Hard 8 out of 10 (8 of 10) on my Fun Factor & game polished Scale, and since it is a work in progress that can be expected to go up or down with its finally release.  Because it is that, and with the upgraded 2vs2 3vs3 4vs4 multiplayer games  just around the corner with the official release ~ it can only get better.  Hope fully they are suppose to be incorporate some sort of a grand campaign internet map, that players will be teaming up and fighting battles for control of ~ non stop 24/7.. Probably of Europe, and hopefully Russia ~ we will see those are just some long term expectations and idea.  **BOTH THUMBS UP**~Rommel.99 (In game Alias)The ~ Following are sub notes to my qualifications to review games and what I am putting together ~ additionally a search request for partners in this new endeavor.  The idea of reviewing these games are to make them better and keep people from wasting there times on games that are a sell out or as we see in so many cases an out right lie as advertised versus game play.PS ~ If your wondering well who the eff are you to  suddenly be reviewing games. Thats a fair question and I will have a full resume on my new web sight listing all my qualifications. MOST  IMPORTANTLY THOUGH ~ I AM A STUDENT OF GAMING, I have been gaming since 1977.  Played the first Wolfinstien on the Apple 2c, heres a hint it. It wasn't a first person shooter then, if you've been around for a while you'll know that and remember such titles as Karateka (

 ), Bruce Lee by Data Soft, Conan the Barbarian ~ first game you could chop peoples heads off in!  Was awesome..  I love games of all kinds, I was one of the best Half life players in the world in 1999, Ive played every measure of first person shooter ~ the latest titles I have enjoyed are Titan Fall and BF-4..  I like vehicles. Ive played though Skyrum, Dieblo, Star Craft, Battle front, EVERYTHING STAR WARS and so many more (75 titles in my Steam Library alone). Additionally my true love is with strategy games the past 7 years.  Ive got at leat 15 hundred hours in the Hearts of Iron series, All of the TOTAL WARS.. I particularly love Napoleon, ROME 1&2, Mid-Evil 1&2 and Shogun 1&2.  Looking forward to there new Total War : WAR HAMMER 40,000. Ok so all that being said I am looking for partners in crime to join me in a REAL GAME REVIEW that plays the games it reviews intensely.  For now the emphasis will be on Strategy games, war games..  As I feel that first person is so over done right now and there are a million talking heads when it comes to the ""first person shooter"" Genre.  I want to investigate search for and review the ""THINKING MANS"" game's.  So email me if your interested ~ send me a friend request to if you like.  I have a huge infrastructure already in play for this task. Servers, 2 state of the art PC's, an awesome web sight that will smoke PC-GAMERS page under construction and of course Team Speak Channels etc. There are 3 of us committed to this endeavor and an awesome name for all this has been selected, I am pulling trade mark rights on it before I post it though.. Its that good.  I need 5 solid  Students of Gaming to come on board.  I will be working to long term to engage large game companies and enter into contracts long term with these companies for the sole purpose of game play review to assist them in producing better products.   This means a strong possibility of being paid for doing what we love to do. I cannot promise any of that, however I can say for the 5 that do come on board I will be personally bringing your PC up to current Game PC Awesomeness standards.  So there it is the sugar in the cake should be interested and selected to be apart of our new game review (name pending ~ trust me its awesome).			"

								Got 10 minutes to attack the enemy base.Deployed my assault force (2 Hetzers, 3 Pz II.Luchs, 1 Sd.Kfz 222 and some infantry)Got instantly rekt by the spawn camping enemy base defenses.Only the Sd.kfz 222 left.Sneak around the entire map avoiding mines and detection, notice that all the enemy forces was at the spawn and manage to capture the enemy base without meeting any resistance.Returned to base with the loots.Stealthy RTS / 10The gameplay is quite alright, if you're into old school RTS like the previous Blitzkrieg game.Graphic is amazing, the map and effects are just gorgeous.So far with 10+ hours into it (non-steam) I'm a bit sceptical about the asynchronous multiplayer, Its like Clash of clans but in WW2.Campaign is almost as the same as Blitzkrieg 2 but with some enchantment and major graphic improvement.You can't compare this game with the others WW2 RTS game such as Men of War or Company of heroes, because this thing here is something else.Highly recommended for Blitzkrieg fans, but for those who are still in doubt go watch some gameplay videos and visit the game website for more informations and do a little research on it, because you shouldn't take my word for it. I'm not not Jesus or something dammit			"

								>Starts game as America>Cruises through training missions>hears stories of the feared Russian tanks>meets his first russian on the firing end of his bunker>Russians get slaughtered>Thinks everyone is overreacting>Meets a higher ranked Russian player>I now spend my days shivering in the corner remembering when i was still innocent-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Real review:The game special. Coming back online after a nights sleep is always great to see if your defences had held off the nightmares. Even if you didnt hold them back it lets you prepare better and make the most impenetrable wall of firepower in the history of mankind. Offense is soild i find it more difficult espically if the defender has a well built up defense. I have not tried skirmish/missions so i can not judge those.The downside I see often enough is that the pathfinding leaves room for improvement.Balance issues are present but not huge.Last off machinegunners can wipe out entire infantry blocks if you move them into a bad spot by mistake. they get pinned and will all slowly be masacered so beware your surroundings.

								Many of the reviews I have seen have most of the same complaints that I have for the most part. Yes it is very pretty, everything looks fantastic, especially the buildings with the idle soldiers just about, but that is probably one of its strongest features is how pretty it is. Currently it feels lacking in content, and while it can be said that this is an early access game, so are other titles with more content and that do not feel like a ww2 version of clash of clans. Now I have not tried out the historical battles yet, because the first one is just a wave defense and currently, I have zero desire to play a wave defense. There is no other way to see if there are any other battles because it just takes you straight into it. No single player besides that really. From what I have seen so far it doesnt look like there are any custom commanders to level up either. Nor any interactive campaign map on the multiplay side, just build a base and attack people, which just feels so uninspired that I honenestly thought that I would have to wait hours for my buildings to upgrade unless I bought a premium currency. There really is not much of a cover system, so if you were thinking of company of heroes where you can hide behind a wall and throw grenades over it not really going to happen. While it does feel like it plays like blitzkrieg 2, it plays like blitzkrige 2. The controls are very similar without much improvement, as many other criticized the fact that you cannot face tanks, and you cant. I actually had a panzer one driving backwards until it spotted an enemy then decided to turn around. Blitztkrieg one and two are fantastic games, but just little tweaks here and there to fix old controls and such would be fantastic. The graphics are all nice and good so they got that part down. Another thing is a lack of an ability to actually call in reinforcements which I guess is because of their strange multiplayer not a campagin campaign thing that they have going.  Multiplayer is not an instant make a game better solution, and when done improperly makes things worse. Seeing as I have had many reservations about early access, the reason why I bought this was actually for the blitzkrieg one and two anthologies that I got with it and decided to give this a try anyways. Overal, this game needs a lot more work. It is dreadfully lacking in content and the fact that It is missing so much customization and single player aspects is very worrysome. There is no way I could recommend this game. Even just as a first impression I cannot recommend it, because you could buy far better things worth your time and money. That being said, I really want this game to succeed. I really do, the market is so lacking in rts, that people are recommend turnbased games because there is not anything else out there that is decent beside company of heores, total war, and starcraft. Plus I love blitzkrieg, and the opportunity to see a new one would be amazing. Right now however, this is just a sad shell of something much better.			"

								Bought this for £29.99 and to me it's a waste of money. Defending your base is impossible in MP. You get hit by a hidden Enemy by Artillery Fire before they attack. Also the lack of any in game documentation is frustrating. COH is far better. I would suggest that this is released in a better state then it currently is.			"

								I played this game a while back. I played it a little and enjoyed it a little until I finally came to my senses and said to myself... ""You idiot! You spent thirty dollars on a Facebook game!"" This game is literally a facebook game with a price tag and a BIG one at that for an Early Access game. I suggest this to the devs. Make the game like Blitzkrieg 1 and 2. And make the game balanced because I am sure having first tier soldiers fighting machine gun bunkers, mines, IS-2s and T-34s when your heaviest tank is a hetzer isn't exactly fair. AND FOR CHRIST SAKES. LOWER. THE. PRICE. Its early access for Petes sake. This game has NOTHING to offer more then ""Build base, build units, attack."" Rinse and repeat. Make this game free or have us pay five dollars. I think that is fair. But for now, STAY THE HELL AWAY			"

								This is the worst thought out RTS i have ever come to play.  Asynchronous Multiplayer has removed all of the human interface. Furthermore the units can not dig in, resupply, fix or dig trenches which was the beauty of Blitzkrieg 1.  This has further drawn away from the realistic side to a more easy mass of force and plough through defences.  Little was meant for the inutitive information gathering, use of airpower wisely or having artillery units.  They removed all of this into a lengthy base building project which would be equal to the neverending story.  If anyone is thinking of buying this I would stay away and look at something with more substance like Men of War: Assault Squad 2 or wait for Hearts of Iron 4			"

								Avoid this for now. This game is so bad right now after nearly a decade of writing perhaps 1 Steam review, I've found this so bad that it warrants a negative review.Major issues:♥♥♥♥♥♥ pathfindingBattles that take way too long and and are way too short (I will elaborate later)♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficulty curveSo the pathfinding. You have to manually, individually command units. If you do a big move order units get stuck, they get jammed and the best part is, if two units get stuck on each other they do damage! Brilliant game design choice there. It makes the most basic of features tiresome - moving your armies about. Units get vaporised in seconds if you're not careful. The ""artillery"" (Including planes, hence the quotation marks) is incredibly overuses by the AI and will wipe your entire army if you do not react in time. Currently I have no AA vehicles and I have no idea if they are even in the game. You have defensive AA but that's only for base defense. So it's a tiring slog through a basic mission, meaning the whole thing becomes an over-extended bore. You have to carefully, slowly poke forward and with the pathfinding being so bad even that can fail miserably to stop you getting hideously punished. So battles can and do end VERY quickly, often unfairly so. Now why do they take too long? If you manage to somehow best the above, you have to take down the HQ and their radar (it calls for ENDLESS reinforcements from the AI - seemingly) meaning the longer you take the MORE enemy units there are. What a catastrophically♥♥♥♥♥♥design flaw - punish people for moving too fast, punish people for moving too slow. So battles are both too slow and too fast. There's no happy medium and the game becomes a chore. Seriously, you can even check the ingame bars - it shows your unit score in blue. I start with nearly 600. They slowly die off, so does the enemies. Then BAM the enemy counter goes from 60 back to 600. Yet I have nothing now to counter?♥♥♥♥♥♥game design 101. So you think to rush the radar? Bad idea. The enemy reinforcements spawn in the HQ, it's cluttered so bad pathing becomes even more painful and the way LoS works means they will be able to snipe you from the Fog of War with impunity. Another exercise in frustration. So yeah.♥♥♥♥♥♥pathfinding,♥♥♥♥♥♥game design choices and a terribly balanced AI opponent have turned me so off this game it upsets me greatly. Avoid.			"

								I don't understand all negative reviews, because game did not come out yet. This is just an alpha and majority of things are disabled. This release happened now, because commercially it is perfect hit for May 9 - Victory Day against Fascism.Currently, the game is pretty raw and there are not many things, but you can see even now that game has many cool features. I bought it now, because you have  a chance to receive some special things if you buy it before May 12. Game will be in the development at least 4 months more. So, if you want to level up much easier now than it will be later, like me, then buy it now. But there are not many things to do right now except leveling up and see some basic mechanics.Otherwise, you should buy it after official release and don't scream about problems now. It is stupid, because this is ALPHA!!! DayZ sucked at first too, but now it is pretty good. Blitzkrieg 3 is fine even now and will be great after official release.			"

								OK now for an actual review, The game itself feels like a blitzkrieg game, I could instantly tell that it was indeed blitzkrieg. The graphics are Very pretty and not too demanding. The gameplay is relatively smooth, could be a bit polished. The vehicle variety and sounds are GREAT, It's like the took the tech trees out of WOT and put them in this game. One thing that I feel needs to be implemented is a proper cover system, like COH2, it would make infantry much more useful (for me at least). Something that they should but don't NEED to take out is the off map artillery and make artillery an on map unit like in the other Blitzkriegs, another thing, please oh please don't focus so heavily on the ""Clash of Clans"" style of multiplayer, leave it on there as a play style but I miss the massive battles that you could play in Blitzkrieg 1. They should add a proper campaign again like the older Blitzkriegs where you got to choose what you had in the mission and you would unlock more units as you completed more missions. Last but not least add like a skirmish mode similar to COH,COH2 and Wargame, it's just a quick way to play a battle and have some fun. I change my recommendation because they said that they will fix the pay again problem and plus this game is in Alpha so there is much work to be done.			"

								A perfectly alright game, if you are into that kind of thing. And by ""that kind of thing"" I mean historical RTS, or even WWII RTS.

								First of all - I bought this game on 50pct sale, so i have not spend as much as some of you.But and I must say I disapprove the bad reviews.The MP is fun, the building of your base is interesting =)About the balance - it seems to me that it is very ""tier-dependant"".For example, people below me are complaing about attack aircrafts.  You (and the enemy due to the MM) get the air-support a tier sooner than you get the AA guns on light vehicles, so for a few games before you move to the next tier, the attack airplanes are OP. But the only thing that needs to be done is to push your tanks forwards or pull back out of the target area. Thats it, simple. And just a tier above, you get mobile AA guns. It is the way the game punishes tactics of a one single ""invincible"" blob of heavy tanks slowly pushing forward.I am currently at the level 6 and overall balance seems to be quite good. I find the siege of some AI-controlled bases quite challenging and if there is a person defending, its even better. Skirmises are OK. I havent played SP-campaign yet, but i am going to when i reach the top tier in MP =)I have played B1 and 2 in their days and B3 doesnt seem any worse to me, its just more MP-focused. Yes, I like to win. But if everything is too easy, there is no point in playing. I find current difficulty as something around normal / hard of B1, depending on the MM.			"

								Enemy KI has unlimited units yours are limited. Chaotic missions where you have to be everywhere at the same time on the map. I have the impression the developers didnt play their own missions so they would realize what crap they are building.Units look nice, map detail looks good but playing itself is just stupid and annoying.Im refering to the ""Luftalarm"" (Air Alert or Airstrike?) mission I can Play with the Russians and to the ""Sabotage in Nordafrika"" mission that can be played with the germans. The ""problem"" is the Ammont of troops I have compared to the ammount of troops the enemy has. If the enemy had all his troops together in one spot they would wipe me out in 5-10 seconds.Now fortunately, they are not all in one spot so they can be killed group by group. The Problem again is, that the player cannot replentisch his troops and repair his vechikles after killing an enemy group. In Blitzkrieg 2 there were truks with pioniers who could repair the vechicels. What happened to them? Do you want to tell me that the Tanks where easier to build thaen the trucks??In the first Blitzkrieg 3 Missoin with the Germans they had first aid kits. Now nothing. Every faction WW2 had paramedics and doctors in their armies even the russians. Furthermore there should be certain points at the map where one can replentish the lost soldiers of an infantry unit before going on.Nevertheless most of the missions are still doable step by step,, even they are quite unsatisfying, (because no repair and no replentishment) as long as they are linear. Because the player can focus his fewer units in one spot to wipe out the enemy there before moving on. In this to missions Luftalarm and Sabotage in Nordafrika you get targets all over the map at the same time. That means you have to split your units and then there is no focusing anymore. Its just the 30 enemy units on the map against the 6 units of the player wich are already damaged from the battles they faced before while all enemys are fresh. And then you step into some minefields. Would be no problem if i had the amount of units the enemy has if 2 or 3 step into mines. But if i have only 6 units well 2or 3 is half of my army and if they are already damaged theat mine will blow them to hell. There is no way of winning that by using ones brain. The only way there might be is to save and reload 100 times per mission. But that is not a strategy game for me its an ANNOYING game. And annoying isn't ment only as andjective but also as a new genre. I love playing strategy but i hate playing gmes from the annoying kind.I strongly recommend that developers to play that missions 4-5 times and make it playable before releasing it, else you will face  tonns of negative reviews.

So far so fun for a early acces game. It sure is not Blitzkrieg at all anymore but it still makes for a decent and addicting game. Conquering the bases that other players created, each and everyone different from one another proved to be just as exciting as the constantly new possibilities in moba games. Lets see how long this game can hold me. For now, it gets a recommend, the price of 30€ isn't much and the content is there even if unfinished and a tad broken.I hope the publishers take care of the future development of this game, so I don't have to change my review into a negative one. Therefore for anyone reading this, this review should be taken with the fact in mind that this game is in alpha status and that I, as of writing this, really enjoyed the 8hours I've spent so far with this game but might change my mind in the next few months unless I see progress.My biggest issues with this game are the lack of actual RTS elements. While range indicators are involved the basic combat system breaks down to rock, paper, siscors. The strategic part of the game lacks depth and needs drastic improvement. The movement too, Infantry should have different movement speeds based on gear and vehicles especially, should be fixed.The motions feel too clunky and units don't behave realistically.I also want more control over my units. I want to tell my Infantry when to charge, get down or use items. The armies aren't that big that a little more mircomanagement would hurt.Further the graphics are 'okay' but the sound needs improvement. Not just the ambience but the weapon and gear sounds as well. For anyone whining about it not Blitzkrieg, youre right, get over it, its still a decent start and the brand 'blitzkrieg' doesn't belong to you. Thats life, thats gaming, accept it - Singleplayer is still similar to the old games so enjoy that. Otherwise I recommend you Men of War or the first CoH, but stay away from CoH2.I'll say it one last time, if you're not okay with playing unfinished games, don't buy this - yet. However if you have no problem with that and you enjoy ARCADE RTS you're good to buy this already. "

Early Access Review
								-The only game I would call worse than DayZ- (and that means sadly something)Patches suck quite horrible. Game is nothing like the original Blitzkrieg. Balance is horrible, and performance got worse after patch. The game's campaign is unrealistic and buggy. This is less realistic than Company of Heroes. Would refund if I still could.If you want Clash of Clans in a WW2 setting this is your game.Update: Since I have written this review two bigger updates came. Well, at least in size on the HDD.After trying them out I have to give up on this game. Get Blitzkrieg 1, it's much better. Update (August 29 2016): The game had a patch a few days ago, which added ""temporary ingame store"" and REMOVED THE MAIN MENU. I really don't even know how much worse this can even become anymore, developers, please, what are you doing???????1/10I also recommend to read the developers response on other reviews. There you can make your own image of how ""friendly"" they are.			"

								I am very frustrated with Blitzkrieg 3 game right now.  I had high hopes for this game to be like Men of War or Company of Heroes games which are very simliar and I love playing both of those games very much.   I can't get into the Single Player Campaign right now and the game keeps going to Early Access Selection even though I chose to go into my Steam Account on Nival website.  I don't want to go into the Early Access Account.  When you go into the Main Menu for the game, the only two selections on the Main Menu for the game is Multiplayer Campaign and Historical Battles.  You can't go into anything else.  On Historical Battles you can't even pick which battles to go into.  It just goes right into the same battle over and over again.  Plus the zoom features and rotation features need to be addressed and fixed.   Right now they are pretty much not working properly.  Please Nival fix the game to play the way you advertised it.   Thank you.			"

								Way too soon to buy, wait till all bugs are ironed out. This game seemed interesting but then it completely changed and I am totally lost, its as though the developers cant make up their mind of what kind of game they are making. AI is bad and this games difficulty ain't even in the fun range, its more like playing a game that requires you to do a chore when you realize you could be doing that in real life instead.			"

								(Sigh) What do I say about this game.... well.... its pretty freaking good! That's what.OK so it's like this...You build up your base and then attack other players bases with the army you've built up over the time. Now it isn't a ""Wait 4 days for a t-44 to be built game. You build, its done instantly, go kill some stuff. Its that simple, and its done pretty well.Pros: -Free, its entirely free after the purchase to play... meaning no monthly pay to play♥♥♥♥♥♥..-It rewards scouting and tactical play, send in a light tank to see what the enemy has and then arty the crap out of it-it has an ""In Depth"" leveling system for units where the more they fight the more awesome they get-Great sound design and weapon sounds-Explosions (Check) Vodka (Check) Russian Bears with DSHK's (Maybe ill hold off on that)-A lot moreCons:-Tedious, attacking and then attacking, may get repetitive for some-grinding.... maybe.... sometimes... yeah there's grinding-that's pretty much it alongside a few minor bugsOverall the game is great... is it worth the steep 30$ price tag? Yes, in my opinion yes it is... its worth every penny. Now remember its not every ones cup of tea, no way is it that. I just think it was a great buy for myself personally.Score: 9/10 (Would rofl stomp players base with Assault Squads and rockets again)			"

								Well being a huge fan of rts I was excited to see the best world war II strategy game first hand. And it of course fell short of that statement. I still find men of war to rule the ww2 strategy title and this game isn't knocking it any time soon. The game has several elements I enjoy and around the same amount I hate. Starting on a positive note the game functions and works and the gameplay is pretty fast paced. at ten minute around quick wits and lighting strategy is required, so prepare your blitzkrieg tactics. there is an extensive upgrade tree it's almost redic how much you have to do to upgrade your base. Resources are so abundant and yet it can take awhile to accumulate  them, at first it world make sense to fight battles because they are pretty easy. I was stomping the crud out so many people. but later on is where the game picks up and you will find yourself struggling to complete the same task you found easy at first. That being said it's boasted a-sync multiplayer is fancy for clash of clans style. Which is a little sad, hopefully a full fledged pvp head to head battle mode will surface, but for now get ready for ai battles. I have to admit the appeal of the game comes in spurts, this is more of a time waster then a game you want to spend hours playing. and after around 50 battles it gets dry and you pick up on most of the tactics defenders will use. The problem is you will face battles you can't win due to the leveling system. Trying to rush to the next tier leaves you vulnerable to players who just have better stuff and I found that not upgrading my units was leading to my units not being able to fight what should have been a sure match from prior battles.  It's weird when you run into the same tank you killed a million times but this time it barely takes dmg and wrecks you. The rts mode is pretty good even if it is ai you get control where your defenses are, what they are ect. You can deploy defensive structures(barbed wire, mines, hedgehogs, bunkers, ect.) and then a battle group (infantry, tanks) buildings can be garrisoned and you can test your defenses to see what other players might do to you. you can also watch replays which is important if you don't want bleed resources like a stuck pig.  I enjoy the game and recommend it for those players looking to kill time and want to experience what it would be like if a mobile phone game sexed up sudden strike and produced a decent game.   However this is no company of heroes or even old blitzkrieg (which comes with it) so all is forgiven.			"

								Many simply forgot that this is still a product of 'early access'.Blitzkrieg 1 and 2 are known for its massive battle and campaign with its rather strict unit availability for reinforcement purposes (most of the time forcing you to take hours after hours just to keep that special Tiger I alive). Battles are usually you vs. a hell load of defenses and tanks--often encountering pesky aircrafts. Now, sticking with single player only in this day and age is not possible now, would it? So nival decided to added an asynchronous multiplayer aspect of it. Blitzkrieg 1 and 2 has always been single player--Blitz3 is no different. You, your attack force, vs. loads of defenses and it's all up to you on how you would crack that defenses and stamp your boot-heel on your conquest. Except those defenses are now set by others. What could go wrong?			"

Early Access Review
								I've only played a few missions thus far but my first impressions are generally positive. I've always enjoyed the Blitzkrieg games and was excited when I saw this one.  Gameplay is generally similar to the previous ones, but it has better graphics. It most assuredly needs a 'save' option, as it's annoying to have to quit mid-mission and then have to start the whole mission over again. I also miss the variable stance option for infantry where they automatically go prone when under fire. I'm not fond of the new system where auxilliaries (air and fire support) are on a separate tab rather than displayed on the same screen as one's troops, but I can learn to live with it if it doesn't change.  So far there's no means of selecting which reinforcements you recieve-don't know if that's because it's no longer there or I just haven't progressed far enough for it to be an option, but if it is gone, I'd like it back.  Overall, I'd say if you liked the previous games you'll probably like this one.Now back to conquering/liberating Europe . . .Okay, so a few more things that need to be added from BK2. Infantry need to be able to entrench as do vehicles, or at least enter pre-prepared trenches. One of the weaknesses of BK1 and BK2 was the vulnerability of infantry which was partially corrected by the ability to dig in when under fire. Right now they're completely exposed and die like flies. Likewise, it looks like the ability to summon reinforcements is not yet present and it needs to be. I have fought the Arras mission six or seven times now and I always end up trying (and failing) to take the bridge with one damaged tank and 3 badly wounded infantry because I lost the others trying to take on five or six Char B1, one of the most heavily armoured tanks at the beginning of the war with a hull mounted 75mm gun.  In its present state, I would consider the Arras mission virtually unwinnable unless you have LOTS of luck on your side.  Also captured weapons-mortars, anti-tank weapons, et hoc genus omne used to be movable either by infantry or by vehicle and they should be again. I would also like to see a separate and distinct German and a distinct Allies campaign.			"

								The good, the bad, and the ugly....Good:Even though its early access (and therefore limited missions), great looking game. I like it, and can see huge potential.  A nice WW2 RTS, that builds on B1 and B2. Will cater to both vets of the original series and new players to the series.  Some innovative ideas, like having a base that can be live 24/7. I like having both single player campaigns and PVP. Very good tech support. Bad:A few  bugs (eg, can't save game), units doing funny things sometimes, server problems, lack of tutorials, initial single missions too hard (so will turn off new players). No encyclopedia or help functions. As B3 is still in development phase, changes to game interphase, AI, etc annoying - but to be expected with early access.Ugly:Too expensive for what you get at the moment (Oct 2016).  USD $15 - $20 would be about the right price for what you get because its sort of a third of what the full game will be, and still buggy.Official website for B3 very poor in terms of game information and details.In summary - the full release should be very good, but the early access version is a bit too expensive for now. A great WW2 RTS strategy game, big potential if Nival get it right.I recommend it (the game) - simply because I can see the potential once its fully functional, and early access (despite the price) gives a great feel for what the full release will be like in 2017.

								Have to change from a Positive to a Negative review for now.This game is in Alpha, as of April 2016, definitely not Beta. The bugs are numerous, and game stopping. A Beta is about ironing out lesser bugs, and making balance changes etc. In its current state, the bugs are big, and they can ruin the game play. Right now I cannot continue playing one faction because of a giant bug. I switched to another faction, and after an hour, again, a game stopping bug - my units don't even appear on the field, but the unit roster says they are there. There are many to list, and so you should know:If you buy now, there is a game, but you will not always be able to play it. And when it does work, you may still have large problems.			"

								So far only played the Multiplayer game. It does not feel like the old Blitzkrieg games. It feels more like a clash of clans ipad game for the PC. Hopefully in the future there will be larger ""Multiplayer"" levels rather than base on base fights(Leave this for mobile devices)There is still something addictive about it but it is very, very repetitive. Same levels, same troops and hardly any strategy. Example. Move infantry forward, come across troops emplacement, artillery/bombers, then move again and again and again. Who know what happens when you max out the base?			"

								Скучно, однообразно и неинтересноIt's boring, monotonously and uninteresting无聊 , 单调 , 无趣 .2016.04.28 обновление :Прошло более года с момента выхода игры в ранний доступ и более 5 лет с момента начала разработки , на сегодня мы имеем : - онлайн игры упал с 400 чел до 100 . т.е в 4 раза , - каждый патч делает игровой процесс все более не играбильным .- покупатель до сих пор не имеет возможности тестировать игру и влиять на изменения в игре, вместо этого игру тестирует группа приблежденых любимчиков .- на форуме в среднем 5 сообщений за день и куча забаненых критиков .- следует отметить крайний патч - так называемый реализм в бою. Хочется спросить разработчиков : возможен ли реализм с безгранчны боекомплектом и одним видом боеприпаса ?- совмещенный режим ПвП и ПвЕ напомнает шахматы и шашки на одной доске, что выглядит как полный бред при невозможности их сбалансировать - ввидение командиров в игру полный бред . Скопировать с оригинала- Компании героев и то мозгов не хватило . Напомню что там нет генералов , а есть военные доктрины.- особенно эпичны видео дневники от разработчиков - не потомучто они интересны, а потомучто выходят с периодичностью раз в 8 месяцев-  хотелось бы также отметить просто бездарную работу пресс секреторя Бочарова С он же автор шедевра "" Бабушкин телефон в 1080 р "" .- о конкурсе "" На Берлин "" : Конкурс  уже как минимум несколько раз должен был быть проведен . Но суть не в этом , а в том что разродившись наконец на провидение конкурса и призы были озвучены такие условия, которые убирают более 90 % пользователей от участия в нем , а именно : кто умеет работать с редактором по созданию миссий или у кого есть на это время ? Почему только граждани России ?   Они бы еще озвучили как условие - реальное  взятие Берлина :)))-Более 3 раз поменялась команда разработчиков проекта -Недавно проект покинул продюсер Олег Буренко , тот самый который был на арте - капитан с пистолетом . На вопрос разработчикам: ""кто же все-таки занимается разработкой проекта на данный момент и просьбу представить рабочий коллектив игровому сообществу"" был получен ответ: ""что якобы кол-во персонала это комерческая тайна"" , прошу обратить внимание что вопроса о кол-ве не ставилось и то что в других компаниях никакой тайны о людях которые делают игру нет  , никакой тайны из этого другие успешные компании не делают и даже наоборот стараются как можно быстрее представить участников разработки игровому сообществу - следущий момент: делюкс издание - которое дает обладателю разрушаемую статую реальных вождей , что совершенно является просто хамским отношением к истории, культуре и традициям народов .- Даже выбор названия Блицкриг не этично по отношению к гражданам нашей страны и стран СНГ , так как это прямое название гитлеровской военной доктрины примененной против нас , полагаю не нужно напоминать сколько людей было убито в результате . В данном случае более логично было бы дать игровому проекту нейтральное название например типа противостояние - продолжение серии игр блицкриг .В общем это ряд показателей по которым уже можно судить и делать выводы об успешности или не успешности проекта . Что касается компании производителя , на мой взгляд, они уже давно проект похронили и все к чему они сейчас стремятся это как можно быстрее выкатить игру в официальный релиз , побыстрее потому что после 2 недель релиза никто не сможет вернуть деньги . В общем и целом большая часть тех кто купил игру и так не будут возвращать деньги , но возникает вопрос купят ли эти люди уже готовое дополнение к этой игре Вьетнам ?  Судя по чательному анализу проекта и тех кто над ним работает и организует рабочий процесс - все они ужасные тактики и еще худшие стратеги , что и послужило главной причиной краха ,столь ожидаемого изначально, проекта .

								I bought this game during the Alpha phase to back the developers and enjoyed it quite a bit. A few days ago the game was released on Steam so they gave the option to transfer the game to your Steam account. I did this and then I got the ""userglobusload"" failure. Not only when starting the game through Steam but also via the normal exe file as I started it before. Something got screwed during transfer and I guess it's something with account names. One of their developers said it was something they could easily fix and all I had to do was contact the support department. After contacting Blitzkrieg support they almost immediately responded to check my Steam account. It was the wrong one so I provided them the correct one, almost immediately also. After that... Nothing anymore.  UPDATE: They fixed it! Yesterday I even got contacted on steam and added by a developer to figure out what was wrong and for help. This day's patch fixed it so I'm back at Blitzkrieg 3. Thumbs up!			"

Because thats what this game reminds me of now, its just a big waiting game leveling up your buildings and defending your base against the best youtube 'how to attack tutorials in Blitzkrieg 3' and making your defence as best as you can wich in my opinion is boring repetitive and just plain out lame. If your 7 years old and you like to copy and paste stuff from youtube without any stratigical knowledge this is probably the game for you. If you love a great RTS buy Blitzkrieg 2 its a great game! I hope my review was in some way helpfull to you.			"

								an amazing new and improved version of the game but granted that its early access im assuming youd want my feedback for potential improvements, first and foremost id like the ability to zoom in farther and secondly id like them to fix the screen scrolling, its not very smooth and it does get stuck at times when trying to scroll using the mouse. other than that im quite happy with my purchase. game just needs a bit of polishing  in order to be perfect. oh and those of you comparing the game to a classical rts like coh2 this game is a rtt a real time tactics. two different things.

								In its current state, I cannot recommend this game; the server issues currently make it unplayable. However, I will keep my eye on it and, if it improves, I may change my mind and give it a ""Yes"", as the idea of this game seems very intriguing (asynchronous multiplayer campaign) and the previous iterations of the series were good games.If you wish to take a chance and purchase this in its current state, be my guest, but I'd advise you to wait until the full release or for a sale, just incase you find it very disappointing or if you run into any technical problems (seeing how it's an early access game with, currently, an online-only focus, expect lots of them).http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/717540474960011123/5B320FBE08E87C311ED7921BD0D27248BB449B95/ "

								Why do I love this game?   Great graphics, everything is well detailed, you can zoom in to get close to the action.   Now this is just like when you were a kid with your toy soldiers, tanks and jeeps etc., but X100!   If you don't take the road when you move your troops to your desired point, they crash through fences, mow down trees, the damage is very detailed!   The battlefield's are about 1kmX1km, and you can pan around the landscape to plan your attack, but it will not show you where all the enemies are.   In the beginning (where I still am), the first level was fairly challenging, and I battled towards the goal as a crow flies. Yay, I won, but my battle report was poor and lower rewards etc.   Try the first round again to kill ALL enemies was a completely different story,  It just gets harder and harder the more you try to fully complete a round.    There are several seperate battles on the map.  Inbetween some of these battles, you receive exp. points that you can spend immediately on reserve troops and tanks etc. and bring them into the battle. How cool is that?   There is a 'watch replay' button, but I haven't used it yet. Sweet!   Very intricate, detailed, in-depth, the sound is great, damage is great and stays that way.   Would you like to hunker in a bunker? Your soldiers can build a trench anywhere you like, and you can also build up defences around tanks in areas you want to defend.   Game is FUN to play!Update after 50 hrs: Before going into battle, there is so much military to choose from.                              In battle you use your selected units for certain situations, don't send your machine gunners to a gun turret!                              From the detailed characteristics of soldiers, to the dust on the road...                              Incredible game, just incredible.                              Super replayable, even if I'm victorious I may replay the same battle and try it completely different.                              I hate to cut this so short, but I would like to play this game now. Cheers!			"

								I don't know what this is anymore. I used to enjoy it before the last update, but anymore its such a cluster**** I literally don't even know how to play anymore. On top of that the last update destroyed performance. My 980 now chugs along around 20 fps. I really did enjoy the new mechanics of base defense, and felt that while it needed alot of work, it ultimately was fairly enjoyable to play, and could easily find players. This has turned into a circus, these constant game changing updates. Its like they don't even know what they want to make anymore. As far as what I can say that hasn't changed? Tank combat is fun, infantry combat absolutely sucks. At least compared to previous BK games. Gone are Binocs and varied squads, now all infantry are identical little minions with no individual will power or armament. Pretty much garrison them or blob the enemy. The base defense concept is sound, at least to me, I liked the defense system, though it was a bit simple. Didn't like the 3 day wait to switch between factions. The new UI is the most confusing thing I've ever seen. Ultimately, I'm giving up on this turd. I had hope, they dashed it, I settled into acceptance with what we had with BK3, now.....They'd be better off remastering an HD version of the original Blitz and calling that BK3. This as it stands now? Just stick to the original. I've been finding more and more mappacks and mod sites. At least until we can see what Sudden Strike 4 looks like. Hopefully they won't **** it up like these guys did.			"

Games like Company of Heores run rings around it grahically and gameplay wise. Considering CoH was developed ten years ago this should not be sold anywhere in its present state. Its only saving grace apprears to be the support. I sent an email in with an issue and had a reply back within a few minutes fixing my issue.My advice is to avoid.....			"

								I have been playing Blitzkrieg since the first installment of the franchise and it is with great enthousiasm that I started playing on this third installment. Keeping in mind that it is stil an early access is the first thing to do. It is still full of bugs. I do not see it as a bad thing since it's part of the early acces principle, it's not the official game yet. If I still see soldier swiming in the sand when it's officially out, well, I'll change my mind. At first, there is the tutorial. I tought It would be all about France or Poland like in the others but it is a full lenght of 4 mission, which total about 3 hours! Although a bit annoying at some point, it allowed me to learn the game, even if I am a veteran of the genre. This game has actually a steep curve of learning. The missions are very hard, the ennemy AI is mostly proactive and efficient, which is great, at least in my opinion. I read so many review about the game being too hard... It's a strategy game! Hard is good! It means you have to think and plan carefully. there is in this game some great elements of the first and second blitzkrieg and many new things. I can't wait for the other campains. For now, Only one is out, the germans and it's far from being a complete one. Beware, it is not a CoH or a MoW. If you take all this in consideration before buying the game, you will, I am sure of it, appreciate the game.(edited for better syntaxe and correction of some grammar faults)			"

								Being a sucker for WW2 strategy games and a old fan of the previous Blitzkrieg games I had to give this a try.I can see potential in this game but they need to do plenty of work in doing it to the Blitzkrieg we fans know and love. It is sad to see resupply removed and static heavy weapons such as artillery, something that was vital for the survivability of your more important assets in the older games was to relocate them. It is early access and I hope they will implement these functions at a later stage. I am also sad to see the reinforcement counter have been removed, instead you get points by taking objectives to call in reinforcements with. I especially liked BK2's as it forced you to go through missions with the minimal ammount of reinforcement called in so you had the most at the end mission, making you plan and strategize even on a front scale.There are a few bugs haunting this game too, the one that affects my gameplay the most is the one where infantry jumps out of trenches (they have been told to hold positon) and get slaughtered immediately. The constant online feature is a worrying addition to this game, and the constant global chat window is a nuisance and pops up as soon you press space (not to mention it is in the way at times even minimized).What I like is that infantry have a bigger role in this game, acting as scouts as your tanks have a very limited view range and add somewhat of a challenge. Sadly once I figured out that making small move orders at a time I can snipe out enemies without them even doing a thing took away that challenge.In all I can't recommend this game as for now, there are sadly better games out there if this is what we will get not to mention the older Blitzkrieg games which thankfully are available on steam too.Any newcomer to this genre, stick to the older series. You won't get disapointed.			"

								This game is CERTAINLY a work in progress, i have never had any previous experience with the Blitzkrieg games, but this game has been a great game as far as i can tell, i like the whole ""clash of clan"" like multiplayer with building your own base and destroying others bases, and the graphics do look quite beautiful... i do have some VERY serious gripes about this game however, one of which being that the armor/penetration mechanics dont seem to have been put in yet considering my Hetzer, which apparently has 284mm of frontal armor and 284 pen on its gun, is killed with relative ease by tanks such as BT-7s and M3 stuarts.... also any damage is taken off the health bar, no matter how miniscule, if a Ba-64 shoots at a Pz2 Luchs, it will cause damage... the tanks anti-infantry capabilities are also very poor for what they are, for example the Pz38t is hardly able to kill a squad of riflemen effectively by themselves. While these things are game breaking and annoying, making tanks almost useless against anything except buildings and buldings with infantry, this games does show immense potential and i feel as if my money was well spent. if this quote that i said during playing this game helps,""this is the first time i have had fun playing a unfinished game i have payed for"" i hope you join in and support this game. Thanks for reading :) hope this helped			"

								////NEW REVIEW////Went on to Youtube and watched some playthroughs/tutorials on this game.  Initially I was very frustrated (see below), but, after watching the walkthroughs, I have a better understanding/respect as to how this game is played and, indeed, how clever it is.  I've began playing it again and am enjoying it very much.  That said, I would like to see more opportunities/means to acquire resources and incentive for playing rather than waiting.  The current means is by waiting, challenging other players or the AI, or, defending your base.  However the rewards through playing, initially, were around 7K for supplies and gas but, taper off to around 2K.  Overall though, this game is growing on me more and more.  ////OLD REVIEW////You'll play this game initially and think wow, awesome, and amazing.  However, as you try to build up your base, forces, and get your feet wet, you'll have a higher level player stomp you....  I'm not sure if some of the other players experienced this, but, I found during one base defense mission, that I threw my entire range of forces at one tank and it took little to no damage and all my infantry and tanks died quickly.  The emplacements offered nothing in terms of resistance as well, dying in one to two hits.  Must have been Rambo manning the tank....  Point being, attackers took little to no damage and were at 100% force strength when he took out my base.  Good idea/concept.  Once the developers work out the hacks, bugs, and players who cheat, it will be a good game.  For now, though, this game still is a ways off from being anywhere near balanced or playable.  Feel free to hit me up with any questions.  Cheers			"

								At the moment, this game is not finished and it is not polished therefore, its not great, yet. I def. see potential in this game and the devs, making good decisions, can  make this a good game. Right now I cant recommend or not recommend this game the one exception to this is Blitzkrieg game fans then, I would recommend those people buy it because I think the risk of this game not being liked by Blitzkrieg fans is low.. I am optimistic about this game and at this stage in the games development considering whoe the devs are, I think it will be a good game to those people who like WW2 Era RTS games. If people are on the fence about the game, in my opinion, I would recommend those people to keep an eye on this game because of its potential. I did buy the game because I am a long time Blitzkrieg fan and to those people that are Blitzkrieg fans, I do believe that its more likely this will be a good game espically to previous Blitzkrieg fans. I had this thumbs down but with the recent update, I think finally this game is headed in the right direction and the latest patch, in my opinion, did a lot of good work.			"

								Not a great game. Combat feels unrealistic. Soldiers that can kill tanks in seconds with grenades ectYou need to ern the units you use in game (even in multiplayer). When playing the game your units are just as powerfull as the enemys (which i like), but it you get about 1/6 the enemy force to defeat them with. It feels silly/unrealistic.Many of the great features of past games have been removed. Engineers, towable artillery, resupply trucks. It doesnt play like a blitzkreig game. it feels like they tried to be more like company of heroes and a moblie game mixed together. its really BIZZARE. At this point in development i don't see the game making a comeback, and from what i've seen the devs have no intention of making drastic changes (which are needed).			"

Early Access Review
								Needs more work.I was a big fan of Blitzkrieg 2 when it came out in the mid 2000's. So far, this game was a bit of a dissapointment for me.  Issues- Not enough people playing online. I waited a very long time during multiple timeslots throughout the day adn wasn't able to get a match. I think the matchmaking system is based on your single player progress since I wasn't able to access the ""tier 3"" technology and wasn't able to match with people who had that tier unlocked.- Singleplayer is incredibly difficult. The singleplayer relies on you using your own units. This is problematic since you don't start out with many types of units and there is a cap on what you can use. There's no chance for reinforcements unless you have additional units in your queue. This made the first levels very difficult to play.- The interface needs some work. I discovered the multiplayer button (titled ""Frontline"") on the main map by accident. It didn't give any indication of what this button did until I clicked on it. The units in the game pop up icons when something happens to them but there is no way to decipher these icons. - Blitzkrieg 2 had a nice unit stats window that would appear on the main UI when you clicked the unit. This showed the gun's penetration capabilities, the armor, the HP, and how much damage the gun can do. This one just tells you the armor on the vehicle: it's less intuitive than B2's. - Performance is subpar considering the graphics quality and the fact that this is a RTS. I encountered lag quite frequently during the singleplayer despite having a GTX 970 and an I5. I think the ""clash of clans"" style base assault multiplayer has potential. I will be checking this game out in a future release, but right now I'm not ready for it.			"

								First of all, i really like this game. It's different from any other major RTS game on the market.(less E-Sports type competition I guess)It makes me want to keep playing.You don't have to worry about those annoying building order. you just have to think about you combination of force.Just get the unit you want and get out there and smash your foe haha.But still, a little bit of micro management is required.Graphics are not bad but the unit object in game are TOO SMALL that they make my eyes pain A LOT!!!!I can only play this game for at most 30 minutes and have to rest my eyes.Zoom-in is not working too much. You need to fix it Nival.I don't want to be blind for playing too much of this game.Above all, I will still recommend this game for all RTS lover.P.S I am not a native speaker so excuse my poor english.PP.S The german voice acting is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hire smoeone else.

								I loved Blitzkrieg 2, however this one is terrible. I wasted $60 on a promised-to-be-good game that turned out to be a nightmare.  The combat is pitiful, the ""base"" management is even worse. Every battle is the same no matter what you do.  There is no strategy involved either, if you bring a full set of tanks you will win even if the enemy has alot of AT guns, they wont stop armor, however if you bring infantry you will lose no matter what you do, they are so useless its pitiful.  Do not buy this game unless you can overlook a 95% fail			"

								This game is rediculus. First time I buy an early access game and totally tricked by those early gamers who gave this game a very high positive review. I play a lot of WW2 games and this is by far the worst gaming experience ever. People who gave this game very positive rating. I hope you don't give the false rating so that more people got trapped here and pay the developers to further develop this crap - so the money you paid won't be devalued. 1. Need internet connect to play and very unstable server connection. I never dropped a single game ten years of playing online games and this one, I played the first mission ten times and I could NOT finish even once. Everytime the game either crash itself or it pop out a message ""you lost connection with the server"" and kicked my out (for an supposed offline mission, seriously??). Can you imaging spending 40 minutes or so playing a first mission every time and never being able to finish a single supposed offline mission because of the bad connection to the server???!!!!!2. How is it a realitic engine, everything looks cheap and fake. From movement of infanty to that of tanks. If you've played COH in the past, you will know what I mean3. Don't waste your money here. Until it is fully developed.			"

You are basically forced to go head on into choke points that only a stupid commander would assaultYou wind up spending a lot of time doing nothing waiting to get resources. It can take 30+ min to replenish your forces. This is OK for a multiplayer game but against the AI for your own enjoyment, you play 30 min and wait an hourAI Battles start being all the same very quickly – Game really a multiplayer game.

Early Access Review
								A relatively historically accurate RTS in the vein of Company of Heroes or Men of War, at least to the degree that any top down RTS could be historically accurate. As in Company of Heroes tanks do not destroy each other with one penetrating hit, infantry are not immediately gunned down in swathes by machine gun nests and so on, but that is unavoidable in order to keep the game playable from an isometric perspective.As in Company of Heroes there is a singleplayer campaign with historical missions as well as a traditional skirmish PVP mode.The main difference from the competition, and to me the most interesting part of the game, is the Clash of Clans style base defence/offence mechanic. You establish a base on a front line and set up defences where the terrain favours them: minefields and tank traps on bridges, bunkers and tank destroyers hidden in forests, etc. Then other players attempt to attack your fortifications with assault forces that they put together. If you are online you command your defensive forces yourself, and can call in reserves and various other support such as artillery barrages, dive bomber strikes, strategic carpet bombing, etc. If you are offline the enemy player faces your defenses controlled by AI. Surprisingly the AI actually defeats enemy players attacking you from time to time.As in any Early access game there seem to be a few balance issues, but on the whole the game seems quite polished at this point. I'm rather impressed with it so far and definitely prefer it to Company of Heroes 2. It's refreshing to be able to spend 100% of your time commanding units and microing, whether defending your own base or attacking an enemy base, as opposed to spending it on base building and build orders as in more traditional RTS.

								I have enjoyed the Blitzkrieg Franchise from the first game through all the expansions till now. i must say this game is different from the other two as far as mp is concered, but sp is the same, it simply lacks the rpg element. but regardless the missions are fun and provide some historical insight into the actual battles of the world war 2. Now my only complain about this game is, and like the other blitzkrieg game is that they lack a multiplayer ai, now they do have practice mode, but i feel it is lacking. i feel like they should a multiplayer ai that allows players to select faction,diffulculty and game mode.

								I like this game, it is very thin ice on a positive and negative review in all honesty though. I am a very big fan of the older series and very much still play them still despite the elderly graphics and mechanics. Blitzkrieg 3 seems rather distant and undecisive in what it wants to do, either a massive community based multiplayer game or a single player campaign. The multiplayer aspect seems like a limited pay to play game (Clash of clans) but the single player seems like a distant forgotten single player campaign like the older games or even men of war...despite they are so different. I am playing the single player aspect and rather than starting with a lot of men and tanks and re-inforcements like the older games, you start with a few. You start with what you can afford to buy before the mission and aquire anything else within the mission to win which is not a common aspect. It seems like a love child of a bygone era which was not paid enough attention....but the multiplayer seems like a spoilt child who was rewarded for doing nothing with nothing to show either....Single player lacks finesse....multiplayer lacks normality....but over all it is Blitzkrieg....the game I played when Call of duty 2 servers were down. I really wish there was a save feature on this....you lose....you lose the past 40 minutes of your life...I am giving this a positive review....based on it is early access and has potencial...7/10...needs some work			"

								First of all to those who haven't played the game, try read what status rhe game has. It's early access and they are working on it. The campaigns for each nation nation in game will come. If you haven't played blitzkrieg 1 and 2 then don't get blitzkrieg 3 before playing those games. The graphics in the game are really good in my opinion and the multiplayer is something I can spend hours on just attacking or defending my base or making my base defense better.Some of the things I don't like are the bugs but I see how their developers are doing everything to fix the bugs and glitches.And then again it's early access, things will be better.

It envolves base building, tactical deployment of troops, supports (air, artillery, airborn, ect.) along with tanks, and great ground combat. Blitzkrieg 3 is an all round great game, so I highly recommend it. Also, I would recommend getting this game on♥♥♥♥♥as it is much cheaper there.

								I'm a fan of WW2 RTS (men of war, CoH 2 ...). I've never seen so much bug in a game. Patch after patch they can't fix bug and pathfinding is horrible!! Your tanks are always going backward for no damn reason, infantry getting stuck against anti-tank barrier, vehicules merge into one another and then are stuck... Horrible is the word! Really hard to find a match in multiplayer (so few players are playing it). You can let the game open for hours waiting for someone to attack you.... well you better be patient cause no one is going to (except early level)!There is no big goal in this game, if you defend or not, it's doesn't really matters (you can choose to ignore enemies attack and then they can't attack you wtf...).Don't buy this! If you do, make sure to play less than 2 hours so you can have a refund! Stay away from that game!			"

								I haven't played RTS for a long time, more than ten years. As I see, these technologies really have been raised far beyond since old time. Gameplay is hard enough, but it is quite feasible to complete the missions. GFX is funny sometimes like square wheels on the airplane in the operation ""Compass"", but in-game graphic, especially battlefield detailization, is completely amazing. Support of 4k screen resolution - excellent! Small nice feature: I may save the progress in the game on my home device (PC) then load and continue in outdoor (macbook). I forgive some minor bugs due to early access and hope, dev team will fix and tweak game as quick as the real blitzkrieg :)			"

								It's a pretty good game for any WW2 RTS lover. The game is pretty good in it's current state but I feel it's going to get much better. When I first got it a few months ago It wasn't that great and there was a few design choices I thought were odd. With each update that passes and with devs listening really close to the community I feel this game will fullfill all the users want a worthy sequel to Blitzkrieg 2 to be. I'm posting this on the day of a new massive update which seems to be overhauling to perfecting the game, looking forward to it! :)			"

								Well if you search for a ""clash of clans"" like game with the sweet taste of paying for then it this game is the perfect choice for you. If you wish to get yourself a nice WW2 RTS then you should not buy this game. The strategic deepth of the game is nearly non existent since it is based on simple countering (infantry > AT infantry > vehicles > ) witch gives you fun for about 10 mins. The simple counter mechanic does not really benefit from the fact that there are 3 unit types either. The game gives you an actually nice challenge with this system since it is not easy at all yet way too uncomplex to keep the ecitement up for more than a couple of minuits.			"

Early Access Review
								DISCLAIMER: I was given a free key by the publishers to review this product. I received no other compensation or monetary gifts. I was not biased or swayed by anything the developers or publishers did or did not do for me.This review is NOT finished. This is an inprogress review as I work my way through the game.My final suggestions may differ from what you now read based on how well the game does or does not develop from this point. When the review is ""final"" I will make it public to all and this 'warning' will be removed.Through Early Access and funding by gamers who weren't too tight with their wallets, Blitzkrieg III was announced initially as a free-2-play multiplayer only game with optional purchase for a single player campaign and showed up on Steam's Early Access (EA) program shortly after.Every since it's EA announcement, I have followed the development of Blitzkrieg III with a bit of hope that they would take the new features of a modern RTS games and mix it with the power of today's graphic engines to make a Blitzkrieg III to make the past entries look ancient.And, I will admit, I was nostalgic for a title from my past returning to glory.However, nostalgia has a bad habit of making you remembering the past through rose-colored glasses and let's you think good things were REALLY good and the bad things weren't so bad.I had forgotten how advanced RTS's are today compared to ten years ago. I forgot just how valuable it is to use features a lot of people today take for granted.So after getting a press copy of Blitzkrieg III from the publishers, I was excited to relive the glory days of fight for Hill 772 while being outnumbered by the bad guys 4 to 1.I had assumed, that because so much time had passed since Blitzkrieg II and III, that III would be a totally different beast.Rose Colored Glasses Indeed.After firing up Blitzkrieg III the first thing you are greeted with a very simple choice;Choose Germany, Russia or the U.S. forces as your side.No idea of what type of units you'll have, starting population of your units, what the situation is... just dumped unceremoniously into an active mission.While I appreciate the tutorial starting from the beginning, I would have liked to have a main menu screen first to set my options!I find it extremely irritating when a game just auto-picks my screen resolution and blindly throws me into gameplay without letting me set these features first.On a console I can understand it, as you don't really have any options to worry about, but on a modern PC, 9 times out of 10 a game does not pick the settings I want to run my games with.I have an amazingly fast machine, but just about every game auto-picks medium of the road setttings. It is very annoying to have to play through a complete mission before you can shut that darn music down or go past 720p resolution.(I did find out later that I could go to the options screen at any time, but I usually am afraid to escape from a tutorial mission on a new game I know nothing about as I have had games that cleared your mission and some tutorials are hard to reset incase it makes you miss something) Devs, don't do this! Please, give us a Main Menu screen as our first choice in all games.My next problem is the starting mission. My first time I picked US forces. I am not told how to select or move anyone. I just have some guy telling me over voice to stop these German guys who are attacking my guys. Being that I have played RTS's, I have no problems figuring out the basics and get all my ducks in a row. But, if I had been new to the genre I would have been completely lost.I soon discover that this Blitzkrieg feels pretty simple. Too simple.My soldiers have no formation controls, other than crawl or run. Shoot or not shoot. Take over a building or exit a building. That's about it.No patrol routes, no ""defend this guy"", no ""ignore bad guys and run like hell to the objective"".So after slogging through a simple get-together with my scattered forces this is where I run into my next problem. I am told that enemy Italian forces are coming at me with superior armor and to bug out. The problem, is it doesn't tell you where to go to ""bug out"".There are a few spots on the map where you can see there are enemies, which show up as red dots. To the north is a new big red icon so I assume that the armor is coming from the North and decide to head south to get away from it.  Suddenly, my guys just get blown to smithereens as if aliens throw down hellfire. I just got scripted-killed because I went the wrong way...That's not good.Next time around I learn that the big red icon was the direction I was intended to go towards.(Remember, red on the map is supposed to mean ""bad guy here"" but, for some reason, they assumed I would know that this time, that red icon was the way to safety)What really chapped my hide was that it seemed like if I didn't go North, that I would be scripted to lose no matter how well I fought. So, this being in ""tutorial"" land I decide, ""Hey, maybe it's just to get you through the basics."" So I let it slide... for now. However, at this point, the tutorial has not ""taught"" me anything, except that you can't trust the color red on the map to always mean ""enemy"".I go back to the main screen and see that I have a choice of Generals to use. For some reason the game decided I didn't need to know about that either and had automatically picked a General for me, never once telling me how to pick my own, what the benefits are over one or the other.In the next mission I get some off-screen arty (with a cool down period) and later I get a button that shows I could call for reinforcements.It's at this point I am more confused.Why? Well, I see tanks I can order, but no idea how to get the ""points"" needed to order them.It shows I have 5 points, but never has it explained how I got those 5 points or how to get more.I am down to my last 2 squads and have about 50 bad guys with about 4 tanks. I so need to order a tank or two, but the reinforcements button for them are grayed out and I assume because the cheapest item on the list is 30 points that I do not have enough resources to order more.I of course get slaughtered. 2 squads of infantry against at least 50 enemy infantry and about 20 armor/arty isn't going to happen in anything resembling reality.So, for now, I have turned the game off in disgust.What is the point of this forced tutorial mode if it is going to throw overwhelming odds at you, and at the same time tease that that are other features, like ordering reinforcements, but takes no time to tell you what you did or didn't do to earn more points.This was not a tutorial in any scope of the imagination.This was a ""throw you into the lake and sink or swim"".If did not teach me how to play the game, nor did it teach me about any extra features.The only thing it taught me was that the game likes to stack the deck with more than normal amount of enemies against a small squad.Should you buy this game?It depends. Are you a seasoned RTS vet?Do you already understand a lot of WW2 combat tactics?Do you know a lot of the historical aspects of WW2, what generaldid what, where?Are you okay with a game not telling you about features and letting you figure them all out on your own?Are you okay with a game not having a ton of graphical featuresand bells & whistles?If you answered yes to all of those and you want to support the genre, then sure, but that comes with a warning:I don't know how close the developers are from being finished, but if this is anywhere near close to done, then I fear this title will never live up to it's previous pedigree. With it's heavy focus on multiplayer, titles like this live or die on how well it's user base is active. If the ""meat"" of the game is in the online aspect, then I feel this game might flop if they don't beef-up a lot of glaring problems.			"

Now multiplayer is nearly dead or noobstomping if you get matched with any veteran players (and still no confirmed release and wipe date, just 2017 Q1). They added a chat too, but guess what, only russians using it and noone answering any english questions.Maybe after wipe ...			"

								A black sheep of Blitzkrieg franchise.    I was expecting Nival to produce a further evolution on the epic Blitzkrieg 2, which shouldn't be too difficult, but now it seems more like a degeneration than an evolution. Many features already present on Blitzkrieg 2 are missing in 3. You cannot rotate camera with your mouse, you cannot control midair aircrafts, you cannot replenish ammo and HP, and more intolerably, YOU CANNOT SAVE OR LOAD YOUR GAME, one wrong move and you have to start over from the very beginning, yes. Instead they added some useless features, such as ""capture the house"" key for the infantry, which I have absolutely no idea what meaning it has.    Speaking of campaign, it is UTTERLY USER UNFRIENDLY, partly due to the game mechanics. The walkthrough of a single mission is very long. It is especially frustrating when you cannot save your progress (imagine you just lost your only tank and you can not load game). Also, the campaign is unbelievably DIFFICULT, DULL and severly RUSSIAN BIASED. Russian infantry can wipe out German counterparts for breakfast without a scratch (in 1941!). BT-5 can one shot a B1 frontally whereas latter takes more than 3 minutes to do so. And you have no reserves while AIs do. I highly suspect whether gamemakers themselves can clear the campaign or not.   The multiplayer is dull as well. The player matching is long and not based on any parameter like skill, the map is way too small and predictable, the game mode is lacking (only defensive and offensive). I don't want to continue, you name it.    Overall, it's a very disappointing experience and I can tell the devs are not enthusiastic about this game for a single moment. Maybe they shouldn't make a sequel of Blitzkrieg 2 at all. A legend is better kept than ruined.			"

However gamers buy this game for amazing campains in a single player mod. i think Blitazkrieg 3 still very dry and need a lot to fix in a game process. You cant save game in single company, you cant change lvl (on easy, medium or hard). i think game have to much realism than previous parts and this make masturbation in a game process. All russian RTS strategies have same problem, to much realism and difficult gameplay process. I hope it will be fix in nearest updates.P.S. main picture of this game sucks fat german solders in glasses. Nival you should change this.			"

								AS much as I would like to reconmend this game to players of the series of which I was a huge fan of until this game. I cannot in good conience do so. This game was the biggest let down I have ever had the misfortune of paying for, A $60.00 price tag is not excatly cheap , but I feel ripped off, there is no single player campaign that does not inculde PvPing for upgrades or better units, and there is no balance when you get into a battle, the A.I. you face has better everything, firing rate , accuracy, and upgrades, so it takes forever to get anywhere in campaign mode. I hate being forced into PvP to just to get anything done in game., as matter of fact ,I hate PvP period. This game is more like a facebook app then an actual PC, strategy game, there is no skrimmish mode to square off against an A.I., and the Historical battles seem less then impressive to Me. I have played alot of World War 2 strategy games, but this one was such a let down. Im disappointed in Nival for ruining one of the best ww2 strategy games there was.If i had one reconmendation for Nival Scrap this game and build better versions of the frist two games in the series using those game formats will in my opion insure success.

								Stay away from this game!!!!!!! This is complete and utter trash. To sum up my experiance with this game lets put it in blunt terms.update-Gave this game another chance, and it still pisses me off. The dev below pretty much confirmed that this is a clash of clans clone. You need I repeat need an internet connection to play this game, there is no plan for adding an offline mode so if you have comcast you can go f**k yourself because you will lag out during single player. this game is a turd with sprinkles and I hope Karma pays these devs back because this game is a scam.1: French have Mortars that fire homing nukes capable of 1 shotting a Stug. 2: German Infantry are totally useless and are outgunned by french infantry by a huge margin. 3: a french machine gun carrier can go toe to toe with a stug or panzer 3.4: The game requires an internet connection, so if you have a bad provider like I do say hello to lag.5: No base building.6:With how useless your units are in this game it would make sense to either A: have a large army or a steady flow or re-enforcements. Not in this games case. I have no idea what the devs are thinking on this game but they have never played a strategy game before. 7: If you think about playing as the germans (The games name is Blitzkrieg no♥♥♥♥♥♥people want to play as the germans) Forget about it because your units will be outclassed and next to useless to the enemy.8: God aweful AI. When giving move orders over any distance sever of my tanks will drive in reverse offering a rear shot to the enemy. Don't buy this game stay clear it will only bring you anger and disappointment. Play Men of War or go outside and play in the snow.1/10 Biggest scam next to Day Z			"

								Dont buy this game. Truely feels, looks, and plays like a frickin' app game. For 30 dollars? Definetly not worth it. I refunded(THANK GABEN FOR THAT NEW FUNTION) this game after 20 minutes of play. I dont see anything new or inevative at all. Had no fun. The tutorial pushes you through what seemed like the majority of the games upgrades and progession. Stay away and ignore those ""helpfull"" positive reviews, I feel like I was completely coaxed. If the devs maybe added some kind of depth into the game like acutall strategy then maybe i would consider buying it, or maybe , made it look like a game from 2015 or at least some thing worth 30 god damn dollars. If  you want to know what this game is like without wasting 30 bucks, just go on your phone and download Clash of Clans or any of its clones. What a waste of time! DONT BUY!			"

								Very disappointing game. Basically only like a handful of different unit, which you can keep upgrading into the next tier. Sound great to have a more advanced unit? Well, every time you upgrade your units, you simply fight against a next tier enemy. Meaning that it's the same thing over and over again.If you are an active player, don't bother putting up defences, just make sure to use all your resources, attack 3x a day so you get attack bonus and make sure to use it all again. That way enemies if they attack simply cannot get anything from you.It's really clash of clans in WW2 skin.			"

								This is a mobile app. Has a base in the middle of Germany that can be attacked by people like a mobile app. Troops are hard to come by like a mobile app. The pics up top are misleading it looks nothing like that you just look at a map of World War Two and pick missions. You better hope you have good troops because you don't get a reserve you cannot build a base to spawn units and the only way to get reinforcements is to use paratroopers. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!			"

								A game that could have been so much better :(I look at the screenshot, look at the description and bam. I am on board to the history train! I remember those hours spent playing Blitzkrieg 1 and 2! Such great times spent in my childhood, discovering great strategy games (alongside with Cossacks back in those days).People... The solo is not the greatest, the game is unbalance and it's remind me more of a ""Clash of Clans"" rather than a real strategy game.It reminds me more of a freemium / pay to win, but there is no options to pay (thank god I already paid 35 euros for that). In the screenshot I see planes, epic battles, BADASSERY! GREATNESS! I was like WO WO WO!I launched the game, crashed a few times, had to redo the tutorials. (tutorials take long). Go online, I take a commander by mistake, I can't choose another one... Well... OK? Thank god it was the tank commander! Why? Because here is the ULTIMATE STRATEGY GUIDE FOR SKILLZ MLG PRO! You are ready?Have a lot of tanks.... Basically, you want scouts to see far away, you want medium tanks to be able to kill any poor AI enemy coming towards you or to handle an ambush from a player. Then you want a tank destroyer... which will be used as a giant sniper to ... destroy everything that is in sight of the scout! AND VOILA!Oh... I didn't say the best! You make your own base (seems fun uh? A permanent base! :D but no... here's why) but this is like a base you can't customize, you need to have your building in a big square, you can still put defenses (mines, stuff to make people not to cross a road or anti tank guns and pillbox) and you can put some of your units here and there.Problem? Everything cost ressource points (logic) but the only ways to get them is by : Attacking an enemy and not loosing OR wait and hope nobody attacked you when you were away from your computer!Let me explain, you attack and steal the ressources of people (they created a beautiful base but my team of ""tank snipers"" wipped out everything), GREAT! Now you are back at your base but someone attacked you, YOU LOOSE WHAT YOU JUST WON! I mean, it happened to me too many times, especially when I was about to click on something and I couldn't after because someone decided to attack me when I was attacking someone else and the AI taking care of my defense was dumb (it's an AI).You level up your base with the few ressources you can get, developing paranoia, you level up your troops and defenses, IT TAKES TIME! GRINDING, PARANOIA AND TIME! It remind me of an old game which was based on the same policy and if I knew, I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT IT!Nevertheless, I tried to love and cuddle that game, I really tried. It's blitzkrieg! But no... It's Casualkrieg, it's paranoia, waste of time, I find the animation of the units / modelization not so great (except... the tanks?). Worst... 35 euros... spent... on a game :( AND THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO SAY! (The commanders abilities, Unit restriction, the OP army with way more levels than you who attack your base while you're away and... 10 other dude who attacks you after him and because of the AI you loose.)So much more to say.... I tried steam refund but for some reason, they are still thinking you need less than 2 hours to discover a game and decide if you really want to separate from it. I wish there was a demo. I wish I knew :(If I didn't have the game and if someone gave me back my 35 euros, I would buy Men of War or EVEN COH 2 which is with LOTS OF DLCs! (DLCs... the new plague)			"

								as of right now this game is way and i mean WAY too difficult im on the very first mission and its ridiculously hard. and you know what i could deal with that if this game gave you the ability to save your progress but for some reason it does not have the most basic and obvious feature an rts game needs. No saving, no way to adjust the difficulty and not enough units to complete the mission with inadequate reinforcements that you cant choose or call in when you want to make this game just frustrating. I understand a game has to be challenging but this is just downright brutal its not even fun.			"

								Very dated gameplay, very unrealistic damage modeling and unit scaling.I know it is early access but that can only be used as an excuse for so much, the fundamental designs of the game, finished or no are still the same and they are flawed. The clash of clans style multiplayer is ok but the lack of customization on building your own base leaves alot to be desired in 2015.Also the units and damage modelling are completely outdated from RTS of a decade+ ago.The graphics are very pretty though.

Early Access Review
								This game is disapointing.  I did spent quite some time playing this game hoping it will get better as I progress. I finally gave up after spending over 30 hours on it.  First of all, all three factrions have the same unit types.  Tanks and infantry units do look different among US, Russia and Germany, but those units are the same type of heavy tank, tank destroyer, assault infantry and regullar infantry, etc.  They just look different but are with the same functions.  The buildings, defense units and structures look the same among all three factions. Multiplayer is a waste of time.  The upgrading system and game progress take forever.  It takes around 600k - 800k supply to progress from a level 5 headquarter to a level 6 headquarter, and each battle won will give you only about 7k of supply.  You fight in the maps with defenses created by other players.  However, there are only a few player created defense maps (around 4-5 per level).  So you fight the same battle over and over.  Imagine fighting the exact same battle 20 times hoping to get enough supply to upgrade to the next level.    Another disappointment is that you will lose your supply to other player when your defense (controlled by AI) is breached while you are offline.   Lastly, this game is buggy.  For example, units don't respond to command, infantry won't be able to destroy road blocks as that's suppose to be one of their skill.  So it ended up my whole army got stucked and I won't be able to finish the battle.  However, I must say the graphics are nice and the sound effects are good.  But unfortunatly, the gameplay is boring with repeatable maps and opponents.  I would not recommend this game to anyone at this stage of the game development.  Save your money for something else.

								I wouldn't buy the game in its current state.   List of problems that I have found with it:1. The game lacks multiplayer matches, because more people choose to play the AI instead of you. No multiplayer games is a game killer if you ask me. I can't sit there for hours waiting for 1 match.  Sure its fun setting up a defense, but if you have to beg people to attack you forget about it.2. The game progresses to a level 7 where you get to unlock all the different units, but you can never go back to a lower tier which are quite fun, and compete for that level ranking. They need to add in a change to any tier level ranking game.3.  The game needs an option to play any map of your choosing.   This right here is probably the most desired want.4. No way to save your maps once you have spent hours setting up your defense, because they make you upgrade to a higher level. And all that work is gone forever.5. No team games yet.  That is unlike the Blitzkrieg people to not have this option.There are many other problems with this game like game balancing issues but they are minor compared to the problem of finding people to play matches with you. There is no 'set up a match' thing button that you see in most games.  All you do is set up your defenses on a map and wait for people to attack you,.. that can be 5 minutes waiting or 24 hours to 1 week.  There are some very good positives also, one being there is no base buiding like in COH where you can keep bringing up reinfocements.  I don't really likes neverending games.  Most of my buddies left this game out of frustration. and I think its happening to me too.			"

								I have played all the way up to tier 6 tanks and have almost completed leveling up. I have played many hours but i must say. What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with the units taking commands? i have lost countless games due to tanks being ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Infantry are okay but can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the tanks. I hate this game due to the stupid tanks. They do their own thing and situations where its 4 of my tanks vs 1 of theirs i lose around 2-3 of my own because they are so ♥♥♥♥ing thick. If you love getting angry and losing your♥♥♥♥♥♥in games than this is perfect, if you love to lose all your units to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reasons such as having them drive through enemy defence lines killing them all because they are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then this game is perfect for you! Save your money, its nothing like the originals and a rip off of the game 'clash of clans' with a WW2 twist. And you battle people better with no chance to pick a base as it was done in the beginning. I hate this ♥♥♥♥ing game and its a shame because i am a huge blitzkrieg fan of the 1 and 2 series. To bad this went downhill and died, oh well. Do not reccomend blitzkrieg 3 but 1 & 2 are good. Hope you find this helpful in some way.			"

								All I can say is I was rather dissapointed.  I felt very restricted in the user interface.  The load times were painfully long for me, to the point I would crack a smile and think to myself... ""REALLY??"".   I don't like to be told what to do in a game as my only option. Just give a decent sized army and let me start kicking butt.  If there are elements in the game that players really like when taking the time to know this game, they were lost before I could even bear to load the game a second time.I was looking for a game like Suddenstrike.  Just not my cup of tea I suppose.			"

								Well graphics are awsome. but thats it. It has blitzkrieg finger print all over it. Not my type rts. I know why buy it well i was hopeing they kinda moved away from there ideas but nope just a better looking blitkrieg with its early accsess glitches.  NOW there are STRATEGY games i would like to see a little bit taken from 1. Aggression over europe the detail on units and destruction.  2. civilization 5 strategy map and turnbase functions and resourses.  When you attack enemy territory you start an rts battle for that hex. 3. Every thing sudden strike with better graphics that snow drop engine looks good. 4. Command and conquer base building 5. R.U.S.E pull there map view of the battle that view would look awsome when yourr battling in the rts fights. All these parts of theses games would be nice to enhance sudden strike. So sad this will never happen. oh well .			"

								I have played and loved Blitzkrieg 1 and 2 ever since they came out, and i have to report with a heavy heart that this is the worst RTS game i have ever played. Fans who loved the detail of the 1st and 2nd game will immediately understand how far backward this version has gone. For example, aheavy machine gun can easily destroy a panzer IV in the game. I will grant to Blizkrieg 3's credit that it is still in the early access stage, but i can already tell this game has nothing in common with the ones we have cherished over the years.			"

								Hello folks,So, I've loved to play the old BK games, BK2 with the support and unit reforcment system was just perfect, and the campain with the historic background was a masterpiece of singelplayer expereince.Now we get BK with a interesting mutliplayer, because they just copy the Clash of Clans system, and put them in a WWII theme, so its the very same like clash of clans.You can raid other base from other players, you can choose between attack a KI controled base or live against an other player.Elexir and gold from Clash of Clanes are here supply and gas, so if you gets attacked you will loose them like in Clash of Clans, and its so obvious thats a simply copy of the game, but you can play Clash of Clans for free, i mean i spend money to play a game and then i have to wait until my base have produce enough supply that i can build some stuff, this system will work on a free to play game sorry devs, this is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in my eyes.One good thing is in theire, because if you attack you dont will loose your units or if they gets destroyed, thats should be the same with the supply and gas system, i mean i dont want to wait for ages to build me some anti tank guns or a defence fighting position, because you will need supply for the dfp for example and supplys to upgrade your base, like in .. right Clash of Clans.If i'm right then the devs say at the start they think about a f2p multiplayer and a p2p singelplayer, in my opinion the multiplayer is still in the direction for a  f2p mutliplayer with microtransactions instead of a p2p multiplayer, because they say they will sell the game like a full game.If you loved BK1 and BK2 then you should wait for the final version of the game, maybe they will change some stuff in the game that we got the good old BK feeling in that game, i mean its look very nice and the animations and map are very detailed and they look very nice, but the other thinks are just crap.

								Why do the developers want us to follow their idea of how the game should be played? Again this is another RTS that forces you to follow a script. Some of the best RTS games I have ever played allowed me to control the game. Set an objective and then the player can follow whatever strategy he or she deems fit to achieve that goal.This channelled game play is not fun, I don’t care that I have to take item 1 then item 2 then item 3 I want to arrive a successful outcome MY way.Had the potential to be a good game along the lines CoH or MoW but they missed the boat here – developers please stop trying to force us to play YOUR version of the game. Allow people free reign over the game so we can play how WE want to.It is an alright game, but if I was back and knew now how they structured the game play, I would not be spending any money on it, if I could I would try for a refund I feel that disappointed with this game.

								I originally got the game well over a year ago. It used to be fun and entertaining with a bit of natural difficulty due to unit stats. Now the AI is rediculous. I can put hold position on and the units charge the enemy and wipe your army. The game us now unbearably buggy, I can't complete objectives, some buildings the AI will control are indestructable making missions uncompletable. The ""historical campaign"" is just a mess every which way. It's not even fun any more.			"

								I'd never played the Blitzkrieg series, though I had heard and seen a lot about it, and upon seeing this I thought now was the time to jump on the bandwagon. First impressions were positive; a decent UI, easy controls and gorgeous graphics (for what it is anyway), after the 1st mission and the invasion of Poland began I barely advanced into the town and units started getting stuck on pieces of rubble, refusing to attack and generally poor performance. I just assumed this was single player bug and decided to jump onto the MP. This was where my opinion of the game plummeted like an asteroid dropping through the atmosphere. WHERE THE HELL WAS THE BRITISH ARMY?!?! Anyway, after going to get a drink and having calmed down a little I, somewhat begrudgingly, selected ""the Allies"" (Nival, hear me out for a moment; IT'S NOT THE ALLIES IF IT'S ONLY THE AMERICANS!!!) First look and clash of clans deja vu started flooding back and whereupon I read through the chat box, others were complaning about this that and the other. I went to have shufti and see what units there were, and lo and behold! ONE BRITISH UNIT! The Churchill. With a dirty great big star on it (Yes I know that's the sign of the Allied exp. force) I couldn't even be arsed to play a battle by this point. The negative waves were too much. So I've gone and applied for a refund. Needless to say, I think I'll leave this alone for a good long time.Update: Now ""SLIGHTLY"" Recommended So, I wrote that *cough* review, a fair old while ago now, and given the discount which has fluttered along, I thought that, because I'm naive, that'd give Blitzkrieg another bash. And my oh my how it has come along over the past 9 months. For starters, the gameplay has been smoothed out substantially. It's not perfect, by any means, but units no longer get stuck, campaigns have been added and tweaked and such until they're now in reasonably enjoyable state and just general adjustments here and there to make it playable. Now you might think I'm being a bit harsh, well to tell you the truth, I've been waiting for a WWII RTS game which has enough elements of realism (Tell me on what earth a 37mm can pen a Valentine from the front. I'd REALLY like to know), but retains a good arcade style to it that it can appeal to the mass audience, for YEARS. No don't say Company of Heroes 2, that game is all about humping the fuel point long enough and hard enough until you win through sheer numbers and unbalanced units. Sudden Strike 4 looks decent enough, but the lack of technical gameplay doesnt avail enough for me. Anyway, back to Blitzkrieg 3; The game STILL retains some rather intolerable, if your reasonably learned on WWII, aspects. Such as nations only being the US of A, The USSR and Germany (Tell me what is wrong with that list, I'll wait) and what appears to be the bread and butter of this game; Clash of Clans, Blitzkrieg edition. Ok, perhaps I'm reading this entire game wrong from the start, but it's just my view. And the ATROCIOUS voice ""acting"". But other than that, this game has done ok to pull itself out from the rubble of a Lancaster bombing I gave it last year, but as a nice little distraction until that perfect WWII RTS arrives *cough* Steel Division *cough*, this will tide you over nicely until then. (I cannot speak for the MP as my limited time of repurchasing it hasnt allowed me to play it yet)I would recommend getting it when on sale. Even for 22.99, it's still marginally unpolished state really marks it off for more of a 15 quid game.			"

								Hey Guys,I want to say that this is my first review I write for a game, I decided to do so because I really like the game and I hate that it gets so many bad reviews. Please note that english is not my native tongueGraphics and A-lifeWhat brought me to buy this games was the wonderful graphics, some people complain that the graphics are outdated or ugly, but I think they are timeless. The world looks just beautiful and there are so many details, there are markings on the tanks, AT Guns, Planes, AA guns lots of beautiful buildings and there are many different buildings. You can find destroyed tanks on the maps showing that there was a fight before you arrived. The buildings are damaged and many vehicles stand around or in barns. In peace time, for example in one of your many bases which can be attacked too, there is alot of scripted things happening, like people repairing Trucks, generators or simply chilling. The Ai is okay, the campaign is very challenging it takes me hours to complete one mission with all 3 Stars.GameplayThe gameplay makes fun but could be improved, some units for example mortars and infatry seem to strong and as this game is early access many things are changing many times. (Frequent Updates!!!) There are alot of different vehicles, at the moment we have the sowjet union, USA and Germany but there are also many tanks from other nations (France, Italy for example.Crashes are rare and happen most of the time when starting the game. I did not have crashes during campaign or Multiplayer which is important because we can't save during campaign at the moment (02.09.2016)User InterfaceI am playing computer games for 12 years now and I have to say that I just love the interface, it's like in the old rts games. Many people complain it's difficult but you just have to try some things out and you will see it's really easy. Micromanagement for units works well but when grouped they tend to act a little dumb.Price30€ is a little bit much I bought my copy in summer sale for 15€ and I would buy it againFunWatch a Stug headshotting a russian soldier, it's priceless xD			"

								IMPORTANT: I wrote that review with 70 min. on the game, so I don't saw everything of the game, but I think I can do a buy or no buy. ALSO it is early access so much can change.At the actual state, do not buy it. To much bugs, missing content and the controls are awful.It's sad that BK3 has chosen to be an early access game, would be way better if they had betas and some Test players. Instead, they want to  take the money and do a half-good/finish game.I do not recommend it even if you are a BK 1&2 fan.Maybe after it is releasd it is worth it but only if they fix it and put more content in to it.

								Here i used to recommend it in 2015: Really nice game, has a lot of potential and good developers that listen to their community. The game itself is not expensive, but the Deluxe edition is quite of it, it should cost 9.99 or 12.99 but 19.99 is little bit expensive. Game mechanics and innovation is good.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2017: Now i can't recommend the game because it's very bad optimized, it has been modified a lot, but made the game very weird and boring. It could be better.I think it should have stayed like it was when released. Greetings from Chile.			"

								Ok this game has its issues but what do you want its ""Early access"" so far with what ive seen the game is really fun with a unique spin on WW2 statagy mixed with a aoe online like macanics, and for the most part the devs do listen to the community on new opions and ideas for future patches and such. over all i give it a 7/10			"

								I changed my review since the update. Game is biased for Soviet Faction (Russian developers). Campaign is screwed forcing people to do singleplayer to collect units. Not recommended!			"

								I have played Blitzkrieg when it was just a PC game, and would like to still see it as that, as well as this.  But, this is really good.  I like the strategy of Blitzkrieg, so this really fills that spot that I had been missing for a while now.  It is enjoyable, and will get better as they keep working on it.			"

								current gameplay is not fun anymore, i prefer the older gameplay, where you dont have to finish every single, nearly impossible campaign mission just to advance and gain new units (especially when you only can bring very limited troops to a battle).if you will, at least make some campaign missions where it's a major offensive operation, not a special, small scale troops "

								Just started getting into it. Looks really something and I believe the multi player part is where the game really takes off. One of the things I miss though is the ability to sweep the map around 360 as per Blitzkrieg 2 but the detail so far is splendid.			"
