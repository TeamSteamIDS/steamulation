												TL:DR; Not for people with a short attention span - you need to commit to learn the game, around 2-5 hours. Though I still highly recommend it.So here we have a 4X Space-Based Strategy game with about the same complexity of Civilization V (Base Game).I highly recommend this game to anyone with some patience and the will to learn a new game, as Endless Space is not easy to jump right into.The Tutorial is a series of text-based prompts with pictures; remeniscent of a wikipedia instead of an in-game tutorial, this coupled with a few 'ease-of-life' features (such as the Waypoint system) not being included in the tutorials make for an experience and a half when it comes to learning the game. Once you get the hang of the early game, however, everything else simply falls into place and all comes together. Between myself and my friends, we became competent in the game within 2-5 hours of playing (without the tutorial).In terms of difficulty; Pirates tend to give people a hard time, but can be disabled in 'Game Settings' just before starting a new game. The AI controlled Empires unfortunately 'cheat' at higher levels, gaining bonuses to their entire economy which grows exponentially with difficulty. That being said; after playing against them for a while, you'll begin to notice patterns in their behaviour and countering the AI becomes trivial after a while.Combat's not too complex; you do, after all, play the role of the Emperor. When 2 fleets clash, you're only able to select a 'battle action' for each of the 3 rounds. (Basically cards which give bonuses and negatives based on what your opponent chooses - some increase a specific defence, while others may empower your ships' weapons).The game is pretty, cinematic battles which take place in rather stunning space-scapes, beautiful galaxy maps with subtle animations in the background, dynamic changes to planets based off of which anomalies befit it and how much population is on it.Well, if you've read this far you're likely patient enough to learn and enjoy Endless Space, also thanks! Your dedication is appreciated!Regardless, I beleive this game is most fun with a few friends, though most of the time I've played has been in singleplayer. I also Highly recommend Disharmony - Endless Space's only DLC, it adds a few features that really help the game among other things, as well as adding a couple more layers to combat.P.S: In the Galaxy map, hold 'Ctrl', click on a system you own, click on another system (you don't have to own the second system); Congratulations! You just set a system waypoint, now whenever you create a ship in System A, it'll create a fleet as soon as it's done and move to System B.			"

												I fell in love with Master of Orion II when it came out first (1996) and since then I look for a worthy successor. Played several 4X games and they had their pros and cons. Endless Space is one of the better 4X games and absolutely worth buying, in my opinion. Wouldn't have played 300+ hours else, heh. I am reviewing it including Disharmony expansion.Galaxy: Endless Space offers some variety of galaxy shapes and sizes, some favoring defensive players, some favoring offensive ones. Additional finetuning of the galaxy is possible. I miss the opportunity of creating a REALLY huge galaxy, but maximum size with just one opponent works ok as a sandbox mode. During exploring you will find nice bonuses, a few pirates, wormholes (basically dividing the galaxy until you can travel through them) and finally different wonders, so exploring is actually fun.Background story: You learn about the Endless (usual Elder civilization which went extinct) during playing. The game lacks lore summary articles, but there are traces of this ancient civilization everywhere (galaxy wonders, technologies, factions, leaders), which adds to immersion.Factions: The games comes with 10 to 12 moderately unique prebuilt factions (depending on whether you get Harmony and Vaulters). Each gets specific traits, innate bonuses, ship bonuses and a few special technologies to encourage certain victory types and hence playstyles. Prebuilt factions are different enough to motivate you to try them all. Additionally, you can create your own faction by modifying a prebuilt one. Meaning you can replace their traits completely, but you have stick with their innate bonuses, ship bonuses and special technologies. It has still a high degree of freedom, I enjoy building my own faction a lot.AI: Computer opponents (artificial intelligences respective AIs) offer a solid challenge. Especially the 'evil' factions tend to attack you early on, so you cannot simply expand all over the galaxy or rush through the technology trees. Later most AI will attack you when they run out of colonization space - unless they are busy with other opponents. But they also attack each other for same reasons and their reasoning is mostly transparent (+x for long period of peace, -y for common borders etc.). At higher difficulty ratings they are more unfriendly (but not hateful) and get the usual strong production bonuses to offer more of a challenge.Leader: You can hire a few people for boosts to your empire or your fleets. They make a real difference and usually have a nice background story. It takes some time to learn about their feat trees, but once you became familar with it, your leader can turn a fleet into a nearly unbeatable force. Which you will need to fend off the many enemy ships at higher difficulty ratings... Using leaders to improve your empire helps a lot at the beginning but loses importance as it grows.Production: Production is done on system level mostly, saving you some time compared to games which do it on planet level. So most buildings affect all colonized planets, ships are produced by the entire system etc.. However, you can specialize your planets (usually: food, industry, research, money), explore their moons and terraform the planets. Terraforming is an interesting feature here because depending on faction and situation you can be better off with unfriendly environment. Since production shouldn't be automated, you will spend a lot of time with tweaking your systems. But that's true for many of these games...Technology: There are basically four technology trees and they sometimes offer different paths to specific technologies. It honestly needs quite a while to get used to them, but it offers interesting decisions to make. Technology names are often NOT related to their benefits, so at the beginning you will have to check their descriptions often. Other games did that better. Well, on the plus side you have many interesting concepts in the tech description texts - some scifi fans will like them.Diplomacy: The negotiation with aliens is a solid feature. At the beginning you are at ""cold war"", meaning you can invade other factions' outposts but not colonies - a bit confusing first. Of course there are war and peace. Peace can be upgraded a bit by two more treaties (open borders, cooperation) and there are alliances. Alliances are usually a short-lived thing with AI empires, but a few traits and technologies reward you for allying. Upgrading from war to cease fire to peace to additional treaties / alliance goes slowly since there is a hardcoded turn amount between them. For instance you have to be at war with your opponent for 10 rounds, then both sides can offer cease fire. At the beginning of the game this makes some sense (why ally instantly with some empire you barely know?), later it becomes kind of a burden. AI empires sometimes ignore the turn amount, speeding up the process. Beside this you can trade dust (basically money), technologies, systems and special resources. At the end of a long war you can even make an AI empire give you all its colonies.Covert operations: There is no secret service in any empire which is a bit of a letdown. Leaders can steal some dust (money) and technology points from other empires, but that's it.Ship design: This game gives you rather much freedom how to design your spaceships. The weapon choices are a bit dull: Level 1, 2 and 3 versions of mass drivers, beam weapons and missiles, plus some fighters and bombers. You can defend your ships with thick armor, defense systems or simply taking out the enemy ships fast enough. Finally some special systems make your ships truly unique: Better engines for raids, better scanners to avoid getting surprised, siege for slow invasions, marines for fast invasions (they cost population!), multiple colony pods for quick expansion or multiple layers of armor to accept and shrug off enemy hits.Battles: Endless Space has a somewhat simplified battle system. You cannot control single ships or squadrons, instead you set the overall strategy by picking a card and probably refine it by formation and general targetting tactics. Leaders add a bit of complexity with their special cards. 'Manual combat' just means you can watch the battle (which looks nice) and change cards every combat phase. Of course this card system means you lose some control (compared with other games), but it also reduces micromanagement and makes the AI more competitive in battles. Some people hate it, some love it, I'd say it's ok.Bugs: Endless Space crashes ocassionally, let's say every other game. In every case reloading the latest savegame fixed the issue. According to the error messages it's mostly about AI diplomacy - playing with less opponents and in smaller galaxies might help. Given the fun the game provides, I accept the rare crashes though.If you like complex 4X games, you will (very likely) enjoy Endless Space and its addon Disharmony.			"

												The short of it: This game is really good, BUT ONLY WITH THE EXPANSION! DO NOT BUY AND PLAY THIS GAME NAKED!Unlike a lot of 4X games, Endless Space is more about building your empire than about developing your colonies or really fighting wars. Not that you won't fight wars, the AI is usually vicious enough to wait and plot and it will build up an overwhelming force based on your existing military might before waging war on you. And it WILL do that. Every single chance it can, unless it can't, it will do that. Never think it won't, since it has no reason not to.We'll get more into that later, but right now let's focus on the empire-building. Building up the empire is the primary focus of this game. Oftentimes if you look at too little at a time, you'll tunnel vision yourself into a corner when you should be keeping yourself as distant as possible. A prime example of this is expressed in happiness. The morale of a system and its subsequent production bonuses are NOT more important than the overall happiness of your empire. After all, a 15% production bonus across 4 stars is better than a 30% bonus in just one. If, when settling a new system, you have a planet with lots of production, or a planet with a high amount of happiness-boosting, you pick the one that makes your empire happy, or you lose the game.Now then, let's talk about war. War is problematic in this game because A) it's inevitable, and B) it's boring. The game takes a very hands-off approach to combat and in the vanilla game technology is both everything and a linear arms race. The guy with the most ship tonnage and the best weapons will always win. You can employ tactics cards, but these will only have a minimal impact on the outcome. This leads to a very boring experience, and can force you into certain types of tech progression and thus certain modes of gameplay. To deviate from established doctrine is to lose in the vanilla game.DO NOT PLAY THE VANILLA GAME. Instead, do yourself a favor and get the Disharmony expansion. The Disharmony expansion does away with about 75% of the weapon-tech in favor of just four generations of guns. Each is a sizable improvement over the last generation, and keeping up the with the AI is definitely important, but with tactics, ship design, aimpoint selections, and formation management you can steal victory from the jaws of supposedly assured defeat.Endless Space encourages you to use your distant veiw not to mess with the minutae of your own empire, but rather to mess with the other guys. Through trade, trade routes, blockades, invasions, explorations, treaties, and wars you are charged to take away the choices of the enemy for as long as possible while you improve your own choices. How you do this is entirely up to you, and Endless Space: Disharmony actually allows you quite a bit of wiggle room on how you do it.			"

												This game is nefarious. It has that ""one more turn"" down to a T. From the sound design to the atmosphere to the lovely and easy to read interface, I think this is the best space 4X I have ever played. Gal Civ 3 was very, very slow. Stellaris is fun but has a lackluster mid- to end-game, and some balancing issues. I've tried most of the space 4X games on Steam. This is where I stayed.Yes, combat is hands off. That doesn't bother me. It's actually a nice change in my eyes, I don't always want to micro my whole galaxy while pausing every 5 for battles. Do your thing, my fleets. Crush my enemies that I may grow and prosper! I can see that being a legitimate complaint though. It really is very hit or miss (pun intended.)As for Steam, there are many incorrect reviews here, from the one that says you can't re-name your systems (oops, embarrassing) to the ones that say all factions play the same.Interesting that a race of pacifist amoeba entities whose focus is peaceful existence and diplomacy  can feel similar to the Cravers, a locust-esque species that consumes planets and their resources voraciously and requires constant expansion to maintain its resources pool. Craves can't even really use diplomacy and are automatically at war with everyone. Sophons gain science like mad but have weaker ships. Sheradyn focus on combat and honor amongst the stars, and enemies they engage cannot retreat but must fight to the death of one fleet or the other.What that really tells me is that many of these players didn't play at a high enough difficulty for their playstyle to need to match their chosen race, or they simply didn't understand how to play the different races. That isn't a knock on the players, but how can someone with 5 hours judge a 4X game and claim to have seen what it has to offer? That isn't even long enough to get a feel for one race, let alone the game.			"

												Think Civilization in space, a beautifully crafted and easy to get to grips with 4x4 strategy game that can operate anywhere from small galaxies with two races to a huge universe with 8 factions. The joy in this is the expansion and technological advancement. However, the space combat, while somewhat of a railroad sequence, remains entertaining with a fairly unique 'stance' selection mode where you can choose the tactics your fleet uses. This game is also has incredible aesthetics, one of it's high points,with the ability to zoom in on planets, ships, the galaxy as a whole has clearly been crafted with love. IMPORTANT: Get used to this game via a let's play video:

												I loved this game for a really long time. It was interesting and had a good aesthetic (and still does). The developers were really responsive to the community and released a string of free DLCs that added many new features to the game. Even the expansion, which was reasonably priced at ten dollars, was interesting and fun, although the interesting, radically different Harmony faction was permanently crippled by two very, very bad design decisions....but I digress.However, this is an example of a game that was destroyed by its updates. The final changes made to the game completely destroyed the diplomacy system and resulted in the AI repeatedly declaring wars on the player almost immediately after the player's score surpassed their own. It was a serious blow to the game's immersion factor and playability. It's not even like the wars were deadly, as it wasn't that hard on most difficulties to just endure the early sieges and produce a fleet of advanced Reaper-like dreadnoughts to wipe out the million tiny cruisers the AI would throw at you. Simply put: it turned Endless Space into a sci-fi version of the Total War games.This was a great game; it's still a decent one, but I would not recommend buying it now. If you want a good 4X game, either buy Endless Legend, a much better game by the same company, or wait for Endless Space 2.			"

												Simple Answer -Even if after 100 hours you find yourself hating this game, the first 75 hours are totally worth it.Simple Advice -Buy when on sale (Happens often enough) and make sure to get Disharmony.Supplemental to Answer -I dislike the AI amplitude uses. Trying to predict how they will behave is annoying. However, if you play with a friend then the two of you can explore and learn at the same time. After about 30 hours you will have figured out the majority of the game and how you are suppose to build. (Hint: Same theme in Endless Legend). All in all I could not say I love the game, but I can say that for the price tag, it provides plenty of entertainment.Supplemental to Advice -The DLC makes the game complete in terms of play style. Without the DLC planetary invasion feels lacking. I would also recommend you ignore the game's rating on difficulty. Just start on easy (or less if you are new to 4x Games). After you learn the mechanics move one tear up at a time. I made the mistake of starting on normal and expecting this game to be as easy as most other games. Normal had me pulling hair out and screaming ""the game is cheating"" - which it does. >.>After I got over my ego being bruised the game smoothed out.			"

												When it shines, it's a beauty, but when it stinks, it kills everything good about it.I want to like this game. It has that ""one more turn"" factor. Visually it's well done, and the UI is pretty clever with most complex orders only a few mouse clicks away. But then you find reordering production queues to be unusually clumsy. Most of the game is like that. A few solid hits then a terrible miss. [Queues have been improved in a recent update]The races are good, well designed and presented, each with their own strengths and each requiring a slightly different set of priorities to succed. But then the difficulty modifiers kick in and the whole race balance goes out the window. Enemy AIs get bonuses to production NOT intelligence and you fight races that can outperform what you could do with them.Then the AI itself shows irreconcilable stupidity. If i could tolerate 6-7 dumb things the AI does per turn, it would do 10. All too often the AI fleets that could potentially beat you choose to flee (but waste your time, attack, or leave ships behind that blockade you), while i have had one completely unarmed and undefended fleet of invasion ships try to fight back (with tactics, not weapons ofc) and even somehow managed to flee with a few survivors. [AI stupidity has also been adressed with updates]The AI can sometimes use tactics wisely and from what i saw has no knowledge of your own tactical choices, but the battles are a lottery decided far far ahead, back when you designed the ships. Some survive, some have no chance, and if your ships are very good, then AI will either allways retreat, or allways die, depending on whose territory you're fighting in. Sometimes the very outcome of a war or even game can hinge on the AI doing something remarkably stupid or you failing to understand some of the BASIC fundamental rules of the game. That... is beyond bad, that is awful.The diplomacy model is one of the better i have seen. Most of it is really good, except of course the one part that kills it completely. It's all meaningless because ultimately your empire exists and therefore it would be better for a rival to take it all away from you. You're the weakest empire? Then die. Wait, you're strongest? Then die. You're in the middle, and a long term trading partner as well as supplier of strategic resources, benefits that far outweigh the problems caused by close borders (and you can see the exact numbers too)? Guess what? Today is the day none of that means anything. Prepare to set the relationship score to -200. And die.Colonisation and expansion is arguably the strongest part of the game. Exploring the galaxy, triggering some halfhearted random events, scouting good spots for colonies. First contants. All good. But. The game actively penalises you for each and every system you own. Wheter you colonise it or capture it, just having a system increases the penalty higher and higher. Eventually it becomes high enough that it starts to hurt morale and that in turn drops production, research and cash flow. Yes, by colonising a system at a wrong moment, you can drop overall empire wide production by some 10-20%. Does that make any sense?Yes, there are technologies that reduce the penalty, and yes, it's there to counterbalanc expansion but i am here to play a game, be emperor of space, not to oversee active game modifiers. They should be invisible and subtle, not hit me in the head. When i deliberatly skip average systems that are still well positioned, all just to avoid getting the expansion penalty down the road, i think i am playing a flawed game.Combat is neither good nor bad except when it's completely illogical. Designing the ships properly takes some experience and knowledge and if you do a good job your fleet will usually serve you well and survive for a long time or you will produce enough replacements for losses to not matter much. The main problem with all the tactical options, counters, different ranges, weapon optimisations, support ships, repair capacity, fighter/bomber cover, is that you very often feel like you just can't take your ships and tell them to ""$#%^&* go and kill the enemy!"", the MOST BASIC OF PURPOSES for your fleet, but somehow it gets lost in the myriad different things you have to tweak before you can fight. Long story short, i know what i want, the game wont let me, or i have to obey some rule/design feature/balance mechanic.So while it starts pretty well, and has enough to be fun for a while, it eventually becomes a chore to try to complete a game. The AI has too many choices to make and inevitably it makes poor decisions (compare to SOTS' very basic but lethal AI) and all the strengths of the game are drowned out by the weaknesses.The best turn based space 4X games have already been made. Master of Orion 2 and Sword of the Stars 1. Maybe even Birth of the Federation, though i am biased about that one. Other games of the genre try to do things differently which is unfortunate because sometimes imitation is the wisest form of flattery. Case in point: Xenonauts. For ages developers tried to recreate the perfect succesor to XCOM - UFO Defense. UFO: Aftershock is 99% as good, and UFO: Alien Invasion is an extremly good remake (but still unfinished). A slew of other games missed the mark completely or admittedly used the old game as a springboard for a new experience. Then Xenonauts imitated the original and surprise, surprise, it hit the bullseye.Ultimatly Endless Space isn't solid enough to satisfy demanding 4x players, and it isn't ""mainstream"" enough to captivate the casual audience. So it ends up in between. Better than most, but not good enough.EDIT - 20 Dec. 2014Some of the complaints i've ♥♥♥♥♥ed about have been adressed by several patches released since this review. Production queues and enemy retreat logic have been adressed. Better late than never? Or thumbs up for devs supporting their game well after release? Both pretty much, and the game can't be hurt by extra polish & fixes.I will not change my verdict, but i will say it's still a game i would like to like. Probably more so than before with the recent updates.If you're sitting on the fence know that you will probably enjoy exploring the game if you choose to buy it. Exploration and expansion are strong suits of Endless Space. It's just that ultimately i felt dissapointed with what i found, but have to admit it was fun exploring.			"

												For any fan of Sci-Fi, Space Opera or just enthusiast of space Endless Space is a real treat of a game to pick up. The visual style of the game is simplified but it works extremely well for the game and it has a really appealing design which is gentle for eyes. Especially the space and the stars look just gorgeous. The music enhances the feeling of being in space well and it is one of my favorite soundtracks ever.The gameplay is the usual for any 4X game but it's very well polished making it one of the better ones. In Endless Space you pick a race to conquer the galaxy through diplomacy, science, military, colonization or economy. In combat you get to control fleets and command them in 3 phased battles that involves long, mid and close range combat. You get to choose a special command for each of these phases via a card system that functions like a rock paper scissors game. The battle system is easy to grasp but it has good amount of depth into it once you research more of these cards.Still depending on your skill level with 4X games Endless Space might not be the most hardcore game out there, but for someone who casually enjoys the more popular ones such as Civ 5 it's a fun game to play and offers a good amount of challenge.Also the effort put into creating the endless universe seems quite passionate and it is an interesting one to digest more into! (Amplitude Studios are even making other game series based on the same universe). All of the races have their unique flavor and it's easy to pick your favorite one out of them.			"

												This was my first indie game purchased.  As a fan of 4x strategy games they all look good to me but few live up to my standard.  This game has so much potential for and indie game and I really do look forward to an endless space 2 hopefully someday.  The complexity of it almost mind blowing.  The space battles between ships go 3D instead of the normal 4x game battles like the the most popular of all times Sid Miers Civilization.  The background story of the Endless Space Universe is fantastic.  The play between the factions is a little lackluster.  And the game leaves you wanting more of an in depth feel on the solar systems and planets.  But it is an Indie game and once you play you will see a few game play enhancements would be nice.  But the Universe is so expansive the technology tree is enormous.  The tech tree is broke down into four sections military, science, exploration, and economics.  If you research into exploration you might be able to build on any planet but it doesn't do you an good if you can't defend yourself.  If you go all science doesn't help if you can build the greatest advancements if you can't afford them because economy is weak.  That’s why I love 4x games and the seven ways to win expansion, scientific, economic, diplomatic, supremacy, and wonder .  And I all most forgot about  the ship builder I’ve lost myself for hours just building your very own customized ship. The disharmony DLC added some nice features and I look forward to more DLC's.  I could go forever on why you should buy this game.  I give this game my highest recommendation the Nifty stamp of approval.			"

I really do like 4x games and this one started rough (I mean it was all but unplayable) but with the continual development and improvement pumped into it by the publisher it's gotten to be quite decent. It's definitely mature and I haven't had a crash in a long time. I see they're taking what they learned from this development experience and making a new game in the series.  Looking forward to that one and if you're looking for a time killer with a lot of playability, well then this is it. A great buy.			"

Overall infoEnjoyable and fun game experience. Can be a little frustrating at the beginning but once you get into it will consume you. Lore of the game is  really interesting , races are well designed and unique. AI isn't that great, even if its you best friend he will probably attack you becouse 1) you have a higher score than him 2) he has no room to expand. So yeah diplomatic is kinda hard in this game, one of the most difficult victories to achieve.There is also a supremacy ( aka conquest homeworlds ) , expansion ( own 3/4 of galaxy )  and wonder victory. So I suggest cooping with a friend becouse its always more fun. Games lenght depends on your map settings, they can last few hours or even days. There is lots of customization when it comes to the galaxy settings, like shape , size , ammount of planets and their size, events etc.Races are also great. There is a race that devours worlds so they need to expand if they want keep their strenghts up, pacifist robots , religious robots , various humans sub-factions, et's , some kind of samurai aliens and finally my fav race Harmony. Race made of living crystal that wants to purge galaxy of dust ( aka gold, game income ).There is also an option to modify current races and select different traits for them, its a fully customizable.Soundtrack is amazing, really enjoyable to listen.Flaws~~What are the minuses ?AI cheats a little , how is that possible that he can manage so many fleets and still have a decent income.Combat system is unbalanced. Kinetics op - even when they were designed for close combat they deal sick dmg at LONG range, just go full kinetics and every game is won.Bomber units are useless. UI could be a bit better. Becouse later in the game micromanaging your entire galaxy gets a bit annoying, yes there is an AI governor to help with that but that isn't always a good option to choose.And many other small things that you will probably get annoyed by them and you will think ""what the heck devs where thinking"".So yeah , its worth a money especialy when its on the sale. Buy it together with the Disharmony DLC becouse it adds lots of new stuff and overall gives a better player experience than vanilla.			"

												This is what happens when people get used to overpriced games. They see a good game for $1 and start getting suspicious. Endless Space is not the typical type of indie greenlight game trash that floats all over steam. It's a good well-developed game. Also, I hate all that ""for $1 anything is good lol"" reviews. So I decided to make a review myself. The game isn't perfect. ES may be not the right choice for a newcomer to the 4x genre. It is very rough on edges and lacks proper tutorial.Some tips for beginners.1. Beware of pirates and random events. Events mostly negative and can be very harsh. Both can be disabled in game settings.2. AI cheats on all difficulties starting from normal, and it likes to spam ships. Be prepared for war. However, unlike Total War series, here the AI is not so prone to backstab you. You will probably see when and why if it gets pissy.3. LR kinetics rules.4. For me, the most complicated thing to start with this game was a tech tree. It took me hours to figure what the final goals of my research should be. But then I just gave up and started to pick from those technologies which I could research at the moment and which would be most useful as of right now.5. ""The lines to the new systems looked wavy and I didn't know which research would let me pass it.""Those are wormholes. The game didn't explain it well. But you need to unlock Applied Casimir Effect tech from the Exploration&Expansion tech branch.Overall I rate this game as a solid but average 4x strategy with its lowest in simplistic combat, rudimentary diplomacy.

												maybe its not the greatest 4x game ever made but its got alot to offer aslong as you not hung up on being every ones friend from start to finish . many options at your disposal to upgrade systems to be more productive and be able to fend off invaders aswell as a nice system to allow the player to form a aliance with the ai controlled factions . its not civ5 but its not trying to be . be warned if you have pirates turned on they will show up at the worst times when your stuck fending off a nemey or taking over systems to distract you			"

												So, this game is on sale for 1€ right now. I'm not really a fan of space sims or space strategy games, so it was one of those ""It looks nice, maybe I'll try it out some day""-games I'll never play after buying. But for some reason I spontanously decided to download the game and give it a try right away. And I'm wondering how many great games I've missed with my attitude.Honestly, I'm surprised. Basically, I only played two turn-based strategy games throroughly in my life: The addictive Civilization 5 and Medieval 2: Total War.Endless Space is like a more complicated Civ 5 with some Total War elements in space. But it still has its own touch.Initially, I wanted to go into details concercing my last statement - but considering that I've only played it for 3 hours so far (until I lost my first game on easy difficulty lol), I figured that you should probably pay more attention to other reviews.Let me just emphasize:For 1€ this is a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good deal. I'd actually say it's way too good of a deal. If you like turn-based strategy, grab it and fall in love. If you missed the sale, give it a try anyway! And if you never played turn-based strategy before, this is the perfect opportunity.			"

												this game reminds so much of Isaac Asimov's novels. Once I had two separate colonies at the far ends of the galaxy that eventually became 2 separate empires, like in the Foundation saga. so cool.PROS:- every decision counts, but errors are not irreparable.- awsome ship design system, you have to keep you fleets up to date, man.- many ways to win- long games (might be a con for you)- high replayabily value, you could play it endlesslyCONS- micromanaging 20 systems can be a pain sometimes- no real surveying/intelligence system...like I would like to scout enemy fleets and systems, but I can't until I engage or conquer- the learning curve is a bit steep, but that might be a pro for you- endless space 2 is coming out!- sometimes the AI does dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥ but at higher difficulties it gets pretty strong.super cool game, would racomend it...it's kinda relaxing sometimes. endless/10			"

												Endless Space is a lovely looking 4X game, but has a number of strategic flaws which, while adding elements to gameplay, don't make sense (and hence, break suspension of disbelief), and don't work in an entertaining manner.Economy is well abstracted, and there are lots of options for expanding your economic foundations, but there are some factors which are largely out of direct player control -- population happiness is one of them.  Happiness affects everything, as in most 4X games, but unlike other 4X games, you don't seem to be able to invest much into helping your populace be happy (commenters claim this ability is merely hidden along particular tech tree paths, which seems restrictive -- do you have to choose those paths to succeed?).  Wars, in particular, make your people unhappy -- to the extent where an aggressive military playing style is basically out of the question.  The game's design limits the options for the ""kind"" of player you want to be -- you basically must play by the rigid set of rules the developer has laid down, or you are penalized to the point where you simply cannot beat even the normal AI.  Wars must be routinely tempered with diplomacy, and expansion must be limited during growth periods... or your expansion will fail, no matter how large your military, economy, etc.  Conquering opposing races is almost out of the question, unless it is done over a protracted period.  DIfferent races have different features, in this regard, but the trouble with such a setup is that your playstyle is largely known from the outset, by every other player in the game.  This basically boils down to a rock-paper-scissors ""you chose your strategy, now live with it"" game that is largely decided before the game starts.Space combat is visually spectacular, and has some interesting tactical twists, in the form of a rock-paper-scissors tactic system.  Ship design, is fairly involved, even though weapons basically boil down to 3 types, with levels 1 throgh 5.  Ship designs can vary the amount of weaponry and defenses they have, but the game often boils down to something of a ""who researched the right techs vs the other guy"" fight, yielding a boring, balanced research mechanism as the most effective in basically any game, unless you know your opponent is researching rocks, papers, or scissors in particular.The most severe issue with space combat, however, is that fleet size is limited by elements of the tech tree.  You can build a fleet of 50 cruisers, but can't put more than 1-2 in a fleet, plus a couple destroyers/corvettes, without researching the right aspects of the tech tree, and even then, the numbers are quite limtied.  Thus, an economically superior empire cannot necessarily win with sheer numbers, as each fleet engagement is limited by the number of possible ships in the fleet -- a small empire, with a fleet of 9-13 ships, with a similarly hard-to-come-by ""hero"" admiral (also limited to a very small number, unless you increase the number with tech), could conceivably defeat an armada of 50+ ships of the same technology level, based upon these nonsensical fleet-size limitations.  As such, increasing your effective fleet size is nearly the most important aspect of space combat, all by itself.  This enforces military balance between empires of radically different military sizes and capacities, effectively making large-fleet empires which rely primarily upon exploitation a weak approach, compared to empires which favor other 4X techniques. I would argue that the limitation is so restrictive, as to diminish strategic & economic options to the point of boredom.  No zerging, due to small fleet sizes.  No concentrated attacks.  Ship design heavily favors quality over quantity/inexpensive, etc.  Your opponents will be exactly the same as you, unless they're looking to lose through neglect of a balanced approach.The inclusion of ""heroes"" in interesting, except that you are limited to a very small number of them.  It is nowhere near as easy to acquire, or utilize a hero in ES, as it is in a game like, for example, Heroes of Might and Magic.  You may have 1-2 heroes that are ""Admirals"" typically (the rest are typically governors of single star systems), but those heroes may not command any more vessels than are allowed by the fleet size limitation.  Thus, the benefit to a hero in a small empire is much larger than that of a hero in a large one -- and large empires can be easily overwhelmed by a sum of smaller nations, simply due to the number of heroes involved, and the fleet size restrictions.  Even 2 vs 1 can be almost impossible odds under these conditions, and the happiness issues with warfare.Diplomacy is limited in much the same fashion as combat is -- by options in the tech tree.  A player cannot even offer a peace treaty without researching the idea, first.  Thus, much of the diplomacy of a game is hidden until the mid-way point of a game, and even then its fairly limited.WIth all these important techniques locked up, via the tech tree at the beginning of each game, the tech tree seems reminiscient of a ""tutorial"" system, that locks down interesting aspects of the game in literally every game you ever play.  Since many of these options are fundamental to basic gameplay, as expected in most 4X games, your traversal through the tech tree is pretty much forced to visit these nodes each time... or you lose.  The nodes are spread out amongst the branches of the tree, and neglecting any of them seems like a typically fatal flaw... thus balance, balance, balance, at all times.Endless Space boils down to an exercise in walking down the middle of the road.  Straying too far in any direction is just an expensive diversion, and won't work against the AI, or in any interesting MP game.  No blitzkriegs, surprise attacks, radical technology developments, or diverse battle tactics allowed.			"

												This review uses date I've gathered from the Disharmony DLC________________________________________________________________________________Endless Space is a game by AMPLITUDE Studios were you start as an empire in space with a single planet, and your goals are either to become the strongest nation and conquer everything, become scientifically advanced that you reach the Endless stage and win, or colonize a ton of the galaxy so no one else has a chance. This game requires a ton of thought. I'm going to put it plainly, it really does require a large amount of thought with it, but let's not start the review there. Let's start at the learning curve, and the fact that if you were to graph it that it would be a steep climb, then a flat line. When you first start the game, you don't get a tutorial, all you get is tool tips. These wont help you any because they barely explain anything at all so it will take you, depending on the type of gamer you are, anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours. This can push a few people away, but after you get past that you will love the game for what it is possibly. Key word being possibly. +6 Rating________________________________________________________________________________Lets move on to the games factions. There are several factions in game that you can play as, or if you get Disharmony you can create your own faction. These factions are; United Empire, Sophons, Hissho, Amoeba, Cravers, Horatio, Sowers, Pilgrims, Sheredyn, Automatons, and Harmony.The United Empire is a faction that just loves to expand and attack the weaker. They love to expand, but they don't expand quickly. If you're playing against them I would recommend you quickly grab your border systems so that they can't push in. U.E. can gather a military at a moderate place, but doesn't have the strongest military. The U.E. gets its military from its economy, and the economy from its colonies so if you want to destroy them quickly, don't allow them the colonies they want. If the U.E. sees a faction weaker than it that has a small military, and it doesn't think it would be able to defend itself well they will attack so be prepared.The Sophons are a scientific faction that prefers Isolation unlike the U.E. counterparts. If you play as a nation that focuses almost entirely on your military you should make these people part of your alliance as they will give you some things they research for your dust. The Hissho are a big problem when it comes to military as they don't like anyone most of the time. The Hissho will have a strong military that will become a pest if you don't try to get rid of it quickly, but they do research slowly. If you play a scientific nation become allies with these people. They will protect you for what you research.The Amoeba are a faction of peace, but they colonize extremely quickly. Their people are happier whenever they are at peace with a faction, or a few factions. The Amoeba can quickly gather the Dust to prepare for war. If you are in need of dust, make sure you're on these guys good side, as they are very nice about giving it to you if you are.The Cravers are a war monging, money hogging, system conquering faction. They are fun to play as, but they can not be in any alliances. Period. Don't even try to be nice with them.The Horatio like to expand, and go to war when it comes to defense, or if they feel provoked. There isn't much to be said about them besides what I just said here.The Sowers are an odd nation to say the least. They are a machine race that will either build a wonder to victory, or just attempt to conquer everyone else. This is literally all I can say for them until I get a better notice of how they play.The Pilgrims are like the Horatio, and like to expand. They are a bit more like America in a sense though, they can be a bit unpredictable in some games as they have a good research rate, a good military, and a good ability to colonize systems. With all of this though comes the odd economy, it's definitely an interesting faction to play as, or with.The Sheredyn is very likely to make an alliance with the United Empire, as according to lore they were at first the United Empires body guards for the Emporer. They are a very strong nation for military as they make it impossible for an enemy to retreat. They also have a pretty good economy at times. This is possibly one of the easiest factions to play as, but one of the harder ones to play against. That is my own opinion though.The Automatons are a nation of building. Just building. They can do a weird resource gather thing if they aren't building anything, and if something large comes along to build that would take any other nation about 10-15 Turns the Automatons can likely do it 5-10 turns. This also gives them the ability to spam ships out sometimes.Lastly the Harmony. They don't have an economy, and can populate systems rather quickly. They don't believe in using money because it can supossedly corrupt them. This means if you want to build anything you can't buy it out. Ever. They require patience when it comes to military. Calling them odd is the nicest thing to say as I could go even farther than calling the ""Exuberantly weird"" +15 Rating________________________________________________________________________________The game has smooth gameplay, and some good graphics that you probably wont be paying much attention to whenever you're having your fleets of ships fire lazers, missiles, and more at your enemies while they hold of the enemies own attacks with shields.The battles in this game are basically exactly what I said above, except you pick an attack for them to do, a formation, and how you want them to attack, then you just watch. You can't control them in battle past this point.Colonizing systems is pretty simple to do with easy mechanics behind it. All you do is build a colony ship, send it to a system you want, tell it to colonize and bam! You got a new system!The alliances work as simply as this. Research the Alliances technology, bring up your approval rating with another faction, ask them to join. They can decide whether to join or not, and whether they do or not is simple as that. +9 Rating________________________________________________________________________________There are several different ways to win one of the games you play.Conquer the galaxy, own 75% of the galaxy, research the highest technology, build a certain wonder, or get a ton of money. These are all self explanatory, and give you several different ways to play the game giving ""Play the way you want"" a true meaning. +8 Rating________________________________________________________________________________The only way you're going to be able to play multiplayer is if you have some friends that own the game, the community is basically dead due to a ""Chicken had to lay the egg, but the egg had to hatch the chicken"" kind of thing. People say there's no multiplayer sometimes, so some people don't get it. There's no multiplayer because people don't get the game. +3 Rating________________________________________________________________________________With all of this being said I think that I'll end the review here ending with a Rating Score of 41 out of 50. If you ask me the game is great, and a very enjoyable game. That's just One Gamers Opinion though.			"

												Endless space.  Well it definitely seems endless until some random AI or player appears out of the blue with tech that would take you 80 turns to catch up to. Like another reviewer wrote it is an excersize in walking down the middle of the road, straying too far one direction or another leads to punishment.So lets break it downPro's -Graphically better than average-Very long scenarios (if thats your thing)-Tons of tech paths-Customizable balanced races-Potentially huge universeCons- While tons of options exist, viable strategies are severly limited- Tech extremes (either you dominate vs enemy tech or you get completely destroyed)- Zero forgiveness / ability to react to enemy tech - by the time you know its way to late- Extremely long build up for a rapid end game desicion win or loseMany games will end up 300 turns in with you dominating by teching one or two directions just to have the game end in the next 20 turns when you come against another that has teched to your weakness, it is merciless and gives no method of comeback.Even if you continue to dominate non stop the game takes for ever. It becomes an effort in picking every weed from the proverbial garden chasind down every last fleet and spending turn after turn invading planets with you puny limited fleet. Fleet size limiters basically strangle you throughout the game and create a near singular military tactic.  Attack every system all at the same time.  There is no ability to focus because your fleet size is obscenely limited and each fleet fights solo 1v1 then the next, and the next etc.So much is not explained in this game, it lacks detailed tools to let you know exactly how things/tech will effect your empire making it difficult to plan without using a wiki or having only a vague idea of how something will effect your empire.I really wanted this to be the next big 4x but sadly I have to not reccomend it as there are definitely better ones out there.""Endless Space's combat system had more the feel of a pokemon card game where I play my engineering card in hopes to counter your sabatoge card while we watch a quant little cinimatic in the background - pewpew...""

Review: Endless Space""Come, my friends,'Tis not too late to seek a newer world. . . .To sail beyond the sunset, and the bathsOf all the western stars, until I die."" Alfred Lord TennysonThe universe with it’s endless amounts of galaxies, stars and planets was born out of what we call “the big bang”. It took billions of years before the first life was given and further billions for the new rulers of space to conquer every star they could reach: The Endless. They traveled through wormholes, became masters of time and space, built outstanding monuments and structures and oppressed every lifeform that stood in their way, all with the help of a special gift called dust. The only ones who could make them fall were the Endless themselves with inner conflicts and arrogance. Millions of years later other empires arose from the stars. The Endless were gone but their technology, wisdom and Dust is still there, waiting for new conquerors. Which faction will dominate the others with science, war and dust? Hopefully yours. ----------It all starts with your chosen nation. May it the aggressive bird-like Hissho, the mechanical Automatons or the old human Imperials, they all come with positive and negative aspects that fit differing playstyles. Colonizing your first planet afterwards can be a tough choice. Planets differ and thus do the resources they produce. What you should keep in mind here is FIDS, standing for Food, Industry, Dust and Science. Basically, these four get your planets populated and fed, build ships and structures, offer the possibility for doing research and pay your running costs for ships, planetary improvements and heroes. Improvements can be portals for faster travel, refineries or habitats, just to name some out of a huge amount ES offers. Heroes are specialized commanders who can be attached to starsystems and fleets to further improve certain aspects like production or offense. They get XP, level-up and cost more while doing so. Better ships and improvements need more research and cost more Dust. See, it is the well known cycle you have to bear with. What makes it even more difficult sometimes are random events that can be a blessing but also a plague for the whole empire. Having established yourself, there is room for more difficult tasks. First, acceptance. Planets, taxes and other effects influence your nation’s happiness. The higher the taxes, the higher the dust outcome. But who wants to pay taxes? People will likely start to get lazy and work less. It works the other way around too. Less taxes, more resources. Next task: luxury ressources. Once your scientists know how to deal with them, you gain the opportunity to build better ships, planetary improvements and use them as trading goods. Trading leads us to task 3, diplomacy. Venturing into the unknown will make you meet new friends. Or Foes. Fight or feed them? Living in peace means building trade routes for dust and science, luxury resources and even full researches. An alliance keeps your back when war is raging against You. But why even trading when there is the chance to OWN your friends starsystems? --------Talking about war makes it necessary to talk about the combat system. Since the whole game uses a  turn based system you might expect this happening for combat, too. It somewhat has “turns” but once your fleet started the battle, there is no way to stop nor influence it. Every battle is divided into 5 phases, were these are again divided into turns. Roughly Explained:  Remember turns as a term that got used in Baldur’s Gate where attacks and effects were happening in a specific amount of time? Take this, mix it with scissor-rock-papers referring to bullets, lasers and rockets and their defensive counterparts and add some tactical influence via abilities, used as “cards” ingame. These cards have to be chosen before the battle starts, thus forcing you to have a close look at your opponent. If you like battles à la Sins of a Solar Empire you will get disappointed. Fights in general last about 1 min if you choose to watch them and tend to look repetitive after a while. Still: Choosing the right weapons and armour can make your fleet win against even way stronger contenders.   --------Let’s have a look at graphics and sound. Whilst the tactical overview tends to look spartanic, does a zoom make this game shine. Planets, Moons, Stars, everything looks nice and realistic and every faction looks unique in terms of ships. Although battles aren’t the most exciting part of the game, they still do have some nice explosions and fleet animations to offer. The UI can be overwhelming at the start but having played for 2-3 hours I already felt myself at home. To those complaining about it in other reviews: There is a tutorial that nicely shows and explains everything. My recommendation here: Take your time, read carefully. It is turn-based. The soundtrack fits just perfectly into the setting of an unknown and unexplored galaxy. Sometimes thrilling, most of the time relaxing, I never stopped it while playing for hours.-------Story? Lore! It is everywhere in this game and it needs to be mentioned here. Every planet, every ship, research, hero, resource...every single fact comes with a nice and well written explanation and makes this game shine. Most of the facts are fictional though but still written in such a reasonable manner that one might want to look up a lexicon. Keep in mind: There is no single-player campaign, yet there is enough content to fill hundreds of hours if you choose to play every different faction. Everything happens in scenarios that can be set up before starting, like choosing difficulty, number of AIs, nations, single- or multiplayer. Multiplayer feels great and allows players from all over the world to play without having any ping-loss - the advantage of a turn-based game. Big Text, Quick Facts:ProTurn-Based 4x at it`s best - gotta manage them all!Various factions to choose from, each with their own unique background storyDozens of different planets, ships, researches, heroes and random eventsWonderful graphics that show details on ships, planets and star systemsSatisfying diplomacy and tradingRich fictional yet reasonable setting full of lore and textMultiplayer allows to form alliances with - or against - your friendsChilling SoundtrackCon:Overwhelming start (Hint: Read the Tutorial!)Combat feels short, uncontrolled, even luck-depending sometimes and once you found the right answer for enemy ships, they are meatNo single-player campaignSummary:Endless Space. A game that uses the 4x in its description, roughly translated as explore, expand, exploit and for the sake of all: exterminate. Resource management, diplomacy, research and war, perfectly arranged for turn-based strategists who love to play at their own pace whilst planning for future turns. One can not ignore that combat lacks the thrill other space strategy titles offer in exchange for strategical choices but graphics, depth and lore is what compensates and entertains for hours.  My personal verdict is 9.25 / 10			"

												This game is like an attractive girl with some very bad habits and/or attitudes. I tried to love this game, I tried to overlook the bugs, but I can't, they are too obvious. It is a good game, but sometimes, I cannot tell if some of the stuff they have are supposed to be features or bugs. For example, enemies can move during MY turn. If I wanted my enemies to move at the same time as me, I would go back to Sins of a Solar Empire.BugsAnother frustrating thing is that my main fleet was trapped in a star system for X amount of turns because the AI, for whatever reason, decided to send 10 individual ships to that same system and set them on blockade mode. I can only kill 1 at a time so the chances of that fleet leaving on its own was close to zero, unless I mount a rescue.DiplomacyThe diplomacy is broken beyond believe. AIs often offer star systems and resources as part of their Cease Fire agreements. However, these agreements would be undone next turn, because the systems they surrendered contain the same resources in the agreement, so they have no more resources to pay me. Another thing that is annoying is that I do not understand why ""create alliance"", ""cease fire"" and such needed to be researched. When someone is beating your @$$, you would instinctively yell 'stop', not to these advance space beings apparently.TutorialThe tutorial is inadequate at best. After going through the whole tutorial, I still don't grasp the important points of the game such as battles and ship designs until I googled them. I figured the rest out because of my past experience with Alpha Centauri and Civ.AIThe AIs are dumb and overly aggressive. By 20-30 turns, my closest neighbour declared war on me for absolutely no reason at all. At least in AC or Civ, they would give you some sort of warning, but not Endless Space! It will f--k you when it feels like f--king you up, regardless of their capabilities. And they refuse to make peace when they just lost all their ships. Based on my reading on multiplayers, it seems that it is buggy as hell online as well. So this game doesn't have much going for it, since you can't play with the AIs and you can't play with other people.DifficultyIn Civ V, they have a nice range of difficulties, ranging from settler to deity (8 levels). In ES, they have something similar too. However, the problem is that the gaps between each is as wide as the Grand Canyon. Say, ES's normal is like Civ's Chieftain or Warlord, its hard mode is like Deity. So either the game is too easy for you to learn from, or it is so hard that you just can't survive past the 100th turn. I was either bored or frustrated.ResearchRegardless of your fraction, you almost always research the same techs every time. Colonize planets, Enhances weapons, Make ships bigger, Enhances more weapons, Make ships even bigger, with the occasional resource unlocking, incoming increasing, happiness inducing tech here and there.Victory WarningWhile I appreciate the game for telling me that the AIs are winning, it doesn't need to start reminding me when they are only 10-20% complete toward certain victories. A even more ridiculous example is when I am at 60% completion, they warn me of this AI who is close to winning the game at 20%. Very helpful indeed.ConclusionI paid around $15 in Nov of 2013 for both Endless Space and Disharmony. I want my money back and I am trying to save yours here. This game is great in the sense that it is like Alpha Centauri but on a galactic scale. It's like Civ 5 with levelable heroes. The management/production system is nice. But everything else is not. The concept is great but it is very poorly executed or maintained (based on my investigation, a lot of bugs seemed to stem from Disharmony).I have uninstalled this game after close to 100hours of play and it will take a major cleansing for me to reinstall it and give it another go. This game as it stands is worth $5 at best, anymore, you are getting ripped off. Spend your money elsewhere. Thanks for reading.Update/SalesJun.25, 2014 - currently at $7.49USD (75% off). Best discount I have seen since I bought the game. If this game interests you and you don't mind the bugs/features, then GO FOR IT quick. It is a good price.			"

												A ""true"" 4x sci-fi strategy title with a big focus on empire building providing all the tools to sink massive amounts of time into micro-managing and min-maxing of your systems.The start can be pretty hash on newcomers, the tutorial is rudimentary at best, there is no introducing single-player campaign like in other titles. Your best bet is to take your time and read the tooltips carefully. Almost EVERYTHING in the game has a tooltip of its own providing basic information and stats you can call on. If somethings unclear dont hesitate to try out stuff. Usually stuff ""clicks"" after a few turns.The Ai follows the same rules as the human player but will receive bonuses to all kind of things depending on the difficulty level you select. Thats why I always suggest ""newbie"" or ""easy"" difficulty....no matter if you are a 4x veteran or not, those are the best difficulties to learn the ropes of the game.Make sure to check out map and advanced settings to create matches of your likingYour biggest priority at first will most likely be warfare. Be advised that Endless Space supports all kinds of different playstyles which can lead to victory. Pure defensive empires focusing on research and trade, warmongers crushing everything in their paths, scientists dominating the technological aspect, empire focus races growing like cancer (sorry for the pun) etc etc. I tried out so many different combinations already and I STILL find new ones I can enjoy and which challenge me in a different way.You will always play maps versus 1-7 opponents and while the goal is always the same (dominate your oppponents and ""win"" the match) HOW you can achieve this varies drastically. Thats the replay factor which enabled me to pump so many hours into this game.Very polished UI and some of the best visuals for the genre make it stand out for me. The combat cinematics especially are able to entrance me. Immersion factor for me.....skyhigh.There are so many factors in the game (planets, anomalies, technologies, diplomatic status and effects, invasions, ship designs, battle card system, traits, heroes etc etc) that it might take a while to find your way but its a very rewarding path. Once you understand and see certain synergies you wont notice how time flies pastIn my experience the game runs very stable and the errors popping up can be easily fixed with a reload (which doesnt take long). Multiplayer matches do suffer from desynch errors frequently tho. That being said I consider it a single-player title.Endless Space might not be ""the best"" in any ONE department (AI, diplomacy, combat, infrastructure) but the combination/package of all things makes it THE best sci-fi 4x title for me personally.....highly recommended for the low prize.

												I like this game, it was considerably worse at launch than it is now.  The devs have made sincere efforts to improve and some of them have paid off.  The critics reviews at launch don't really reflect the game now.  It's probably closer to an 85 with the changes and additions the devs have made.  If you like the wide campaign part of strategy games you'll probably like it, but if you're interested in the battles you'll likely be disappiointed.  The map/campaign is great fun and very sleek, but the battles are basically a crapshoot.  You get 3 turns, a variety of abilities to use each turn, and they have a rock paper scissors quality.  Space battles are fun to look at, but it gets tedious and I find myself skipping through them.Overall, it's worth picking up.			"

												After endless (pun intended ;-) ) years searching of a game that would be better than Master of Orion 2, I came to a conclusion, that there is none. However other space strategies can be fun on their own merits and ES is one of them (but get the DLC, cause it makes the game a lot better).The good stuff:- good automation of colony management (needed in late game)- enforced keeping of diplomacy treaties (""let's call cease fire, but gimme those 5 techs, 1 turn later, haha I changed my mind & I'll kill you anyway"" - this doesn't work here)- interesting background lore and story- good variety of races (12), some quite unique- big tech tree- waging war costs money (literally, doing battle actions costs game cash, which has an interesting effect on strategy)- pretty good AI opponents (they have problems with taking over systems on the lower skill levels though)The bad stuff:- lack of tactical battles (the DLC gives some nice new options for battles, but still they are very non-interactive)- quite small array of ship design options (e.g. a ship can have only 1 of each kinetic, beam and missile weapons in 1 configuration each, can't have 2 different beam weapons)- espionage doesn't exist (I think)- not everything is covered by tutorial and the game manual- rarely some bugs show upOverall, a good game, worth playing.

												Since I cannot be bothered to write out a full review for games now, Ill try my best to condense the review into a few lines.Great little turn-based strategy game, that is a whole metric tonne of fun. A single game will often last hours on end, especially if you play with friends over the multiplayer aspect. You can do whatever you wish, kill your enemies, buy them pretty much, culturally assimilate them, become the cancer of galactic population, research science, explore, terraform, and create a vast endless empire of galactic fear and sovereignty.I found this game fun because the turn based aspect did not make gameplay fast paced, and twitch oriented, and where APM (actions per minute) is not a defining feature of victory. Create custom races, and play against a whole super large galaxy of people, where your choices are put to the test. So yes, I would recommend this game, especially if you have someone else to play it with.			"

												Blog Post: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2015/02/Endlessspace.htmlWhat Endless Space did right Smooth 4X gameplayEndless Space plays great with smooth 4X gameplay. it plays a lot like a Civilization game, with the player having to manage your government, your tech, your military, and foreign relations. Strategic Combat In Endless Space instead of directly controlling battles you choose your battle strategies. like EMPs, Missile Barriers, and the such. choosing the right battle strategy can help you win against even a larger fleet. Epic Thematic Battles once you've chosen your battle strategy the only thing to left to do is sit back and watch the fireworks. getting to see your epic fleet destroy (or be destroyed) is just great. Lots of factionsEndless Space features 12 factions with their own lore, game art, and space ship design. to add to that you can also create your own faction with their own traits. Custom fleetsin Endless Space you can choose what weapons and systems your ships have, this means you can make ship designs for certain purposes like planet invasion or fleet carrier.Heroesa slight RPG element to Endless Space are heroes. heroes can be assigned to systems and fleets giving bonus. they also get XP as time goes on and get better traits.What Endless Space did wrong UI is a little confusingthe Endless Space UI can be a little confusing and they don’t really do good job of explaining everything to you. AI is not too smartThe AI in Endless Space is not that smart. they will attack you even if you greatly outnumber them. also if you get a too high tech score they attack you “out of fear of your advancement” so basically they get afraid when you have enough power to beat them, so they attack you. on their own. i wish the AI would join together to take you down if they think you've gotten too powerful.

												Flawed, but still the best 4X space game since Galactic Civilizations 2.At first, I didn't like the combat much, but after playing other 4X games, I have a new appreciation for it... It is a double edged sword. The battles are simplistic and often a crapshoot, but inspecting your enemies capabilities and employing the right cards goes a long way to winning a battle, even if most of them are countered. The tactical combat also keeps the pace of the game up and helps you understand what happens if you skip manual combat. In more complex tactical battles in 4X games (e.g. Fallen Enchantress, AoW3), you never want to use auto-combat because the game will arbitrarily kill off units when you know you would never lose them in manual mode, so you end up going through the tedious process of a turned based tactical engagement in a one-sided fight just to make sure you can keep a veteran unit. Endless Space battles, while not nearly as complex, leave you the option to auto-resolve battles with confidence, which saves a lot of time while doing battles with an overpowering force - which in my experience encompass the majority of battles in 4X games. Icing on the cake; sometimes manual combat in Endless Space is worth it just because you want to actually  *see* your new fleet/commander/ship design make your enemy explode.Long and short - plenty of reviews cover the simplistic tactical combat, even though it is more complex than Civilization V. If we take the tactical combat out of the equation, Endless Space is a near-perfect 4X game. You can design ships, empire management is meticulous, and there are many ways to win. If we do add in tactical combat, I'd rather be playing Total War, but I'm not always in the mood, nor do I have that kind of time. 3π/10.			"

												This one didn't really click for me.  The expansion/colonisation parts are okay.  The initial game was interesting, expanding my reach and butting up against other empires.  But once I got into military planning and combat, things really started to fall apart.Combat is realtime and is always limited to a ""long range + medium range + melee"" three-phase system, after which it just ends, even if there are still ships alive on both sides.  As such, it can take several turns to actually wipe out a fleet, even if you dramatically outclass them.  There's also no way to use e.g. stand-off tactics that don't involve diving down into close-range combat.There's little rhyme or reason to either the AI ship designs or to the tactics they use in combat, and strategic movement is fast enough that you can easily get ambushed, so it's very difficult to plan ahead.  Even if you've already fought a particular class of ships, there's no way to see what their stats are, nor is there any sort of intelligence / spying system to see what an empire is capable of (e.g. what techs they have).Even if you could see their techs, it wouldn't really make that much of a difference.  Weapon and defense techs are really just a three-tier system with very little personality to each.  Compare this to, say, the old Master of Orion, where ship technologies were numerous and varied, there was no guarantee of getting any particular technology, and there was a tendency for an empire to focus and rely on a particular weapon type, making it easier to design against them (if you had the tech to do so).The victory conditions are also pretty wonky.  By the end of my first game, I was stomping all over the galaxy, taking over every system and controlled well over half of it.  I was notified that I was well on my way to both the expansion victory (75% of systems) and the supremacy victory (controlling all faction homeworlds).  Yet despite clearly being on the road to inevitable victory, I still lost because the other major empire happened to reach the annoyingly arbitrary economic victory, by making 720k dust over their empire's lifetime.  (Granted, you can turn each victory condition off if you don't like them, but they're all pretty arbitrary to begin with, and not individually customisable.)  There also wasn't any sort of end-game summary with graphs etc. so I could see what I could've done to stop them.The hero system is okay, but it doesn't give you very many over the course of a game.  It would also probably be a lot better if the heroes were distinctly separated into two separate pools, one for running systems and one for commanding fleets.  As it stands, you can quickly run out of skills to add to your governors — and yet the skill tree is completely hidden from you, so you often have to pick combat skills (useless for a governor) in order to get to more skills that might actually be useful to them.  The only advantage of the current system is that you can level up a planet governor by having them run a fleet or vice versa, but it doesn't seem worth all the extra mess.I may come back to this after trying some other modern space 4X games, but I doubt it.  Doesn't really give me what I want out of a 4X.			"

												I have played this game quite a lot. It's a good mix of moderate complexity with the 'Just one more turn...' pull that good 4X games strive to achieve. It recently went on sale, which has caused an influx of poor reviews from players with barely any play time on their profile. It seems to be that most of these seem to be related to the games' difficulty or perceived lack of depth - both of which are caused by a failure to read the in-game messages and/or an unfamiliarity with 4X games. Don't let that dissuade you if it's on sale - it's a bit dated, but a solid game with a long history of positive reviews.			"

												I almost never make reviews but this game became so infuriating in its current state that I have to write about it.Singeplayer is not fun anymore. The reason for this is a combination of weird AI behaviour, strange Design Decisions and newly introduced Abilities that don't work with the older mechanics at all. So I will get through it one by one:1. You can only attack with each fleet once per turn. This wasn't too bad in the earlier versions of the game. The AI enemies usually had a sensible number of fleets and your one attack per turn was enough to sensibly engage the enemy in warfare. This isn't the case anymore because:2. The AI spams fleets. Like lots of fleets. Insane amounts of them. That leads to bizare situations that the AI will have dozens of fleets in a single one of your star systems, currently invading the system. This means there is a counter and based on the Invasion strength of the enemy fleets ticking down and when it finishes the star system gets captured. Not too bad, you would say. You can simply kill the enemy fleets since their focuss on Invasion means their weapons are bad. But you can't because you can only attack once per turn. And if you have one strong fleet and the enemy has a dozen weak fleets and your star system will get captured in 6 turns, you will only be able to kill 6 of their fleets. Not enough to keep the Invasion from happening. This would be bad enough, but it gets worse because:3. Fleets can easily retreat. That means when you use your one attack to kill an enemy fleet, that fleet can just retreat granted it doesn't get killed in a single combat-turn. That means that fleet will retreat to a nearby star system and immediatly turn around on the next turn and return to the start system it was in before, clogging up the Star system with another enemy fleet, that you can't destroy BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY ATTACK ONCE PER TURN.This is stupid. You have the bizarre Situation were I have a massive Death-Fleet in Orbit of a star system, while the enemy has a few dozen tin cans floating through space in that system and I cannot keep those tin cans from conquering the entire star system because the game says I can only shoot at one tin can per year apparently. And this isn't a one-of situation. I tried about 5 different games since Disharmony and while early warfare works fine because the enemy doesn't spam fleets at that point yet, after turn 100 this situation ALWAYS occurs and it ALWAYS ruins the fun of the game. This is broken. The devs could have fixed it by just removing the ""One attack per turn""-mechanic, but they apparently don't care.			"

												I've been itching for a new space 4x game since good ol' Master of Orion 2 is getting a bit... ol'. Endless Space sounds like the prime candidate; imaginative (enough) races, customizable starships, plenty of special resources and random events... But it falls short on almost every aspect.The first problem is that I don't feel connected to anything that I'm doing. In Master of Orion 2, the planet view had all of the planet's populace was represented by tiny members of your race that you could drag from one task to another. It's strange how such a small UI feature immediately tells you that you're playing Trilarians, Psilons or Darloks. In Endless Space, there are these simple ""meeples"" that bear a striking semblance to a piece on a board game. There are no tasks. Instead, each unit of population produces an equal amount of everything, determined by the improvements in the star system. Yep. There aren't many planet-specific buildings; exploitation (which roughly means the primary focus of a planet), terraforming, moon exploration and negative anomaly elimination. Still, as far as I can tell, they go into the same system-wide production queue.The next problem is the special resources. They're not really that special. All they really do is add a bonus to one of the basic four resources (food, industry, dust and science). If you have 4 of them, you'll get an empire-wide bonus that varies from +20% industry to leader experience gains. That is the luxury resourced. Strategic resources are even less exciting. More advanced ship modules require one of the eight strategic resource. Just having one is enough, but having more lowers the cost of said module. Again, having 4 grants a bonus, but it's just a more dramatic cost reduction.Next in line is the ship design. The way combat works in Endless Space is that there are 3 types of weapons, namely kinetic, beam and missile. They can also be adjusted for 3 different ranges, long, medium and melee, but each weapon type can only be set to one range. So you can't have kinetic weapons for long and medium range, for example. The second biggest problem is there are only 4 levels of each weapon, and that's it. The same is true for all modules, mind you. Everything is just a flat numeric upgrade. To make things even more confusing, there are a few different sizes of hulls, and each seems to have 2 different designs. Why? Because, for some inexplicable reason, the devs decided that it would be a good idea to have capacity modifiers for certain types of modules, such as +25% weight for defense modules and -50% weight for weapon modules. If only you were able to choose those modifiers...But the worst part of it is how it plays out in combat. For someone who's used to thinking every fight through in Master of Orion 2, Endless Space is a nightmare. When the combat starts, you have two options; manual or automatic combat, but they really have no mechanical difference. ""Manual"" might as well be called cinematic, because it's just an animated representation of the automated combat. The only thing you can control is the maneuvers you can do at each range, long, medium and melee. At a point where most of my systems are hitting level 3 I have about 10 of them in total (though there are a few that you can research, and leaders can give some). All ranges have the same options. What makes things even more annoying is that pretty much all cards affect 3 things, and they not-so-subtly prod the player in a specific direction. So what really happens when you engage in combat is that you study the strengths and weaknesses of each fleet, choose the cards that play into your advantages and and gives the least advantage to your enemy at each range... and that's it. You can either watch the fight unfold, or skip it. Either way, you can't control anything else.It might sound tactical, but in the long (or short, if we're being completely frank) run squinting at numbers loses its luster as well. Surprisingly enough, it does feel satisfied when you beat the odds because you chose your cards wisely, but even that becomes a chore. And this shouldn't even be a complaint, but the enemy learns from its mistakes, and to play into the weaknesses of a consistent strategy. So basically you have to scrutinize every ship in fleets that keep getting larger and larger so that you don't get taken by surprise. And you might have to keep changing your ships' design as well to keep the enemy from exploiting a specific design. Combine it with an irrational AI that keeps attacking your explorers (because the game starts with everyone at war with one another), and then doesn't want peace because they don't consider you trustworthy, and you're going to face a lot of combat. Even on easy difficulty level, enemy ships just keep pouring in from every which way. And it's not like they're going to attack your fleets either. No, they're always heading for the undefended systems, so you'll spend a lot of time chasing fleets that are rampaging in your territory. And when I say ""every which way"", I mean it. There are star lanes and wormholes in the game, but they restrict movement only in the early game. Later on, you can just ignore them.There's a whole slew of other issues as well. The fact that the tutorials explain only the barest of basics in a few screens, while leaving the in-depth stuff (relatively speaking) is left for the wiki. Diplomacy is really bare-bones. Making deals is clear enough and offers a decent selection of offers, but again, the AI is just an inanimate cardboard cutout that barely says anything at all. It's also really difficult to understand what makes a specific AI tick.So, to wrap things up, when I'm playing this game, I don't feel like a conqueror of space. I feel like a bureaucrat.			"

												Endless space is one of the better space 4X games I've played since MOO2 (the original, not that remake that replaced the space combat system...)Anyway, Endless space is more simplified than most 4X games, yet it retains enough depth to keep the game interesting for many hours (I've got more hours off-steam with this game than I do on steam). I specially like how they tackled the population system, a bit more civ-like where you have ""population units"" rather than raw numbers, and you can easily move them around your planets to fit your production needs.Pros: Great 4X mechanics Big, varied and nicely spread tech ""tree"" (actually graph) Population management is simplified but still deep enough and interesting Colony management late game doesn't get boring and overwhelmingCons: Both space and ground combat are too shallow. Turn-based tactical combat would fit much better than ""define tactics and watch a movie"". "

												Awesome game with lots of replayabilty. Pretty much a more simplistic Civilization like game in space. I thoroughly enjoyed almost every aspect of the game. The lore is pretty awesome with the story and how ""dust"" is used. Only bad things I can say about the game are the battle scenes/battles if you choose to do them,  seem half done. It's a great idea but I would have liked to see it done differently. Then a few crashes/bugs here but other then that very stable for the most part. Would recommend if you like strategy or science fiction games.			"

												TL/DR: Mixed Review. If you like doing the war path, awesome! If not, don't bother, the AI has boosters starting from Normal difficulty. Which I think is BS. They might even have them in Easy given how many discussions I've seen of people having issues winning on that mode. Side Note: It's a shame the different ship types all render visually as the same ship on the map.Don't know if I'd recommend or not. This doesn't make me frustrated, but instead sad. Here's why:1. Apparently, playing on Normal difficulty gives the AI a percentage of bonus right off the bat... Normal should not include any bonuses imo. That makes sense for harder difficulties, not what a 'Normal' scenario would be.2. Because of the above, it makes it impossible to win without wiping thew opponent(s) off the map. I've logged more than 10 hourse on my first game. I've started from turn 0 on this game 3 times (counting the initial start) while attempting to make my research go differently. Since I was the Sophons (randomly generated) I first tried to go more focused on the right side (strategic resources and improvements?) while making sure to get enough of the expansion area to get wormhole travel in a reasonable time (20-30 turns?) and dabbing in the military area (enough to proteect me if needed) and diplomacy area (just to be able to call a truce and some). This had me lose a planet I wanted and somehow it turned out that the AI (I played Small galaxy with 1 random opponent - Horatio) had managed to do a LOT more expanding than should have been possible with army they had managed to get to defend the planet I decided to take (yup, I tried a bit of war for it). ... Let's try another research path..Second time, I tried to evenly disperse my research queue  to get more even coverage (thinking that's what the AI did). This time the AI decided to be aggresive and managed to find the wormhole tech around the same time as me and wanted to attack my ships in freespace as well as any that were just completing the map in their territory... Let's do another retry and see if expanding my 'boarders' will help keep up to our sides..This Third time, I mainly focused on expansion to I could get al the types of planets around me and the ones I knew I wanted from outside while getting neccessary resources and military tech for protection. I got my planets, but now the AI wants my planet badly enough to declare war and blockade it and the apparently have a MASSIVE army (6/8 in fleet with power 900+). Add to all of these tries, that the AI had 200-300 more victory points on me on the first 2 tries and ~150 on the third. I don't doubt that I could win if I took a production and war stance on this, but then is that really the ONLY way I could have won this? Someone mentioned that the AI is easy to bump if you take a planet with Truce and then trade tech for the others. Yeah, thats easy. But still war. I was trying to see how the AI did their tech tree paths so I could copy that way of thinking, but then I ran into the booster % info and that made me loose my drive.Overall, the game seems to be a very 1 track mind if this is how these go (seeing that difficulties of normal and above would all pretty much make domination the only way to win)... It just doesn't seem fun like this. Designing ships is always fun though! Even if they all render the same visual on the map..			"

												Endless Space tries to be the successor of the Master of Orion series, as in a space exploration strategy game with a management phase and space combats. It doesn't fully succeed, but merit has to be given for it trying to do it in its own way, and innovating rather than copying.First warning, it takes a long time to appreciate (or master) Endless Space. I don't think I got much fun out of it until the 20th hour or so.The tutorial doesn't help, it's just a series of much too detailed non-interactive screens, which just make you want to say TLDR. Do I really need to read everything about super advanced diplomacy features on my 1st turn in the game?The game interface is extremely well designed. It's beautiful, practical, both easy to navigate and feature-rich, has all the info you need where it needs to be. This game should be an example for all other strategy game devs out there.The graphics are beautiful too, full of eye candy grade galaxies, planets and spaceships, different designs for each faction.The management phase is the biggest success, and the most interesting to play. There are 4 base components (money, science, food, production), Each planet you colonize provides a mix of those depending on their type and the improvements you build. There are also 16 different luxury ressources + a bunch of rare metals, that provide you different benefits. You can also trade ressources as well as make other diplomatic agreements with other factions.The research is divided into 4 different trees (military, diplomatic/financial, terraforming/space travel and production/science) in a clever way that will need you to think carefully about your future planning.The combat phase, unfortunately, is a bit less interesting. A lot of players have described this is nothing but a game of rock, scissors and papers. In reality it is a bit more complicated but in essence it's correct.You do not have full control over your ships like in similar strategy games. All you do is watch the battle unfold as you play up to 3 cards. You start the game with 8-ish cards to choose from but advance techs and heroes allow you to unlock many more. Where it does get really more complicated then just Rock Scissor Papers is that each card, in addition to countering certain type of cards, and being countered by some others, also provide your ships with specific advantages, so by studying your opponents stats and making the wise choices, it's a little more tactical than it seems when you first play.But yet, it's frustrating that the battles are just a show with not much user input. How you build your ships, group them into fleets, and which admirals you assign to them is the most important part in winning a battle, the card phase only changes the odds in a very minor way.Overall I still recommend this game, for trying to innovate with the space 4x genre, the quality of the interface, the infinite varieties of customization, and the overall adictive fun that it provides, despite the slow pace and the dissapointing space combat.

												A neutral review, it's a good game that sadly gets monotonous after awhile. Replay value is moderate, if anything it'd be to just try out the other factions. Definitely worth it on sale at 75% ($7,) higher prices don't justify the content to cost.It is a good game, the empire building is fun and complex, diplomacy/AI are very competant as compared to the other 4X game AIs, albiet still not perfect mind you.Sadly the biggest draw back is the replay value, there really isn't much of a replay value as compared to other strategy 4X games. As strange as this sounds despite maps being somewhat large and randomly generated, the maps are very limited to where you're able to go - the star system and planets are always in different locations but the map is always the same. All you can do is basically follow the dots and your empire building essentially becomes a game of connect the dots, it's like this for all games. The lack of movement and diveristy of maps is the major con of this game.Empire building, AI are the best features of the game. The Empire building is complex at times by having a difficult balancing act between Food Industry vs Dust and Science (FIDS) along with population happiness.Combat is a matter of personal taste, personally I'm on the fence about it. There's no ""real"" interaction and the scenes are always the same. However the amount of customization you can add to your ships (no cosmetic changes unfortunately, if there were cosmetic changes it would be amazing) and your selection in cards help offset the boring battles which often results in just auto-resolving to save time, sense manual combat all you get to do is watch (and change cards if you need too.)- In the end, it's a good game with both strong postive features and strong negative features.EDIT: Ah, and the factions are worth a mention too. There is a very limited amount of factions but they're unique in all aspects with an interesting lore which the AI actually sticks too. Unlike other 4X factions where a religious AI ends up going war-like, the AI in E.S. ends up sticking to what you'd expect from that faction; either warring, expansive, economic or generalized. The lack of factions however can be made up by creating your own factions with a TON of options. Sadly you have to choose from one of the faction skins for your ships. Again, this is another example of strong positive and strong negative features of this game.			"

												' Space space, I wanna go to space  ' - One of the personality cores from Portal 2Endless Space is a 4X strategy game (eXploit, eXpand, eXplore, eXterminate), developed by Amplitude Studios.The game revolves around the legacy of an ancient sentient race known as the Endless, and the technologies they left behind when they went extinct. Many centuries later, factions of different kinds and species are locked in a battle for control of the galaxy, and control of a substance the Endless have created, known as Dust.If you have played other 4X strategy games, such as Civilisation or Master Of Orion, then Endless Space will feel familiar to you: You start off on one planet in a system, and by researching technologies, colonising other systems and managing your resources and military power, your rise to fame takes place.The game's soundtrack is beautifully sublime as well, consisting of slow-paced electronic music with Middle-Eastern instruments mixed in, all composed by FlyByNo.The only flaws I can think of the game are perhaps the tutorials. While they explain the basics of the game rather well, I feel they do not go in-depth enough about certain elements of the game to allow the player to fully understand a certain research capability or how to stockpile resources.Regardless, Endless Space is an amazing game, and one that is highly recommended for any tacticians out there. If you have never played a 4X strategy game before and want to get into it, this is where you should start.9/10. Would go to space again.			"

												Endless Space is a game for people with patience and interest in complex mechanics, not unlike Galactic Civilizations.  As a 4X game, it succeeds and holds its own well.  The AI works the systems and the difficulties scale well as you learn the game.  If turn-based, steep learning curve games don't scare you then you should at least put this on your Wishlist.Before giving up in frustration, there are some key mechanics to understand.Combat - You choose 'cards' in each of three combat phases, and set formations and tactics before starting the fight.  If you choose to 'Auto' the battle, it plays out exactly as it would if you were watching but without being able to shift your card selection.  Sitting through the fight in 'Manual' lets you see the destruction and alter your selected card for the next phase if you want to.  The cards can counter opponent cards and/or simply provide combat bonuses.  Combat mechanics aren't clearly described and can be confusing - the most important aspect is the relationship between ship size, defense, and weapon damage.  Late game AI ship builds will push you to have a good understanding of how to defeat them mechanically.Ship builds - Ship building is fairly tame and comes down to adding categories of stats.  Ship builds generally stick to themes - the ""Tank"", the ""Glass Cannon"", and the ""Planet Destroyer"".  Trying to create balanced ships early in the game can work, but later they become a liability and it's better to shift to a strategy that involves either making a lot of small glass cannons or a massive tank backed by serious firepower.  Space limitations in each of the 6 chassis types means ships never get insane statistics on their own.Growth - Colonization is key to conquest and can be tricky to understand at first.  It can be hard to balance happiness, taxes, and production - but with a few key techs it's easy to shift into overdrive and expand as quickly as the AI does.  The combat and conquest does suffer from grinding, especially later in the game, but that seems a common theme is in every 4X game and is expected.Overall, this is a worthwhile 4X strategy title and is recommended for lovers of the genre.

												Three first games down the toilet because I forgot to do something - not all idle actions and queues have reminders. The pull of One More Turn is strong, however, so I recommend any 4X fans interested in atmospheric space exploration and conquest to give this a try. Making your own ship designs and managing solar systems is mysteriously compelling!See other reviews for in-depth information as I have played very few hours so far.Best Bits and Needs Improvement in the first 8 hours+ Music. Perfectly on theme. Decent number and length of tracks.+ Visuals. Vibrant and immersive. Ships and effects could use more detail and variety.+ Writing. Clever, not reliant on tropes or overt references, consistent throughout.+ Ships. Planetary and fleet management is one thing, but tweaking ships is next level.+ Details. Everything from planets and ships to perks has that extra step of depth.- Camera. The combat autocamera needs work, repetitive and produces blind/empty shots.- Cards. I like the card combat idea, but the execution is very rudimentary, no nuances.- Polish. The game looks great and plays well, but there are annoyances:. . Tech web improvement colour flags are tiny and disappear when zoomed out.. . Tech web search does not include descriptions and resulting improvements.. . Text is way too small in parts of the UI and distorts oddly, needs scaling.. . Planetary system view keeps pulling to one side, skewing the view uncomfortably.. . Fleet and ship names are limited way short, and even then get cut off.. . And so on...Still loving every moment, and quite happy with the style of the game. Good design and writing, makes me wish there was a campaign I could play in this universe.Note after 24 hours: this game is all about the ships and fleets, blockades and battles. Expect to get hammered into submission if you fail to build up your fleets. Isolated systems don't stand a chance and diplomacy and allies may come too late. "

												Looks shiny, but the AI is terrible and there's a severe lack of balance everywhere from combat to the tech tree to the stock races themselves (nevermind custom races).  You'll have fun for a few hours, but quickly enough you'll figure out how the game works and realize there's a single best method for winning (not even a handful, a single one) barring random events (which are also unbalanced) and the AI is not a challenge at all, which makes things really bad because multiplayer is half-broken (used to be fully broken).The real big problem about all of this, though, is that the developer is so focused on their gimmick of asking for community vote when it comes to adding content or at all modifying the game, that the glaring issues get overlooked in the face of adding more faction colors or art assets, because the community at large either doesn't care about balance or is terrible at it. It's specially jarring when terrible ideas get implemented because you *know* they won't be removed later since that'd be going back on their word of doing what the community says.			"

												Endless Space is a tribute to intelligent design and meticulous polish, offering endless hours of micro management goodness on all fronts. Whether you are duking it out against an accomplished AI in the games single player or vying for cultural dominance online, this 4X turn based wonder accommodates all levels of experience and play styles, providing countless sessions of entertainment for newbies and pros alike.There's no denying, that Amplitude Studios' debut is spot on. There's epicness and complexity that make the player use tactical thinking, teach management, panience and provr that war isn't always the key to victory. Despite a few setbacks, Endless Space is a very well made, relaxing game. It's no revolution but clearly shows that 4X games won't be forgotten.Visually, it's detailed and opulent where it needs to be, yet simple and clean everywhere else. It makes its voluminous level of complexity accessible with a terrific interface which affords a pace and ease of management that few other games in the genre can match.For a first game it's surprisingly complex, challenging and motivating.

												A fantastic 4x game with the absolute best UI you will ever see in a strategy game. I also love the fully visible tech tree where you can plan ahead, even more so after playing a few games with ""randomly available technologies"". It pains me to see it getting mixed reviews nowadays. I mean sure it has it's problems, you can't control ships in combat, but you still have strategy cards, formations, and massive hero bonuses. That's more than recent game Stellaris has in their combat system. After playing several other 4x's i always find myself comparing them to Endless Space, almost like its the par for the course. I mean that in the best way possible too.			"

THIS IS A TURN BASED GAME! if you dont like turn based games, then you probably shouldnt buy it and then give a bad review because the turn based  feels boring to you.Personally, I LOVE them, they are great for working and gaming at the same time. I cant help but do one more turn.... I cannot quit, I actually have to force myself to stop playing.I enjoy it greatly, so yeah, 10/10			"

Posted: November 1, 2016
												First off, let me preface this by saying that Endless Space is one of my favorite 4x games and one of my most well-loved games. I have decent experience with 4x games and many are bad, while just as many are good. At its base, Endless Space fits into the 'good' category, however it is plagued with numerous glaring problems that I would recommend playing another 4x game. Endless Space is a space 4x strategy title developed by Amplitude and you know that already. The gameplay consists of building an interstellar empire, balancing economics, research, military, and diplomacy, like most 4x games. The largest problem that Endless Space has is that these mechanics either do not play well together, or are almost entirely broken. I want to draw attention to the positives of the game before I delve into specifics as to why I do not recommend it:First of all, it is fun, usually immensely so. Games can take anywhere from 1.5 hours on the fastest speed to around 10 hours for the slowest, meaning it has a playtime per game comparable to other 4x games. There are some imaginative factions, from involuntarily ravenous insects to sentient stones, and the most of the default factions can be considered balanced. There is a custom faction creator, a staple of 4x games. The graphics are stunning for a strategy game, especially considering that it came out four years ago (though not as breathtaking as Endless Legend's), but despite this, the game still runs on most machines I've tested it on with Fantastic graphics. Even on the lowest graphics, though, the game definitely still has formidable aesthetic. This was Amplitude's first game, and you can see the charm of an 'indie' title in it, if that sorta thing appeals to you. All-in-all, it's a rather generic 4x strategy game - it's probably the closest thing to ""Civ in Space.""Now, as much as it pains me to do so, I will explain why I cannot recommend this game. The first, most glaring problem, as I mentioned, is that the various 4x mechanics do not work very well together, at all. Scientific playstyles are, without a doubt, the most overpowered/easiest way to win. This is mostly due to the fact that overdeveloping a tall empire gives many more benefits than a wide empire would, resulting in end-game tech at the beginning of the mid-game for all other players. Space combat isn't difficult when you have end-game weapons put up against low-intertia slugs. Diplomacy is absolutely broken, half the time completely invalidating the need to have a tax rate above 0%, by way of simply offering open borders/peace in return for a large amount of that empires' dust per turn. The other half of the time it is exceedingly useless - AI that feel 'Very Close' to you will declare war within the first 50 turns, regardless of empire proximity, score, expansion, etc. The diplomatic relations and treaties are mostly useless - why even include a button to allow AI to trade planet if the AI won't trade a single system for *everything* in your empire, including your 20+ systems? Making an empire focused on dust production is almost entirely useless unless you're trying specifically for an economic victory, and even then, it's not likely that you'll have a fun time of doing it. Combat (and sieging by extension) is the absolute worst combat I've ever experienced in a 4x game, basically boiling down to a phase-based CCG. Ship building seems cool at first, but it's really a snapshot of the original Master of Orion ship builder - you start with 3 classes of ships and can research up to 4 more, then add various modules to decide exactly what role the ship will play. This sadly boils down to stacking obscene amounts of weapons on very cheap ships, scout ships not even being built, and colony (settler) ships being far to cheap if they're modified at the beginning of the game. Heroes are extremely useful as governers and next-to-worthless as fleet admirals. Finally, the game has quite bad problems with micromanagement, like the majority of 4x games. Turns will end up taking up to 10 minutes to complete by mid-game. There is an AI governor mechanic, of course, but it's about the same as in every other 4x game that features AI governors - they will ruin absolutely everything you planned for. Custom factions, while quite fun, are sadly much too overpowered to have balanced play with AI.Moving on from problems with game mechanics (which is, honestly, a trap that most 4x games fall into) there are immense bugs. The game is UNPLAYABLE on multiplayer due to a well-known desync problem that the devs seem to have forgotten about - if you can make it to turn 100 on multiplayer regularly without a perpetual [End of Turn in progress...] then I envy you, and also don't believe you. Array Index errors, common with the Unity engine, are more prevalent than any game I've played previously on the engine. Most of them, around 70%, are absolutely harmless and mean nothing whatsoever. The remaining are game breaking, resulting in anywhere from no input being accepted to the entire GUI failing. All in all, this mostly means that Endless Space's multiplayer is unbalanced, and broken in more ways than one, and the singleplayer is either frustrating or a faceroll. There are simply better 4x games to play. Endless Legend, the developer's next 4x strategy game, is mindblowingly good. Endless Space 2 is currently in early access and it is looking to be shaping up and taking care of most of these issues. For a single player 4x space game, I'd recommend Galactic Civilizations 2, while recommending Endless Legend in all other cases.			"

												I feel it best to write a more up-to-date review focusing on the game that is Endless Space.Endless Space is a 4X, Turn Based Strategy that involves you building your empire through Colonies, Fleets, Improvements and Diplomacy to attain victory.The easiest way to fully describe the game, would be if Civilization V were set in Space. But that in itself isn't a fully accurate description. Let's get to the meat, shall we?When I first started the game on my Netbook, I noticed how nice the graphics were and how it ran relatively smoothly on the Medium settings (It ran on High settings relatively well on my Mac) only slowing down in the late game when hundreds of fleet movements had to be rendered and checked. The game has only crashed once or twice, and that was mostly because I messed with a few game files while running the game. Performance- 8.5/10As mentioned previously mentioned, the graphics were very impressive. From the Character designs, Ship designs, Menu designs, Planet designs, the game has a very clean and polished look and has Lore related artwork that really makes the game a much better experience. I found myself taking screenshots of planets and systems as they were simply amazing. Wonders, Cities and Anomalies are rendered on the planets themselves, thus giving direct visual feedback to the user.One critique relating to the graphics was the lack of variation in city aesthetics and a lack of visual feedback given when a Planet's exploitation changed.Graphics- 9.25/10The soundtrack is what is to be expected from a Space themed game and has shining moments, especially the more ambient tracks, but nothing as spectacular as the theme from Star Wars for example. Still has it's good moments, but if you're sitting there for long periods of time, the soundtrack may get repetitive.Sound- 8/10The AI is interesting to say the least, at lower difficulties, it is hilariously icompetent, rarely making me run for the hills, but at higher tiers (especially Endless) the very nature of the spontaneously insane AI can get the best of you. It is important to note that some bugs exist (or maybe they were intentional, I can't tell) in the AIs interactions. Especially related to Wars and Cease Fires, as the AI may simply beg for mercy after losing a System before continuing on their blood thirsty rampage through your worlds. Overall, the AI is quite solid, albeit if you want a challenge, aim for the higher difficulties.AI- 6.5/10Combat is something that is often criticized in reviews of Endless Space, but I found it somewhat unique and I appreciated that the devs put it in. Even though it is essentially a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, it's still a slightly more complex Rock-Paper-Scissors. The combat system involves 2 fleets fighting each other and playing different ""Battle Cards"" (you can unlock more via the Tech Tree or through Heroes that you equip to your fleet) and in the Disharmony DLC, also includes specific targetting (such as the Nosebreaker tactic which involves you focusing on the emey's main ship)While Battle Cards will cancel each other out and play a pivotal role in the combat, you will have to equip your Fleets with weapons as well. Ships can be equipped with 3 Attack ""Modules"" and 3 Defense ""Modules"". The 3 Attack Modules are-Missiles (Long Range combat)Lasers (Medium Range combat)Kinetic (Short/Melee Range combat)and the 3 Defense Modules are-Flak (Counters Missiles)Shields (Counters Lasers)Deflectors (Counters Kinetic)Every time a Module is added, it adds an extra Missile/Laser/Kinetic attack or defense capability. A battle will involve either an Automatically decided outcome, or a Manual Cutscene (in which you can still adjust your plans in Real Time). A battle has 5 phases (Intro, Long, Medium, Melee, Conclusion) of which 3 are the times when the ships fire at each other (Long, Medium and Melee of course). Ships will fire all the weapons during each phase, but some weapons will be more effective during their respective phases.During a battle, (if you own the Disharmony DLC) you will also have the option of adding Fighters and Bombers which add to the way combat plays out by giving/taking away an advantage. In the end, I enjoyed the combat and as with me taking Planetary screenshots, I did the same for the Battle sequences.Combat- 7.75/10Multiplayer is quite enjoyable as you can play with up to 8 people in a private or public lobby and have the option of using Custom Races or the Pre-made ones. In-game chat is available, but not Private Player-to-Player chat (I'd recommend Steam Chat). While it's not uncommon to find a Public game, ES is best played with friends. There are several sync and disconnection issues that occur once in awhile, but they are rare adn usually require a quick reload of the save.Multiplayer- 7.5/10Victory can be obtained through both peaceful and non-peacful routes and give every race a fighting chance at victory. Routes to Victory- 10/10Modding is almost non-existant in this game, so don't buy it if you expect mods (though it would be great if you knew how to program xD). I haven't divided into modding myself, but it's quite sad that the mod scene is minimal at bestModding- 1/10I will keep updating this review on Diplomacy, etc. at a later date :)			"

												Please don't buy this game, play it only for a couple of hours and then toss it with a bad review. (I almost did that) It takes a bit of learning... (probably not unlike the VERY first time you tried Civilization) But it's worth giving it a full playthrough as a race and then trying again with the same one. Once you get the basics, swap to another race and prepare for a whole new game. Each race has different perks and some have different improvements (not unlike Civ). But the best part is that the tech tree is slightly different for each race to capitalize on those perks. For example, one race has a buyout bonus. Then through research they can gain money (dust) by killing enemy ships and build unique improvemnts that rake in cash. Then you can basically not worry about long build times because you can just buy everything in one turn!The diplomatic system can be frustrating at times... not being able to declare war for a certain number of turns after a ceasefire or peace agreement. But the ""Cold war"" aspect is pretty neat.  Another drawback is that sometimes the AI will make stupid decisions. ""Sure i'll give you the REST of my planets for a ceasefire..."" or ""I'm about to capture half of your planets in the next turn but ok... I'll accept this ceasefire for nothing in return."" The battles can be repetitive, but you also don't need to watch em...(there's an auto button that skips straight to the outcome... takes 3 seconds) And it's fun to watch the battles that you deem worthy. Watching 15v15 is almost as cool as watching 4v4 with capital ships!In sum, it's a great game... give it more than just one shot. If anything it'll give you something to look forward to in the upcoming sequel! "

The biggest thing that i loved about this game was the endless customization of what go in your ships. And dont pay attention to anyone complaining about the combat system. yes its kinda tricky at first if your doing it on manual but it really isnt that hard. If you find out that manual combat is too hard then all i gotta say is ""Use the Auto Combat"" if u dont feel comfortable giving direct orders.			"

												I played about 80 hours on classic mode (without the Disharmony dlc) before I switched over to the Disharmony version. The game is incredible and gets only better with the addition of the Disharmony dlc. And the AI is probably the most vastly improved feature of the game. Oh man, the AI.Me and three other factions controlled a quarter of the galaxy each. Well, I allied myself with two of the others, and declared war on the remaining faction, the Sowers. I had the least amount of ships in the galaxyand was by far the weakest by firepower, but thanks to fleet formations and strategic card playing, I beat every fleet sent my way. By the time I drove this guy to his only remaining star system, his home system, I must have destroyed well over a hundred individual ships and taken six or seven systems from him. He's two turns away from being wiped from the face of the galaxy when he calls for a ceasefire. Maybe you're thinking he offers me a tech or two I don't have for incentive to accept the ceasefire. Nope.Not only does he demand I pay him 30 dust per turn, not only does he demand techs that would reveal different resources to him, he also demands no less than four star systems that never even belonged to him in the first place. I mean, the balls of that. The absolute ungodly size of them. I almost accepted the ceasefire out of sheer awe.10/10 recommend.			"

												Awesome game. Naysayers seem to either disrespect the learning curve (which is less than many other space 4xs but still there for the uninitiated), or want it to uphold their Master of Orion nostalgia. The game is rather a thing of its own, and I'd claim the winter sale reviews can be mixed because of little play-time. Anyway, I did find the game streamlined yet complex, with the most awesome flavour of their own mythology built into it. The texts really flesh out the gameworld. Have thus far only played a huge map on normal difficulty and it actually was quite a bit of a challenge. Ok, the battle system for the vanilla game is more of a paper-rock-scissors cinematic, but I'm personally fine with that. Awesome that I don't need to micromanage. Also, heard that the expansion adds some depth there.Overall, taking into account the music, the feeling of competing in technological and military advancement with very different and flexible strategies, the awesome lore and feel fo the game, I wholly recommend it to any 4X connoisseur. Might need some reading and getting used to tho.			"

If you want to play online, bring friends. Pirate spawns can be extremely annoying if they catch you by surpriseFinal Score: 4/5It's a very fun game to pick up and have fun, but I rarely ever find myself actually finishing matches (online or not)Nonetheless, I still enjoy playing it ocasionally.

												5/10I wanted to like this so much. It is almost painful to give it a thumbs down. There is so much in this game that is so close to making it really good, and really this is not so much of a thumbs down as it is just not a thumbs up. So, where to start...This is, as you should know, a 4x space game but there in lies one of the first problems with it. It is a 4x game ""light"" IMO. The game takes the approach of making many aspects of a 4x game and automating them. The combat is completely automated, there is mostly no colony management outside of setting a tax rate and building que, there is no real desicion making in research other then to just get it all, there is little to no diplomacy other than war/peace, and there is no espionage. Overall, while this makes the game a bit more casual and easier for newer players to understand, after multiple games and hours of play time everything just kinda falls flat. And honestly, I wouldn't have minded all this so much if the rest of the game was there as well. This is not a bad game, by any means. For what is there, it is polished, beautiful, the music is nice, the lore is interesting and the game does a great job of pulling you in and making you want to play it. But once you get past that intial love, you realize there is not anything else there. It is super shallow and after a few games it becomes very repetitive. The worst offender in the game and what possible pushed it down for me was the combat mechanics. Let's face it, most 4x games result in lots of combat and this one is definitely no different. However, the mechanics of how they work in this game make them very uninspired, bland, and does nothing to reward the player for being smart or playing better. See the main problem with the combat is all combat is done through ship fleets. A fleet can have a certain amount of ""Points"" of ships in them. The bigger the ship is the more points it is. You can gain more point maximum per fleet through research and racial traits. Actual combat is all done 1 fleet vs 1 fleet at a time and is all automated, winning is simply a numbers game that compares fleet defense number vs enemy attacking number. So what this boils all down to is the empire that can have the most points of ships in each fleet has a huge advantage simply because they have more of everything. Since combat is all automated there is no tactical advantage for smaller faster ships or ambushes or any battle tactics whatsoever. It is all just a numbers game and who can have the biggest number. Unfortunately, this carries over to the rest of the game because what this means is that once you get past the initial exploring part of the game all you will ever do is build ships non stop and throw them at the enemy and whomever can build them fastest with larger fleets wins.This is also exactly all the AI does as well. So once war is engaged, and it always will in most 4x games, it becomes a sluggish slog that becomes very boring very quickly. This is were the rest of the shallowness starts becoming very apparent as with other 4x games you may be able to start other tactics, whether diplomatic, espionage, etc to help move the combat and war along. Unfortunately in Endless Space there is no other tactics, and there is no other option other then to just slog it out, or simply stop playing. Which was what I did. As with so many 4x games in recent memory, Endless Space fails to build upon earlier games that were far superior. The developers, for whatever reason, failed to learn what made those games popular and whom, by many, are still considered the best of the genre, even some 10-15 years later. Yes, the graphics are better, the sound is better, the ships are cooler, and the lore is engaging, but 4x games require more then that. So I cannot recommend this game, there are just simply better games out there of this stype and style.  "

												Endless Space - Emperor Edition is a turn-based strategy game where the object is to meet one of the conditions for Victory, Expansion, Scientific, Diplomatic, Wonder, Economic and so on. You can play in a randomly generated galaxy, the size of your own choosing, with up to 8 opponent empires. Endless Space also allows for full modding and multiplayer capability. There are several stock empires ready for you to play as, or you can choose to create your own. You start in your capital system and then must explore nearby systems, colonize new planets, research and unlock new technologies, locate strategic resources to upgrade and more. As turn-based games go, this game was a lot of fun. I spent Five hours playing and ended up not getting much done in the way of review writing yesterday. The Space combat portion of the game, involves a different type of combat. Other reviews and game analysis have referred to it as akin to Rock-Paper-Scissors, and I think that is a pretty valid observation. Of course you can always allow the computer to auto-resolve the conflict, in which case the game takes into account the type and strength of ships involved in the conflict and randomly generates an outcome. All in all, I enjoyed Endless Space - Emperor Edition and may go out on the web to look for player-created Mods to make the game more challenging. If you enjoy these types of turn-based strategy games, give Endless Space a try.			"

												So I bought Stellaris a month or so ago and liked it.  Have always been a fan of 4X playing Civilization and similar games.  I enjoyed Stellaris, but it wasn't exactly everything I want.  I read about Endless Space and figured I would give it a try.  It is quite simply an amazing game.  Very well done with tons of replay value.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of 4X.  The ability to customize your faction sets this apart from both Stellaris and Civilization in my opinion.			"

												Endless Space is cast in the grand tradition of 4X turn-based strategy games. They’re so-called for their emphasis on four key gameplay elements: explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate. Endless Space is aptly named, because you’re responsible for shepherding a spacefaring civilization into the stars.Besides expanding the borders of your civilization (with several unique races to choose from), you need to learn how to adapt to new planetary environments, manage relationships with other races, and handle the continued development of your own species. A four-branch tree of very different technologies, each focal point of which helps you direct your race’s development, either into exploration, applied sciences, warfare, or diplomacy and trade.As your technology improves, so will your adaptability to the environments of different worlds you discover. You’ll also need to assimilate resources to grow. The four basic resources managed in Endless Space are Food, Industry, Dust, and Science (FIDS for short, an acronym you see pop up from time to time), and you can direct your civilization’s management of those resources on a colony-by-colony basis.Dust is the “currency” of Endless Space, the gold bullion that greases the wheels of commerce, simplifies the development of technology, facilitates trade and commerce with your neighbors, and more. The uses for Dust are a bit of a wildcard, unlocked as you get further and further into the game.A growing interstellar civilization demands a fleet of vessels to manage exploration, expansion, trade, and defense. Fleet creation and development is an important component of the game. You can customize your vessels with a tremendous amount of detail depending on your needs and the state of your development.Inevitably the expansion of a civilization’s borders creates friction for its neighbors, and in Endless Space you have control over how that friction occurs. Each of the eight playable races has a base disposition either using diplomacy and trade as your tool or, let loose the dogs of war. Combat in Endless Space is more football coach than player: You issue fleet commands to direct your ships in the two-minute skirmishes that follow. But like the coach of a football game, you can’t control the players on the field directly.Every time you play, Endless Space produces a new galaxy to explore, so there’s endless replay value here. You can adjust the parameters of the galaxy extensively (though not endlessly) and you can customize the race you want to play. This leads to some daunting moments for the new player, but the reward is constant challenge no matter how many times you play.Endless Space is lovely to look at and sounds great too thanks to an electronic soundtrack which fits the stark beauty of the outer space visuals. The galaxy is your sandbox, and you will get immersed for hours, days, weeks at a time. If games like Master of Orion or Civilization appeal to you, there’s a lot to love in Endless Space.Highly Recommended "

												I wanted to recommend this game, but I can't. I like strategy games in general and 4x in particular, but there are just too many little nig-gles [stupid profanity filter] that turn it (overall) into something largely unfun. I could write a detailed analysis of everything, but tons of people have done that already. So... here's a little list of turn-offs that, if they bother you, you should leave this game alone.1. The AI cheats. A lot. Shunt up the difficulty, and it doesn't even bother to hide it, just straight-up in-yo-face BS.2. Limited replayability. I'm sure purists will disagree, but despite the attempt to give each faction a different feel, overall I felt that the game just plays the sameish way every time.3. Horrible, horrible, *HORRIBLE* achievements. If you're a 100%'er, do NOT pick this one up.4. A number of (imo) bad design decisions. I won't get into all the details, but the absolute worst (again, imo) is the ""simultaneous turns"" idea. Yes. Very fair. I can totally operate m&k as fast as my computer processes the AI's turns. PTFO. You can barely select a fleet before the AI moves ALL it's fleets and takes their actions.5. Poor diplomatic system. Too far behind, get attacked because you're weak. Too far ahead, get ganged up on because you're too strong. Maintain some sort of rough equality, and your idiot allies will drag you into stupid wars where either a) you don't support them, so they get eaten and your enemies get stronger; or b) you DO support them, and you have to cover their backs as well as your own, and then they turn on you because your fleet build up has pushed you from a non-threatening to an aggressive stance. Don't count on winning diplomatic victories unless it's the kind of I-got-all-the-guns-and-power sort of diplomacy. This game's ""diplomacy"" can die in a fire.			"

												While I generally love SciFi games and space empire building games rank among my favorite, the combat alone in this game killed it for me.  You basically sit back and watch as a ""bad"" cut-scene plays out and the only actual interaction you have is a choice between 3 cards that honestly make little to difference in the outcome.I gave this game one full playthrough and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone.  Master of Orion, Sins of a Solar Empire, and other similar games managed to keep my attention for multiple matches and i've gone back to them off and on over the years.  I won't be playing this one again...			"

It hasDistinct and awesome racesA great tech tree with rac-unique techsGreat loreSuperb musicBeautiful combat scenes - although the player is not in direct controlThe reason for this sale is probably because Amplitude wants your attention for their other great games: Dungeon of the Endless (stupid awesome dungeon crawl rogue tower defense), Endless Legend (one of the best 4X games out there) and the soon to be released Endless Space 2.

												This is a great game, its, for me at least, a spiritual sucessor to Masters of Orion, if you remember that. The UI is very well done, its a joy to navigate around, other games can definatly learn from it.The combat is the weakest point, but its not the main point of the game. It is pretty to watch, but you have not much influence besides the cards you research or get in other ways. You can skip it if you want it tough.This game is more focused on expanding, exploring, managing your empire and planets, and of course the development of new technologies. Diplomacy is in it too of course.Overall it gets 8.5 out of 10 points from me, a definitive must play game if you like strategy games!			"

												Hello casual gamers,Endless space is a fun turn based stratagy game. Like any game it has it ups and downs. Entering into the game i had no idea what i was getting myself into. Pretend you just got thrown into the deep end of the swimming pool and you don't know how to swim. There are two options, either learn to swim really quickly or... That is the feeling i got when i jumped into my first game vs. 8 other players. Once you get used to the system, the game provides, it gets easier. The Pros- A lot of different civilisations- A lot of management (game depth - Allocating resources on planets, food, metal, dust (gold) or research)- Huge tech tree- Low system requirementsthe Cons- No single player campaign - only skirmish maps- Huge learning curve- Battles are not indepth at all, very basic- A few game bugs like de-sync (occurs sometimes to never occur)Overall I play this game with my friends and just like to have fun and let off some steam. Overall this game is fun, but to those who are willing to put time and effort in understanding the game.			"

												To get this out of the way, YES the the game is good and it will sink it's hooks into you. I installed the game around 9am yesterday and didn't shut down until 1am the following day. I'd say it'll hold your attention 👍. After a very intuitive ""instanced"" tutorial (meaning, it won't guide you until you need to use specific menus or actions) you're off on the grand adventure   to explore the galaxy however you see fit. Trade, diplomacy, conflict...These are the tools @ your disposal but how you wield them is always the fun part in the genre.Side note: This game controls great with the Steam controller. I was concerned that I would be glued to the keyboard but alas, that isn't the case.			"

												Be prepared! There is virtually no tutorial. Endless Space is a good 4X title, after hours of reading online and tutorial videos. Admittedly I'm not the best 4X gamer, but just to understand basic things I had to resort to the Wiki. The tutorial as it exists is basically information overload in the form of reading pages of information on the systems each time you click on something new in the game for the first 45 minutes. Not easily presented in a way that at least I could retain. All that said if you don't mind some research and a lot of trial and error with many failures, there is plenty to love about the game. The factions are interesting and once you start getting used to the system you start having fun.			"

It's clean, easy to use, efficient, and provides you with all the information you need to run your empire.This is what the result can be if the makers of the game put a lot of polish on it.			"

Posted: December 17, 2014
												I gravitated towards this game after playing Sins of a Solar Empire for a while.  I enjoyed the aspect of it feeling like a 4X game (Civ was a want at the time, but I didn't want to pony up 50$+ for a game that I was unsure of), while still feeling vaguely familiar.After playing Civ5 after this game, I can say that this is probably one of the FASTER 4X's on the market.  Games like Civ will take ages just to get yourself to any reasonable point in the game even on the fastest available mode, research and expansion-wise, whereas this game you can effectively start and finish a game in a few casual nights on the fastest speed.  Another perk of the game is just how beautiful the fight cinematics are.  Though most players, especially in multi-player, will skip these because of time constraints.  But the general presentation of the game is incredibly clean, things are for the most part explained out through hover-over text (Why is my approval rating so low?  Here's a list of every positive and negative affect on it within this system!), but there are its flaws here and there with this.  Some newer features haven't been polished up as much as the base game, but that's overlookable since everything functions just right.Speaking of fighting, that brings me to another irk.  The AI can be incredibly stubborn regarding fleets, and the mechanics of the game can be bothersome as well.  Case in point: If you have a large fleet in enemy territory, a single scout ship can pin down the entire fleet and prevent it from doing anything unless you formally declare war on them.  And in turn, declaring war opens up your borders to their ships and doing the same to you.  So you can't attack a single piddly ship, nor can you get away from it, unless you either make peace or throw down the hatchet.Resources in the game are fairly well presented.  The game bases around FIDS; Food, Industry, Dust, Science.  Every planet can produce some of these, and improvements can further add onto these numbers for a total at the top of every system.  Another fine thing is that each system is pretty much independent of each other, aside from a few exceptions of endless temples, wonders, and luxury resources.  But these are worded differently and imply that they are empire-wide instead of just in system.  So a rebellious and angry system doesn't drag down everybody else, but you can feel it as a whole in regards to your Dust rates.  Managing your empire is tough at times, but it's not improbable unless you make some terrible decisions early on (expanding too fast, hiking the taxes up to insane amounts for no legitimate reason, etc.) or end up getting assaulted by a warmonger later on with not enough ships available.Diplomacy is very well presented, showing your faction vs. everybody else's faction, along with every other faction displaying their current status with other players (Alliance, Peace, Cold War, and War) but there's not much else to it.  Trading tech, making deals, and what-not.  Basic stuff, nothing too insane.The way the military system is presented is interesting.  Fleets cost dust to maintain, and fleets can only be so big, based on your current tech and starting perks.  Some of the science-based factions take smaller fleet perks, since they don't look to win by kicking everybody in the pants.  The one issue I have with the game is that it doesn't take into proper account fighters into the attack power strength, which can be incredibly overpowering at times as they don't really have anything to counteract them via battle cards.  Could be an interesting addition to the combat tree, if you know the enemy is using figs.A great game, worthwhile to give a play if you're growing tired of traditional 4X games taking a week of dedicated play to finish, and are looking for something small and fast to play in bite sized pieces.  I know most people gripe about balance, but when the game's randomly generated like this, there's obviously going to be a little luck involved.  But a good player should be able to counteract things and use their beginning to their advantage as best they can.			"

												Worst 4x space game i ever played D:Combat is rock-paper-scissor and doesnt give any tactical options, making you only to amass ships in one big fleet and throw them to see if you can win...As some people say, ""rock-paper-scissors is also another tactics option"", but is not,  is a gamble and a bad example for 4x combat mechanics, where the final objetive is to make players try diferent aproachs to the same problem. In Endless Space, there isnt aproachs, only attack and then ""believe in the hearth of the cards"" and your luck choosing a better hand than your enemy.Researching technologies is not depth enough and some of them break even more the tactical options you have in the game.Heroes are interesting, but only for planet management, is a waste to put a hero in a fleet -_-The Heroes in fleet is just Firepower increase and/or Invasion power, personally i prefer a heroe that really make more unique the fleet than only increase a % the power output.Political system is very buggy or they really dont know what they were doing.This game is really disapointing, specially for those we pre-ordered because we were scammed into purchasing an ""half-full"" game with bad mechanics.Of course, i admit im old school and i have a higher expectation of 4x games since i played master of orion and space empires games before, but still that is not bad, that only proves that old games give more quality than actual games.If anybody want to spend 29.99$ (or 7.49$ in steam sales offers) in this game, you can do it, is your money, but if you are a real fan of 4x that want a challenge and a good inversion for your money, i recommend others 4x games that cost less or the same and deliver you a much better experience. I recommend Sword of the Stars II, Sins of a Solar Empire and even Stardrive D:			"

												I can only really recommend this for multiplayer, as the single-player AI is frankly atrociously-handled.The multiplier bonuses as listed on the Endless Space wiki are pretty telling: http://endlessspace.wikia.com/wiki/Game_settingsPutting aside the fact that, going by those figures, Newbie difficulty seems to be the closest you're going to get to a level playing field, I shouldn't need to point out that simply buffing numbers is a lazy method of introducing difficulty, nor should I have to explain why. It's a matter that's been discussed ad nauseum for a large part of the medium's life.There's also the matter of a territory/resource-deprived AI still somehow managing to churn out a considerable amount of firepower. I don't know what's sillier, pulling entire fleets out of Hammerspace, or the fact there are apparently people who deny there's anything fishy about this.I mean, if you're okay with it - maybe you just like having more stuff to blow up - that's totally fine. But at least be honest about it.With a group of human players, I could see this being a fairly enjoyable (if very lightweight) 4X. It's not necessarily BAD, there's just not a lot to it. If you're willing to go to the trouble of organising lengthy multiplayer sessions with this kind of game, you're probably also willing to get your teeth into something a bit more substantial.I'll still be playing this a bit to see if I warm up to it, but as of the time of writing this, I'm doubtful.

												tldr: you should probably already own this if you like 4x games and spaceA solid 4x and a good benchmark game.  If you ever played Risk and thought ""I could get into this"" this is the game for you.  Games take forever, the skill tree(s) might as well go on forever, expansion takes (almost)forever.  You get the idea.This is a good benchmark 4x because it literally does what it claims and no more.  Control the planets, systems, fleet, troop, production, and diplomacy in exquisite detail with exactly the right controls (I'm looking at you ""right-click backing out of status windows"") which I swear should be everywhere.I digress, if you like the genre or want to dip a toe this is a good foundation to build a love for 4x games upon.  For the experienced player you'll be glad to know that things like wormhole geometry will have a bearing on your life.  Because jump points between systems become very important.  Once you've established yourself in a galactic arm with one jump point in and out you want to keep it.  You might take a system on the other side of the jump point just to keep it safe, even though the system is a drag on the economy.  You know you're going to have to increase fleet production to take the system but citizens are unhappy because you have...You get the idea. The only (obvious) twist here is that it takes place in space.  So if that's your thing you should enjoy it.			"

												Game is pretty enjoyable for the initial 100+ rounds, then as soon as you got the Dreadnaught, the nature of the cheaty AI would be exposed. In easy or normal difficulty, before you got the dreadnaught everything seems to be pretty simple and easy, AI may fight back for a couple of times but they never pose a real threat. Still, later in the game, when you think you would be able to crush the AI with the dreadnaught and a whole advanced fleet , you would be surprised - all of a sudden all the AI fleet got around 90% deflect rate shield, and a couple of destroyers can easily wipe your entire fleet without hurting themself at all.It seems the AI adjust to your technology level far too abrupt, almost within 5 rounds.For casual player, this is just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Maybe the game will be much more fun when you play with your friends.Sorry dev, your AI sucks.

												Simply put this game is pretty high up on my ""steam regrets"" list and I don't know why. It starts off with fairly amazing graphics, however, things quickly go downhill. The whole combat system is essentially pick a card by making an educated guess about what card the computer picked... and then you get to watch a 30 sec encounter of the ships shooting at eachother. After maye the first dozen fights these become increasingly painful to watch as you realize that if you wanted to watch a movie you have no control over netflix is probably the cheaper and better option. Essentially all of the combat and strategy are done in what you research and how you equip your ships (kindof cool for the 2 minutes it takes) of course by the late game it doesn't really matter what you do equipping wise as all ships are essentially paper airplanes flying around with nukes. (whoever has the most ships wins)... I'm going to quit writing before I get to the completely happiness (you have very very little control over) based economy as this much anger is unhealthy.TLDR; Deceptively disappointing game. You do tons of work for very little actual affect on the game.			"

												Endless Space is a 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) turn-based space strategy. I've been playing it since alpha and have to admit that it's a sort of a mixed blessing. Let me list all the pros and cons as I see it to give you a better picture.PROS: Solid graphics with fantasticly detailed awesome planet textures, neat art style, memorable and diverse races, clean and slick UI, some of the core game systems, e.g. the FIDS concept (Food, Industry, Dust, Science), research trees are quite the beasts with many interesting techs.MIXED: Battle system is controversial. Player has a limited input on the battles - no direct control over ships, just cards (actions), formations and targeting. I don't mind the concept as a whole and it got better with the Disharmony addon, but  there's for improvement IMO. Heroes are also in the so-so category, their ability trees are dull and not diverse enough although I like the concept. Events are cool but too few and not detailed enough to my taste.CONS: Diplomacy is weak in its current form + you have to research even the most basic types of interactions which really hurts multiplayer, espionage is basicly non-existant. Fast early expansion aka system grabbing is still the best strategy for most races, the penalties are not strong enough to encourage alternative strategies in most cases.Even with many negatives I consider Endless Space to be one of the better 4X strategies of the last years. It lacks depth as a single-player experience IMO, most game systems are too straightforward and multiplayer has plenty problems of its own. Still, if you dig the genre and don't expect ES to be the best 4X strategy ever you might sink couple hundred hours into it not without pleasure.			"

												If you're a fan of any 4X strategy games, you owe it to yourself to play this. The streamlined interface, and the deceptively complex micromanagement make this game compelling and intuitive from the first turn to the last. Several design decisions may seem awkward at first, such as the movement phase not actually ocurring between any singular turn but at any point during anyone's turn. However, this minor decision and many like it (I.E. starting in a ""cold war"" instead of peace with newly met factions) add quite a lot of depth and decision making to a genre that normally severely lacks, in both departments, even though it thrives on each. This is ESPECIALLY true in multiplayer. While the AI is quite good on higher difficulties, nothing beats the chess standoffs that can occur in the functional (surprise! Multiplayer in a 4X game that works!) and fun 8 player galaxy spanning matches. Don't even get me started on the sound design. The music is top notch and I recommend any fan of ambient yet groovin jams to actually purchase the OST for this game. Music aside even, the little boops and blips as you navigate through the menus are satisfying and even gratifying, I personally dig the ""you completed a research"" jingle.Every game has it's faults, though.The space battles, however, lack in the sound department. The guns and lasers and explosions just don't have that ""oomf"" you'd expect. It's strange when pressing an ""ok"" button makes a more satisfying sound than having your fleet blow up a moon sized battlecruiser with space lasers.The combat, also, I feel lacks a bit. Everything is automated with battle cards being selected. Where some counter others and have certain effects on your ships. While you can design your own ships in terms of the modules that they contain, the ships don't end up all being too dissimilar from eachother. This does work within the formula of the game, and I'm sure the inclusion of multiplayer might have something to do with it, but I would have preferred a turn based tactical battlescape ala Master of Orion 2. The Disharmony expansion is also a must. Not because the new race is particularly cool, (Neat concept, very difficult to play as.) but because there are many minor tweaks that have been performed throughout the game, from UI changes to ship design and tech tree additions. It somehow makes the game even MORE polished.Speaking of polish, I don't think I'd encountered a single bug in my play time with this game. It's almost eerie.So yeah. Buy this game if you like 4X games. If you don't, I honestly don't see this changing your mind. It's like a really good hamburger. Yes that hamburger is delicious, but if you're a vegetarian it's not going to appeal to you. 8.6/10Don't let the Cravers eat you! "

												The game is awesome, buy it. I am really excited to try the second one now that I have played this. I was considering it (Endless space 2) when I realized that I allready had the original in my library, figured I'd give it a try first. Upon launch I remembered I had tired it but the steep learing curve probably left me in the tutorial/ wasn't in the mood or didn't have the time that day. I tried again. I left the tutorial on and read everything. They are great but I still felt I needed some help on strategy so I watched some youtube videos. Somewhere around turn 67 I realized I did some dumb stuff around turn 23 and started over, leaving the tutorial on and reading everything again. That's when it hits you, yea, I love this game, It's everything I expected and more. A+, I love Civilazation games, this is way better. If you play/love Civ games? Buy this. Space stratgey 4x your thing? Buy this. This game has me excited to play the second, as well as try all the other games like this in my library that maybe haven't goten a proper look. Endless space will now be the gold standard that those other games will have to live up to.			"

												A decent enough game at first, this 4X game really only has 3X's. The X it lacks, is eXtermination. Technology research, colony management, exploration, and spaceship design are all comparable to other space 4X games. You don't really know what is missing until you start fighting with the other races. There is absolutely no way to win consistently in space combat because battles are basically just a comparison of fleet size and strength with some modifiers thrown in based on the results of a pre-combat game of paper, rock, scissors. Forget all the other 4X games out there where you can command individual units and beat the enemy fleet with strategy and tactics. You pretty much just pick 3 tactics from a list and then passively watch the battle happen. The computer is an amazing empire manager, so even on normal difficulty, you will find yourself at a distinct disadvantage in terms of technology and military strength when you encounter the enemy races. Once the galaxy gets divided up, wars are slow, boring, and repetitious processes of attrition. The end result is a game where any way the human player can gain an advantage by using their brain has been removed.			"

												PROS- Unique and interesting playable factions with a robust suite of options for creating your own.- Great art design and graphics that still hold up well. Massive battles between fleets of ships are especially impressive.- So many ways to be ""hands on"" with your empire such as building your own custom military units and battle plans.- Very well thought systems for colonization and development of your systems and planets.- An interesting tech tree that doesn't feel copied and pasted from similar games.- A more exciting late game than a lot of similar games.CONS- Less than stellar AI. There are mods that make it a little more interesting but for the most part it's not amazing.- High learning curve. Even if you've played games like Civilization before, there's a lot of different systems to learn here.Overall it's an excellent game that holds up wonderfully against similar games. Endless Legend, the kind-of sequel to this game is also excellent and worth checking out if you want an experience a little closer to tile based games like Civ.			"

												A great 4x space game - it can be simple or complicated depending on how you want to play. If you get deep into the ship building and combat systems, you can make a formidable navy that can challenge stronger factions. The AI is pretty smart and diplomacy is typically sensible (although some options like trading systems don't work well). The best part is that each of the races is rather unique - each has a unique playstyle and custom factions can make them even more unique.Games can last anywhere from a few hours to tens of hours depending on size of galaxy/speed/number of enemies.

Ship customization ends up in a rock-paper-scissor game, the game- balance is nonexistent , the tech advancement feels odd multiple times. The game has some bugs/feateures in it just a few example:-enemy ships moving in your turn-ships can not turn back or stop, unless they belong to teh enemy- diplomacy is useless , even your allies wont trade a low grade tech for your your 3 high level techs- indequate tutorial , after 20hour play I only knew how to win the game after I read the wiki. Some things still unclear- insane AI eg.:I) you control half the galaxy with highly developed colonies with the gold(dust) specialized race. your income: 150 gpt  another faction's with half your territory: 1500gpt.  II) you are usually happy with a 10K power fleet. Other factions even the pacifist ones often has 40K+ fleets.To sum up: This game had the potential to be great but there is just too much problems with it to be truly enjoyable. "

												I am torn over the art of Endless Space. I love the consistancy of art over the Endless game series. I love the sleek look and original concepts of the different races. BUT at the same time the art for the techs, the flavour of the buildings, the nuts and bolts of the game are lacking in artistic flair. With this lcak of flair to these components I found myself ignoring most of what I was doing. I just considered some techs as ""science tech no. 15"", and the buildings by their colour ""This planet needs more orange buildings."" Combat is also an interesting issue. I love the idea of the card system, and that they are techs that I can unlock. But they take far too long to simulate, and even the automation options is time consuming. When you have 12 battles to play out sometimes you just want it to be over. I would say this game is far behind some of the contemporaries, GC3 or Stellaris, it is also far behind Endless Legend. But is it worth a tinker and a play around, just for the change of pace. Sure is. Give it a play, but don't expect it to rapture your understanding of 4X space games.			"

												I've only played this game for a short amount of time for a 4X game.  And I can thoroughly say I enjoy it.  I played without the tutorial awhile ago, and it seemed complex and difficult.  It was honestly overwhelming.  I unistalled it.  But after hearing from gamer friends how awesome it is and how much better it is than Civ 5, I had to try it again.I played with the tutorial this time.  I hate reading long texts on how to play a game because I usually forget most of it.  But I found the tutorial truly enlightening.  It wasn't complex and it actually revealed a game that has a lot of autonomy linked to it.  You build your own units, you decide which way to take the game, and the victory options aren't limited to the usual 4 options of victory.  The ""civilizations"" are also diverse and interesting.  If you know the game well enough, you can even make your own.If you are a beginner, I suggest starting with the Pilgrims or the Vaulter civilization.  Starting with newbie difficulty might be slightly boring, but it really shows you how your games can work, and if you make mistakes, you will know and be able to recover from them easily.  For example, I tried to start an invasion of a planet without invasion units.  I thought I could simply do so over ships with overpowered weapons.  Not so.  I learned from my mistake and carried on.  I paid the price for it, but it wasn't game breaking.  It is my personal opinion that when starting a new game with entirely new mechanics that you should be given the option to fail without letting it destroy your game.  It was effective in Guitar Hero, Braid, and a diverse amount of other games.  Of course, the option should eventually be taken away.Overall, I found Endless Space to be an entertaining game.  I could not reccommend this game enough.			"

												My first impressions of this game were mixed, but only later did I realize, that the game was good, and I was the one with the issue. Now I would just say this is a good game. Endless space is a 4x game where you explore the galaxy, and build an empire. The game actually does a great job of simulating something that countless science fiction writers have worked on for years. It presents the concept of a vast galaxy where your galactic empire is just that an empire. In an empire, your decisions as emperor determine whether your race succeeds or is wiped off the face of the galaxy. You may lose a battle, sacrifice a fleet, or even give away a planet, but in the end you are working for the welfare of your people and with practice you will prevail. The game is hard, so start in the very easy modes at first. After you have a clear understanding of the game, each playthrough will be something unique and a place to experiment with. The game gives you the option of creating a custom faction to play with your own selection of skills and starting parameters. This allows you to really role play the content of this series well. Honestly the most epic part of the game for me is when the player begins to transform worlds form barren dead worlds and eventually transform them into terran, or ocean paradises, for your citizens benefit. Nothing fixes their attitude more than turning a dead world into Eden. I found myself chaffing a bit with some of the win conditions in the game, only to realize, you can chose which win conditions are active and which are not. In my case, I do not like having a final turn timer mechanic. I want a clear victory through expansion, domination, science, or diplomacy... though these are not all the win conditions available, I am able to select just these for my playthroughs and it makes all the difference, and at times if I want to just watch a galactic empire expland... I will play a last  standing game. Take  the game slow, and take your time, and this game will give you countless unique runthroughs to enjoy.			"

												I don't see a reason not to recommend this game. It's simple, it's easy to get into and mainly provides a power fantasy kind of experience. If you're looking for a Master of Orion's depth, you won't find it here. It's a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. It's a fun 4X lite, it's really a neat looking and seeing your empire expand is just worth your time. To a certain moment. Where you realise that no matter what race do you play and what kind of victory condition(s) you choose, you play the same all the time every time. It might look it's diverse and complex, but it is not. Despite of trials to give an every race its own characteristic it all boils down to few starting conditions and quickly don't matter. They're just +% this -% that. No matter which race do you play, you will research the same science trees. It doesn't matter if you're bravely expanding communism into space as a mighty Soviet Space Republic or vegetating as concious crystals. Everyone needs the same bonuses and supermarkets! Of course there are few exceptions in the research, but again they boil down into +/-%. You could count Harmony out, which doesn't use dust at all, but it really doesn't feel or plays much different than any other race. After 100 or so turns you will hate menaging your systems building the same upgrades over and over again. You will hate stubborn AI with dozens of 1 ship fleets attacking you and taking your time to click in an unnecessary combat window. The combat is severely lacking. Ship building boils down to 3 types of weaponry, 3 additional modules (infrantry and aircraft) and some % bonuses. Yeah, sure, visualisations of battles are really nice and fun to watch sometimes, but the rock/paper/scissors card mechanic just sucks and is too RNG based. The AI doesn't help. Of course I played only to a high difficulty, but the AI acts the same all the time. One empire will expand immensely, the rest will vegetate in few systems. Every empire will build a♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of same ships often with 1 and only weapon type you will counter. And AI won't react to your ship designs, producing dozens of fleets with no protection againts your most used weaponry. Empire management is better and really fun - as said above - but it grows old very fast due its simplicity. Again - it boils down to unifying all your planets to your race's habitat as soon as it's possible for the best population and production % bonueses. It's is entertaining until you research necessary technologies to transform your planets and mine/acquire a ♥♥♥♥♥on of strategic minerals and goods. From some point - it's just zerging your enemy turn after turn, not caring about anything - pirates are no threat after 20 or so turns. Diplomacy is non existant and - again - boils down to war/peace and trade agreements/alliance. There is no espionage at all, there are no specific race behaviour (only amoeba doesn't seem to declare war at all).The game drops in efficiency after 100 or so turns making it to play annoying. The lag after your mouse clicks is sometimes 5 seconds long. It's not bad, but it's not great either. I will surely come back to it after a while.			"

												This game is eh.  It could easily be any of the countless other 4x space games.  If playing on any difficulty above normal, you have to be a war monger to survive or win.  Doesn't let you turn off the other victory types, so you often even dominating 80% of the galaxy lose to the trade faction because they saved up more credits than you.  Seems to be a huge bottle neck when upgrading ships after 2-3 of the initial cycles.  Getting to 4-5 is almost end game, yet your ships can't compete against the AIs unless they are top of the line always.  AI always seems to not have to deal with money issues, empire favor, or long research times.  Graphics are very basic.  Terraforming would be great if not for it being at the very end game when you don't need it.  Even on the slowest game setting, game forces you to hurry up and max out everything otherwise your overrun.			"

												not too complex or too simpleRealistic and shows a lot of cool theoretical possibilities that could happen during space exploration such as a planet with a shattered crust allowing minerals to be extracted faster but making transportation on that planet difficult. A more positive effect could be a planet that has rings on it, making it an amazing tourist destination and also brings possibilities as a resource for science.Taking over everyone does take a while, In the real world this is realistic (unless your opponent is France, hahahhaha, sorry I am unoriginal). This also encourages people to try and reach the other victories. Of course taking over everybody is still a viable option for you warmongers.There are lots of events that require moderately tough decisions, sometimes without the consequences not being known.There are lots of risk/reward situations that you can get stuck into, such as researching only missile based weapons to have an incredible advantage in combat, unless of course your opponent has a lot of anti-missile tech.I know ""graphics aren't everything"" but they are pretty nice in the game when you are looking at ships and planets.

												I'm only writing this review to combat all the negative ones I've seen recently. Every single negative review I've read is just complaints about gameplay mechanics from people who clearly don't know what they're doing. Eg. some guy asking why it takes 50 turns to research something far down the line on the tech tree. PS. As you increase your science, it takes less turns to research each tech. The tutorial sucks, yes (if you could even call it a tutorial). But if you've played any 4x games, or take 20 minutes to watch some YouTube videos, it's not that hard to figure out. It's a very enjoyable game if you have the teeniest bit of patience or reading comprehension skills. If not, then this game is probably not for you.			"

Half of the time I was micro managing annoying things (enemies clearly losing fights and fleeing all the time but then ""overpowering me"" in the next system because I moved my fleets to chase them down), refitting ships and reoptimizing planets. Also the diplomacy was pretty much limited everyone declaring war on me all the time because - well I can only assume I was too powerful because I grew too fast.			"

												TL;DR, a solid 4X with a couple unique & nifty features; lacks complexity, but it's at least not mind-numbingly easy. A solid intro to the genre on easier difficulties, and nice for veterans on hard+, definitely worth the price of admission for any fan of the genre...and at least worth a look if you're not, if you can snag it on discount.With three games played and considering a fourth, something about it has me hooked, so I guess that's recommendation enough. This game is feature complete and isn't a platform for 4+ years of continuous overpriced DLC, so there's that too, I guess.This game is the definition of what I think when I hear ""Civilization in space,"" and is just about the same as Civ in how much of a repetitive slog to inevitable victory it is despite its shipbuilding & combat systems, and SUPERBLY crafted factions each with unique art/units/style, backstory, and game mechanics; I fell in love rather quickly. Sadly, as time went on and the veneer of starry-eyed wonder wore off, I discovered that the game ultimately lacks depth, as you end up rushing the same buildings & tech, and falling in line with the same battle strategies regardless of enemy or faction.The Pros?+ The Factions. As stated above, it's clear a lot of time was spent to make them all different, with detailed artwork & backstories, unique models for all faction ship classes, and game mechanics. I'm not just talking superficial changes in how they play, either: unique improvements, tech (and a mixup of where certain tech is in the tree), different specializations on your different ship classes, and a specific set of game rules - not just modifiers, but actual mechanics - endemic to each race that attempt to steer you into a particular playstyle with that race.I mean, this alone makes me start up new games with factions I haven't played.+ The shipbuilding, the real meat that sets Endless Space apart from many 4X games. The ability to personalize every part of your ships' systems and loadouts really adds a personal touch to your empire, and made me feel (rightly or wrongly) that any combat failures were my fault, that any overwhelming/surprising successes were my doing, and not some dickery of the game. There is no inevitability of overwhelming enemy numbers: as the supposed ""weakest"" empire in my first game, my 9 little gunboats held the border against the entire enemy armada from the empire with more than double my score, simply by hardcountering its build.+ The aesthetics. The music definitely fits the whole ""intergalactic space empire vying for supremacy"" thing, and the map, artwork, ship models and planet models are all still a glory to behold, even after all these hours. It's pretty, I guess.The Cons?- You can - and eventually will - be dicked over by the galaxy generator. That's just the nature of the beast, sadly. A crafty player can overcome a bad start position, at least, but if you're looking for a quick game, you'r ebetter off just surrendering and restarting. The AI has deep difficulty in overcoming bad starts; I'm talking entire galaxy arm with less than half of their planets colonized by turn 120 (on normal speed).- Every faction plays the same. ""But what about those different mechanics you talked about?"" Yeah, forget it. Notice how I said the different faction traits ""attempt"" to steer you into certain play styles. Ultimately once you've found your groove and know what works, you'll rush the same techs & improvements every game, regardless of pressure from the game itself to play differently...because there is an optimal way to play, and it just simply works best regardless of the faction.- Combat is dull; you'll want to just autoresolve about 95% of it when you learn what you're doing. Sure, you can pick formations (which determine what your enemy shoots at) and strategies (which determine what you shoot at), and you can select from certain tactics cards to give an edge in a nearly ""rock-paper-scissors"" fashion...but ultimately, ""manual"" fleet control proves useless in a game where combat is just two fleets colliding into each other with no maneuvering, and really only has a use in changing your attack strategy to ""guillotine"" or ""nosebreaker"" when things unexpectedly go♥♥♥♥♥♥up and you try to get as much damage done before inevitable defeat. Even battle tactics become trivial after the early game, as you unlock ones that are just objectively useful in all situations.- The tutorial is objectively♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's pages of text overlaying screencaps of the game, talking you don't understand when you first boot the game. It's 2 hours of reading for an info/text dump that'll just leave you vaguely confused; you're better off finding a friendly FAQ/guide online somewhere...or do as I did, and stumble around in your first game learning as you go.- The shipbuilding. It is vital, a necessity to know what you're doing with ship loadouts in order to survive, & WILL be the cause of you losing your first games. Also, hard-countering your friends is fun. Being hard-countered yourself is not fun, and will will be the cause of much raging and quitting when your entire armada is slaughtered by 9 piddly gunboats.Yeah...I think that's about it. Probably forgot something, but that's what I remember off the top of my head.			"

												After 30 hours (3 games) worth of Endless Space I feel like I've exhausted its options. Maybe that isn't so but after a first runthrough learning the systems I was able to beat the game on easy on my next attempt in about 250 turns. Moving up to normal added little challenge. The game simply ended more quickly because the AI forced my hand earlier on. Strategy games thrive in that thin line between being too simplistic to have lasting appeal and being too complex to learn in the first place. Sadly, Endless Space is both difficult to learn and easy to master. It's the exact opposite of what a game of this sort should be. That said I still had a lot of fun with Endless Space. I liked the addition of hero units to space based TBS Game. It's something common in fantasy titles but not something I had experienced in this specific type of strategy game. The combat to me was pointless. I found a handful of cards that worked and just used them in almost every battle. The AI didn't adapt to this strategy and I found myself easily winning every battle without having to fight it manually. The main issue with the pacing of the game is that once you reach the point where you are close to victory you are so insanely powerful that there is little tension. In my first match on the normal difficulty level I built 4 of the 5 wonders needed to win the game and left the fifth one with a couple turns left to build and enough money to finish it instantly if I needed a quick victory. Meanwhile I also researched every single item on the tech tree but the science victory. I made numerous diplomatic agreements for no reason, getting my score very close to 100, and built up a massive army capable of destroying all of my opponents with ease. Eventually an opposing team got too close for comfort to reaching an economic victory, forcing me to finish my final wonder. But the point is that at the very late point in the game I was at, any victory method would have been viable. I was toying with my opponents. This is something I would expect to be able to do after a hundred or more hours of practice or on an easy difficulty setting. But it seems to me that unlike the best turn based strategy games, focusing on one area (say scientific research) does not have to hinder your abilities in other areas. That takes away from the strategy of the game.So while I enjoyed my three matches of Endless Space, I felt by the end that I had nothing more left to see. I could play as one of the more unique races. I could up the difficulty and see if I could beat a cheating AI, but neither of those prospects excite me greatly. I still play Galactic Civilizations 2 over half a decade after it was released. And in my mind it inarguably remains the greatest sci-fi 4x game on the market.			"

												When you find this game you may think, is it worth it? Well, let's summarize:- This is a new twist in the 4x genre, strategy , civilization in space, whatever suits more to you to understand. The design, music and lore are superb, as everything Amplitude does.   - This game is hard, is hard to understand and hard to master. First games you'll lose, and you may find things you'll consider bugs like being unable to move your fleets or colonize a system, but as many things in this game you'll need some research done to get it to work. Combat is what people complains more about, it's a simplified paper/rocket/scissor game, and by that it doesn't mean is luck related, no, because how you design your fleets and arrange each combat can make you win or lose.- Each faction is unique, and that means you will have to play each game with different approachs. Playing cravers, the locust/hive/insects? Forget about diplomacy, and also your planets wil be consumed in time because your people deplet all resources (which also gives you a boost in production).  Each faction has specific traits and thus each gameplay will be completely different.- The events, systems anomalies (strange things that change the very core of some planets you colonize like strange alien abandoned stations in the orbit or psychedelic atmospheres where everyone is happy because high but improductive) and general game development is simply put the best one I had seen in this kind of games, If you liked Master Of Orion 2, this is the best succesor in the genre.

												Long do 4x space TBS fans await for a true worthy successor of Master of Orion I & 2, and like few decent iterations that spawned over the last 15 years, Endless Space can be .....  ' close to Orion, but not quite '...For an indie production value however, this game shows remarkable efforts put to the overall artistic eye candy, for probably the best looking game of the genre at its release. Micromanagement exhibits several similarities with MoO and various clones, decent throughout but space combat remains shallow despite what the developers wanted to bring with their card system ( long/medium/short range ). Ship design could have been more flexible, few customisable options buried within an unintuitive user interface. Though the AI performs surprisingly well at a strategic level, signs of coding flaws at some tactical level like invasion or ship upgrades offset ( a bit ) an otherwise challenging game even for experienced players. It may be intentional or not, yet the game has a plethora of hidden features and buried formulae that even a ' galactic pedia' from AAA games couldn't cover entirely.Pros: artistic direction; galactic settings; strategic planning; rightly paced micromanagemnt; some specific factions coerce the player to rethink whole new strategy and ways to expand ( namely Harmony, Cravers ); soothing audio track.Mixed bag: AI ( like the vast majority of strategy games anyway ).Cons: generic combat system; user interface ( many fonts too small also ); ship design needs more work; too many ways to win FOR the few ones that really matter for both AI and player; lack of some value to colonizing & terraforming ( untapped potential here ).Bottom line: recommended to hardcore fans of the genre.

												Very well made, polished, graphically pleasing 4X space strategy.From what I gather, developers take player feedback rather seriously, there are even player-suggested achievements or whole race designed by a player (in a competition). This comes through voting (and with Emperor Edition your votes have bigger gravitas, apparently - I haven't tried it myself though). I'm pretty certain this helps with game's balance and also shows in the well designed UI which never let me down (you can easily find info you need and execute orders you want).Well, maybe it's somewhat hard to keep track of enemy fleets and their movement, especially that even if it is turn based, the turns are simultaneous, and you can't zoom out far enough to have eagle eye view of the entire galaxy, but this is somewhat alleviated by the fact that if you do see them, it means you or they are close and the intentions of fleets are pretty clear.As far as 4X space strategies go, this game seems pretty standard and relatively not complicated. This is probably another outcome of quasi-communal design, I'd have to track its history to be certain. But I don't mean this as a bad thing - if anything, this lends itself to the final polish, letting the game stay focused on what it is trying to do. It still does some things its own way obviously, especially interesting feature are heroes who improve efficiency of your colonies or fleets if assigned a post and level up increasing their abilities.  This relatively not complicated approach also means it is a good place to start your adventure with the genre, if you're curious. The learning curve here is not as notoriously steep as usual in such titles (doesn't mean it isn't steep at all, though). And if you already are familiar with the genre you'll feel right at home and still get kicks from figuring out how the things work this time around.			"

												Awesome space 4X game with some interesting new ideas to the 4X genre. If you played Endless Legend, you'll find many things (especially the interface) very familiar. If you can, buy the Gold edition with the Disharmony DLC!Pros:+ Beautiful graphics; every planet and every anomaly has its own awesome visual. And space fights look gorgeous as well+ very clean interface, you normally find all information you need directly on screen or they are at max 1 click away+ very different species with different playstyles; not only will you have technologies that only you can research but also faction traits that require different playstyles. A war driven species won't bloom with diplomacy only. You can create a fraction with your own selection of boni and mali by yourself (though always using the ship design of an existing faction)+ planets and systems that basically become available over time; At first you can only populate very basic and life friendly planet types (like Terran, Ocean, Jungle). Through research you are able to populate lava planets, gas giants or even asteroids. But you always have to keep  in mind the happiness of the population. Just putting ppl on a lava planet because it will give you a lot of production won't work because your happiness will go down and decrease productivity. So you need buildings to compensate that or be lucky to have some anomaly or luxury resource that produces happiness in that system.+ the battle system; while some ppl hate it, I think it is a nice new idea over the old Civ like ""Strenght X vs. Strength Y, so both Units get A and B damage""; first you have to design your ships with modules you have researched (no visual editing though). Each ship can carry a certain tonnage but may have a bonus regarding certain modules. While a bit overwhelming at the beginning it is quite easy (and fast) to do later while you can put of lot of time crunching numbers in it, if you really want. There are no things like firing arcs just basically how much of each weapon (3 types), defenses (for each of the 3 types) and other modules do you want on your ship. Your normal battle ship will have about 2/3 weapons and 1/3 defenses so nothing to worry about if you don't like designing ships. But it is a very tacital element of the game because you can hard counter enemies who focus e.g. on rockets by just using flaks (defense against rockets) and use the rest of the tonnage for weapons. After that you have to put your ships into fleets (each battle is 1 fleet vs. one other fleet) which have limited size but can be increased with technology. The battles themselves are divided into 3 phases: Long Range (rockets will do most damage), mid range (beam weapons are most effective) and close range (fire the ballistic weapons!). During each of these phases both players can use a certain tactic with various boni (e.g. +20% on beam damage or defense). Each tactic can be countered by an other tactic (nullifying its effect) of the enemy which gives the battles another nice tactical layer. While some ppl complain that this is pure luck, I think that it is just the reality of war tactics. Also if your enemy uses e.g. mainly rockets you may have an idea of the tactics he will use. And that also does not mean that a small army can completely annihilate a huge army just by using a ""lucky"" tactic.+ technology tree; there are basically 4 of them roughly focusing on warfare, diplomacy, expansion and science. While you normally do research in all of them (as the technologies get more expensive later on you will naturally research the cheap technologies in the other 3 trees before researching an expensive one in your favorite tree), it will give you an interesting way of focusing your empire on a certain thing. Your enemy may have a blooming economy but if you can get more advanced weapons faster than him, you will get a nice advantage in warfare.Cons:- lack of late game buildings;  sometimes I have the feeling there is barely anything to build on your main systems in the late game except for more ships (or convert production into money or science) as there is not much to build. Many buildings focus on giving you more food on planets that normally produce barely any food and thus allowing for a faster growth but normally most of your systems are maxed out on population by then anyway (but there are exceptions!). In games like Civ, that normally happens more in the mid game where you are doing a lot of war anyway and you always have new wonders to race for.- no allied victory; while you can do alliances with your friends, there is always only one winner at the end of the game. Of course you can just stop playing when you annihilate all other enemies but that does not feel the same. And for e.g. the science victory you can't work together- ship design may be a bit confusing at the beginning; but there are plenty of wikis/forums/videos to help with that.			"

												I bought this for myself as a Christmas Present and so far I'm glad I did. That and it was on special, which swayed my decision apart from the good reviews the game has received. The Tutorial is Ok, and gets you through the basics of the game. I found it pretty easy to come to terms with, and the learning was enjoyable too. I don't want to say much about the graphics, but the game does look good. The research trees are well designed, and with a bit of thought you can quickly open up different planet types for colonisation and before too long you will have a bag of planets under your control. I like micromanagement, and if there is something the game could do a bit better it is that. However, there's plenty to tinker with, and you don't have to worry too much about being crushed early in the game with a bit of planning. Ship design is fairy intuitive, and researching techs gives you advances in that area too. I haven't played it very long yet, but my feeling is that I will be spending quite a bit of my christmas holidays playing this. 3 1/2 out of 5 rubber ducks.			"

  Game Features:   Single Player CampaignNO   Immense Tech TreeYES   Race Strengths/WeaknessesYES   Decent TutorialNO   Real-time CombatNO   Diplomacy at startNO   Customizable fleetsYES The majority of the game plays like a double edged sword. Immense and intricate but then hampers or limits the player in one way or another. For instance not only can't you negotiate at the start of the game, every diplomatic action must be researched in your tech tree before hand. Want to form an alliance? Research first. Open trade routes? Research first. It gets obnoxious when it comes time for trading resources. Say you want to trade X number of your anti-mater for X number of their space peaches.First you have research the ability to recognize anti-mater as a resource and then research the ability to trade it.The same issue happens when it comes to fleet customization. The ability to build your own warships and customize their load out was one of the things that drew me to this game. Cause let's be honest, that's ♥♥♥♥ing cool.You select your chassis and the type of armarments you want. Make a ship that's all offense, all defense, or somewhere in between.The problem comes first with the lack of real-time combat. It's honestly the biggest dissapointment.But you get the option to watch cinematic of the destruction and imagine what it would be like to actually play.Because there's no real-time combat like the Total War series, you can't tell your fleet to target the weakest, strongest, or ship with the lowest current HP. You can't flank, you can't really do much of anything. This could have been solved with more attack formations, but we only get 3.Combat in Endless space is a card game. It begins like this, Select your defensive formation:How your fleet is formed...remember pure defense in front, pure attack in back because the ships in front are targeted first.Select your attack formation:Every ship attacks another ship, 1/3 your fleet engages 1/3 of theirs, all ships focus fire a single ship. Select your special cards.Bascially you pick cards that have special effects like increased accuracy, increased damage, etc.These card effects can be blocked or enhanced based on what the enemy chooses for their 3 cards. I can't stress how depressing this is.Both Medieval 2 Total War and Crusader Kings have strategic positions. Like a portion of land that gives bonuses to attackers or defenders. In  Endless Space the card game option is purely luck based. There is no way of knowing what card your opponent (AI or human) will pick so it's a pure crap shoot.Knetics are hilariously overpowered giving you no reason to use missles or beams which only further limits your strategic options.The faling of Endless Space is the fact that the entire foundation of the game is waiting for upgrades. You can't do anything in this game without researching it before hand. Even something as basic as diplomacy with other factions.			"

												Things to Research:Creating Artificial Atmospheres, Utilizing Perpetual Motion Machines, Harnessing Dark Matter for Manufacturing, Black Hole Mining, Quantum Processing, Inorganic Biology, Negative Mass Mechanics, etc.Making Colonies:Earth-like planets, all metal planets, gas planets, hollow planets, lava planets, also settle on asteroids.Factions to try:Humans, not-humans, robots, religious robots, half human-half robot, mysterious crystal beings, parasetic race of insectoid robots, and Ameabos!Review:The descriptions for the various research alone is enough to keep you occupied for a while... the science-fiction in this game is well thought out, perhaps most of it can even be refered to as speculative science. Since this game takes place in a thousand years (as of this review) the game lends itself credibility by applying current theories and ideas into it's gameplay.If your interested in quantum and theoretical physics, this game has that... if finding out more about exotic biology and ecological systems is fascinating- this game has a whole tech tree dedicated to just that. If researching various ways on exterminating entire armies and fleets peaks your interest, this game has many flavors of science and technology just for that purpose. And of course there's an entire section of diplomacy and trade that you can explore if you prefer to take the non-barbaric route of your empire.Combat is simple, so is creating units... it also wont take 2 hours for a conflct to resolve (infact it usually ends within a handful of turns). Expanding is also really easy, being able to do something is really easy in this game, the difficulty comes from the fact that other players can do a lot just as easily... what it comes down to is who can make smarter decisions.This game is not for everyone... 9/10			"

												TL;DR:If you like 4X games this is a easy pickup. It offers a ton of replayability with custom races and in depth ship design. Combat is shallow and the planetary invasion mechanic is a bit much to handle at first. After a playthrough or two you can easily get the hang of all of it. I would highly recomend it.Pre-face:Before this game I thought 4X was dead, I thought we would never see something quite match the joy I felt when I played Galatic Civiliazations II. Interesting Tidbits:The guys down at Amplitude are not just making a game, the community is also in on it. They have a system called Games2gether where the community votes on features, additions, rebalancing, and even where to go next in the game. The community even got to add its own race, the ""Atomatons"". It's not just Amplitude's game, it's our game.Pros:(+++) Extensive customization(+++) Perfectly realized aesthetic(+++) Constant updates, fixes, and free addons(++) Clean UI and visuals(++) Ability to influence Amplitude's future endeavors(++) Interesting lore and backstory to every aspect(++) Lots of bang for your buck(+) Cheaper then other many other 4X titles(+?) Every one takes their turn at the same timeCons:(---) Multiplayer bugs that cause desynchronization on occasion (on their list of problems they are working on)(---) Performance problems and potential memory leaks(---) AI still having weird quirks and issues. Cheats on higher difficulties(+?).(--) Combat boils down to rock, paper, scissors and offers minimal depth(--) Custom races played to their strengths can demolish any of the pre-existing races(--) Elements of the UI are some times never explained(-) Updates have all but stopped as Amplitude moves towards Endless Legend and DungeonConclusion:This game is truely one of my all time favorite and made me a fan of Amplitude. They handled the community of the game the way all companies should. It's a example of how powerful a player base truely can be, and will continue to be. If you are on the fence about picking this game up, do it, you can thank me later.			"

												Endless Space is a 4x turn based galactic management strategy game with an extentive tech tree, fairly well polished visuals that still look good on low settings and some minimum amount of bugs or glitches. It wasnt always this way and the dev patched at the game quite a long time. Things you would expect in a game like this are present - wonders - different factions - designing your own ships, diplomacy. AI exists in the dumb and adaptative flavors, I keep it at dumb because I am not that great a strategisgt and I learn something new everytime I play the game but its nice to know the option is there. This game also has some mods for it floating out there and the multiplayer is fairly solid me and my mate enjoyed that quite a bit as well... So if you skipped this when it was early acess and never looked back and this falls on your radar again you might seriously consider it. Be advised however that this game favors the empire management and ship designing over galactic battle which are mostly just cinematic with some very light tactical decisions thrown in "

												Fun for you and friends, unique mechanics allow for some sweet gameplay. Has some issues with Windows 10 and certain driver versions. Endless Space 2 is out right now, probably should get that instead since it expanded on this game and has some even cooler mechanics			"

												Quite good space 4X with, as you'd expect, a steep learning curve. A few too many elements are random for my tastes (heroes stats and attributes, wonder placement, number of easily colonizable planets in home system, etc), but overall it's a solid game.			"

												I am a die hard strategy game fan and have played many, if not all, strategy games on steam or elsewhere. Now the mame Endless Space is a worthy name for the game. For it really is endless fun, an endless hours worth of effort which reaps endless amount of joy, (if you dont mind a bit of hard core strategy action every now and then with indie games)                               .--------------------------------PROS------------------------------1.The game has a Hero system which distinguishes it from other strategy base building games. The plus side is you're not bored after long while playing this game,it adds variety to the game play, slightly opens up the multitude of outcomes, and gives a sense of control to the players which is unmatched in the entire game.2.The tech tree is unique in that it has four varieties: diplomacy, applied sciences, military, exploration. Each has its own flavor. Military provides might, diplomacy gives keys to diplomacy, applied science sometimes reveals new resources or helps in development of a star system, exploration lets you colonize new planets and star systems. Together they give a unique blend to the game play.3.Exploration of the galaxy is fun for any newb or experienced player alike                                ---------------------------------CONS-----------------------------1.Some technolgies hold the key to survival. For example if you dont discover wormhole travel you cannot travel to other planets or star systems, similarly if you dont discover applied technologies you are more then likely not going to discover hidden advantages of certain resources.2.The game uses a point system for rating players. Problem is, once your points overtake any of the A.I.s the A.I. attacks you where you're more than likely to lose the war. So its advisable to move ahead of the packAll in all its a 6.5/10 and definitely worth the buy, if you can handle a bit of warfare maneuvers from the A.I. and have the spirit to colonize the galaxy.

												Wow so many negative review suddenly.This game has pretty positive rating for a very long time... until it gets the $1 sale.Honestly most of those negative reviewers only buy the game because it is cheap. They are not veteran 4x/conquest genre players, so it is kinda expected really.Yes, this game isn't exceptionally good, in fact I'd say it's a rather average 4x game overall, but those negative review is unwarranted. It's more like a case of short attention span ""action"" gamer button mashing 8 yr olds trying a slow paced high learning curve turn based strategy for the first time. Let me quote some of the ridiculous review stems from complete lack of experience in playing 4x game:- ""The AI is super unfair. I have a hard time winning on Newbie.""- ""Its ugly. Gameplay seems repetitive with amateur choices and terrible music.""- ""Sometimes a stray ship will come to my planet and offer services or peace but as im reading that text it disappears and end's my turn.""- ""It might be a great game, if you understand it. But the tutorial is terrible.""- ""Bought this game on sale. It's really hard to understand and to learn this.""- ""Game was given to me as gift, best part I found was the return to desktop option.""And these reviews all came from people who played less than half an hour. Really, just go back playing CS:GO or something. Don't crap on games that you don't understand.			"

												Endless Space is a complex, and beautiful 4X strategy game that draws natural comparisons to games like Sins of a Solar Empire (Endless Legend, possibly Civ). If you don't like having to spend possibly hundreds of hours exploring tech trees, managing morale, supply lines, and configuring ship outfits this game isn't for you.My one gripe (with most 4X games for that matter) is that the pace is often (intentionally) slow. Even after learning the mechanics; skirmishes against AI will take multiple hours. This is fine if you plan on casually playing a game over the course of days/weeks/months (which I'm told many people do), but in many cases the larger strategy (i.e. any of the 'X's) will largely overwhelm the rest of the game, to the point that most tactical aspects will feel mechanical, which leads to a lot of largely unfulfilling early games (which will burn 10-50 hours).If you appreciate the zen of turn-based strategy, you'll love this--and for the money, playing this game is effectively identical to Endless Legend (which I believe is currently more expensive).

												I'm not much of a fan of this game. I'm excited for the second one, but this one is pretty boring for me. But that's probably because i'm impatient and hate spending more than a few hours trying to accomplish something. I do however, recommend this title to those who want to spend a long time building an empire and squashing your enemies like the verman they are (chances are it's a very rewarding feeling, but I couldn't stand waiting that long).I don't however recommend getting this for regular price. It's on sale (as i'm writing this) for a dollar and will be so for the next 31 hours. Hurry up and grab a copy or wait until the Steam Summer or Winter Sale.My Rating: 7/10 (Recommended on Sale) "

												I loved Endless Space. LOVED IT. I could play it obsessively for hours on end. I recommended it to all of my friends....notice how that's all past tense though?The game appears to have developed some issues and keeps crashing. It's not the same game when I restart; in-game events get jumbled and it's obvious some of my efforts from previous turns are lost even though the game is supposed to save after every turn. From other reviews I have seen, this is happening to a lot of people and it doesn't look like the developers plan to fix it. Because of this I have lost faith in the company. I don't game often and am picky about which games I'll spend my time on. I'm sad to lose one of the few games I love.If this issue is ever resolved I'll change my review. Until then, I do not recommend this game.			"

												I am a huge fan of turn-based strategy games and science fiction, so games that blend the two are a dream for me. Endless Space is no exception. Using mechanics reminiscent of the Civ series of games, anyone familiar with such should be able to pick up the game easily and anyone not familiar with such will be able to get a feel for it quickly. The game's pace is solid, and in my experience the AI is able to present a challenge if you so desire. The best aspect of the game, in my opinion, is the customization. The ability to create your own factions, using in game factions as a template and then manipulating perks and flaws, is outstanding; I'd say it's virtually a guarantee that you'll be able to make something that fits your playstyle. The in-game system for putting together your own starships is also solid, giving an interesting tactical diversity for the game's fleet-based combat system. All in all this is an excellent purchase, well worth the cost.			"

												In my opinion the best 4x game since GalCiv II. There are 10 factions with unique techs, shipdesign and raceutilities (like cloning, locust swarm,...) in the main game and one more in the DLC. Each of them plays different and uses a very balanced concept of fighting for their goals. Like in common 4x games there are warlike, economic, diplomatic and scientific races which all try to reach their prefered kind of victory condition. But here all of them are also able to defend themself which increases the difficulty of the game even against peaceful neighbours. The game itself plays like the most known 4x games where you have to colonise planets, build lot of improvements on your systems and finally create a fleet to defend your worlds. Each part of this is well balanced and keeps interesting even in late game. The Heroes which improve your fleets or systems with unique boni increase the impact of your choices and add an important and interesting point while playing.The shipbattles are a little bit more tricky then in older 4x games because it isn't all about numbers. The battle runs in timebased turns where you could give a main order to your ships (like focus first ship, spread fire ect.) but you do not directly controll your ships (like you did in Armada2526). The fight will be simulated with your orders. The battle card system (tactical options for each turn like sabotage, weapon overload) are hard to understand during the first game but after some time you learn what is important in which turn. The biggest advantage of Endless Space is the battle grafic which is amazing and unchallenged in classic 4x games. The overview grafic is also absolutly okay and after some time even the interface that may be confusing during the first turns becomes absolutly useful. The soundtracks fits well in a spacegame and give you the right feeling while playing. People who like 4x games and could handle to lose against an AI should buy this really amazing game. And yes, the AI is really hard and you will need some time to handle the game even on easy or normal. But for patient players that take the time to learn it will be a game for many, many hours.			"

												This is actually a pretty good game. Endless Space is a Real Time Turn Based Science Fiction Strategy. Yeah, something like that. Basically turns happen simultaneously and next turn begins when everyone clicks ""end turn"". You have quite a lot of races to choose from, and if you don't like them you can create your own races from the other races' set parameters.The first thing that hit me is that the lore of the Endless universe is absolutely stunning and well thought out. They have many mainstream sci-fi cliches but also very creative and sometimes funny technology tree. The first time you play this game you would think that it has a storyline due to the immersion and random events etc. The scope of the game, within some couple hundred games, is huge: you evolve from a species habiting one single fluffy terran/jungle/ocean/arid planet in a faraway galaxy into a galactic superpower with the ability to colonize gas giants and tear down space-time. What I really like is that they have actually managed to keep the game interesting even into the late game. For example, your population can be hard to manage, at least in the start (you can't expand too quickly or they will get very unhappy), but they won't get pushy and won't drag you to too many details. One way they have done this is that battles are pretty straight forward and there's really no strategy there, except good scouting and finding out how your adversary is equipped so you can counter him/her in the rock-paper-scissors battle mechanic. Hero is a must in a battle, and heroes can really boost your stuff, also when assigned as planet governors.On higher difficulties and versus multiple enemies a lot of things are luck based. You can simply end up in a bad spot with a cheating AI with no way out. Also the fact that moving of ships & battles is somewhat weird, it actually happens in real time, and is not turn based is a pretty stupid mechanic especially vs AI. Sometimes you would want to move ships between fleets before combat but you can't because the other player forces you to enter combat. I suppose the point here is to cut waiting times in multi player so that turns can happen simultaneously. I have not played MP so I can't say anything about that, although I would ""guess"" that the game's balancing probably favors single player. In single player you can easily beat all opponents on easier difficulties, but the game gives you lots of options for handicapping yourself. Too bad that AI is mostly quite stupid, and like many other games, higher difficulties only give bonuses for AI and handicaps for the player or make the AI cheat but I guess that's the only way to make challenging AI's in strategy games... One real point of discontent is the planet menu, it is really hard to organize when you have a lot of things queued, and there is no ""bring to top of queue""-button. This is really frustrating if you want to manage things yourself. You can always automate buildings though, but it's not very feasible if you are playing vs 8 AI's in endless difficulty and need to be pretty precise about things. In the trading system the AI is pretty smart though, and is really difficult to cheat.Ok, so I wouldn't pay 20€ for this game, but definetely recommend it especially if you get it on sale. If you are looking for the ultimate competitive strategy experience, then I don't think that this game is it. However, it can be quite fun to play. I also have Dungeon of the Endless and recommend that as well.			"

												The learning curve is steep, but the game itself is a lot of fun - if you're patient and have played strategy games before, anyway. It definitely isn't an 'intro to the genre' title. It can get tedious as you move through the campaign but there's lots of cool detail and lore throughout. Combat is probably my least favourite aspect - I find most of the battles slow and pretty boring. I'm more fond of this game than the review makes it sound - but it's definitely a niche title.			"

												really quick if you like 4x games but hate the combat (playing out the fights yourself you might like this game for you I recommend the game)What can I say I really wanted to like this, and I do like most of it. It does have that just one more turn feeling going on and there is a lot of options to play around with, but even after playing for hours I came away feeling cheated. Cheated because I have bascially no control over what happens durring battles. you send your fleet against another fleet pic a battle plan (which are like rock paper scissors defense beats offense, sabatoage beats defense) then you just watch as the battle is played out with no control at all. I repeat again there is absolutly no control over battle besides picking stragegy cards for long range combat, medium range combat and short range combat. It also gets so annoying when you are trying to attack and get rid of an enemy fleet and they just keeping fleeing combat then jumping to another of my stars where they try to invade. I go over attack them they run away and set up shop and my next closes star system. I clearly over power them and I have to chase them around. Some times I had a higher level hero (lv 23) vs (lv 13) hero and my fleet is a bigger stonger fleet and I lose. All because the choice of the wrong staragegy card means I lose my entire fleet. This is just so annoying because I had no control. I could take it if I had lost because I messed up the battle myself but losing with superior force and a higher level hero that I had level up to specialize in combat to be my main general while not having much control over it just makes me say no thanks.

												.:. Endless Space: Disharmony .:. Revised: 10/5/14(newly included suggestions to the developers of ES, Amplitude Studios)-Civilization in Space!  Beautiful Graphics, 4X, Addictive (...just, one more turn, appeal), terraform planets within star systems, within a customized galaxy of different sizes, types, age, and more.  -Compete for planets, resorces, influence, military dominance, technological supremacy, or become a galactic trade empire.   The player has the ability to terraform gas giants to colonizing ocean planets, this game has it all.  -Civilization + Space = Endless Space!!!  This game is a must for every Civilization fan that would like a unique Civ-esque experience in space. Music is soothing, graphics are beautiful, unlimited replay value allowing the User to change their Civilizations characterics making for a unique experience each playthrough.***Warning:   This game may is highly addictive and may be a life/relationship killer.  Yes, it's that addictive!  Be warned!!   I highly suggest watching Arumba's Playthrough on youtube, if you are on the fence about aquiring the game... I bought it before I made it all the way through his the 3rd video and I'm in love with this game.     Arumba's Endless Space - Disharmony - (playlist):

			Views: 159,830		

			Let's Play Endless Space! This is the new expansion for Endless Space: Disharmony. This play-through is as the new playable race, Harmony.		

________________________________________________________________________________Suggestion(s) to the Developers:From what I've read, this game has been put, ""on the shelf"" for now, and will NOT be getting updates until after EL is released...  'Endless Legend' is finally out and 'Endless Space' still needs some TLC (ie. patching/updates, make the game more conducive to modding.  I've only been able to find 3-4 mods for this game.  If you are no longer supporting a game, allow for an effective modding scene.Please maintain Amplitude Studios' good name; abandoning all support in lieu of creating a newer game is a terrible longterm business strategy and ultimately self-sabotaging.  Why is this bad for business?  Simply put, this business model is completely unsustainable.People will not continue to buy games from a company/developer that has a reputation for abandoning support for current games and are still charging $$$ for.  Why would anyone with any sort of rational mind want to buy a game or product from a company/develepment team known for abandoning perfectly good projects barely a year old.  If you want to make a good name for the 'Endless' franchise, your customer base needs to come first, and be able to trust the fact that you support and stand behind all your products, not just 'new releases.'I am interested in purchasing 'Endless Legend,' but I won't even consider it until I know this company supports all products it currently charges $$$ for including the existing release in 2013 of 'Endless Space.' Once support resumes for 'Endless Space' and it gets a few much needed updates, I would support and purchase 'Endless Legend' or any other Amplitude Studios' game for that matter.   By this time, you will have earned my brand loyalty... and I know I'm not alone in my sentiment.  Endless Space's has so much potential,  Sure, the AI needs to be reworked.  But please, for the love of all that's good,  DON'T forsake your current player base, it's bad business.  I've seen many developer's with great potential, fall by the wayside because they do not provide continued support for their products or opt to make new games, instead of fixing current ones.Studio's... small and large: in  favor of short term profit gains via newly released games/products, rather than making existing games work properly is not a sustainable business model.  You will lose brand loyalty, and brand loyalty is a major factor in the gaming industry upon release(s) or newer games/products.With trust comes loyalty.  Loyalty = Sales.  ex. I have so much loyalty to the Civilization franchise, I felt confident pre-purchasing their newest game, Civilization: Beyond Earth without playing it or even watching a playthrough for release on October 24, 2014.Until then, I'll play ES.... (hoping) for an overall update that improves AI mechanics, as well as other minor tweaks.... this would restore my faith in Amplitude Studios and give me hope for the future of this, potentially, promising studio.

												A damn fine and outside-the-box piece of work without proper multiplayer. I mean, stomping AI, while designing ships and getting through random events is fun (hey, Sid, more fun than your latest) interesting faction balance and some planetary development (though I personally wish there was more to it than just choosing a type and watching blockade rings). Still, singleplayer is nice.And yeah, soundtrack looks good, but I'm not that much into ambient, so...maybe only ambient there wasn't such a good idea.			"

												Endless Space is a Strategy/Empire Simulation. It has a lot of similarities to Master of Orion or other Space Empire Sims. Often the question arises if this is a worthy heir to an old name, in this game you can say - it is. It's even better than the original series in some aspects. The 4x genre has many stars, one of them is here.  Now for a more in depth look.Graphics/Artworks: They are fitting and atmospheric to this game, of course there is room for improvement but the game is in many aspects an eyecandy. The artworks of the different races are also a good atmospheric stimulus to what to expect during the run with your choosen race. Of course, at times this games sometimes looks like a MoO 3 clone at times, and this was giving me sometimes a hard time.Music/Soundeffects: Ok, we are decades now out of the beep, beep, beep sound of Convox and I am very happy about that. This game has a thick, atmospheric background sound. The sound effects fit to the game and don't disturb the flow of the game. Sometimes this game has a meditative stance.Playability: The game is for 4X quite easy to learn, yet hard to master, even in a small galaxy with only few other competition the game can quite easily overwhelm you, if you don't build your strengths to the right degree. Balancing the different aspects of research, industry, resources and budget can get you into a good deep mess at times. And it is for each of the races quite different, yes, in this game it can be challenging to choose from the different races. You can sometimes ponder a long time over a decission on your turn - and still not be sure if you choice was dictated by wisdom or foolishness. Genre and Developement Issues: The game is, like some of it's predecessors a turn based strategy and exploration game, exploration though, as in this type of game typical is only superficial, you can't enter the planets surface and look for strange alien artifacts, strange alien lifeforms and so on ... therefore the so often typed 4X is kind of a stereotype. If you loved Master of Orion, Pax Imperia, Ascencion or other games of that type that come in your mind, you might be on a good way with this game - it offers endless hours of fun, has a great replayability value and a very customizable universe. The mix of races is good, you can choose between very different stances of gameplay, just by the the choice of race. There were and there are still some bugs in the game, they are minor and mostly don't disturb the gameplay - some of them are only cosmetic issues.Value: At 30 € this game might seem expensive, but - it has a lot of hours with great and wonderful gameplay to offer. The price ""might"" seem steep, but it is still worth the money - especially for fans of this genre. I can recomend this game. It's a must if you loved the MoO series or you are a Science Fiction fan.			"

												""Endless Space"" is a very interesting and fun game. It's almost like nothing you've ever played before. OK, sometimes, it might remind you of the ""Civilization"" series, but, a little more detailed and complicated. Of course, I do like its concept  myself, so I'm totally into it.The graphics are beautiful. The player can pick any kind of galaxy out there and a faction with balanced pros and cons and achieve different types of victories. Scientific, economic, military...Another amazing thing is the game's music. I'll say no more about it, just take a look at YouTube by yourself.I'll add that the game has a mythology of itself, which makes it unique and not some simple TBS with nothing much to offer.One last thing that amazes me, is the research behind the game. It seems like the developers trully gave their best so as not to fall in the waters of pseudoscience. Thus, the technologies are actual (present day) ideas and  theories, somewhat futuristic and simplified but real! So, the player will find teleportation, wormholes, black holes, Casimir effect, quantum entaglement and stuff like this that can make a Science student go mad!There are only two things that bother me:  (a) The Tutorial. It's not messy but it's a lot of information at once, without giving the player the chance to practice it,  a bit. Someone might get overwhelmed but you get used to the game pretty quick. It could be better, though.  (b) The Battles. They don't occur the ""usual"" (whatever that means) way, but it's all about advancing technologically, picking Heroes as Admirals, having a few ships and most importantly (!) picking the right cards. I've never played anything like this before and I know that the developers don't have unlimited money, time and mood to create a game *that* much detailed, without disappointing the consumers, but, in general, yes, battles could be a little more *alive* and a little more simple!Nvertheless, I do recommend it! It will be an unforgetable experience!Have fun!			"

												An enjoyable space 4X game, but unless you're playing in MP, it's 'workmanlike' rather than stands out.  I enjoyed my time in it, but it felt too skewed towards the early game (it's tough early, but once you're out in front, then there's really no stopping you, so the last 75 per cent of the game is no challenge - or you get smashed early and the game's over - or it's easy early, and then crazy easy for the rest of the game), and could have done with more work balancing the strategic AI and the difficulty curve over the length of the game.  Would recommend trying the devs later stuff first, and hoping they refine the single-player game in the upcoming Endless Space 2.			"

												The game is enjoyable. Nice graphics and gameplay. Factions made nice. Interesting storyline. Lot of to do in game even from the start it's seems easy. The game not over after you death. No lines in the game, do what ever you want. Go where you want. No limits. It's take long time to finish the game, but easy to be killed. Nice peacufull agreement. Nice ships. I give it 10/10. Don't be clever from the start, it's only beginning. Buy this game if you like strategy 4x, turn style game + if you have lot of time. I don't have lot of time to play game so I am not enjoying it's enough. I can see people get lot of hours in this game, so it's really playable game.			"

												Good game, nice music, the battles are well rendered, but I found it somewhat underwhelming, personally. I feel that: - The events lack ""punch"". Important things happen, but there's just a pop-up with some text. - The heroes lack personality. - The factions and races, while they do each have their interesting peculiarities and quirks, don't have these elements transpire much in the game play.Overall a nice entry in the space strategy universe, but I feel like it should have more content. I guess that's what Endless Space 2 will provide.Still a good game though, and if you are into this genre, this is definitely a title you won't want to miss.7/10 from me.			"

												Great turn based game similar to Civilization, but in space. The game has star lanes. Colonizing planets is the key to victory. Of course, you get to build each start sytem up with structres. All buildings in a system affect the entire system.Designing start ships is fun. Tactical battles are good, you get to watch the battle. Cards are chosen for the three different phases, long, medium and short. Planetary invasion is both bombardment based (takes time) and troop based (instant results).Endless Space has a nive lineup of races to choose from. Also, Heroes become available in the game as you play. They can be assigned to fletts or planetary systems. Either way, the heroes definitely have an impactEndless Space is not a short game, and is fun if you like building things and sci-fi in space.			"

												*I dont write many reviews, so this one may not be the most professional*I personally love strategy games and this is no exception to the long line of games that I would play over and over again. It is very polished and has sort of a civilization feel to it, because games can last for days or hours, and that is only half the fun.The atmosphere of the game changes even time you play because you can customize your own faction and no two universes are ever the same making for some intense fights for dominiation. Even though I haven't played the multiplayer much, for the time I have played it, it has been very fun and addicting. And did I mention the space battles are totally epic? When you dual with other factions, and their ships, you watch the battles in a movie-like fashion as they pound away at each other, and hopefully blow up in the end for a huge display of light and shrapnel. So if you decide to get this game I hope you have a lot of time on your hands because conquering the universe isn't something that happens overnight.  "

												I finally decided to buy this game. And I don't regret any minute I have spent in it, since. It's a beautiful game and you can see that the Devs really did care about it. Every Description in the Tech Tree offers a great understanding of what you are actually researching there and I also love the small details, that when you reduce the anomaly of a planet, in this case Meteor Strikes, that it actually names the scientist who had the idea to fight back against this force of nature. Or  when something bad happens in your Galaxy, you are able to blame it on Scientist XYZ. It's just beautiful. Furthermore the humor in some texts, or the way the AI replies to your offers, it's just great. Not to mention this is the only 4X Games which's Soundtrack I can actually stand. Furthermore, this game has a lot of details, that show how your Population reacts to certain things, and everything is understandable, and you know why they are feeling so.And last but not least, FREE DLC. There is only one DLC that costs you something. Disharmony, which is a great DLC which offers a different perspective of the game. But the rest? You get in Updates. New Factions, new Gameplay Mechanics. For nothing.All the factions you can play, are quite unique. (From generic humans, to giant amoebas to robots, who want to terraform every planet in the Galaxy, you have everything) And each of them plays differently. For example you can go full-war with humans, as they are a war nation, but with a scientific faction, your ships are slightly worse than the ones of the humans, so you rather go the diplomatic way.But of course, this game has some downsides. For example the System of how battles work. Two fleets meet, and when you start the battle, you have to chose Tactic Cards on what your fleets should do, like a Rock-Paper-Stone IN SPACE. But yeah, it's really weird, and it's more luck than anything else, especially if you go against another player.Also, what I disliked about the Population System is that it doesn't matter if you are at war or not, that even after 300 lost battles no voice of protetst is  to hear. (This is more of a personal opinion than anything else, but eh.) So you could have an eternal war and your people simply don't care. I hope they add this little immersive feature in a later update.  Overall: A great 4X Game, maybe the best out to date! I can just recommend it! It's tons and tons of fun!			"

Aside from managing the resources on your planets, your Space Ship Fleets are your funtime to defend/attack/ and expand your empire.  But I have found a lot ot the time my Fleet gets stuck, I cannot move it, and in reading the forums, I am not alone.  This is no little bug, it totally ruins the game.  Sadly, I am done with it.			"

												This is a superb game, it lives up to its name Endless Space. It truly takes you to the space you are exploring, there is a learning curve that some will have difficulty with but once you get the hang of how everything works, you'll spend hours playing this game. I've made tea and it was cold before i took a sip, I was surprised because it seemed like minutes had gone by but it had been 9 hours. The game is truly immersive and I highly reccomend it. I would play with friends though because the AI is programmed to win, and unless you are a crazy good straegist you will ultimatly loose. Just remember to have fun, and experiment with all of the races and even create your own and figure out what works and what doesnt.			"

												The combat isn't very deep, but why would you expect it to be on a 4x game? Nobody complains about the combat of Civ being weak, because the combat isn't the main part of the game. This game is very much about the management of your empire, and strategic use of your forces to deter the enemies. The actual tactical view of the space battles is just icing on the cake, and it is absolutely stunning to watch, and you can directly see what effects your ship upgrades have on the battle.			"

												Simply put ES is a reasonably well-designed 4x game. The fact that it's space orientated probably suckers me in more than most. It's nice to look at, being able to customise your own empire and game settings, and the diversity of play-style involved is all very nice. The battles at first i thought would be an issue but as you get into it, it's quite easy to understand that the developers have thought it through so that battles in the late game can be auto'd quite successfully to save on turn time using a form of rock-paper-scissors approach with cards, while some can be manually done to watch the pretty explosions. The UI is very intuitive to use, provides all the information you need to cut down the micromanagement needed to a level of enjoyment and not tedium and I love the system view used in this game.I spend most of the play time on the expansion ES: Disharmony which has expanded on the core idea quite successfully IMO and adds some nice features such as the Harmony race and I'm enjoying trying to get achievements, experience different play-styles and fine tune my custom race, something that this game does really well...... ..BUT...As much as I like this game there are some glaring flaws that must be mentioned. Firstly, the tech tree is not nearly as large or diverse as I would like it to be. It's really easy to finish which is disappointing and I don't like the military tree. The weapons only have a few levels each of which consists of a weight reduction / power increase which is too simplistic an approach and kind of cheapens the combat thereafter. The techs themselves have massively misleading names; eg Dark Energy Shield - immediately you think ""woah, that's gonna be good"" but it only unlocks an armour module which does what? More defence power, more ship hp, the same as the rest of them. Only a little bit of variety would add a really nice twist. Invading systems is in the firing line next. For such a neat ship-combat system this game lacks an invasion system at all really. It consists of; put invasions modules on ships, go to system, invade, wait. You have no influence over the invasion whatsoever which can be a major pain in some games when you need to make key moves quickly and you're held back by invasion speed. Once you research into troops you can bypass this by directly invading with a % chance to succeed but this itself is flawed because by replacing a couple of siege modules with troops and maintaining moderate amounts of siege ships you can insta-take systems quite easily, swinging to the other extreme.No culture-flipping / major effects of influence is disappointing personally. Lovely way to add pressure to empires without using guns and hulls that could be implemented that isn't currently. I've heard a lot of knocks at the diplomacy system, I don't think I notice / care with how I play but might be worth investigating if you do because it is quite simplistic compared to something like MOO.Having said all of that, it might be easy to think this game isn't worth it but I think it is. Yes it needs some TLC and I hope the developers are interested in providing some but for now it has entertained me for over 120 hours and I get bored quite quickly of things so to me that's a success.My suggestion if you are thinking of buying it, read more reviews, watch a let's play or two on youtube because I did and I found that very helpful in making up my mind.

												Endless Space, where to start with this one...well to start it is a game I can't recommend to everyone. This game is a great 4x strategy game in my opinion but for some people who like to get instant satisfaction when playing games such as shooters will not enjoy this. This is because Endless Space is slow it isn’t something you can go in and expect amazing entertainment from instantly. This is the type of game that you must invest yourself in and while I find that easy and have easily put 100+ hours into it I do know of others and people who have or would easily get bored with this. Now with that out of the way let’s talk about the game. It is amazing I absoluetly love it if you have played any other space strategy game they usually have a focus towards combat or a fast paced destruction mechanic and while this games combat is similar the core of the game is focused on exploration and colonization not war. Its soundtrack compliments this very well and it is a big relief to see a game focused more on exploration just like galactic civilizations 2 was. Not much more needs to be said about this game other than that the combat scenes are very enjoyable to watch and the AI on higher difficulties will give you a run for you money. With each play through I have I always learn something new and while everyone has their strategies there is a lot of depth in how these games play out. So to sum it up yes I definitely recommend this game to strategy fans because of its great gameplay focused on exploration, its amazing soundtrack and the combat sequences which are very fun to watch.

I especially like the ship customisation in the game allowing really in-depth decisions on how to build your fleet.The only real issue I had is with the combat system feeling lacking, all you can do is select which card you want to use and watch the ships just pummel eachother. Which is entertaining but I really like the way Total War games and similar products allow you to command your forces on the field. A similar option here or atleast more control over the course of the battle would be nice.Over all a good game if you want a space, TBS.			"

												From the rubble of MOO3, comes a spiritual successor to shake the brittle foundations of the 4X world. Little did they know that is was ACUTALLY out of this world! Not only toppling the foundations but sending it at ftl speed into the infinite cosmos. Endless space, infinite fun. (infinity technically not possible, results may vary)			"

												This game requires some time to understand and play. I HIGHLY recommend doing the tutorial they provide, if you are familiar with games such as Empire at War, then you will have an easier time playing. Same concept. You pick one of 10 factions, plus with the Disharmony DLC you can create your own faction. To win a complete game, you must acheive one of the following: Scientific, Diplomatic, Economic, Miltary, or Wonder. it is ideal to choose the Victory type parallel to your faction's focal point. Your ultimate goal is to search for the Fabled Augria, one of the many wonders in the game, once found and colonized you can achieve your Wonder Victory. Onto to the ship building and fleet managing, If you crave for war, go for the advanced hulls. Every RTS has a Unit CAP, this game's cap depends on the research you have invested into economics and military. Ship creation, is completely customizeable. Fleet managing is where its a pain. Over population of ships causes upkeep increase. PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR TAX RATE AND YOUR SYSTEMS HAPPINESS!!!			"

												It is a simple, but yet complex strategy game. + Fun to play, + Addctive and easy to master, mediocre to learn+ The fractions are well designed.+ Exploration, strategic rescorces and planet positions are key elements- Lacks good multiplayer co-op options (team victory does not excist) - Some minor glitch/bugs here and there- End game chart is way to simple. - The computer AI is moronic in easier levels and ""cheats"" in higher. Nautral opinions: When understanding the ship design and battle chart you can win against stronger enemies very easily. It's good to feel overpowered even when the enemies are surperior, but it makes the game way to easy if you're equal or better around mid game.Recommend to start with ""United Empires"" as your first time fraction. ""Harmony"" last.			"

												Endless Space is a pretty great game... I love the strategic turn based mode and the more tactical battle mode, when you and enemy fleets collide in sometimes massive battles... The only thing that I'd like as an improvement if there were MORE ship types... Weapons for two ships to get more personal then just point blank shooting (Like boarding parties, or drills)... Another type of beam, like, solid beams you see in movies/games like Star Trek; lasers... And last but not least, atmospheric and land combat with ships (Orbital bombardment support), Fighters/Bombers and land based units, like troops, just like the space battles, but on land, air and sea... I just constantly wonder if this is too much to ask for.			"

												Endless Space is a turn based strategy game. You can choose from any of the default factions or you can even make your own. In a game you can choose to be a good person and tax your people lightly and make peace with everyone you meet or you can be a bad person and tax your people heavely and conquer everyone you meet and in the process take control of the entire galaxy. You can also edit your ships. You can choose between what class of ship you want it to be and you can edit how much shielding and weapons will be on each ship.			"

												For anyone enjoying 4X games, Endless Space is deffinitly worth a look. As many reviews say: this game does many things right: inlcuding the good tool-tips and intuitive gameplay. Space combat, which has players ""playing cards"" from a deck of strategies, in the hope of canceling the opponet's strategies out, may not be everone's cup of team, but those who want to build an empire and wish not to have to bother too much with the whole space combat malarcy, it may actually be an advantage - add to that that the space combat graphics are pretty ;)Overall the graphics are very nice and detailed, without ever becomming intrusive or distracting. And of course: the races are interesting and the ability to create one's own species is a given.			"

												I enjoy 4X games live Sid Meiers Civ, Superpower 2, Anno series and I think Endless Space is similar to them, with its own unique space premise.My first game was a 1V1 as United Empire against Horatio. I expanded fast and got a supremacy victory. I thought, well shizzle - lets keep playin. The Horatio struck back as my happiness index caught up with me and I was screwed.This taught me that there is a lot more depth to the game that the tutorial doesn't cover. I read 3~4 guides, made a custom race and started pwning on normal difficulty. A typical game would run for 8+ hours.I haven't tried multiplayer yet, I don't like to lose against real people. The novelty of the game is starting to fizzle after 60 hours of game time - but I think I can extend it by using a save editor to build custom maps and go against harder difficulty AI.			"

												If I had to describe this game in one phrase it would be ""difficult to learn, fun to master"". I bought this game about a year ago and after getting absolutely stomped by the AI on easy mode several times, I dropped it to go back to 4X games whose mechanics I understood. However, after playing the absolutely superb Endless Legend from the same developer, I decided to revisit Endless Space. After consulting some online tips and running a few games on very easy mode, I became comfortable with the game's unique resource system and asymmetric factions. Speaking of asymmetric, it really is incredible how differently the playstyles of the game's 12 factions vary. The factions of Endless Space aren't simply separated by buffs to certain resources, but rather by drastic and often game-altering differences in resource mechanics that somehow manage to maintain a semblance of balance against all odds. While this game doesn't have the replayability of a game like Galactic Civilizations 3 or the visual style of its successor Endless Legend, it can offer massive amounts of fun and satisfaction to those willing to learn the ins and outs of its gameplay. I'm currently dominating in normal mode with my custom faction and thinking of moving up to hard difficulty, and I recommend that any fans of strategy games give this one a try.			"

												This is an amazing 4x space strategy game.  The best thing that I can say about it is that it *feels* complete.  In other 4x games there's always a system or an aspect of the game that's superfluous or just tacked-on.  Here, everything has it's place, there are no bad factions and no victory strategies that are unsupported.  The game looks great.  The clean visuals are great and the ui doesn't get in the way or drown you in spreadsheet data.The combat is interesting and strategic.  You can *steal* a victory with superior strategy, and you never feel like the AI lucks out when they do the same.This may be my favorite 4x.  It's competing with Civ 4 for that spot.  I can't say enough how good it is.			"

												A classic: loads of (patient) fun. Solid AI. Complex without being frustrating to learn. Nice graphics too.Only notable drawback is (like a lot of 4X games) the end-game can become dull because you've built up so much strength that knocking down the rest of the dominos is basically just a formality; something to balance the scales a bit more at that point would have been great.

												Alltime love favorite together with Elite Dangerous. I could not immerse myself in any 4x this much since Imperium Galactica 1 and 2.And even today, throwing some AA and AF on it from the GPU driver, it is the best SHIP-PORN after Endless Space 2. No 4X looks better in this respect. Beautiful! Especially in 4k. I thought at least Stellaris would overcome it or GCIII or anything but no. Not at all! The new Master of Orion comes close, but come on, that is not as serious a title as this one =)If you want a long, deep, complex game, turn off point and income victory, throw in all the opponents and generate a medium map. You have a month to think :P			"

												This game is great. If you like Civ, you're probably going to like Endless Space.ProsEmpire Management: Pick a race and conquer the galaxy. Or, get so much money that nobody wants to touch you because you ARE the economy. There's even an option to become so scientifically advanced that the mortal shells known as bodies become superfluous. No matter how you want to do it, managing your resources and building infrastructure and fleets is up to you.Space Battles Look Epic: Even on low quality, space battles look awesome. Prepare to witness all of the nonsensical explosions you can handle.Custom Races: Not happy with the default races? Feel free to make your own.Tech Tree: Research how to get along with your neighbors or destroy them? Research how to expand your empire or build on what you already have? The choice is yours.ConsSmall Fleets: Space battles may look amazing, but you can only really have about 15 ships in a fleet, max. Cool, but small scale.Overly Simplistic Combat: Combat consists of 3 phases where you and your enemy select a tactic. The result is either a Spaniards vs. Aztecs situation where you win due to vastly superior technology, or, if your opponent is your technological equal, the combat devolves into rock-paper-scissors.Gets Bogged Down Easily: New games are slow to start up, but afterwards load in like a dream... At least until ~turn 80, where loading times are nearly equivalent to new game load times. Loading times between turns go from 2 seconds to almost 2 minutes if enough is going on. "

												I'm so fascinated of games about space. When I've read the title ""Endless Space"", I expected exactly some kind of space sandbox game, I was wrong but it became better.In a nutshell, it's Civilization V but with systems and planets, with the whole galaxy as a map.In my first games, I sucked so much, I was the typical noob who was doing stupid things without reading any kind of guide. Then I watched some walkthroughs, I was like ""Ohh, that's how you do it..."" and everything else. I still don't have any Diplomacy Victory, but I'm working on it. :DAnyway, like any game, I was learning the hard way how to do stuff, how population works, how to build better warships... In the end, you have to be fast, efficient and creative. You need to know where to drop the next colony ship, you need to know how to balance your resources, you need to know when to attack and when to invade (I'm talking about the Disharmony version, not the classic one), you need to get along with other races...Ah, the races... Each empire is one race, and each race has a different set of skills that makes the game more balanced than ever. The Sophons (my faved one) produce more science points if you have low taxes, the Amoeba starts with the whole galaxy map known, the Harmony (another faved of mine) don't use Dust and approval points, and the Cravers can't be at peace with other factions.If all this doesn't make the game awesome, the Lore inside the game about the Endless and other stuff will probably make this game more awesome. :PI'm not a journalist or anything, so I wouldn't be capable to give this game any rating, what I'm going to do is this:IF YOU LIKE...-Games with space setting-Turn-based strategy games-Explore the gameplay through several races/empires...THEN YOU'LL LIKE THIS GAME.

												Endless Space is a a very satisfying entry in the 4x genre.In generalities of 4x - it's a turn based genre where you explore a grid, find juicy spots to expand your empire, research new technologies that can do all sorts of neat things. And of course there are up to 7 other races/species/civilizations doing the exact same thing and when you come into contact there can be peace, trade, and friendship - or lasers, bombs, and death. What really distinguishes Endless Space from games like Civ is a more dynamic and challenging AI. The AI is aggressive, but rational. You can generally tell almost exactly when an AI is going to declare war on you just using common sense - they spot some sweet weak spots in your territory, they're running out of territory and you border them (and are weak), and so on. And the AI is very challenging, but fair. Some games like civ cheat during the game to keep the AI competitive. So for instance if you're far up on technology the AI will simply start granting itself new technologies for free to keep up. You won't see that in this game. The AI on higher difficulties gets boosts to his rates of production, but otherwise plays by the exact same rules as you. This opens up lots of fun and dynamic possibilities. For instance advanced ships require various sorts of unique materials for production. Cut off an opponent's source of this material and you can bring his military industrial complex to a screeching halt.The big downside of the game is in the combat system. While ship design and fleet organization is a lot of fun and very interesting - combat itself comes down to picking from some relatively uninteresting cards which come down to a frustrating and boring system of roshambo or paper, rock, scissors. Another small issue is a lack of polish. The in game skill tree for the heroes is incorrect and outdated, and there are various little annoying bugs. For instance if you alt-tab in the game, the game will consider alt as being constantly pressed. All you need to do is press alt again to fix this, but the lack of polish here and there really adds up.That said I think this game has already overtaken Civilization and there are many ways it could be greatly improved and expanded upon. I'd strongly recommend this title and I expect to see more great things from this series with Endless Space 2.			"

Also, game length is always long. a good session against easy ai will not finish in a couple hours.Defenitely get the expansion pack, it makes combat smoother and it rebalances alot. you have to relearn the game if you play with the dlc later. worth it!11/10, one of my best purchases on steam!█▀▀ㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ▀▀█▀▀ㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ █▀▀▄ 　 ▀▀█ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ █ㅤㅤㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ ㅤ █ 　 ▀▀▀ㅤ▀ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤㅤ ▀ㅤㅤ ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤ █▀▀ 　 ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ▄▀▀▄ㅤ█▀▀▄ㅤ █▀▀▄ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█▄▄▀─────███────██──────████───███────────████──███─────────████─█████████████──██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████─────█████████████████────────██████████──█───────────█████──────────────████──────────────█────────▄███████▄██───███▄▄──▄▄███──────▄██$█████$██▄██──█▀───▀███────█───▄██$█████████$██▄██──█───█──██───█─█──█$█████████████$███──█──────██─────█──███████████████████──██────██▀█───█─────██████████████─█───██████──▀████───────███████████──────────────────█───────█████████─────────────▀▀████──────███████████────────────────█▀──────██───████▀─▀█────────────────▀█──────█─────▀█▀───█──▄▄▄▄▄▄▄────────██────█───████▀───██─█████████████────▀█──█───███▀──▄▄██─█▀██▀██▀████▀█████▀──█───██████▀─▀█─█────────█▄─────────██───████▀───██─██▄████▄──██────────██───██──▄▄▄██──██▄▄▄▄▄██▀─────────██──█████▀───█─────────███────────███████▄────███────────███████─────█████████████───────▄██████████████████████████████─██████████████████─────────██████████████────────███████████───────█████──────████─────████ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀▀█▀▀ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ█ㅤ▄█ㅤ█▀▀ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ█ ㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█▀▀▄ ㅤ█▀▀ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀ㅤ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀ㅤ▀ㅤㅤ▀ㅤ▀▀▀ █▀▄▀█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ█▀▄▀█ ▄▀▀▄ █▀▀▄ █▀▀ █ ㅤ █ㅤ█ █─▀─█ㅤ█▄▄█ㅤㅤ █─▀─█ █ ㅤ █ █ ㅤ █ █▀▀ █▄▄█ㅤ██ㅤㅤ █ㅤ▄▄▄█ㅤ ㅤ█ㅤㅤ█ ─▀▀ ─ ▀ ㅤ ▀ ▀▀▀ ▄▄▄█ㅤ▄ "

												Endless Space is a a very satisfying entry in the 4x genre.In generalities of 4x - it's a turn based genre where you explore a grid, find juicy spots to expand your empire, research new technologies that can do all sorts of neat things. And of course there are up to 7 other races/species/civilizations doing the exact same thing and when you come into contact there can be peace, trade, and friendship - or lasers, bombs, and death. What really distinguishes Endless Space from games like Civ is a more dynamic and challenging AI. The AI is aggressive, but rational. You can generally tell almost exactly when an AI is going to declare war on you just using common sense - they spot some sweet weak spots in your territory, they're running out of territory and you border them (and are weak), and so on. And the AI is very challenging, but fair. Some games like civ cheat during the game to keep the AI competitive. So for instance if you're far up on technology the AI will simply start granting itself new technologies for free to keep up. You won't see that in this game. The AI on higher difficulties gets boosts to his rates of production, but otherwise plays by the exact same rules as you. This opens up lots of fun and dynamic possibilities. For instance advanced ships require various sorts of unique materials for production. Cut off an opponent's source of this material and you can bring his military industrial complex to a screeching halt.The big downside of the game is in the combat system. While ship design and fleet organization is a lot of fun and very interesting - combat itself comes down to picking from some relatively uninteresting cards which come down to a frustrating and boring system of roshambo or paper, rock, scissors. Another small issue is a lack of polish. The in game skill tree for the heroes is incorrect and outdated, and there are various little annoying bugs. For instance if you alt-tab in the game, the game will consider alt as being constantly pressed. All you need to do is press alt again to fix this, but the lack of polish here and there really adds up.That said I think this game has already overtaken Civilization and there are many ways it could be greatly improved and expanded upon. I'd strongly recommend this title and I expect to see more great things from this series with Endless Space 2.			"

												I just love it. Quiet, unstressful, yet challenging. You got read into the technologies a little bit, and the first somewhat rounds are a bit unusual to play, but once you get to know where is what it just gets easy of your hand.The balancing is well done, some races are better early, some better in the later game.What I like especially diplomacy system. You can't have any preconfigured teams, you have to build your alliance. And once you have one you may exchange anything, even technologies and planets.			"

												2016-01-02 - I had this for...years...I'm guessing...before I finally played it.  Great game.  All of the 4x action I loved back in the day with MOO/MOO2.I'm still trying to figure out the space battle commands and the rock-paper-scissors of ship and fleet composition.  There is a nuance there that just doesn't exist in a lot of other 4x space games where you literally throw the largest stack of the latest tech at your enemy.  Instead, in Endless Space, your fleet sizes are limited by command ratings.  So, getting the right mix of missile boats, mid-range energy weapon platforms, and knife-fighting kinetics is a constant juggling act with a definite need to defend your empire in depth.			"

												Endless Space is a pretty sweet strategy game. The gameplay options for customizing the maps, factions, and play style are plentiful and varied. Despite not having a story or campaign mode, the single player mode offers many hours of play. I really enjoyed the concept of the endless that's presented here. The flavor of the game is very rich. I haven't played multiplayer, so I can't comment on that. The games UI is very plain and simple, but I like it. It makes it easier to find everything and get into the game more. One complaint I have about the game is that the games themselves are slow paced and quite lengthy. Also, in terms of the 'Emperor Edition', I'm not sure of it's value. You get the soundtrack and some points for the developers website (useless in my opinion). They should have included the expansion, but I'm not too concerned, the base game is still terrific. I'll recommend it to 4X strategy fans or sci-fi lovers, and people new to the genre; it's a good start.			"

												This game is a fairly typical turn-based strategy. The 4-branch tech tree and custom factions and units make it a little different from many I've played.  As many other games in the genre, it's plagued by shoddy diplomacy. You can give the universe to an AI faction and have him crazy happy with you, and then the next turn, without provocation, he declares war on you.			"

												I'm very torn as to whether to give this a positive or negative review. The level of immersion is wonderful. Everything is extremely customizeable. The whole tactic of having to balance your resources within the system--managing happiness and food--makes it a very unique experience (especially when these systems are highly randomized). There are a number of factors that make replayability extremely high, including the wildly diverse tech trees, unique factions, race-specific technologies, advantages, and disadvantages......but my god. The tutorial system.As someone whose job description includes writing how-tos, I can say, with tenured authority, that their tutorial system is absolutely horrible.The 'tutorials' are screens that pop up the first time you play, and give you a screen cap (of a sampel screen) with numbers, and a wall of text on the right. No context, nothing leading you through--it's like getting an instruction manual, whose pages are only accessible while you're playing the game. To put it into context, it's as though you were taught to play Monopoly using a tutorial that didn't tell you that you could buy houses until you've acquired your first set by pure accident.There's no campaign, no tutorial mission, no walk-through, no 'live example'--hell, the damn thing doesn't even tell you how the various win conditions work.Which, with a game as rich and deep as Endless Space, is absolutely appauling.What's worse, the complete lack of interactivity makes the tutorials extremely boring, and the fact that it only pops up to let you read once you've encountered an immediate need for it means that these boring walls of text will pop up as you're finally getting into the action, bringing the whole experience to a grinding halt.If you've got a lot of time and patience to learn all the subtle nuances (mostly on your own, since the tutorials, boring as they might be, are also woefully inadequate in offering context), then you'll likely (eventually) get a hell of a kick out of Endless Space.For everyone who doesn't have that kind of time, and just wants to be able to jump on, colonize some planets, sign a treaty, kill a bug, and shuffle along your merry way, then I cannot warn you vehemently enough about how throughly the tutorial will ruin your gaming experience.

Space Truly Is EndlessEndless Space created by the talented Amplitude Studios is a game that strategy game fans should have in their library. It involves countless hours of fun, amazing lore, and a soothing soundtrack. It's at one point calm and serene, at another point frantic as haphazard plans are thrown together, and from these haphazard plans rushes a great victory. GameplayEndless Space, as my first 4X Space Strategy game, has not dissapointed. The genre has some very lauded titles, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they stack up against the gameplay of Endless Space, which is almost always consistently engaging. Whether you're colonizing new planets, building improvements or conducting diplomacy, the UI is very well done and easy to see, use and activate. Although there are many systems that are relatively more complex than they initially seem, so some tinkering and experimentation is required. Everything just gels together really nicely, and it's very fun to explore all the different possibilites, Hero skill combinations, research tech paths, military ship creation: there's a lot of content to keep you satisfied. Probably the weakest point of the vanilla game would be the combat, which is essentially a card game with admittedly cool cutscenes. StoryIt's a strategy game, and as such, it doesn't really have a main story. It does have overarching lore and history of the Endless, but other than that there's no story. Nothing wrong with that as it's a 4X strategy title. Graphics, Atmosphere and SoundThe graphics for Endless Space, running smoothly on my computer, are shiny but some of the ship textures really aren't anything to write home about. However, planets, stars and diplomatic figures are all very well done. The atmopshere is very nice, with cool randomized events and diplomatic messages. Very enjoyable to play and experience. The sound is worth listening to by itself, and the soundtrack, I am in infact listening to it right now it's that good. It's very serene and beautiful, and a good calmative after a long day. The main theme is probably my favorite piece. ConclusionIf you haven't been paying attention- do you like strategy games? If so, buy it. Do you like science fiction? If so, buy it. Do you like interesting backstories and creating your own custom factions, with their own custom backgrounds? If so, buy it. Pretty much what I'm saying is a big thumbs up. You will lose yourself in this great strategy game. As the old adage goes... 'Just one more turn!'			"

												Endless Space is a well put-together game. Its a fun game and very approachable, and the graphics are really nice too. It's not really ""Turn-based"" since the AI moves its pieces during your turn, but it's not something that will break the game entirely. All-in-all, this could be a great game to spend a few hours playing, however...But this game harbors a dark side. No matter what you do, no matter what difficulty you set it to, you just can not win!...ever! I know it sounds crazy, but it is true! A game needs to be able to be won at the easiest difficulty if you are ever going to try the harder ones. Nobody ever said ""Geez, that AI was really hard to beat, but when I quit my day-job and set up a database to help me keep track of every calculation in this game, I finally was rewarded with a victory."" At the easist level, a game needs to be able to be won if the player is ever going to get better, or to be rewarded with a higher difficulty. In a way this reminds me of that person who offered to teach you a game like chess, and instead of going easy the first few times so you could learn they game, they just beat the bejezus out of you. Ever had that experience before? If so, chances are you do not play that game with that person anymore, no matter how good you have gotten since.There is a DLC pack for this game. I do not advise getting it either. The money you spend will be spent in agony.			"

												Recommended: An exceedingly well-executed and designed space 4X strategy game that stumbles a bit with a lack of personality that typically characterises its predecessors such as Star Control 2 or even newer competitors such as Stardrive.  It's much more Master of Orion-esque in that, but if you liked that kind of game, then you will certainly enjoy Endless Space.Endless Space is a space 4X strategy game developed and published by AMPLITUDE Studios.  It's a sleekly presented 4X game that's something of a wonder child for the UNITY engine, and certainly proof that more complex games can be made with the engine, although it certainly also highlights some of the flaws in the engine.The presentation is both the strongest suit of the game and also what puts some people off.  It's presented in a very clear and logical format, with items presented in a logical selection of sub-screens.  It's very clean, and that's also the crux of why it puts some people off.  Unlike Star Control 2 that had some great personality to the different races available, the presentation of racial interaction and diplomacy is just as sterile as the rest of Endless Spaces' interface.  It's unfortunate.  For some people this sinks the game.  Personally, I would say that it is certainly say what has kept a good game from being a great game, but it is still a good game regardless.  It just has an unrealised potential that could have been tapped to make it better.Graphically, the game is indeed pretty impressive for a UNITY engine game.  Together with the polish in the interface and the gorgeous loading screen art its graphically rather impressive.  The camera view in the combat sections makes for some sweeping shots of starship combat that are quite nice.  There's certainly shinier games out there, don't get me wrong, but the game has a careful attention to the production values all the way through that shows.  The music that accompanies the game is likewise quite good.I spend as much time on the presentation as I do because the mechanics are bog standard.  They're done competently but there's nothing particularly new to the genre here.  The one thing that is done differently from the genre standard is the combat.  It's kind of a halfway between tactical combat and simply ordering a unit to attack and getting an auto-calculated result.  Instead, you choose tactic at long range, medium range, and close range.  There are a variety of different categorizations of tactics and each tactic is strong against one category and weak against another.  So essentially it creates a paper scissors stone game in the mechanics that is kind of simplistic.  Some of them don't seem very balanced though.  There's a few you'll be to unlock after some time in the game that are just objectively better than any other tactic in the category.  Nonetheless it does add a small amount of depth to combat that is otherwise auto-calculated.At the end of the day its a well-executed game that does the genre pretty well but doesn't have anything that really sets it apart other than the high production values.  It's certainly well-made and a good entry into the genre, however.  It just isn't going to set the world on fire.Published: http://www.highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/88-review-endless-space "

												Serious gameplay flaws prevent this game from being great. Battles are repetitive and boring. Simulating battles to avoid boredom results in heavy losses. A lack of an effective unit cap results in WAAAAAY too many repetitive and boring battles, forcing you to partake in far too much of the worst acpect of this game. We are talking of 50 to 100+ NPC fleets. The tactic is also abundantly used in multiplayer matches. It feels cheap runs counter to superb unit customization, hero abilities, and fleet building mechanics. Unfortunately, cheap usually wins.I hit the 80 hour mark because I love everything about the game but the conclusion. Terraforming is cool, exploration is very cool. Conquest fells like running in the mud wearing swim fins.			"

This space faring 4x game from Amplitude studios may be a little rusty since it's original 2012 release  but there is still enough shine under the surface to make it worth playing.What makes this game stand out from other 4x games are the way leaders work, unique planetary systems, and a complex tech tree.  A major negative is the ship combat is best done with the auto setting so players will never see the cool ships they design.			"

												Exceptionally clean game design where micro management is made easy. Highly recommended. Stick with it for about three-five hours and you will begin to apporaciate the finesses applied.Then start to appy your own finessing to how you manage modifications to your fleet and your planets.Love the paper-rock-scissor apporach to managing battles (every battle is different)  one can never be quite sure of the outcome, and this keeps you interested in playing.

												Endless space is a 4x strategy game set in well space.The game contains(Currently)12 factions each one playing quite diffrently from each other for instance you have the Cravers which for the first 20 turns on a colonzied planet gain +25% FIDS(Food,Industry,Dust,Science)After that they get a 40 turn no bonus no negatives and finally for the rest of the game a -25% FIDS.The Galaxy looks quite nice and isnt too Graphically intense(I Can run it quite well).The Units howver come with a in game unit designer as you research new tech you get new parts which you can add to your ship this makes the units quite flexible and diffrent.The tech tree is huge and seperated into 4 diffrent paths.Space combat is seperated into 4 parts Arrival,Long range,Medium Range and Melee Range.Each range is better for diffrent weapons.You have two ways to do space battles Auto or you can WATCH the units fight no commanding.However in both modes you must pick a tactic for your units to do in all phases.Ground combat is seperated into Sieges which u can do by adding siege modules to your ships.many more things can be said but i think by now your falling asleep.Overall this game is a 4x Jewel			"

												I like it because I love sci-fi, strategy games, and games where you can move at your own pace.  If you have little patience or like lots of excitement or an easy win this game is not for you.  If you buy this game be prepared to spend an above-average amount of time looking up how to play it, and hitting ""end turn"" so you can cycle through to the next move.  In a way this game is civilizations-meets-sunday crossword... For me this game is about the intellectual challenge of actually learning how to play it, and finding work-arounds for the user interface which is not as straightforward as other games of its kind. I like that there are numerous victory types for this game (science, economic, dominance to name a few).  The in-game story is pretty good (not cheesy like other games).  It reminds me of my old favourites Sim City and Star Trek Armada II.  In all I say its a great game for ponderous intelluctuals who love a challenge.			"

												If you enjoy strategy games like Civilization you'll probably like this. It functions more or less the same as Civ V or BE with combat that is more interactive. I also thought the playable factions, backstory, variety of planets, and strange alien wonders make a nice atmospheric game. All in all I'd say this game deserves as much attention as Civ.			"

												Endless Space is a turn-based strategy, sci-fi 4X game developed by Amplitude Studios, and published by Iceberg Interactive.In this review I will be listing some of the pros and cons that this game has to offer.Let's start off with the pros:+Beautiful soundtrack (one of my favourite tracks from the soundtrack is The Endless (Choir Version))+The UI is fairly clean and nice looking, as it fits with the futuristic time period that the game takes place in.+Creating and joining a game in Endless Space is easy and there is no annoying errors that prevent you from playing with your friends.+The customization for the galaxy that you play in is great; and I also like how they added a option to set the galaxies age, I found that pretty cool.+Animations and transitions for tabs and the hud are fluid and makes the UI more enjoyable to use.+Decent amount of empires+The empire names and appearance are amazingly made and drawn, I haven't seen one faction that I thought wasn't well made.+The lore behind the empires (and the game), are crazily detailed with the perfect amount of text to back it up. Aside from that the actual stories are very intriguing, and I spent a long time reading them without losing a single bit of intrest. +Custom race maker+The perks for each race are a nice edition, like the Sophons being mainly scientific, but they are fairly weak, etc. (adds more thought put into choosing a race rather than just choosing a race because you liked their appearace.)+Option to change your empire colour+Endless Space has in fact the best artwork I've ever seen in a game, and the fact that some of the artwork is in the loading screens, makes the loading screens more enjoyable to look at.+Optimization is great+Backgrounds for the galaxy in-game look beautiful+Ship design is phenomenal (My favourite ship designs are the Harmony, the Sophons, and the Automatons)+Each star and planet are highly detailed and have great names+Managing your solar systems (and tax) are very complex and requires a lot of attention if you don't want your  empire going into rebellion.+The research tree for the game is... just.... AMAZING. So many options, and sheer amout of research you can do, is just magnificent. Endless Space has the best research tree that I've ever seen in a strategy game; and is one of my favourite parts of the game, to be honest.+Exploring through the vast galaxy is fun and simple to do+Choosing different productions for each star system adds more strategic planning to do+Random events are great and suprising+Empire AI is superb+Special planets are a nice addition+Different types of ships (Colony, Defender, Scout, etc,) are good with their different stats and functions.+The fact that they added a option for you to build your own type of ship and modify it for different jobs to do is just exceptional+Space fights are cool+Free camera movement and a locked camera for space battles+Trade routes and just trading alone is fun+Diplomatic screen looks beautiful and is very clean+Many different type of resources and luxury resources+Different actions (in a card shaped format) to choose from for you next space battle+Population of a star system have their own opinions+Graphics are decentI think I'll stop listing pluses now, because I could list them forever.Lets head on to the cons of Endless Space.-Game breaking glitches here and there (for example, me and my friend encountered a glitch where the game was stuck on standby for 30 minutes, and never went to the next turn. We had to restart Endless Space and revert to our last autosave to fix it.)-Don't turn on the A.I. to manage your star system, like if you turn on the A.I. for one star system, the A.I. may tear that star system down to hell, causing that one to go into rebellion. I don't really recommend turning the A.I. on for managing the star systems, manage it yourself.-Graphics options are simple and not the detailed, not allowing you to tweak it for the best preformance.well, I guess there isn't that much bad things about this game then.Endless space is a outstanding game that is now one of my favourite strategy games, beautiful work Amplitude Studios!86/100			"

												At first I wasn't sure what to expect from this game.I saw this game pop up when it first hit steam quite some time ago looking for funding.  I've always been a big fan of 4x games, I grew up playing MOO/MOO2 and dreaming of games that would build on that style.  I even found myself fond of MOO3, glitches/bugs/balance issues and all.  It's been a hard time finding a game that truely captured that style of game and moved forward with it.This game isn't quite what I wanted.The combat in this game is fairly hands off.  You decide 'tactics' in 3 stages, each tactic mildly affecting how your ships perform and in some cases can cancel the effect of the enemies (and vice versa).  While this is intrigueing, it does make for a mildly irritating battle choice.  What ever happened to a nice turn based combat system like in say MOO where you had complete control over each ship, making every single movement count?Ship building isn't half bad, which Galactic Civ does have more options in this department it's combat is far to Civ like for my tastes.  Endless Space does a far better job making your choices feel like they count but there could have been far better ways to implement combat.  That having been said, the game itself looks quite beautiful, reminding me of oldschool capital ship battles like Homeworld.  Nice explosions, lots of bits and peices go floating away, etc.The tech tree is also a bit interesting.  Unlike most other 4x games with a side scrolling tree that can be a pain to locate what you want, Endless Space uses a true 'tree' system, with 4 branches to incorporate 4 different types of techs.  Each of the races has a different tree, and honestly they each feel truely different... no watered down ""Huumies!"" here.While I'm somewhat sad that the combat isn't quite what I'd have hoped to see in this title, the gameplay is still quite impressive.  I've really enjoyed the game thus far, each time I've started a new race it's been a joy to see how the new race feels over the other choices I've made.			"

												    Can't recommend this game at this time since I feel the tutorial is very weak.

I wanted to build some better ships but mysteriously the planets that had the materials I need had pirate ships posted there and never moved. It just seemed to much crap was thrown into my starting system. I'm going to give this game a couple more chances before I choose whether or not to buy it.			"

												Quite possibly the worst 4X ""strategy"" game I've ever played, this game is hampered by a terrible UI, arcane game systems, and game-breaking randoms.1. The terrible UII haven't moved a guy and yet its beeping at me when I try to move him. Never tells you what's wrong. Just PING PING CHING CHIME. Its like WTF?Select guy 1 from planet and move him. Oh I get a second move? Nope, auto-selected guy 2 whom you never clicked and whom you needed to garrison a planet and now he's off someplace else leaving critical planet exposed.Clicking a specific location and WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY GOING?? WTF through enemy territory when its not even the shortest path!!! ARRRGGGHJHH2. Arcane Game SystemsDespite an INCREDIBLY ANNOYING and PERVASIVE tutorial system that constantly interrupts your gameplay, the game systems are totally arcane. For example: nothing tells you what the collapsed wormhole thing is, even when you really need to know, or how to get around it. Nor does it tell you how your 5 destroyers, by far the most advanced in the galaxy, is beaten by 5 corvettes from a far inferior race. Nor does it describe why supposedly-""nice"" races whom you're not at hositities-with, simply waltz in and start invading your worlds. Do they even read their own fiction??? Or... more likely still: there is no differences in the AIs and the ""fiction"" is just a fascade that has no bearing on the races true intentions. WHY HAVE FICTION IF THE GAME DOES NOT FOLLOW IT. You're just being deceptive!3. Game-breaking RandomsWas in a game tonight, and found myself on a dead-end part of the galaxy behind a collapsed wormhole... twiddling my thumbs for something like 40 turns before I could research the technology to get past it, and by then, most of the galaxy was already taken. They should probably have in their galaxy-generation algorithm, some kind of invalid state checker which will prevent the game from generating maps that prevent the player from actually competing in the game.Worse still is the combat system, which... I kid you not... consists of picking 3 ""cards"" for 3 ""phases of combat"", a formation, and a firing doctrine. Now... your cards rock-paper-scissors against the ""cards"" that the enemy selected, and somehow this is what they call strategy. Seriously? Selecting cards, by trying to out-guess an AI (which is probably just randomizing) is the tactics of game combat? I made better combat systems when I was 10. Literally. War of the Worlds board game. Was awesome. Much better than this abortion of intellect. Worse still is that there are blatantly invalid ship configurations that are invalidated by your card selection. I made a fleet of laser-heavy ships, and upon first engagement discovered there are NO laser-based cards in the early game.A good game designer respects their player. You do this with a good UI, short non-invasive (preferably -fun- tutorials) that cover the basics and, if they want you to start the game a certain way (like ""Lasers are better towards the end-game"") will warn their players away from gimped configuratrions... or even-better: make it so all the configurations work if used properly. They don't take the lazy way out and make you use ""Battle cards"" that are actually quite meaningless. And they will check their random generator for broken starting configurations.I hate to say it, because I like indie games, but this one actually FEELS indie. Completely unprofessional.			"

												This is the 4X game I've wanted for a long time. I don't like all the crazy complicated stuff people try to throw in other games, I just wanted a tweaked MoO2, and that's almost exactly what this game is. Anything I dislike about the game is tiny trivial stuff, like ES not having MoO2's preset ship designs that I can just throw out when I'm feeling lazy.Sadly, this was gifted to me, so I wasn't able to throw money at the devs. I'll probably buy the expansion and maybe even the sequel.

												I think I picked this game up on sale for £5-6 a while back.  On the face of it, It's a turn based strategy game and has a number of interesting game mechanics hidden within it.The tech tree is extensive and the brain power required to decide what order you will need things in is interesting.  Picking your colonies, even nice planets, and then wondering why moral hit rock bottom is a fairly big part of the game.  Quickly you learn how to do better - expand, drop the tax to 35% or less to maintain moral for a bit, scout the area and hope for free hive ships and then make your fleets as big as possible. Would I recommend it... full price? (£20+)  Heck no.  On sale? (sub-£5)  Yes.  Especially if you like turn based strategy or want a game to play while you watch TV.			"

												Bought this game as an afterthought during the Steam Summer Sale, and basically haven't been able to turn the darned thing off. Just...one...more...turn!  This is an empire builder, but it isn't Civ. Some thinking and forethought are needed to succeed. I had a hard time finding documentation to help me along at first, but the Steam community has published some nice, solid guides that showed me what I was doing wrong. When I took their advice (hint: pay attention to approval/disapproval!), the game was opened up for me in an entirely new way.Battle sequences are a roll of the dice, as opposed to having RTS elements. You can build, modify and upgrade your fleets, but other than choosing tactics during battle, you can't target individual ships. This was different than I expected, but fits within the overall theme.Expansionsts will find this frustrating if they don't pay close attention...you pay an approval penalty for overexpansion. Basically, this is the anti-Civilization. There are ways around that though, I'll let you figure it out so as not to spoil anything.If you like building empires in a turn-based setting, this is a very easy game to get hooked on.			"

												I am a big fan of these types of games, so at first I was not happy with a few things.  Then 16 hours later I was okay with it.   This has some cool things in it and is quite fun.  At first the Rock Paper Scissors type cards and limiting it to Long, Medium, Melee phases of combat was something I was not happy about.   Later the three phases make sense if you are actually playing this in multiplayer.    The cards actually end up being pretty cool after you get the hang of them.   I'd like to be able to design my ships a bit more micro level than you do in this, and I wish it had a system view so, you could have multpile teams colonize planets in the same system.  This is more the systems are the smallest territory unit, and the the planets are like slots you claim, and upgrade.   Overall, it is a lot of fun.   It is a bit different, and worth trying out for 4 or 6 hours before you throw up your hand and say ""It's not like MOO2"", or ""It's not like Gal Civ II"", or ""It's not like Space Empires""...   it is partially like all of those.   It is NOT like ""Sins of a Solar Empire"" as this one is Turn Based, and not Real Time.			"

It has very solid gameplay, visuals (mostly in combat), sound and music, and the tech trees are useful and interesting. Each race gets somewhat varying tech and ships, which is also nice to keep things fresh. Worth the buy! So grab it asap and get to playing. :)			"

												Endless Space was to me Civilization in space. With an in-depth tech tree and seemingly unique races, I setout to achievement hunt.. before I realised the ridiculous number of achievements attached to a ridiculous number of different victory conditions. That and the games were long, the races weren't that unique and I have a need to win these kind of games purely through conquest. Peace victories be damned. Having said that, Civ in space is enough for me to play 40+ hours and recommend this game.			"

												I think I picked this game up on sale for £5-6 a while back.  On the face of it, It's a turn based strategy game and has a number of interesting game mechanics hidden within it.The tech tree is extensive and the brain power required to decide what order you will need things in is interesting.  Picking your colonies, even nice planets, and then wondering why moral hit rock bottom is a fairly big part of the game.  Quickly you learn how to do better - expand, drop the tax to 35% or less to maintain moral for a bit, scout the area and hope for free hive ships and then make your fleets as big as possible. Would I recommend it... full price? (£20+)  Heck no.  On sale? (sub-£5)  Yes.  Especially if you like turn based strategy or want a game to play while you watch TV.			"

												I was Curios about that game, because it was developed together with gamers who could give input while developing.All in all its a solid game, but it lacks a few things for example controlled space fight, ground fight or optical customizable spacecraft.But that's also partially whats missing in Europa universalis and its still a great game.Result: For those who are searching for the Total war in Space, go on. but for those who enjoy a space tactical/economical simulation, its a must have for less then £25.

												Do you like Civilization V? Do you like space? Do you have good taste in video games? Then you need Endless Space. I was blown away by the game's quality when I finally gave it a try. Its factions play dramatically differently from one another, and it teaches its mechanics almost as well as Civ V does. Though it asks you to do a lot every turn, it has that addictive ""One More Turn"" quality that has made me pull an all night binge.			"

												Bought this game as an afterthought during the Steam Summer Sale, and basically haven't been able to turn the darned thing off. Just...one...more...turn!  This is an empire builder, but it isn't Civ. Some thinking and forethought are needed to succeed. I had a hard time finding documentation to help me along at first, but the Steam community has published some nice, solid guides that showed me what I was doing wrong. When I took their advice (hint: pay attention to approval/disapproval!), the game was opened up for me in an entirely new way.Battle sequences are a roll of the dice, as opposed to having RTS elements. You can build, modify and upgrade your fleets, but other than choosing tactics during battle, you can't target individual ships. This was different than I expected, but fits within the overall theme.Expansionsts will find this frustrating if they don't pay close attention...you pay an approval penalty for overexpansion. Basically, this is the anti-Civilization. There are ways around that though, I'll let you figure it out so as not to spoil anything.If you like building empires in a turn-based setting, this is a very easy game to get hooked on.			"

												I am a big fan of these types of games, so at first I was not happy with a few things.  Then 16 hours later I was okay with it.   This has some cool things in it and is quite fun.  At first the Rock Paper Scissors type cards and limiting it to Long, Medium, Melee phases of combat was something I was not happy about.   Later the three phases make sense if you are actually playing this in multiplayer.    The cards actually end up being pretty cool after you get the hang of them.   I'd like to be able to design my ships a bit more micro level than you do in this, and I wish it had a system view so, you could have multpile teams colonize planets in the same system.  This is more the systems are the smallest territory unit, and the the planets are like slots you claim, and upgrade.   Overall, it is a lot of fun.   It is a bit different, and worth trying out for 4 or 6 hours before you throw up your hand and say ""It's not like MOO2"", or ""It's not like Gal Civ II"", or ""It's not like Space Empires""...   it is partially like all of those.   It is NOT like ""Sins of a Solar Empire"" as this one is Turn Based, and not Real Time.			"

												Civilization IN SPACE. Suffers greatly from ""One... more... turn!""-syndrome. I can't even imagine the hours I lost to this time-devourer from beyond the void.The gameplay is a lot less busy and redundant than Civ in terms of building your empire, and far more streamlined. Diplomacy actually feels worth a damn, sometimes, too - even with the AI. It's always fun to be an interstellar Space ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, too.Combat takes the form of card-based-pseudo-turn/real-time nonesense that amounts to a rock-paper-scissors game in 3 phases per battle, except it keeps adding cards that utilize different effects, can neutralize others and sometimes counteracts themselves and oh no I've gone cross-eyed.What's important is this: Combat consists of spaceships of increasingly large size and fleet compositions shooting the hell out of eachother with laser guns, full-auto railguns and missile barrages, and it is friggin' cool. Once you wrap your head around the combat system, it also becomes very rewarding!Visually it's quite gorgeous in my opinion with great, interesting and unique designs for each faction - and immense attention to detail, as you might find out! Not only that but all the tiers of weapons, defensive measures and dirty tricks have very distinct appearances which makes the combat glorious to watch.Highly recommended - especially as it comes quite cheap!

												Endless Space is a ridiculously fun take on the 4X Space genre. Has the turn-based colony and micromanagement of GalCiv/MoO/etc, and strangely enough, the ship to ship combat resembles Skies of Arcadia closer than any other game I can think of. Players can choose from a whole mess of interesting Alien species, and it has a wonderfully fleshed out ship design mechanic. If you like the 4X genre, you need to own this game.			"

												Get this game now. Don't wait, don't read the rest of this review (unless you have to), just go and buy this game. It's worth it. Just in my first play-through I can happily say that I am in love with Endless Space.  The planet and system resource management is smooth, simple and doesn't bloat horribly as the game progresses thanks to simple and automatic ""upgrading"" of built facilities. The space combat is fun and interesting, with a system that doesn't always reward the obvious option, helping to promote creative thinking. It has all the options that you will expect in a game of this style, but on top of that it has one important thing that occasionally the ""grand stretegy"" genre misses - it's retained the fun of playing a computer game.

												Solid space themed divide & conquer, turn-based strategy. Easily in the top 10, if not top 3-5 of it's genre imho.How I would describe this game:*a dozen factions to choose, all quite different and almost completely customized factions can be made as well.*basic custom map generation*Civ's turn-based strategy*'Sins' tech/war themes.*Gal Civ's tech tree*resources = money, research, production*construct things on your planets (buildings or ships)*optional ship customization a bit like Gal Civ, Stardrive or something*Hero/governor/generals which you get to choose how to level up via a nice long, deep skill tree system.Pros:-Everything is ""just enough"" in proportion; the viduals are nice, the management is just enough, there's leveling up, customization of play style, storyline type immersion, and there's a bit of real-time combat in the battles (choice of auto or manual), which keep things interesting.-UI is pretty clean, and the tooltip system for everything is fantastic.-The DLCs and updates have actually been good. They have done balance and bug fixing updates which I thought were well done and reasonably timely considering it's not a huge company, and it's a mostly single player, turn-based game.Cons:-Slightly on the pricy side if you ask me, but inflation and whatever I guess... at least it is less than those big name thieves like Sid Meyers, Total War, and the rest.

												Endless Space, a turn-based 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) game set in space. It certainly isn't the most adnvaced 4X game you'll play but it is a good one no doubt. If you are looking for a reliable game in this genre and setting this may be for you. Before you start a game you can decide how small or large universe you'd like to play in with various tweaks available, such as number of players and types of planets and shape of the universe. Then you have a set of factions to choose from. Each faction have different pros and cons that you should consider depening on how you want to play. There are several winning conditions and ways to play this game: Economic, Scientific, Diplomatic and Military. Different factions are prominent in one or two of these things as well. It is possible to combine these playstyles as you like. No matter which way you chose, you will do Research. The research tree is rather extensive with 4 branches. Each branch are focusing in certain areas different from the other. Left branch: mainly focuses on economy, trade and diplomacy.Top branch: is mainly for military research.Right branch is mainly for technologic research and resources.Bottom branch is mainly research for expansion, terraforming and colonization.Exploration and colonization is rather satisfying. You have various types of solar systems with different types of planets as well as asteroid belts. Each can be colonized if you have the right research completed. Once colonized, the planets can be exploited on their resources for your empire. Different planets also have different effects on your colony on said planet.Diplomacy and trading with the AI is fairly basic and you will notice that the AI can change their mind  over a deal several times over. It is possible to form alliances, trade resources, systems and research. You can of course declare war! With research you can unlock more options for diplomacy and ways to improve your trade routes.Lets not forget the military side. You can build and manage armadas of ships of various kinds. What kind of ships is mainly up to you. You can make customizable ship blueprints that are then available for construction. Each ship blueprint has a set of slots that you can choose to put different modules in. Such as weapon types, defense, utility and smaller ships (fighters/bombers). Your main ship has only room for a certain amount of weight that can be put on them (more available with research). The overall look of a ship can't be modified.You can research and build larger battleships and you can assemble armadas to fly as a single unit on the world map. Armada size is limited by Command Points and you can get more points with research for larger armies. In a fight, only one armada can fight at once even if you have several armadas in one system.The actual fighting is pretty uneventful. You don't actively control the fight yourself but there is a small element of tactics involved. A battle has 3 stages: Long Range, Mid Range and Melee Range. Missile weapons are good for long range, Lasers for mid range and Machine Guns for melee range.Before a battle you choose a card for each stage. Cards have an offensive or defensive condition (like extra armor or weapon damage). There is a planning stage before the battle where you make your decisions. Some cards negate other cards based on the type of card that is in play. Your card could be put out of play and the enemy card will get buffed or vice versa. When battle starts there isn't much you can do but watch, which is the main weak point of the game. You can choose firing mode for each stage however. All in all it is an enjoyable Sci-Fi 4X game that can keep you occupied for hours. Try and pick it up during a sale and it will be worth it if you are into these kind of games.			"

												Excellent game all around with a lot to offer for fans of games like Civilization. The strategic gameplay is great, with a smoothly streamlined colony management system and an interesting tech tree. AI is, as always, a crapshoot. 'Diplomatic' factions will wage all out war while all-out war factions will attempt to broker peace treaties, but there are at least benefits to playing the diplomatic game in the form of trade and unique faction traits that give benefits for treaties.That said though, the tactical side is a little wonky, with an over-emphasis on symmetry on paper getting in the way of actual balance. Some features are useless or counter-productive *coughfighterscough*, while others are massively overpowered, and learning which is which is the key to playing well rather than actually gaining skill. The difficulty curve is also stupid, with higher difficulty levels simply ratcheting up the ratios by which the AI is cheating. All levels play with the same AI, harder ones simply have to spend less time and money on ships and upgrades, have a bonus to empire approval, move faster, hit harder, have more health, expand more easily, research faster, get better heroes sooner, and can rush production for less money. My recommendation? Play a game or two against AIs and then find a few friends to play with. The single player game is frustrating once you're better than a novice, as all games are either a cakewalk or an endless parade of superior vessels crushing your holdings. There's a ton of game here to enjoy if you can get past the flaws, so definitely pick it up.			"

												On initial play-through I thought this game was just OK. But the sparse user interface is deceptive I came back for another game and then another & the more I play the more hidden depths I find. One of the nice things about the game is that everything happens for a reason. Even the ""random"" events/encounters usually give you various ways of handling them.The combat system is the games weakest link - but even that is more strategic than it appears at first glace - there's a lot of be gained from tailoring your shop builds to counter certain enemy fleets. Still I do feel the actual ship combat is somewhat lacking.Also the expansions are great & I hope Amplitude continue to produce expansions as each one adds a new dimension to the game.  "

My only criticism is that instead of immersing myself in the battles, it is FAR easier to click Auto-resolve.  A la Total War games.  When your empire spans across hundreds of systems and possibly thousands of worlds, there is no time to waste watching a battle unfold, you have an intergalactic empire to manage!			"

												VERY nice 4x game, 4x games are strategy games where you manage an entire empire, so basically its more about building your economy, diplomacy, technology research other aspects of your civilization than micromanaging your units to win battles (although it does have some of that as well).The easiest comparison is with the game Civilization. I find Endless Space a lot more streamlined (and without that being bad), yet similar enough to be abel to pick it up quickly. The game has less ""polish"" overall but the polish it has is more than enough for it. The game is less complex and the screens tell you everything you need to know about your empire with more ease than Civilization.Civilization has a map to explore as you colonize Earth, ES is a space game so you dont get to play on maps to explore, you just explore the galaxy using interconnected systems, so the map is a grid, becoming more ""simple"" but also easier for amassing fleets and waging war. Def worth a try.			"

												If you like Civilization V then this game is even better!Difficulty makes the AI smarter, smoother UI, better tech tree (actual optional research), AI can manage cities (systems).Combat is much better: Ships are grouped in a fleet. Fleets fight each other. Depending on research your maximum fleet size varies. Onother factor is the rock-paper-scissors ship design. Kinetic weapons are countered by armor, Flak counters missiles and shield counter beam weapons. You can retrofit your units to counter your enemies ship design. For example you are attacked by 300 missiles>you add 300 flak and take no damage.			"

												Endless Space is one of the best 4X game i have ever played. The game mechanics are quite simple to understand but they are also deep and polished, and the graphic aspect is great for this kind of game, with a lot of beautiful planets and some nice explosion during space fights! The random galaxy generation, the huge amount of special features that planets can have (for example anomalies, strategic resource or luxury resource) and the random events that can occasionally occur make every game unique. Endless Space also offers great customization options (pirates, game speed, events, galaxy size and shape...) and a lot of interesting features such as heroes, that can be assigned to fleets or systems to upgrade them, planet production customization, moon exploration, which can lead to important and powerful discoveries, and a fantastic tech tree with interesting and funny descriptions for every single technology!Endless Space isn't surely perfect, beacuse some technologies are definitely too powerful and unbalanced, the combat system (real time combat divided into 3 parts with a card strategy system) may not appeal to everyone, and some annoying bugs still afflict the game, but it has been created with a lot of attention for details and is a great title for everyone who's looking for a solid yet not too difficult and extremely addicting 4X Sci-fi experience.

												Good game. Not as good as Master of Orion 2, but then again, what is? It's a typical 4x game, but the graphics are nice, and the information is usually readily available. (Tooltips are great!) It has incorperated several features from the Civ series that make it much easier to manage (e.g. popup event windows).For MOO2 fans, this game is very similar, but there are a few things that this game doesn't have that would have made it great:- Tactical combat (Combat is pretty much a wind-em-up-and-see-what-happens affair.)- Space Stations- A super-powerful alien race with unique technologies (I loved capturing Antarean ships)- Spying- Galactic CouncilSo, devs, put these in and you will have a true MOO2 killer.One major problem, as with a lot of 4x games, is that the endgame is boring. By halfway into the game you pretty much know who is going to win, and its just a matter of attrition. Also, the distinctions between the races seem to blur in the mid and late game.So, the game is good, but not great.			"

It's clean, easy to use, efficient, and provides you with all the information you need to run your empire.the soundtrack is amazing.This is what the result can be if the makers of the game put a lot of polish on it and they did.Their new game is coming out soon and it's going to be a massive improvement, i love everything from this games studio, keep it coming amplitude.

Endless Space delivers an amazing gameplay that is hard to walk away from once you're on the road to galactic conquest.

The game also features a killer multiplayer that will keep you busy for hours if you can convince a friend to pick it up (or use that steam gift option hint hint). Final word, I'm set while Endless Space 2 is in development.Pros-Incredible Replayability (different species, maps, scenarios!)-Rewards players who take full control of their journey through the stars (auto is your friend when you start but manual is better)-Just a fun gameCons-End game turns can be very long...so many colonies and fleets to keep up with especially on the larger maps-Multiplayer is hard to come by			"

												One of my first 4x games to play. It's a fun game that you can pour several hours into if you manage to get into it. A single game could last you entire days to complete depending on how you set it up. The game can be a little slow at first which could be a turn off for those who prefer RTS instead of Turn based strategy. Space combat in this game revolves around research, ship build, and card choice. There is no actual individual control of the units in the fleet assembled during battle. It's basically two fleets go head to head until one overpowers the other in quite the spectacular light show. Overall, I like it. I'm usually more of the ""straight into the action"" strategy game player but this game is still something I'd recommend for those who want a 4x game to play. It may be a little slow, but the combat and the occurence of unexpected events is something I enjoy.			"

Still a lot of limits though but this is something! I just always wanted a true sandbox space civ sim game, without these pre-designed civilizations and background. I also like the battle mechanic: it is a series of orders which can counter each other, and there are quite a number of different orders depending on tech advancement, commander and ship equip. And the thing which impressed me quite much is the space, especially in battles. It's beautiful. The graphics are not something outstanding but still looks very nice.

												There is a space-conquer game in the old MacOS (8.1) which is called Galactica. I enjoyed that game so much and since I was unable to find another game like that. Simple graphics, simple gameplay, hours of fun. When I downloaded this game those memories from Galactica came out. This game has almost every feature from that old one plus great graphics, more complex development system, and peaceful music. This, gentlemen, is a must-have game.			"

												Really fun 4x games. Basically civilization in space. Only reason I haven't played more is because Stellaris came out and contains many similar elements in a real-time package versus turn-based. That said, this game is definitely not without it's merits and I will likely return to play it more.Just wish it had better modding support. I'd have loved to see some total conversions.			"

												One of my first 4x games to play. It's a fun game that you can pour several hours into if you manage to get into it. A single game could last you entire days to complete depending on how you set it up. The game can be a little slow at first which could be a turn off for those who prefer RTS instead of Turn based strategy. Space combat in this game revolves around research, ship build, and card choice. There is no actual individual control of the units in the fleet assembled during battle. It's basically two fleets go head to head until one overpowers the other in quite the spectacular light show. Overall, I like it. I'm usually more of the ""straight into the action"" strategy game player but this game is still something I'd recommend for those who want a 4x game to play. It may be a little slow, but the combat and the occurence of unexpected events is something I enjoy.			"

												One of these space civilization simulators which actually allow player to create a civ of his own which means at least somewhat your own setting. Still a lot of limits though but this is something! I just always wanted a true sandbox space civ sim game, without these pre-designed civilizations and background. I also like the battle mechanic: it is a series of orders which can counter each other, and there are quite a number of different orders depending on tech advancement, commander and ship equip. And the thing which impressed me quite much is the space, especially in battles. It's beautiful. The graphics are not something outstanding but still looks very nice. Definitely play this game if you like space civ simulators and exciting battles.			"

The music, the characterful factions and the ship models themselves  totally imerse you in the universe. The planetary improvements, modular improvements to ships, faction affinities and the sandbox style setup lead to many different playstyles and add plenty of replayability.

The graphics are visually stunning, the factions are diverse, and custom factions are as easy to make as you please!  The AI is credible, and the mechanics are pleasingly fair and straight-forward.This was the first game in the Endless saga.   It is worth every penny.  If you like turn-based strategy with diverse and exciting groups reminescent of a diverse universe like Mass Effect, this is your game.If you like detailed tactical battle choices, this is not your game.  Strategy, not tactics.  I recommend Total War for tactical gameplay. xD "

												A fine 4X game with good support from the developers. It has nice artwork and visuals and a fun battle-mode to watch your spaceships duke it out in 3D space for battles, which can be skipped if you're so inclined.The Dust resource adds another layer of strategy to both building and warfare as it can be used to speed up production and construction, or to activate leaders abilities before battles to give your fleets an edge.The base game is fine with the AI being quite aggressive, however many great mods are available to further add more races, tech, colonizable planet types, and other tweaks and can be used in multiplayer so long as both parties possess the same mods.I recommend this game for anyone who likes 4X and likes to relax while building up thier galactic civilization for hours on end.

												This is the perfect game to buy on sale. I picked it up during the Steam Summer Sale at a fraction of the full price, and I'm very happy with what I got for the money. Would I feel the same if I had paid full price? Probably not. The simplistic gameplay makes it easy to enjoy without the frustration of a steep learning curve, but does not justify a top-shelf price tag in my opinion. That said, the Endless Space universe is full of beutifully detailed graphic depictions of all types planets, including various sci-fi anomalies such as ancient ruins and gravitational disturbances. Each star system you discover reveals unique challenges and opportunities for colonization, keeping the experience enticing. Combat is a little strange, consisting of 3 phases which essentially represent long, medium, and short range exchanges of damage and defence. There are no maneuvers involved; every class of ship is essentially a slow-moving platform for weapon systems and countermeasures closing in on one another, The strategy for each of the 3 phases is selected before combat, and you are given the option to skip straight to the results or watch the action in real-time. The latter provides the opportunity to change the selected strategies along the way, and some decent eye candy. Nothing that would rival the likes of EVE, but far more exciting than a Sid Meyer game's combat system. Trade and diplomacy are both present, as you'd expect from any sort of nation-building strategy game. Having chosen an empire which relies mainly upon military superiority, I haven't experienced enough of either to judge their implementation. However, the fact that you have a wide of choice of empires ranging from evil militants to peaceful industrialists means you can play-your-way, selecting the definintion of ""victory"" that suits you.The game also includes randomly generated events, rare and valuable resources to find, pesky space pirate attacks, and a handful of other surprises which keep things from becoming stale or predictable. What it does NOT include are cinematic sequences, voice acting, linear storytelling, city-level management  or integrated mini-games. I expect that casual gamers may find that to be a bit bland, but strategy purists will appreciate the lack of distraction.Bottom Line:If you're a fan of turn-based strategy, civilization building, sci-fi warfare, and looking to add another solid title to your collection, then put this on your wishlist and wait for the next sale.

												A familiar game to Civ players. Space based 4x with very similar gameplay, rules, and feel to Civ but it is obviously a very different game- this becomes obvious when you notice the combat system. Combat is a rock-paper-scissors deal, and will also bring you into a different 3D environment separate from the galactic map. The tech tree is also really something to behold, and IMO it's a lot smarter and makes more sense than the standard left to right ""improve everything over time"" general tech tree featured in Civ 5.

												After a few hours of playing and emerging in this game, i have to say: it definitly is a nice game, allthough it has some severe flaws.1. Resources: The FIDS system is pretty much forward and allows to manage your empire on a very easy understandable, but yet not so easy to master level. The decision too whether transform a gas planet up to terran/jungle/ocean or not e.g. isn't as simple as it seems first - provided you do not have all improvements unlocked yet. But in the end, this has a feelable impact on your overall resources. Another thing i really like is the fact, that you have to gather stratigic resources to be competible. So in this department i can clearly say, the devs did it right.2. Diplomacy: Okay - this is one of the bad parts of the game... I really had a hard time to understand, why this game was delivered with a subpar diplomacy system. Okay - you can choose how far to bond with the other factions (from only beeing at peace, over trade relations to full scale alliances), but still it seems a bit to simple in the given options. Another offset is the - IMO - strange diplomacy rating towards your faction. I still don't get, why some of them really hate me, although i play these extremly harmless, but cute Amoebes... - perhaps it's because of the amorph appearance - who knows...;) The only thing it's good for is to gather strategic resources and gain some money and research from your traderoutes.So in general diplomacy isn't a real strenght of this game.3. Combat: Yeah, some of us still remember the good old Masters of Orion games. At this time i loved the combat mechanics. The cool thing about Endless Space is, that i am somewhat reminded of these glorious times... :DGuys and Girls: Do NOT only stick to the general rating of your fleet! in the end it all depends on your fleet setup, skill choices and knowledge of the enemy. I've easily won fights against a higher rated fleet, just because of a few bombers on my ships and the right battle action choices. The manual fights are - compared to the rest of the game - a bit of an eyecandy, but pretty useless and timerobbing at least. After about 5-7 fights i started to stick to the automatic mode - it'll do the job ;)4. Planetary Management: This is the spice and flavour of the game! I really liked the micromanagement in the first to second third of the game. As in every good 4x game you sometimes have to think twice, when managing your colonies. Maximum research output, although some planetary bonuses are more cropfriendly? Standard situations in managing your systems/planets. This is something Endless Space gets right! I really love the fact, that a lot of improvements solely depend on your planettypes, the resources and percs of them. It does make a slight difference just to have a moon, special resources or anomalies. Last, but not least the graphics are quite nice... ;)5. Races: Yeah - this is the section, where the devs got it right. Good balanced and nicely designed races and the ability to costumize your own races. I simply love this one.6. Longtime Motivation: A 4x game must have a high replayability. Given the extremely high level of customability, this is a yes for this game!7. Hardware: One really big backdraw is the unbearable long time to load advanced sessions... This is something i can't understand, if compared to other titles. This is definitely a thing to improve on!Summary: Yes, i recommend this game. If you like 4x and SciFi, you'll have a good time playing Endless Space.			"

This game has many hours of fun and one really nice function is you can design what your ships have for example you can make it fast with high defense options but no weapons or you can make it slow and all teeth which is really cool makes for interesting fleat designs.

												Amazing game! Anyone who played the Masters of Orion games will enjoy this.Some of the mechanics can take a little time to get used to, but this is a very well made game. The developers are amazing at listening to the community and incorporating aspects that players want to see and they have great support for their products.Highly recommended!			"

												Great concept for a modern 4X. You can do it all, dominate with your military strength, expand your empire so as to choke out other civilizations, research your way to a Wonder victory, and more.From options on your randomly generated universes, to fully customisable Empire stats, and modifications to your fleets, this game can adapt to suit your style, or to challenge it!

												Having bought this for £1 on sale, I wasn't expecting much especially considering the number of negative reviews about the UI.This is a very addictive 4x game which is very challenging at the higher difficulties. However... I will agree that the tutorial is massively lacking in both user friendliness and content - there is literally nowhere in game to find out what the hotkeys are. In addition, there are a few UI annoyances that drove me crazy in the endgame. Just small things - for example when you scroll down the list of improvements and click one, it then jumps back up to the top so if you want to queue the improvement next to the one you previously chose you have to scroll down again. Now I know that doesn't sound like a big deal but when you have to do it 200 times it is infuriating.This game is functional and seemingly balanced well and I would definitely recommend it if you can get it on sale, but definitely not one to pay full price for.

												Endless Space, known to its fans as ""That game with the autism-requiring tech tree"" is a game where you select one of four factions and attempt to rule the universe by right clicking on planets and ♥♥♥♥♥ing when Steam keeps shift held because you pressed shift-tab earlier. Sometimes, you get to recruit heroes, none of which have any of the charisma of Ramirez and fall short of the mark in their abilities, too.The gameplay is essentially a right clicking simulator in which you ward off message spam from the game talking about how your people are ingesting more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥this month giving a +2 to productivity or some♥♥♥♥♥♥and you occasionally move an overpowered ship around. So it's basically Mass Effect.Skip this game - the only reason it's called Endless Space is because the gameplay feels endless. . "

												The game itself was pleasant and very detailed, required quite a bit of reading just to get started and have an idea of what to do. Essentially just Civilization in space, which is awesome, but turn-based games are a little bit more a thing of the past so the gameplay of course seems very sluggish and can become boring very quickly. I found the largest map to be quite restricted in size, really would have liked a little more room for expansion and/or strategic positioning. Overall, for what it was, I thought that it was a very detailed and well thought out game, If you enjoy turn-based strategy games (that require quite a bit of reading) then this one is definitely something to check out! 7.8/10.0			"

												Love Civilization-franchise?Miss the old days of Master of Orion 2? Look no further than Endless Space!What happens when you put Master of Orion 2 and Civilization together?This game pops out in a parade of rainbows, confetti, poptarts and aliens (i'm not schizofrenic, i swear!)It's like those two had a honeymoon and then other one get's preggo, what a surprise right? RIGHT?Then out of nowhere Endless Space pops out, BAM! I certainly didn't expect it!Though as this one is no accident, it's like ""Oh it was in development? WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THIS CROSSOVER-LIKE CHILD?!""Well, atleast now it came out and it's beautiful, i wanted this.___________________________________________________Without further due, here's the review of the game:-The gameplay's awesome and the visuals are just stunning, this game hooks you up in an instant!-At first it's a bit difficult to get used to, due to the complex elements like Civilization (Resources, managing, politics etc.)You'll learn the basic ropes in an hour, but the harder knots in a few hours more.But it's fun and immersive!-The sound effects are Ahh and Ohh and the combat effects in beam-weapons are just music to your ear-Though traveling from one star system to another is EASIER than in MoO2 due to the quick links (makes the exploration much enjoyable)  colonizing planets is just as dope as in MoO2!_______________________________Now to the negative side of this:-The combat camera might be tricky at some points and the soundtrack might seem looping the three songs all over, it might get on your nerves at some point of the game.-Combat consist of three stages on the strict time-line:1. Long range2. ""Come closer and say that to my face""3. ""Pirates of the Carribean -close"" Du du dun dun du du dun dun, du du duuu...Which reminds me, that you probably can't BOARD the ship, which you could do in MoO2 and capture (i haven't figured that one out...)What if i'd just want to stay like... Long range and beam 'em?-Combat's NOT turn based, it's completely automated. (Which is a bummer in a turn based game, thank you based space)-Planet invasion has no animations.It's either you bomb the living hell from the buildings or the people liberate them, OR then you ODST down to planet surface (again automated) and deliver some 'Murican freedom right to their doorstep.-MISSILES, MISSILES and... MISSILES! what else you might need? Oh, ARMOR. That's all you need as the beams and laser-pews  are just plain useless against the PROTON TORPEDOES! (MoO2 had them, atleast they hit in the same turn)-The contact of another factions is dull and boringNo animations on the different races which would give them some personality (like in MoO2, in which every race seemed like an unique individual in the contacting of it. neat animations, distinct soundtrack and expressions, you could maybe say the same thing is in Civilizations)-No goverment of any kind.The population is just dead silent and the only thing they're showing is how satisfied they are. Some kind of civilian-contacts from planets would be great, atleast from a secretary who's in charge for the population.""The people would like some heaters on Planet-X, it's freezing there!"" or something like that.Though this would have a double-sided effect, it would be a nice detail though it might annoy in a long run. Ofcourse, ignore has been a darn effective way of saying: ""k well lol no maybe later.""-Further into the game it just pops up some notifications from time to time about a trade, alliance or whatever. Then the question is everytime. ""Now who was that... the Reds? uhhh... Sowers? was i in allegiance with them or... what?""The game could have distinct Leader names, so i could know who the ♥♥♥♥ i'm whooping and who's under my wing.-The AI in this game is in favour of Sowers, Sowers, Sowers, Imperium and Sowers, which Sowers fill the rainbow of faction colours. (They should rename this game Sower Space, come on, some variety in the AI random selection, eh?)-Big bad guys are missing. The one's that threaten your whole existence. The one's, who's home universe you would invade with a whole fleet for a retaliation and rip out the whole root of evil.The ones that are really ugly.Master of Orion's Antarans. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and their little peashooters that swiss-cheesed my Titans. (Okay, everyone's. They were just a plain in the tail-end.)Yet, i wish this game had these kind of forces of evil, atlaest the kinds that are in Mass Effect. Cowards. Tentacloids. No, not a fetish thing srsly. Gotta prease the Japanesu honoruru popurashion-The voice acting in this game. Wait. Is there? I wish there was. It's too quiet. I guess nobody can hear you talk in space... I'm lonely... *sob*-The ship designs are a bit too... Confusing. Instead of looking like spaceships with combat capabilities, they look like dump-trucks with a lifting arm on them, centipede-spiders, butt-plugs, nailclippers and yachts (without the swimmingpools on the deck and palms) if the designs of different ship-classes could be interchangeable (like stolen blueprints from different factions or something like that) it would be just pickle-pleasing.-I want to preview my planet up close and it's cities.It seems like only the big things are visible from the viewer.Not a phallic thing, you creeps -Population assigment is non-existant As the development of the whole star-system is completely driven by infrastructure and it's improvements (That means, if you have a tricked out star-system later in the game and you colonize the late-planet in the same system, it's gonna have all the straws and pops too)-A story mode for each race would be so wished, that i'd start a second christmas for it._______________________________________Things that i'd personally like, something fresh in these type of games:-Minigames!Planet exploration with a fighter, collect resources and have rescue missions.(maybe implement Dungeon of the Endless somehow on the significant planets)-3D HangarPreview your ships and customization of some sort.-ObjectivesWhat could be nicer than random generated objectives or race-specific ones, that provide you some dough and experience points?____________________________________Now to my conclusion:As this game is young, these things might have been forgotten/overseen while the devs have been drunk and have  probably planned all that later in the game (which i certainly hope they do so. When sober.) these are just the details of it.The core-idea's strong and gameplay is solid and the atmosphere in this game is pleasantly void.It was about time, that there was a game that was even compareable to Civ and MoO2 at the same time.As a teenager of a game, this doesen't focus on small things, but the bigger ones that matter.This is forgiveable for now, but when Endless Space grows, you'd expect more of it.As the parents the Dev's should improve this game instead of making a new child (in that case they should be slapped and put in the corner to shame.) But let's hope for the best.As this game might be the next big thing, what the younger generation would remember like i'd remember Master of Orion. Let's hope so.Should you buy this?Yes.  For a full price?Not at this stage, but when it had it's improvements... i'd pay more.Like the merchants in the Metro 2033 would say:""Better than your TBS. Recommended."" "

												This is a very good entry in the sci fi 4X field - you have the standard strategic choices to make of how fast to expand, whether to push economic, technology, military or colonization efforts, choose where to explore and settle, when to go to war, and within the technology trees you have largely the same dilemmas of which areas to develop.For me this is were Endless Space excels - there are no easy answers most of the time, for example when choosing the next technology to work on there always seems to be a number of that you really want, but rarely anything that stands out as much better than the rest, and there isn't much in the way of filler either (only really military technologies that don't fit your play style/game situation, diplomacy related techs in some situations/game setups, and the later happiness techs if you are playing on the easier levels).As in most of these sorts of games getting a tech lead is key, but in doing so you still have to cover the bases and have enough military to deter or hold up the enemy if they attack, and enough production to churn out an actual defense force quickly before your enemies are at the gates, plus to research fast you need to expand your empire to some good locations, and expanding means you need to start dealing with the rising unhappiness of your growing population, which then distracts your technology aims towards happiness related techs, and diverts your tax money into panem et circenses.The ship design system works fine, and gives a lot of flexibility to try out lots of alternatives - you basically have a doubled rock-paper-scissors system of short range quick firing cannons, medium range lasers, and long range but slow missiles, and three matching types of defenses you can put on each ship to reduce or avoid the damage from each type. Plus the customary massive range of other things (repair systems, weapons boosters, troops, anti-population/infrastructure weapons, scouting modules, etc). You can try to specialize (with ""wall"" ships protecting ""glass cannons"" at the back of the fleet, specialist support ships that carrry power modules that increase the rest of the fleets weapon damage, and many other options), or just lots of similar ships maybe not as strong due to being jack of all trades, but meaning damaged fleets can just merge together without missing a key element, etc. And that is even before considering what your scouting of enemy fleets tells you about what weapons systems and defenses they are using and whether you want to adapt your fleets to take advantage of that (and risk being weak against a third party attack, or the next wave of his fleets that have a completely different weapons systems/defense preferences).The battle system is pretty much ""auto calc"" only, although you can watch (and they look fairly cool the first few times through), and you make a few strategic choices (and if you watch you can adapt to the enemies tactics or changing situation slightly). Personally I think it works fine here - it keeps the strategic part of the game flowing, especially in the late game when there are lots more fleets around and turns would otherwise take an eternity while at war (as many half won games of MOO2/MOO3/Ascendancy/etc. got eventually abandoned due to being too close to autocalc everything, but too slow to actually feel like taking the time to grind out the last remnants of the enemy).

Each with their own Perks and flaws.Maybe you'd want to create a race that is more customized to you this game also offers that.There is limitless Possibilities ^_^.This is one game title you should give a try if you love the genre :)Anyways i'd rate the game 8/10 overallHope you get the game and enjoy it!Cheers - Ploogie			"

												4X games: my anti-drug... and my anti-sleep, too, I guess. No other genre has the power to keep me going, turn after turn, well past the time that any sane person would have collapsed from sleep deprivation. I grew up on Master of Orion, and I honestly have to say that I enjoy it more than MoO or MoO2. That's mostly due to the convenience improvements that this game has over those older games, plus it just looks beautiful. The ""synchronous turn"" approach works brilliantly.Ship combat is a bit of a mixed bag, though. I do miss the turn-based combat of MoO, but I recognize the advantages of the CCG-style approach. Ship combat could get tedious in MoO and often wasn't that compelling, since it didn't require a great deal of strategy. In Endless Space, each battle is over quickly, and battles over star systems can last many turns. This means that each battle could be just a small part of a larger, ongoing conflict that is much more interesting. On the other hand, I'm not a big fan of the weapons system. I honestly don't know why you should pick one weapon type over another, but it just so happens that the weapon type I chose worked pretty well. *shrug*I could go on with the comparisons to MoO, but most of you probably haven't played it. Basically, this is a really great 4X, empire-building game. I highly recommend you give it a try. It could be a bit daunting at first, though, so I'd recommend starting light with a ""throwaway"" session, where you just try things to see what happens. You'll pick up most of what you really need to know as you play the game. For everything else, there's google. :)			"

												What this game lacks in graphics it totally more than makes up for in originality and playability. I keep wishing for a decent 4X space strategy game with tactical battle control ala the Master of Orion series, and while this falls short on that, it's combat system is pretty interesting. Where Endless Space really excels is in its races - in MOO and GalCiv it felt like I was always playing the same race with different pair of sunglasses, and that's very much NOT the case here. Races that pick up and move, or that don't use money, or that munch on the worlds they inhabit - they do all sorts of weird stuff that every race feels different.			"

												Endless Space is a pretty good space 4x game. The graphics are great and the game mechanics strike a good balance that avoid micromanagement.There are some other oddities that I would probably classify as bugs. For example, if an enemy fleet has targetted one of your fleets you can't move them to retreat. Even if the enemy fleets haven't arrived in system yet.And there are almost no keyboard commands. WSAD and arrow keys work, but other than that - nothing. You must use a mouse wheel for zoom. And even though there are menus, they aren't mapped to the keyboard. IMHO, a pretty major design oversight. For me, requiring a mouse for a turn based game drops this from a 4 star game to  a 3 star game.			"

												I bought this game when it was on sale for $1. I really wasn't sure if I would like it or not. In fact, I debated buying it, even at that price. But then I figured it was a dollar. So, I sold some trading cards in the market place and picked it up with the proceeds. Four hours later.... I can safely say it was totally worth it! Its a great game. Lots of strategy and planning. But it has a steep learning curve if you (like me) aren't used to this type of game. The tutorial isn't terribly helpful, but fortunately there are lots of youtube videos to help you get started, teach the basics and explain stuff. Once you know what you are doing, it is actually fun to colonize planets and expand your empire.			"

They can be VERY long play sessions depending on the size of the map. Because of that, I recommend playing few small sized maps first to get the hang out of the game and then proceed to larger size games.Soundtrack is exceptionally awesome to my own liking.			"

												Endless Space is a fun space 4x game that focuses on managment and large scale planning more than the finer details. This is my only experience in the space 4x genre so this review should be read from the perspective of a newbie.  With all of that said, Endless Space is a very fun game if you enjoy management and large scale planning in strategy and 4x games.  Much like the other Endless strategy games, Endless Space excells first and foremost in creating unique and varied experiences right from the start with well made, and very diverse factions to choose from.  From there, it is all about expanding, researching and building as you take over the galaxy.  All of which are very satisfying.  This game boasts a fairly nice level of complexity and balance which left me constantly experimenting with build paths and constantly learning how to play better.  The only down side I can see to this game, and this may be a deal breaker for some people, is that the combat sucks.  There is no micro management for combat.  Combat is essentially how you build your troops and then you can watch a cinematic of how the battle resolves.  Personally, I loved this as I find combat to be tedious in almost all strategy games, but those of you who enjoy building troops and leading them to victory: this game is not for you.  I loved this game.  If you are a fan of 4x strategy and don't mind forgoing a meaningful combat experience, this game offers a deep and fun experience that focuses on the macro side of things.  I am new to the Space subgenre of 4x but so far this game stands out as amazing.  (If you have micromange the crap out of your combat, this is a pass unfortunatly). "

I don't have a God complex at all, nopenopenope.Anyway, its mostly a GalCivs-style 4X, the resource management is a pretty heavy-handed (although you can put much of that under control of the AI, and the AI is trustworthy most times), and when you build your military units, you have to equip/upgrade templates for them else they're pretty useless even in massive numbers; as you progress in the 4 tech trees you'll unlock new abilities and more efficient ship modules and every so often you'll need to bring your fleets in for a refurb. And then you have fleet combat with formations and tactics to contend with, there is some randomness to how that plays out (its a rock-paper-scissors scenario) but it will rarely make a huge difference in the end.Like most 4X's there's a LOT to learn, in addition to the fact that there's faction-specific lore and technologies to learn; there is a tutorial-esque thing but after reading a few screens of it you'll want some aspirin, basically you just have to dive into the deep end and drown a couple times before everything snaps into place for you (or at least, that was my experience.)Also like many 4X's, there's a mechanic where you can use your gold - called ""Dust"" in this game, which I kinda wanna mock but whatever - to bypass production queues, basically you buy the ship/building/etc at a high price and get it on the next turn rather than having to depend on your population's laborforce, and any one resource is dependant on the other three: food (population increase speed), industry (production speed), dust (money), and science (research speed).  Once you get to a certain point in the game, you can have money rolling in if you micromanage the hell outta your early star systems, so that mechanic might be OP to some; since I'm all about domination/expansion victories, personally I abuse it every chance I get, and its fun =D If you think that's BS, however, the higher difficulties really don't permit lavish spending, unless the Random Generator God is pleased with you (and he never is is he, ♥♥♥♥ that guy ^^) Also there's at least one faction that outright cannot use dust, so they basically have one of the four resources removed, which fundamentally changes how you have to approach things.This was before the Sid Meier's Civ In Space game, if that's what you want you can probably just go that route and be happy, this smells a little more like Galactic Civs, although not quite as hardcore (which for me is a good thing, your mileage may vary).

Pfft... no one can please everyone - but this game pleases many :) (over 3,400) compared to the (500) so that says alot.Endless space is one of those game's you grow to love the more you play.It's an amazing 4x strategy game with countless possible outcomes.You can play as a dozen races. Each with their own Perks and flaws.Maybe you'd want to create a race that is more customized to you this game also offers that.There is limitless Possibilities ^_^.This is one game title you should give a try if you love the genre :)Anyways i'd rate the game 8/10 overallHope you get the game and enjoy it!Cheers - Ploogie			"

												While the game isn't ""done"" what with patch updates coming out (for free mind you) it is still a beauty of the 4x genre.  The soundtrack comes with the game, it's beautiful, just like the gameplay mechanics.  You can explore solar systems across a galaxy, terraform planets to better suit your needs, and even create a custom civilization based off the default ones.  The game also offers modding potential so expect a community for that.  Several civilizations also play the game entirely differently.  Cravers actually over-produce on their planets and will eventually drain them of all resources so they constantly need to expand.  While Horatio can clone their heroes.  Combat is handled like a turn based card game as well as allowing you to design your ships with the technology you've learned.You have a lot of control over what galazy the game creates.  From age of the stars to how many wormholes you can change all of these settings for ""optimal"" multiplayer matches.			"

												Endless Space is a turn based strategy game with a few good ideas but poor execution. The number one gripe i have with endless space is the randomness of the combat.Combat involves picking cards to play during the  phases of combat,before the battle begins.You never know if the cards you picked will be countered or not by the Computer opponent. this means that even with a stronger fleet you can still lose a battle due to bad card choices.Also laying seige to a planet takes far to long.Even with multiple seige vessels it can take upwards of 20 turns to conquer a single System!!!!There is also little variation in the weaponry used by all factions.Though the ships from each faction look different,you will find yourself facing the same exact weaponry that your faction has researched.This causes stress beyong measure as you must constantly design new ships to counter the enemy factions vessel's,only to deploy those ships and find them countered by a new design from the enemy,forcing you back to the drawing board.Overall there are simply to many great games similar to Endless Space that are less random,more in depth and simply more fun to play. Namely:Sins of a solar empire and Space empires gold edition.			"

												Its not often that I write the reviews to games and I was finding many of the negative ones to be misunderstood. This game is definitely not for everyone since it is a 4x turn based game that takes elements of 4x and faction/map creation from fallen enchantress, Elements of research from civ, and the feel of Sins but turn based while boasting its own ship design and combat system.If your still reading it means you probably have an interest in 4x turn based games and here is where I will review the game:This game with the disharmony DLC comes with a full set of 12 fleshed out races which is ridiculous since the max game size is 8.  And on top of this you can create your own faction using a point system to pick traits for your faction that can be either negative or positive similar to that of fallen enchantress.  Every race has the same Ship Class setup but they all have different appearances, names and benefits based on each different faction.  To add to diversity races even have unique techs to research and some pretty game changing traits (go play a game of harmony). Ill wrap up the game setup portion with the map settings.  They are very similar to fallen enchantress as well in that you can set up all the parameters to shape the galaxy you are working in which can span from a dozen or stars to hundreds all with 1-6 planets in them making for some pretty large games.The game is turn based and can build up pretty slow for the first 40 turns{normal} depending on the game speed you choose where you will spend a lot of time colonizing and teching up to make your first fighting force.  You need this fighting force because the first time you encounter any enemies you will be in a cold war and you need to show that they cant just steam roll you (this is how I lost my first game first contact with cravers meant my doom).  this may take you well between 2-6 hours depending on if you like to read all the turtorials and tooltips or just spam end turn.The battles are not real time strategy like I see some of the negative reviews complain about (its a fricken 4x game!) instead they are fought like chess (civ style moving fleets around).  You load up your fleet with ships up to a cap that you design yourself with researched weapon systems, defense modules, armor plating and ground invasion forces.  You then either attack an enemy fleet by flying to their star and hitting engage, or you get engaged upon.  When engaged a screen pops up with a pretty sweet layout of everyones ships, weapons, stats the whole shebang.  You get to choose battle cards which are basically a generals tactics he chooses for his fleet and what formations and targeting your going to do.  The targeting works in a way that you can focus fire their front line, spray their frontline or spread fire amongst their whole fleet while choosing how your formation will be (high damage up front, or high health).  Next you need battle cards for the three main battle phases: Long, Medium and Melee.  Then you choose your battle card for example: Weapon Overclock, is an offensive card that tells all your troops to wreck havoc with kinetic weapons, there are counters to this such as defensive cards that will get a boost if used against you during the phase you choose offensive.  This allows for further strategic gameplay and a few good counters with correct card placement to allow you to overcome some slick odds (Had a match where my 4 ships obliterated 10 enemy ships in the long range phase because I countered them with a good card that made my damage output ridiculous.The battles themselves can be auto resolved if the player so chooses but manual is so much more satisfying to watch your ships engage the enemy.  The graphics of these battles are pretty decent, this game is 5 years old at the time I write this and I run it at max settings and I am always satisfied to watch battles.  The music in this game is nothing to write home about its very spacey.  I would recommend this game to anyone open to 4x games, I personally got the game for a dollar during steam sale and I play it more than most games ive payed full price for. "

												A new look on an old 4X format, Endless Space is an homage to Master of Orion, with a blatant nod to its predecessor by naming one of the solar systems ""Antares"".  The game has a significant learning curve, though it is somewhat alleviated by a plethora of in-game tutorials.  Despite the tutorials, I occasionally had to search forums for gameplay help.  The time between turns even in early stages of the game is uncomfortably long on contemporary hardware.  The game looks beautiful, but the UI is sometimes difficult to navigate.			"

I only got as far as setting up a multiplayer game before figuring out that it wasnt cooperative. (I know it isnt listed as cooperative, but I made a bad assumption based on the game type). It looks interesting and maybe I'll get around to playing single player. However, that was not what I was looking for when I bought this game.			"

												Endless SpaceThis is the first time I have written a review for any game. I have been playing 4x games since Master of Orion. I like how the game is midway between MoO2 and MoO3 in that there is a plethora of buildings and research, but you don’t have the minutia that MoO3 had.I gave ES a thumbs down because of the Rock/Paper/Scissors approach. In my mind if you have a fleet that has a higher military strength then your opponent then you should win. However I have been in battles where I have done close to 0 damage and the enemy does 10,000’s in damage even though I have a higher battle value. That to me shows that there a flaw in the game. If my fleets, that have all the advanced weaponry, defenses, and armor, are taking damage but not giving back, then somehow the AI is either cheating or there is a flaw in the game.I was 377 turns into the game and number 1. I had researched every tech on the tree and so had my opponent, yet somehow their fleets with less military power were decimating my forces with greater power. This is a game that should appeal to people who like early on zerg rushes. I like a longer game where I can build up.It was enjoyable but I am glad I only paid around $9 on sale and not the full price. On a scale of 1 to 5 I would give it a 2 because of the frustration of the combat system. "

												This game is enjoyable, beautiful, and will run on a potato at 60fps, but if you like 4X space games I can't honestly recommend it over the Galactic Civilisations series. Combat  in Endless Space is a very uninvolved tactical endeavour, and the empire management becomes easy mid-game. Even playing on the harder difficulties, I feel like the game isn't challenging enough. If only the developers made a Brave New World-style expansion to give players more to do in the mid game. Maybe the multiplayer is more enjoyable than the lacklustre AI.			"

User Interface is just awesome and intuitive, dynamics are very straight forward.

You can focus on actually playing the game, which is by far not a standard for this kind of game. Give it a try.			"

												Overall I would say disatisfying.  Waited a long time to buy it because it sounded bad on initial release.  Finally got it on sale.  Maybe I'm a stickler but three years after release there are still typos in several texts.  For an hour I worked on getting my influence over a competitors planet to find out that doesn't mean anything (as far as taking it over).  In that sense it still seems unfinished, and is nowhere near the next in the line of greats like MOO2 some people make it out to be.  It's ok, not upset because I got it on sale and it provided some entertainment.  But I think there are other titles more worthy of a good review and your hard earned cash.EDIT: After spending an inordinate amount of time picking my three cards for combat, that's even more hellish.

												Lets see where to start? I will say that while I'm not a big fan of the level of micromanagement that the game goes to, it was well implemented in my opinion, not only giving you a strong feeling of control over the types of productions your planets can excel at but also how you want to specialize your ships for space combat or invasions and everything in between. The combat is undoubtbly the weakest part of the game, which is a shame since they seemed to have put a good amount of thought into the customization of ships. There isn't any real-time fighting, rather you pick a type of strategy from a list for each phase and then the ships fight until one side has been destroyed or all three phases have passed. The fights usually turn into constant metaing or a rock-paper-scissors match with one side or the other choosing to spec their ships to fire whatever the enemy has the least defenses against. Personally I think they should have increased the number of ships allowed in each fleet so more diversity of ship roles could be filled without decreasing overall effeciency. Oftentimes I usually just had a fleet of high defense ships that repaired and no weapons up front to soak damage while I had high damage dealing ships in the back to destroy everyone. The limitations of the combat shows when you have more than 20 weapon slots on a single ship but it was to waste it's whole slavo on just one ship instead of targeting multiple ones. The combat is just not managed well and really felt more like a numbers game than applying any real tactics to win. The pace of the game can somtimes be incredibly slow, as making first contact can sometimes take forever, ships traveling can as well and researching can be an ordeal if you don't focus enough planets on researching science. I played my first game on the easiest difficulty and I was more bored by the general pace of the game than how it became to crush the AI once I researched the right things and specced my ships the way I wanted to. Basically if you want a sci-fi strategy game with lots of managment and don't mind a soul-crushing slow pace of things then this is for you. But the combat is lackluster and the game doesn't offer enough interesting things on a turn-by-turn basis to keep things interesting.			"

												This is an interesting micro-management galactic space conquest game.  On par with other games like it.  Its graphics are superb and sound and music are excellent.  The interface is easy to get the hang of and it is fun.  Only draw back is a few things.  One is the AI cheats...it gets unlimited resources to mess around with....so by the time I had reached turn 10 it already had advanced ships of multiple types...and sent them to assault me..a feat that is imp[ossible for the player.  The next bad thing was this game aside from the typical micromanagement has more micromanagement of materials needed to build things....literaly if you dont have the materials you cannot build things or upgrade things.  This second part literaly makes the game un-playable at points....as you have no way to collect these special commodities when you actualy need them.  The game is fun....but with a lockout like that to let you be unable to build or advance....is stupid....i was going to tell people to yes play this neat game.  But after reaching turn 55...and seeing this stupidity...i realize this game is a lost cause.  I find myself frustated I wasted money on a game that might have been fun...but instead added un-needed commodities of specialized types to the already in game commodity system.  In other words the game forces you to play a specific boring way....and that makes it not fun.			"

												I wanted to like this game. It's just the little things. The default factions are not very well balanced. The Tech Tree takes too long to learn to utilze properly. Even those used to TBS games should be playing their first games on easy difficulty instead of Normal. Designing your own ships is hard to figure out the best mixes. Heroes become polarised very early in their development and you don't get even close to as many as you would like. Space battles are also tough to figure out how best to utilize the different strategies. I am sure there are plenty of fantastic guides out on the internet for all of these, but it's just too many things to need to go to an external source for just to enjoy the game.I recommend Galactic Civilizations II as a far superior product, and Galactic Civilizations III (Beta out now) should be even better still.

												**9.5/10**HANDS DOWN!Is the game perfect? No. Does it have some of the same issues other turn-based 4X games have? Yes. But that is where the similarities to other generic 4X games (like Civilization) end. The game occupies one of the most fascinating sci-fi settings I've seen in a strategy game, second only to Starcraft.  The gameplay is fluid, easy to pick up, but hard to master.  And as for strategy, well, let's just say even the toughest game of Risk couldn't prepare you for the decisions you have to make on the fly in this game when playing at high difficulty, both in terms of expanding to other star systems as well as micro-managing the indivudal planets and systems you already control.Before I bought this game, I had never played an Amplitude Studios game.  ""Endless Space"" has single-handedly turned me into an Amplitude fanboy!*** Also, if you enjoy ""Endless Space"" I HIGHLY reccommend that you also pick up their Early-Access games ""Dungeon of the Endless"" and ""Endless Legend"".  They are the most highly polished early-access games I've ever seen on Steam.  This studio knows what they're doing!			"

												Unfortunately ES isn't a very good 4x strategy game, playing it more only reveals all the major flaws of the game, however one major aspect of any 4x game is decently programmed AI, and that is something Endless Space doesn't have at all, since the AI is poorly programmed and starts with more or less infinite bonuses and the ability to do things the player can't -  the outcome of the game almost always leans in favor of the A.I winning no matter the difficulty setting, unless the player has enough experience to know all the aspects of the game, knows the skill tree and how to get important research done first and of course, the player gets an almost legendary start.    Even on the easiest of difficulty settings, the A.I can still easily beat a skilled human player because of the boosted AI stats.  Not to mention, throwing almost endless high powered fleets of ships if war is declared against the player and to add further insult, knowing almost intimate information about the players empire so it can attack your weakest points at any time, like many 4x games - basically the AI is programmed to cheat since thats the easiest way to program an AI to give a human player a challenge, even on the newbie difficulty A.I difficulty makes me want to face palm.   I'd like to know how its possible for an A.I player with a couple of planets to have nearly double the score I have sometimes when I have nearly triple the star systems, wonders and a large fleet of ships?Some would say its a ""Smart A.I"" but there is a difference between a proper smart A.I and one that has been programmed with cheap bonuses that more or less gives it a clear winning edge against the player.   Also, I think the galaxy map isn't big enough, the so called ""Huge"" map feels quite small by comparison to other 4x space strategy games with maybe less than a 100 star systems without mods.  Many of the good mods unfortunately break the game completely as they haven't been updated, these mods we're perhaps the saving grace of the game but now its more or less been abandoned. Like someone commented, this game seems to be better played co-op against A.I players.  Single player just isn't worth your time, especially if your a 4x fan - ES seems to be more like a zerg rush than empire building, which weakens the gameplay considerably -  so the title really should be changed to Endless Zerg or Endless Fleets. I think the premise of the game is fairly good, the graphics, sound - all that is fine.   The problem really lies with the execution of the gameplay, thats where it falls down.    I think a sequel that fixes all the major problems the original has would be a good contender for the top 4x space strategy title,  but they need to fix a lot of problems and make sure they don't make the same mistakes. 4x space strategy is about expansion, empire building - in a nutshell turtling out your empire, building fleets - defending choke points - exploring the galaxy.  ES does this, but in such a way it all takes the back burner,  the galaxy without 'working' mods is way too small - The AI cheats too much to make the game fun or interesting, so a sequel needs better programmed AI without infinite bonuses or other stupid stuff.  Overall, 4/10  Endless Space isn't 'terrible' per say, but AI does heavily let the game down.  GalCiv remains the king of 4x space strategy games.  I'm glad I got this from the Humble Bundle sale, I would never pay full price for this.   I would like to see a sequel to see if they can improve the game.			"

												I like this game, it's pretty good. It has pretty great civ customization options, a pretty good galaxy customization scheme, and a neat approach to in-universe tech explanations. The devs are pretty good with long-term upkeep, and have released regular updates so far.However, it is a bit awfully easy to win using economic, science, and wonder victories. As in, extremely easy unless you're playing on the top-tier difficulties. The combat isn't particularly deep and doesn't really get any better, and the hero system is pretty useless sometimes.Disharmony adds a neat dimension to the game by removing a quarter of the economic system as a challenge, but you'll only end up playing as the Harmony once you're comfortable with the game. Since they're packing a lot of new features in updates for Disharmony, I'd say it's probably worth it.All in all, Endless Space + Disharmony is a good purchase at prices below $20. I got the entire package at $12 during a sale, so I'm happy.			"

												This is a well crafted game and is worth getting and playing through. The best way to describe this game is to say that its like Civilization in Space. The AI is good and on the harder difficulties will adapt to what you are doing and hand your♥♥♥♥♥to you. Basically you have to colonise planets in star systems, research new technologies and deal with opponents. combat is worked out on a dice role basis but you design your ships weapons and shields which means on the harder difficulties you have to tailor your fleets to the fleets that you are going to be fighting against.... seriously the AI in this game is like the borg..... they adapt (at least on the harder difficulties). My only gripe with this game is that on the easier difficulties the end game can get boring as you have dominated the galaxy and are just waiting to get to a victory condition. On the harder difficulties it can be frustratingly difficult to get a decent start.			"

												Endless space is not the game I thought when I bought it. But there's an upside to it too.The strategy aspect of the game is tough. Expect to be defeated while you're getting used to the learning curve. However, this just makes victory that much sweeter. And unless you are playing as a military faction, don't expect to win period.There are no moving ships around in the combat screen. If you like using ""cards"" as the only way to help your troops, you're in for a really good time. Otherwise it sucks.Overall, don't buy unless you like a very limited experience.			"

Combat in space is something you want to participate in. The game itself has all the other features down and often with customization is completely fun and enjoyable.This alone lets me say this game isn't recommended.

												**9.5/10**HANDS DOWN!Is the game perfect? No. Does it have some of the same issues other turn-based 4X games have? Yes. But that is where the similarities to other generic 4X games (like Civilization) end. The game occupies one of the most fascinating sci-fi settings I've seen in a strategy game, second only to Starcraft.  The gameplay is fluid, easy to pick up, but hard to master.  And as for strategy, well, let's just say even the toughest game of Risk couldn't prepare you for the decisions you have to make on the fly in this game when playing at high difficulty, both in terms of expanding to other star systems as well as micro-managing the indivudal planets and systems you already control.Before I bought this game, I had never played an Amplitude Studios game.  ""Endless Space"" has single-handedly turned me into an Amplitude fanboy!*** Also, if you enjoy ""Endless Space"" I HIGHLY reccommend that you also pick up their Early-Access games ""Dungeon of the Endless"" and ""Endless Legend"".  They are the most highly polished early-access games I've ever seen on Steam.  This studio knows what they're doing!			"

												„Endless Space“ is a complete and very nice game. It remembers me on older games like „Master of Orion II and III“ and „Galactic Civilizations II“. It seems to me that the game designer knows much science fiction books like for exemple Frank Herbert's „Dune“ and Isaac Asimov's „Foundation“- series. The game is nearly perfect and you are missing nothing of the usual science fiction stuff, when you are playing it. You really make no mistake if you buy it. The game is not difficult to play but it could be that it is finished sometimes to fast. The research tree is consisting on four branches but you need not research all steps. If you concentrate yourself on one of the many victory ways you will surely win.The metascore of the game is 77; i would say that an 80 is justified. The game is pure fun and the known feature „terraforming“ opens you many ways to build a perfect galactic empire.Achim Hamm			"

												 	Being a fan of Science Fiction and Strategy games, I was intrigued when I saw Endless Space on Steam. Not only did it combine both of my favorite genres, but it was an indie game as well. So I decided to take it for a spin. Little did I realize that I would be sucked into a vibrant universe and asking my wife to allow me ""Just one more turn!""Endless Space plays like a standard 4X game. The player guides his race in gathering resources, researching technologies, building up a military force, and managing star systems in an attempt to conquer the galaxy. What sets this title apart from its peers is how it combines these elements together. First off, the game is easy to learn. This is because the interface is clean and very intuitive. Gone are the days of sifting through various menus to find out what something is and what you are working on. For example, if you want to see what you are researching, just click on the research button. You are then presented with an easy to read research tree with the current project highlighted. Also, if you are unsure what something is or does, just mouse over the item and it will tell you what it is. As with any game of this type, managing your far flung empire later in the game can get tedious. Amplitude Studios combats this problem in a unique way. When an event happens you are notified by a pop-up that will take you to the event when you click on it. If multiple events are present, this pop-up will remain until the player dismisses it or has addressed all the events listed. While this goes a long way to ease empire management, it does not totally resolve the problem. Later turns can still be long and drawn out while you deal with these events.The combat in Endless Space is where the game excels. The player can either have the computer resolve the battle automatically, or the player can take control and fight the battle. It is one of the few titles that I have played where tactics are essential. Do I send my fighters in first or do I bombard the enemy from a distance. Each choice affects not only if you are successful, but how many losses one sustains. The game also rewards players for using a mix of ship types. While yes, one could win a battle with a battle group composed of only battleships, but a ""combined arms"" battle group will make the battles quicker with less losses. This creates a world where each battle is different, and sometimes the ""weaker"" side will win.The only problem with Endless Space is that the factions are balanced too well. No matter what faction you play, you have some sort of built in counter that negates the other faction's abilities. At first this made the game really easy to play and but soon it can become monotonous. Most of the balance issues have been addressed with the Disharmony DLC and patches, but some of them still remain.Overall, I have to give Endless Space 9 out of 10 stars. This highly polished and easy to learn game has raised the standard for not only games from the 4X genre, but indie games as well. I highly recommend it to not only fans of the 4X genre, but new players as well. Just make sure to say goodbye to your friends and family before you play!			"

												I've been learning this 4x game by exploration, which is oddly appropriate considering exploration is a good part of the game.  It has been living in a window on my other monitor, which is one of those pleasant advantages of a turn based game, so I haven't really played as many hours as it will say I have -- but it's been a constant companion for days.  I work on things on the ""tomato"" rule -- do something, take a break -- and this has been my ""take a break.""  The devs have managed to infused a good feeling of RPG into the factions and context of the game.  It's polished like an apple, the art style is gorgeous, the music is...well, it reminded me of Eve and I turned it off after a bit.  But the skill trees are deep and interesting, the strategy is pleasantly no-one-solution, the achievements are -- many of them -- gigglesome and some might really appeal to the obsessive.Much more elegant than Sid Meier's stuff.  It appeals to the anthropologist (xenologist?), engineer, and storyteller in me as well as the game geek/dev/closet space grognard.I find myself interested in trying to win the game as different factions having played against random different factions as AI in 2 player games.  I find myself doing dishes and modelling how larger games with more factions would work out, after a few days of playing.  What better recommendation for a game than that it amuses me away from the keyboard, as well as at the keyboard?			"

												I bought this game during the summer sale, which i love.  Now, this game I don't love.  Okay, maybe I am being a little hard on the game.  The game looks sort of like an old game I used to play called Stars!. Stars! was a very simple star stagey game, you make different ships, conquer different planets, and grow in research.  Endless Space took this and expanded on the game.  I like conquering the different planets, but the battle system really SUCKS.  You have to pick different tactics that the other player choses, if you win you get a bonus in the battle if you lose the pick you get lower stats.  I am sorry this SUCKS.  Just let me battle.  If i research better weapons i have better weapons.  The teck tree takes to long to learn and really stretches the game out.I do like to play the game but I am really glad I did not pay to much for the game.  I would never pay over 5 dollars for the entire game with all its MODs. "

												This game is utterly disappointing.It suggests depth where none exists and beautiful graphics which are indetailed at second glance.Your choices do no really matter in ship design, research or colonization. It's just an endless (phun not intended) line of minor upgrades which them cumulate over time. If you manage to outsmart the dumb AI and there aren't multiple factions turning on you (for no apparent reason of course) you can win the game.A horrible example of the 4x genre. It does everything wrong. Master of Orion II beats this at every turn. Sad, just sad.			"

												I bought this game during the summer sale, which i love.  Now, this game I don't love.  Okay, maybe I am being a little hard on the game.  The game looks sort of like an old game I used to play called Stars!. Stars! was a very simple star stagey game, you make different ships, conquer different planets, and grow in research.  Endless Space took this and expanded on the game.  I like conquering the different planets, but the battle system really SUCKS.  You have to pick different tactics that the other player choses, if you win you get a bonus in the battle if you lose the pick you get lower stats.  I am sorry this SUCKS.  Just let me battle.  If i research better weapons i have better weapons.  The teck tree takes to long to learn and really stretches the game out.I do like to play the game but I am really glad I did not pay to much for the game.  I would never pay over 5 dollars for the entire game with all its MODs. "

												Reading the other positive reviews, I don't understand how people are recommending this game. They list out all of the same flaws I found but they're still recommending the game...? I guess 4X just isn't what it used to be, but I found this game to be terrible. The UI wasn't friendly at all - information was in completely different places on different screens, and doing simple tasks was often confusing. I had to do a google search to figure out how to upgrade my existing ships.The combat was boring and gave very little feedback as to what happened or why. The default view of combat jumps around like a speed freak, and although you can turn it off you'll be back to the same view next time. There was a description of how much damage you did but in mixed fleets that wasn't enough to tell you what happened. I finally gave up when a hero-led fleet was repairing faster than I could damage the ships. The hero character was completely unbalancing.Parts of the game had potential which is what made the things that didn't work so much more frustrating. For the first ten turns I thought I finally had something that was an update of the old 4X classics.			"

												It claims to be a 4x game but its not, its a turn based sci-fi strategy. It a more complex version of Star Wars: Empire at War. The basic gameplay is to colonise planets where upon you manage population, research and military progression. The Tech tree is huge and you will need to read some strategy guides as to how to best use it.So far I am a little disappointed and still trying to find the appeal. My general impression was to get lost in the tech tree, slowly explore and then to get crushed by an invading NPC. I did get it and play it in its early stages and a few comments say that the difficulty has been smoothed out.Personally I will not be returning to it.			"

												Behold, endless space.You will be astounded at the wonderfully complex systems this game offers, everything from custom ships to procedural systems with unique planets that offer an array of negative anomalies to make your expansion and developmet within the game no less than abysmal.Stand in awe as you bleed hours away while sifting through the tech tree searching deep within the depths of a seemingly endless array of technology that also feels procedurally generated and is delivered with skillful random assembly.Watch in amazement as you expand your Empire upon the stars, flying into the unkown, discovering procedurally generated systems and planets containing a baffling number of negative effects that will make your people develop an unending disatisfaction of you and their new homeworlds.As you bask in amazement of your empires rage you will find yourself in endless space, finding new ways to appease your people meanwhile a vast array of alien species that will threaten your empire and push you to new heights of frustration.Upon countering that new plateu you will enter the ship customizer and find you have no tech in weapons, thus leading to your imminent reduction in empire size and your eventual defeat on Newbie difficulty.Endless Frustration.Lots of good ideas, terrible execution lacking proper difficulty scaling. The in game systems are so complex and confusing it is nearly impossible the play ""correctly"" without dedicating a huge amount of time to understand how it works - which as far as i can tell is very inconsistent. Things that should be common sense are not so and it seems that it was deliberately made to become obscenely harder the longer you play but in doing so went the opposite direction as to what would apply to common sense of an empires' development and that breaks the game since even an economically inclined person will have to throw away his appropriate logic in order to conform to the unjustifiably broken systems in Endless Space.

												It´s slow to start, the first time you play it ever and leave the tutorial on you get a ton of screens pop up for every small thing you do with walls and walls of text. But, in the end, you can accept that and just walk through that once and never have to do it again. Problem i found however, i never was able to finish a game because for me (not everyone apperantly) the game does NOT load late-game saves, forcing you to start a new game spending hours and hours and hours, possibly days on a single game only to find out that again you can't finish it because the save wont load. And leaving it running the whole time makes it laggy as mad after several hours of play time, so thats not an option either.I would've adviced the game if i could actualy finish it because it looks good and can be quite fun. But because of this, i would not buy it untill the bug is removed for good (currently marked as unsolved on the official forums).			"

Further, the AI isn't affected by of the factors that players have to contend with, from fleet size to dust.  This is a boring game created by lazy and stupid developers too mentally deficient to create an AI that does anything but cheat and rush.

												I wanted to like Endless Space so badly. I love 4x space games, and like a lot of us am still waiting for the successor to Master of Orion 2 to come along. I'd been hoping ES would finally succeed where so many others had failed. In fact, I periodically download and play it again hoping that maybe I was wrong and there's a good game buried in there somewhere.There's not.As many people have written the biggest problem is combat. There's nothing interesting about it. There are three types of weapons and three types of defenses. Each gets linearly more powerful as you tech up, and each defense stops one type of weapon and is useless against the other two. If you have the right defense against an enemy ship you win. If you don't, they win. There's a system where you play three cards to influence the battle, but it moves too slowly and has too little impact to make any difference.There's no diversity of units like in Civilization nor tactical combat like in Master of Orion (or the brilliant Total War series). There's just a big game of rock, paper, scissors. One side wins, the other side loses, you rebuild and repeat. Don't bother with any other type of victory either. There's no room for cleverness in a rocks/paper/scissors system and no stationary defenses, so if you don't put everything into your military the player who did will crush you every time.It's the same with domestic policy. Your systems have to specialize, so you pick whether a system will produce money, tech or industry, plug in all the appropriate buildings and then auto build cash, science or ships. You don't really decide which to do, because each planet is good for one particular thing so the system composition pretty much decides this for you. There's nothing interesting happening in the galaxy or territory uniquely worth fighting over, no external threat or game changing discoveries. Even the little tactical interest that comes from star lanes and wormholes is gone shortly into the game once ships can fly through open space.By the mid-game your empire is pretty much running on autopilot. Cash and science systems tick away and your only interaction is to build fleets and throw them at the enemy. Periodically you upgrade the design of your ships for new science or if the enemy switches to a different weapon.Most of the problem came from the developers' focus on making a multiplayer game. They stripped the mechanics down in order to keep them balanced, and that ultimately made the game *much* less interesting. The wonders, for example, confer system bonuses instead of being big, powerful icons that can change the course of play. System bonuses aren't interesting. I can catch up to that with a few extra factories and don't even need to if they show up on a lousy planet. But the multiplayer would be unbalanced if one person could, by random chance, stumble across a game changer. It's the same with everything else. There are no weird discoveries to make in the galaxy or overpowered planets, like MOO2's gaians, because that would advantage one player too much. Military tech marches up rails up three branches and that's it, no clever or assymetrical weapons or decisions to make for fear of breaking things. Even the races are just a collection of relatively minor statistical differences from each other, nothiing that feels truly different or unique.There are a lot of little things wrong with Endless Space and a couple of big ones, but ultimately the game just isn't that much fun. It feels flat and lifeless. One play through is pretty much exactly like every other and by midway through your second game you'll get bored.			"

												As a big fan of 4X Space Strategy games, I find Endless Space quite lacking.  While it mimics other 4X games adequately, it has very little unique.  Both diplomacy and research are extremely limited, with no room for variation in either department.  Combat is simplistic and underwhelming.  You play the role of observer more than anything.  Only one thing stands out as different: system invasion.  Instead of just blockading or taking over, you have to wear down a system's resistance, an especially useful system when being attacked on multiple fronts.  All in all, though, 5 out of 10 stars.

												Good for a few games, but really the fact that it's an Indie title clearly shows after you get past that. Multiplayer is buggy as all hell, I can't tell you how many times the game froze halfway when all players completed their turn and it just had to be aborted. Not to mention if you don't set the game speed to fast you'll be playing for 6 or so hours just to complete a single game. Finally, the game is very snowball-ish, once a player pulls ahead, his resources will keep him only amassing more and more, keeping him ahead, with very little to be done to stop him/her. I love the concept, but it's just not refined enough. I recommend passing on this title.			"

												When I first got this game it looked fun based on videos ive seen and what not. I played for quite some time still illusioned. I still think about playing once in a while when i get bored of everything else, but this game in my opinion is just too rigged. I can understand making it a challenge. I love challenging games. This however gives the ai players all the good planets within reach and leaves you with jack squat. Random events make no sense what so ever. Most of them that involve planets yet to be colonized mostly require advanced crap to even colonize and it may take about 50 turns to even get to that point and by then the ai has already colonized it. This may sound like ""oh thats because you cant play it right"", but I can beat this game, I have beaten it many times. The diplomacy system is stupid, trade is cruddy, pirates spawn way too often if you let them spawn, and the ""happiness"" of your empires citizens are just way too touchy. Not too mention boring space battles, which this game trys to lure people with. I do not regret paying for it per say, Just make sure you know what your getting sucked into. Oh and final note. the ""community"" is really nothing more than a bunch of trekkies trying to get amplitude to make a star trek mod for the game.			"

I should have plant crops in my tech tree like every other race.Or when I colonize a planet, make the planet look like its being terraformed to that race your playing.I mostly bought the game for the space combat which looked epic! but, no.. the matches are like card games. You tell how you would like 3 turns to play out and then use cards or something to help influence the 3 turns. So all you get is flashy cut scene fights and a result of how the battle went.So, all your doing is doing the same research over and over since all factions share the same stuff except one or 2 here and there while gambling on your fleet and expanding to planets that don't make you feel like you should even care.Plus, another thing is each faciton have unique ship models.. nope.. few factions share the same models.

												I consider myself a pretty heavy Space 4X afficionado.  I have played a very wide range of titles in the genre, including MOO2, Sins of a Solar Empire, Space Empires IV and V, Galactic Civilizations II, StarDrive, and Endless Space.  I have even played some of the much older titles, such as Stars! and Spaceward Ho!Unfortunately, I have to agree with TotalBiscuit's assessment of this game: it is well put together, and it is executed adequately, but it lacks soul.THE GOOD:*The user interface in this game is one of the most easy-to-use and informative Space 4X UI's I have ever seen.  I can usually get all of the information I need with a couple of clicks.  Queueing up production, changing tax percentages, or checking which systems needed my immediate attention was very accessible and intuitive.  Gone are the days when I had to make 5+ clicks just to find the information I was looking for, and then 3+ more clicks in order to implement a decision based on that information.*The music in this game is fantastic.  If I could, I would rip the music from this game and use it in the other Space 4X games that I enjoy.  I was also impressed by the fact that the music was somewhat dynamic; when I was in the main space view, the music played with its full instrumentation, but when I went into system view or ship design, the instrumentation scaled back dynamically and played a more sparse version of the same music.  I suspect they have two simultaneous tracks going on at the same time and the game dynaimcally fades from one to the other based on user actions.*The game is challenging early on.  If you don't expand quickly into different systems and establish the borders of your empire, other races will come in and take neighboring systems much earlier than you would expect.  Moreover, if other civilizations don't see you building up a strong enough military early in the game, many of them will simply declare war on you because you look like an easy target.*The tech tree is extensive and varied.  With four main branches to work through, there is plenty of new tech that can be researched through early, mid, and late stages of the game.*Victory conditions are varied and well developed.  The traditional military victory is available, of course, but you can also win the game by expansion (own a certain percentage of the galaxy), science (research enough tech to 'ascend' to a new form of existance), diplomacy (ally yourself with most/all other races, and prevent war for a certain amount of time), economic (earn/control a certain amount of resources/cash), and others.THE BAD:*Combat is by far the most disappointing aspect of this game.  Don't get me wrong--the combat is rendered beautifully, with cinematic camera movements and fabulous explosions.  Sadly, however, combat is NOT user-controllable.  Granted, you can pick rock-paper-scissors style cards that have effects on the stages of combat, but that is as far as user control goes.  I wanted to be able to direct my big battleships and dreadnoughts to strategic positions on the battlefield, while keeping close tabs on the ships that were damaged so that I could steer them away from danger.  No such luck.  As beautiful as the space battles are in this game, I found myself simply picking auto-combat again and again.*Though the races in the game have interesting back stories and differences of starting attributes, in actual gameplay, the races don't really feel much different from each other.  Sure, there are a small number race-specific techs that can be found in the tech tree, but even these don't feel much different than what can be researched by other races.*Planetary colonization and development is boring and forgettable.  There are a few key structures that you can build on each specific planet, but for the most part, the entire star system feels like a single 'colony', for which you build system-wide improvements.  The 'value' of each of these 'colonies' is vastly determined by the number of planets in the system and the amount of population that you can grow system-wide.  Gone are the challenges of a single, resource-rich, but barely colonizable planet that you have to carefully grow to become a viable production center; as long as there are other more hospitable planets in the system, then a low-value planet is virtually pain-free.*Diplomacy in this game is absolutely ridiculous.  While I like the fact that you have to research more advanced diplomacy actions (i.e. trade treaties, tech swapping, alliances, etc.), I felt like the AI was grossly weighted against you in most diplomatic situations.  Even when I was fully allied with a race, with full friendly relationships, they would still ask me for my arms, legs, first-born child, and the soul of my fleet admiral in exchange for a single new technology.  After many attempts, I simply gave up trying to trade technology with my neighbors.  Furthermore, even good races would break treaties with you seemlingly on a whim--I found myself unable to reliably predict how long my good relations with other races would last.*Ship design doesn't allow much as far as meaningful decision-making.  Most of the time, you'll be designing ships with the absolute best weaponry and armor that you have researched; there is very little reason (aside from production cost) to ever use a lesser tech.  Every once in a while, I created a specialized ship (such an invasion ship with high planetary attack capacity but very little ship-to-ship offense, or a carrier that had very little weaponry but loads of fighters and bombers on board).  In many other Space 4X games, I have the ability to design support ships (i.e. refuel, re-supply, repair, or even mobile ship construction yards), transports, miners/resource collectors, star bases, etc.  Not in Endless Space.I wanted to love this game.  I really did.  I put more than 80 hours into it, playing as various different factions (good, neutral, and evil).  But in the end, the lack of controllable combat, the clumsy and unforgiving diplomacy system, and the uninspiring planet/system management process eventually made me decide to go back to other Space 4X games.

												I really wanted to like this game. On normal level after about 100 turns one race has dominated the other races and has all the resources. And then they turn to you with their massive fleets. I have read you need to expend  out and fast. I do that and then I end up with a 50 turn battle with a guy on on side and by the time I finish that battle the guy on my other side comes in with massive ships. My only guess is they start out with a large fleet.			"

												This game has an insanely high learning curve. Its Civ on as much steroids as Armgstrong. The pros: beautiful to look at. some aspects can be fun to play around with. cool loreCons: the tutorial is crap. it teaches you what things do but not how to impliment them. there is no example playthrough (which it really needs). its all just reading about what things do and not how to use them. There isnt any clear explination on how to win the game or what the goal is either. You're better off watching tutorials on youtube. Theres a lot to this game and it can get really confusing. the UI could be a lot better too. The AI is horrible. one second it will be your best friend and then for no reason declare war. I'd rather fight Gandhi. the AI in Civ (as funny and crazy as it is) is by far better than this. Im still playing aroudn with it so I wont give a rating. If you like games that have a huge learning curve then by all means get it. otherwise stay clear away			"

												It's a nice 4X space game, but the AI is more than a bit wonky, the learning curve is steep, the tech tree (which is more accurately described as a four-sectioned web) is flat-out unintuitive, the combat is essentially glorified rock-paper-scissors with almost no strategy whatsoever, and the interfaces could use some polishing. Mac OSX support is excellent for an Apple geek like me, but my opinion on this game is simple: pretty much everything Endless Space does, Galactic Civilizations II does better. Get GalCiv.

												Mediocre and not user friendly (mabye even buggy). This game needs to take a lot of tips from other games like civilization 5, like not letting you end your turn without all your solar systems and units having something to do. Or some parts that seem down right BUGGY. Multiple games I had my fleet of military ships stuck on a single star system because the enemy fleet could endlessly retreat from battle and still prevent me from going anywhere. Or my last game I had where I conquered one system and when I moved into the next all my fleets where stuck and unmovable. Literally no action could be made with them, no fighting or invading and I couldn't even move new troops into that system either.Another terrible part of this game is that if a system is invaded even if the ship(s) have no way (or reseached the tech) to invade will still prevent all units from being made or instanly bought there. So the computer can and will incapasitate you from building military or expansion.Like when I first started playing on the easiest of like 7 difficulties newbie, there are pages and pages of tutorials for everything and every menu in this game. But thats fine its a civilization simulator, except that the AI will still beat you on newbie, they expand faster, build military faster, and anything else to win win the game better (Even if that's not their forte). Funny Civilization 5 (and civ 3) has their AI brain dead on the easiest level, so players can sandbox the game while they learn.The fun parts arn't all that fun, but you can expand and compete for the best planets and manages your species and their approval. You and can build fleets of military ships and enjoy what amounts to reletively the same prerendered cutscene but with diferent ships and most of all random camera angles.I really did try to like this game, in fact I've play far too much civ 5 and I wanted to like this game but I don't.

												Endless Space DisharmonyLong story short = dont buy this DLCWARNING !!! LONG READ AHEAD !!!I had about 40 hours of gameplay on the clasic Emperor Edition and I loved it. Then I bought the Disharmony DLC.First thing that changed (to the bad imho) was the tech tree. The warfare tree got dumbed down. Yes, it has new features like bombers and the Siege tech to invade systems but the ship weapons pulled the short one.In the description of the game they say how good it is that now you can select if you want Long, medium or melee weapons on your ships which imho is stupid. In Emperor Edition you just put the best weapons you had and if you still had space, you could put on some weaker ones to maximize dmg. In Disharmony you cant do that. If you want put Long, medium and melee weapons on the ship = you cant do that. If you put,lets say, medium range torpedos then thats all you can add in the torpedo section. You cant combine long, medium and melee.You can have only 1 type of torpedos. You also cant put weaker ones in if you want to fill up the space of the ship as I mentioned above.Next, the bugs.I said I had the Emperor edition before. When you launch the game it asks you which key to use. You have 3 options. Honestly I dont even know why are there 3 keys there. Does using the last key of the game give you some extra stuff? I dont know but there you have it.After downloading DISHARMONY all my saved games from Emperor Edition got lost. I sent them a report which didnt help at all. At that time it was a 35 hour gameplay that went Houdini. So i had to let it go.I started to play Disharmony. It was all good. but at the 40 hour timer buggs started to show up. 2 bugs to be specific. I dont know what they are. A window shows up and describes the problem in some programing language. 1 Bug stopped showing after a while. Dont know why. The second bug when it shows then freezes your game and you have to shut it down via Task manager. So I started to save my files more often but you also have autosaves.The next that dosnt work is private multiplayer with a friend. Let me explain.My friend has the Emperor Edition only (I have both). So we wanted to play a private multiplayer.When you start the game the window shows up again with 3 Emperor Editon keys and 1 Disharmony key. So I pushed the clasic Emperor Edition key so the games are compatible. But heck knows why it always starts Disharmony instead of Emperor Edition. And after the game loaded a window pops up and says that I have to launch the clasic verision of the game so I can play with my friend. No♥♥♥♥♥♥Sherlock. We tried so many times but it just would not work.Ok. So we gave upon that too.Now I am at about 65 hours of gameplay (as Steam shows me here)I wanted to continue playing.I go to the LOAD section, pick my saved game and start it. And know it freezes at the loading. After about 20 seconds the loading freezes and I have to close it via Task manager again. I tried the autosaves. All of them. Same♥♥♥♥♥♥ It freezes the whole game.So I played 1 map for 65 hours and now I cant play it.How can a game get buggier after more gameplay time?Other features. It says that you can put the fighters/bombers or your main battle ships in formarions. I didnt even find where to do that. I searched for some options at the Battle window when you start a fight. I searched all the HUD in the manual fight. I found nothing. I dont know if Im just so lame and cant find it even when its somewhere visible or it just isnt in the game. Also some TARGETING, which I thought will be an option that will let me target specific ships in the manual battle. Didnt find a thing that would seem to be a option like this anywhere.In conclusion. Buy the Emperor Edition and have fun with it. Dont buy the Disharmony DLC. Its worthlessI sent a long message to Amplitude as well. I hope they fix this♥♥♥♥♥♥of a DLC and do something about it.			"

												The game is like the standard 4x game, build ships, research tech, colonize worlds, however the ships you can control in a fleet is limited to tech, and the combat is broken down to three turns per side. Missiles, Lasers, and Balistics. Thats it.... the game is pretty boring after the first few hours of play, you can't use tactics in combat, and you can't have massive fleets like in most ofther 4x games.

												I love spacegames, they are one of my favorite types of games to play. There's nothing more cool than having a fleet of spaceships jump into an enemy's zone of control and wiping them out and while I love pretty much everything about this game. The only real issue I have with is the combat. In Combat, you basically play paper scissors rock with a few more option with upgrades.For instance,If you choose ""Offense"" and I choose ""Defense"". I would win and my defense would be more effective and I would take less damage while doing more and you wouldn't do much if anything. If I choose Offense and you choose offense, we both get the full effect of it and so on and so forth. That's really lame space combat add in the fact that you can't really a huge fleet.  If memory serves, only 3 big ships can be in a fleet.The rest of the game is fine but that part is so cruciel to the gameplay that it's hard to get past.			"

												While I am certainly not a fully educated man when it comes to games such as this, I do feel like I am playing Microsoft Excel: Space Edition. There is a heavy learning curve for newcomers such as myself, I have a feeling if I could just get past the terrible tutorial that always frustrates me...[click next, next, next,next...Just read a novel] then I would most likely find this game very fun and entertaining, but this is not the case. I do not mean to put this game down by any means, I am simply saying I do not enjoy the heavy learning curve and this is only my opinion of course. I hope someday, if I can get past the novel of Tutorial and not smoke an entire pack trying to enjoy learning this game, Iwill have finally experienced what so many here have praised the game for.

												Bottom Line:if you are looking for a game that has a beautiful package you will enjoy this title.if you are looking for a game with depth / challenge this one is not for you.p.s. there is the multiplayer option i hadn't playedPros:-Graphics-Plenty of options to randomize the generated universe or your race-Replay-ability-GUI is fluent and of great designCons-Unsatisfying combat-After 10 hours of game-play the O.S.T might annoy you.-Poor AI-Poor Balance, some tactics / weapons etc.. much more powerful / useful then others-You will not feel much room for decisions. some times you will find yourself just clicking end turn button until you win.On normal difficulty level, i won several times just by building the right building according to the planet / system researching the cheapest tech each time and attacking the weakest AI neighbour. Basically the AI is so bad, and there is so little strategic depth to this game that by following several rules of a thumb a cat can beat the AI.On higher difficulty level, AI gets bonuses, to overcame them you will need to look for the OP weapons / techs / race bonuses to win. Meaning your choice of tactics narrows to 20% of the OP things out of all what the game has to offer.			"

												After spending many hours with this title, the best I can say is that is about one third complete. The mechanics are so rigid as to prevent any real play variance. For example, you are compelled into a strict regimen of  play - as any variance either too far ahead or behind results in being attacked. There is no real diplomatic and trade based approach. IN the same way, if you want to pursue a science theme, forget it - as the game is designed to ""reward"" following a path that essentially linear across the whole possible range of improvements. The time to discover items becomes so distorted if you try to follow a ""theme"", with turn times blowing out from 2-5 as an average to 30 plus if you try to go a specific route.The planet developments consist of just letting it be automated - trying to decipher half the meanings of some improvements is both frustrating and pointless - there is no visual or other queues to show what you need to stop youe empire constantly going into near revolt, with half of your systems ""on strike"" - even at the easiest settings. As an example, at the lowest setting, playing the Empire, every system has to be set at ""approval enhancements"" for it to work at all.This may sound harsh, but this was NOT a $10 game - and having played MOO II 10 tens ago, which absolutely blows this away, I expected far more than I got.

												I played this game since it appeared as early alpha access up until sometime after full release, but before Disharmony.  I can tell you without a shred of doubt that it had great potential in alpha.  I was rather blown away by the amount of polish and content already in the game, as well as the ease of the interface.Endless Space is a fantastic single player game, if it was only that, I would have been clamoring for multiplayer but satisfied to play alone vs AI (although AI was never brilliant).  As far as space 4x goes, the exploration and expansion aspect was very nice. The combat tries mix being quick with some player choices so its not purely predetermined who would win. I found I could win a military victory extremely fast and easily. As a normally aggressive player, I liked this. And here comes why I hate this game...It is because after this game, I hate amplitude studios. Bugs. Extremely buggy alpha. Buggy multiplayer, buggy beta, buggy release, buggy dlc. I remember at one point they announced that they had hired more programmers or some such to fix the various bugs of the game. They did fix some things, semi-quickly.  Going back to why I played aggressively, it was because a multiplayer game reliably crashed around turn 30. I could kill someone by turn 22. So this was the only way I could finish a game. In this I found enjoyment, but it does not by any means make it a good product. After they fixed some bugs, turn 40 became the new life expectancy.  Also, in addition to that, multiplayer games had a host, and the game was reliant on the host. So if you kill the host, or he quits, every one gets booted to the title screen. Someone has to load the autosave, and get everyone to rejoin, which hardly happened. Most of the time the save file was corrupted anyways.Let's insert a small note about amplitudes voting process for their games.  You get forum points of some sort for various reasons, and that is your voting power. They will give you choices of what to vote on to implement next in the game, and you vote. The problem here is the majority of players just play single player or co-op, so they aren't usually looking to balance the game for multiplayer, they just want aesthetic things. Fix the games bugs was never a vote option, mind you. Keep in mind, all these things will be added at some point, you are just voting on the priority project. It's all well and fine, but trivial.So lets fast forward to Disharmony DLC. A guy on my steam friend list still played the game and would periodically invite his entire list, i presumed. I said oh, Disharmony is out and a lot changed, ok, maybe its all better now. So i picked it up. NOPE, still buggy for multiplayer.  Expect to crash sometime after turn 60.  Additionally, they slowed the pace of the game, by nerfing nearly everything.  I was immediately reminded why I hate them, which was amplified by the fact that it had been HOW LONG???? since the game was in alpha and the same game crashing bugs still existed. This was made worse since even though now the game won't crash as early, the pace of the game was slowed so much that it didn't matter.So any ""Endless"" Title I expect the same garbage to happen. I wanted so bad to give this game around a 8/10 initially, but the studio seemed to not really care much about polishing it, that I really give it a 4/10.  I was recommending it in alpha, I was telling people to never get it ever after release. That is backwards, in case you were wondering.			"

												This is that rare turn-based strategy space game that gets enough right in terms of design and execution that, even though it is not perfect, you keep coming back for more.  I think that Steam achievements really encourage one to try all the different races - and that is a very good thing as you actually have to change play style to get the most out of each race.  The downside is that some of the achievements are hard to unlock due to requiring luck and/or having opaque requirments.  There are also bugs that may lurk in the endgame in some playthroughs.  However, the positives outweigh the negatives, and the devs have done a decent job of supporting the game (improvements and squashing bugs).  I expect to play this game for years, and I can't say that about many games.  Thus, I recommend Endless Space.			"

												Endless Space is a game of management, strategy & patience.If you find creating & updating templates for your ships, forming fleets, updating planetary build orders,  selecting what to research, upgrading hero abilities etc. boring and tedious... then this game is  not  for you. Otherwise, if you like strategy, you should enjoy it, and (on the higher difficulty levels) find it challenging.As far as space strategy 4X games are concerned, this is one of the better ones. It's graphics and (once you learn it) relatively simple rules, lift it in my opinion above most of it's competition. For this reason I give it my recommendation. There are some things about it that can be difficult for the newcomer: The tech-tree is a perfect example:It's four branches would seem to indicate that you can concentrate research on the branch that interests you the most. This is an illusion. If you want to build a strong empire you'll need to concentrate on  all  branches uniformly. Once your have played for a while (and are more familiar with the research techs), you will discover the ways that certain techs (in different branches) relate with each other.    Pirates are another example:Since victory in the game is all about expanding your empire (as quickly as possible), and colonising systems (before they are colonised by other factions), the appearance of pirates can inhibit this (at the most critical time). Prevention is better than cure. Random events aside, pirate fleets will only spawn in systems not under any factions influence (or surveillance). Station scout ships (if possible) in systems to prevent their spawning and / or station strong fleets at strategic systems to prevent their entry into your space.The use of heroes is another example:Heroes can have a very significant effect on your success in the game, especially in fleet combat. Although all heroes will gain experience over time, speed this up as much as you can. A good way to do this is by assigning them to fleets based at systems on the borders of your space. Use them to fight pirates, enemy faction ships etc. In this respect (if your fleet is strong enough) pirates and cold war can be a good thing.Keep a close eye on what the other factions are doing (if you can). It is easy to lose a game because another faction has reached a victory condition before your faction has.Although, far from perfect, there is much that can be enjoyed from this game.Enjoy!!Algenon   "

												I wanted to like Endless Space so badly. I love 4x space games, and like a lot of us am still waiting for the successor to Master of Orion 2 to come along. I'd been hoping ES would finally succeed where so many others had failed. In fact, I periodically download and play it again hoping that maybe I was wrong and there's a good game buried in there somewhere.There's not.As many people have written the biggest problem is combat. There's nothing interesting about it. There are three types of weapons and three types of defenses. Each gets linearly more powerful as you tech up, and each defense stops one type of weapon and is useless against the other two. If you have the right defense against an enemy ship you win. If you don't, they win. There's a system where you play three cards to influence the battle, but it moves too slowly and has too little impact to make any difference.There's no diversity of units like in Civilization nor tactical combat like in Master of Orion (or the brilliant Total War series). There's just a big game of rock, paper, scissors. One side wins, the other side loses, you rebuild and repeat. Don't bother with any other type of victory either. There's no room for cleverness in a rocks/paper/scissors system and no stationary defenses, so if you don't put everything into your military the player who did will crush you every time.It's the same with domestic policy. Your systems have to specialize, so you pick whether a system will produce money, tech or industry, plug in all the appropriate buildings and then auto build cash, science or ships. You don't really decide which to do, because each planet is good for one particular thing so the system composition pretty much decides this for you. There's nothing interesting happening in the galaxy or territory uniquely worth fighting over, no external threat or game changing discoveries. Even the little tactical interest that comes from star lanes and wormholes is gone shortly into the game once ships can fly through open space.By the mid-game your empire is pretty much running on autopilot. Cash and science systems tick away and your only interaction is to build fleets and throw them at the enemy. Periodically you upgrade the design of your ships for new science or if the enemy switches to a different weapon.Most of the problem came from the developers' focus on making a multiplayer game. They stripped the mechanics down in order to keep them balanced, and that ultimately made the game *much* less interesting. The wonders, for example, confer system bonuses instead of being big, powerful icons that can change the course of play. System bonuses aren't interesting. I can catch up to that with a few extra factories and don't even need to if they show up on a lousy planet. But the multiplayer would be unbalanced if one person could, by random chance, stumble across a game changer. It's the same with everything else. There are no weird discoveries to make in the galaxy or overpowered planets, like MOO2's gaians, because that would advantage one player too much. Military tech marches up rails up three branches and that's it, no clever or assymetrical weapons or decisions to make for fear of breaking things. Even the races are just a collection of relatively minor statistical differences from each other, nothiing that feels truly different or unique.There are a lot of little things wrong with Endless Space and a couple of big ones, but ultimately the game just isn't that much fun. It feels flat and lifeless. One play through is pretty much exactly like every other and by midway through your second game you'll get bored.			"

												What could have been a great game- but horribly buggy.  Supposedly the Disharmony DLC fixes SOME, but not even most, of the bugs (and introduces a smaller number of new ones)- but it's not worth blowing the extra money on an expansion when the devs couldn't even get the basic game to work correctly without constant crashes, errors, and game-breaking bugs (like the AI sometimes getting multiple moves per turn if you save in the middle of a turn when you reload the same save- a result of the game's attempt at a simultaneous turn order).NOT worth the money.  If you love space, go buy Kerbal Space Program instead (it's ALSO on a massive sale- and is extremely fun a playable despite still being in late Alpha development).  If you like 4x games, there's no classic like Civilization IV (which is arguably better than V).			"

												Eines der eindruckvollsten rundenbasierten 4X-Strategie-Spiele der letzten Jahre. Es tritt in die Fußstapfen von Spielen wie MOO oder Stars!, welche dem eingefleischten 4X Spieler bekannt sein werden. Die Bedienung ist absolut intuitiv und schon nach wenigen Minuten kommt man sehr gut mit dem Spiel zurecht. Die Übersetzung ist gut und zeigt einen Detailreichtum an Informationen. Die bekannten drei Säulen (Forschung, Planetenentwicklung, Schiffbau) bieten einfache Bedienung, locken aber auch damit sich weiter damit zu beschäftigen. Gerade der Kampf, der in Hinsicht auf Multiplayer-Runden einfach gestaltet wurde, bietet in Form von verschiedenen Schiffskonstruktionen für verschiedene Einsatzzwecke (Lang-, Mittel- oder Kurzstreckenbewaffnung) eine sehr hohe Spieltiefe an. Insgesamt auf dem Sektor Rundenstrategie ein empfehlenswertes Spiel, das durch seine konsequente Ausrichtung auf Multiplayer durchaus den Vergleich mit Titeln wie Civilization nicht zu scheuen braucht. Das indipendent Entwicklerstudio ist zudem sehr darauf bedacht die Ideen und Empfehlungen der Spieler für kostenlose Erweiterungen des Spiels aufzunehmen und auch um zu setzen. Das hat man so mit den großen Studios schon lange nicht mehr gesehen. Einfach Klasse!---One of the most impressive turn-based 4X-strategy-games of the last years. It steps in the footprints of games like MOO or stars! which become known to confirmed 4 X players. The service is absolutely intuitive and already after few minutes one manages very well with the play. The translation is good and shows a detailed wealth of information. The known three columns (research, planet development, shipbuilding) offer an easy service, however, curl also with it further with it to occupy. Just the fight which was simply formed in regard to multi player rounds offers in the form of different ship constructions for different purposes (long, medium or short distance arming) a very high play depth. All together on the sector round strategy a recommendable play which absolutely does not need to avoid the comparison with titles like Civilization by his logical adjustment on multiplayer. Besides, the indipendent developer studio is very much on it the ideas roof and to take up recommendations of the players for free enlargements of the play and also to place. One has not seen this thus with the big studios for a long time any more. Simply class!			"

												A great game that lets you itch that ""one more turn"" scratch.  Featureing 4X style gameplay, victory can be through trade, explansion and infulence, miitary conquest, or scientific progress.  Battles play out almost automatically, with you choosing the formation of your troops, attack style. At the start of the round you choose from a set of cards earned by heros, or science, that dictate how your ships attack (i.e. a defense card might give you more armor{dodge%} and a greater ability to use your anti-weapon defenses) The cards house a rock paper scissors effect by being able to trump another type of card(i.e.defense card can best offense card.) which allows it to nullify some of the opponants effects while enhancing your own.

												„Endless Space“ is a complete and very nice game. It remembers me on older games like „Master of Orion II and III“ and „Galactic Civilizations II“. It seems to me that the game designer knows much science fiction books like for exemple Frank Herbert's „Dune“ and Isaac Asimov's „Foundation“- series. The game is nearly perfect and you are missing nothing of the usual science fiction stuff, when you are playing it. You really make no mistake if you buy it. The game is not difficult to play but it could be that it is finished sometimes to fast. The research tree is consisting on four branches but you need not research all steps. If you concentrate yourself on one of the many victory ways you will surely win.The metascore of the game is 77; i would say that an 80 is justified. The game is pure fun and the known feature „terraforming“ opens you many ways to build a perfect galactic empire.Achim Hamm			"

												This game has something of a steep learning curve and few resources to help you out, but there is a tremendous payoff if you stick with it.I am a big fan of the Civilization series, and so there is something of a high bar set for all games that even touch on its features. Endless Space does a good job of keeping the core elements that make the genre fun, while bringing its own touch that kept me through the frustrations of initially learning the game.Some of these frustrations are things like difficulty making sense of the technology tree (or sorting through it in a sensible and profitable way), and not quite realizing the importance of updating ship designs and fleet construction. I suspect people will find their own points where they stumble, and while the game always will reward understanding with an entertaining game, it definately took me longer to warm to this game than I normally give.These relatively minor complaints aside, I have found this game a lot of fun to play and fresh enough to reward multiple replays and strategies. A major feature that stands out is combat system for fleets which adds this nice cinematic feel (a bit like Battlestar Galactica scenes) while adding a mechanic that is simple to use, but quite complex to master in terms of determining a best reply (moreso against human players). The game also has a gorgeous soundtrack that will accompany you as you find yourself going deeper and deeper into the night.This recommendation can only apply to fans of turn based strategy games with a 4X feel. There are simpler introductions to the genre, and it's hard to see what's inside that would appeal to people who don't like 'that type' of game. But if you do like this sort of strategy and have not yet tried Endless Space, you'd be hard pressed to find a better alternative.			"

												I've been learning this 4x game by exploration, which is oddly appropriate considering exploration is a good part of the game.  It has been living in a window on my other monitor, which is one of those pleasant advantages of a turn based game, so I haven't really played as many hours as it will say I have -- but it's been a constant companion for days.  I work on things on the ""tomato"" rule -- do something, take a break -- and this has been my ""take a break.""  The devs have managed to infused a good feeling of RPG into the factions and context of the game.  It's polished like an apple, the art style is gorgeous, the music is...well, it reminded me of Eve and I turned it off after a bit.  But the skill trees are deep and interesting, the strategy is pleasantly no-one-solution, the achievements are -- many of them -- gigglesome and some might really appeal to the obsessive.Much more elegant than Sid Meier's stuff.  It appeals to the anthropologist (xenologist?), engineer, and storyteller in me as well as the game geek/dev/closet space grognard.I find myself interested in trying to win the game as different factions having played against random different factions as AI in 2 player games.  I find myself doing dishes and modelling how larger games with more factions would work out, after a few days of playing.  What better recommendation for a game than that it amuses me away from the keyboard, as well as at the keyboard?			"

												A Sci-Fi Civilization V with an extremely pronounced difficulty curve and an overwhelming technology tree. It would be one of my favourite games, if it was just a bit better balanced. There are so many stats and sub-systems in place, that the AI easily gets out of control, and reacting to that requires hundreds of turns (hours). It's easy to find out that the more efficient, optimal, way to win a match, is to complete one of those endless tech tree branches and get a ""tech/political"" victory. When  you win this way twice, after endless, frustrated, attempts to follow other strategies, you just lose your interest for the game. Still, it was fun and joyful to play. I felt like I could rule the Galaxy; but sadly not the way I would like to. If properly balanced, it would hold a very high position in my game library.			"

												I like this game, it's pretty good. It has pretty great civ customization options, a pretty good galaxy customization scheme, and a neat approach to in-universe tech explanations. The devs are pretty good with long-term upkeep, and have released regular updates so far.However, it is a bit awfully easy to win using economic, science, and wonder victories. As in, extremely easy unless you're playing on the top-tier difficulties. The combat isn't particularly deep and doesn't really get any better, and the hero system is pretty useless sometimes.Disharmony adds a neat dimension to the game by removing a quarter of the economic system as a challenge, but you'll only end up playing as the Harmony once you're comfortable with the game. Since they're packing a lot of new features in updates for Disharmony, I'd say it's probably worth it.All in all, Endless Space + Disharmony is a good purchase at prices below $20. I got the entire package at $12 during a sale, so I'm happy.			"

												This is that rare turn-based strategy space game that gets enough right in terms of design and execution that, even though it is not perfect, you keep coming back for more.  I think that Steam achievements really encourage one to try all the different races - and that is a very good thing as you actually have to change play style to get the most out of each race.  The downside is that some of the achievements are hard to unlock due to requiring luck and/or having opaque requirments.  There are also bugs that may lurk in the endgame in some playthroughs.  However, the positives outweigh the negatives, and the devs have done a decent job of supporting the game (improvements and squashing bugs).  I expect to play this game for years, and I can't say that about many games.  Thus, I recommend Endless Space.			"

												Endless Space is a game of management, strategy & patience.If you find creating & updating templates for your ships, forming fleets, updating planetary build orders,  selecting what to research, upgrading hero abilities etc. boring and tedious... then this game is  not  for you. Otherwise, if you like strategy, you should enjoy it, and (on the higher difficulty levels) find it challenging.As far as space strategy 4X games are concerned, this is one of the better ones. It's graphics and (once you learn it) relatively simple rules, lift it in my opinion above most of it's competition. For this reason I give it my recommendation. There are some things about it that can be difficult for the newcomer: The tech-tree is a perfect example:It's four branches would seem to indicate that you can concentrate research on the branch that interests you the most. This is an illusion. If you want to build a strong empire you'll need to concentrate on  all  branches uniformly. Once your have played for a while (and are more familiar with the research techs), you will discover the ways that certain techs (in different branches) relate with each other.    Pirates are another example:Since victory in the game is all about expanding your empire (as quickly as possible), and colonising systems (before they are colonised by other factions), the appearance of pirates can inhibit this (at the most critical time). Prevention is better than cure. Random events aside, pirate fleets will only spawn in systems not under any factions influence (or surveillance). Station scout ships (if possible) in systems to prevent their spawning and / or station strong fleets at strategic systems to prevent their entry into your space.The use of heroes is another example:Heroes can have a very significant effect on your success in the game, especially in fleet combat. Although all heroes will gain experience over time, speed this up as much as you can. A good way to do this is by assigning them to fleets based at systems on the borders of your space. Use them to fight pirates, enemy faction ships etc. In this respect (if your fleet is strong enough) pirates and cold war can be a good thing.Keep a close eye on what the other factions are doing (if you can). It is easy to lose a game because another faction has reached a victory condition before your faction has.Although, far from perfect, there is much that can be enjoyed from this game.Enjoy!!Algenon   "

You choose an alien race/faction (or create your own!) and then setup your game, dictating things like number of opponents, difficulty, and even style of the galaxy (a spiral?  a ring?  a big ellipse?)Once you start play there is an awesome and super detailed tutorial that guides you through each screen and explains how the game functions.  You colonize star systems and then specific planets, and build a combination of planet specific and system specific upgrades.  You also build fleets of ships (from designs you create!) to do battle against space pirates and the other factions.  With multiple ways to win and everything being generated on the fly, this game is just pure awesome for strategy lovers.			"

												This is a well crafted game and is worth getting and playing through. The best way to describe this game is to say that its like Civilization in Space. The AI is good and on the harder difficulties will adapt to what you are doing and hand your♥♥♥♥♥to you. Basically you have to colonise planets in star systems, research new technologies and deal with opponents. combat is worked out on a dice role basis but you design your ships weapons and shields which means on the harder difficulties you have to tailor your fleets to the fleets that you are going to be fighting against.... seriously the AI in this game is like the borg..... they adapt (at least on the harder difficulties). My only gripe with this game is that on the easier difficulties the end game can get boring as you have dominated the galaxy and are just waiting to get to a victory condition.

												I was addicted to this game for a good long time.It's not exactly the most balanced or technically stable game I've played, but it's one of the most enjoyable 4X games I've ever experienced.It features a UI that's been polished to a mirror shine, distinct races with genuinely unique and interesting themes and mechanics, and very engaging gameplay on the empire management level.The combat is a little awkward and confusing, but servicable and it doesn't mess with the overall game. Ship building is solid and fun, and the AI is able to provide a genuine challenge.On top of all that the dev team is very loyal to this game, and has been constantly releasing new updates with valuable technical fixes and design iterations that keep making the game better and better.A great time if you like games like Civ. It'll be your 4X fix for a good long time.			"

												Excellent 4X game. There are 12 default races and each of the races plays in a very unique way, yet the game keeps an asymmetric balance. Players are able to create custom races. Each phase of the game is different forcing you to change the way you play. Overall, war has a strategic facet that Civilization: Beyond Earth lacks. Downsides: The pirates are annoying and overpowered (You can turn them off). It is nearly impossible to achieve a diplomatic victory, making winning through diplomacy not an option. The combat system is too simplistic. Generally, whoever has stronger ships wins. The strategy aspect is reduced to a rock-paper-scissors style of choosing one of a limited number of tactics. It would be nearly perfect if it included a full RTS aspect like in Star Wars: Empire at War.			"

												Do you like Civilization?  Do you like Space?  How bout Sci Fi?  If you answered yes then this game is for you!  A 4X game, basically its Civ in space.  You choose an alien race/faction (or create your own!) and then setup your game, dictating things like number of opponents, difficulty, and even style of the galaxy (a spiral?  a ring?  a big ellipse?)Once you start play there is an awesome and super detailed tutorial that guides you through each screen and explains how the game functions.  You colonize star systems and then specific planets, and build a combination of planet specific and system specific upgrades.  You also build fleets of ships (from designs you create!) to do battle against space pirates and the other factions.  With multiple ways to win and everything being generated on the fly, this game is just pure awesome for strategy lovers.			"

They are also flexible and in depth enough to keep the game interesting and different each time.			"

												A good 4X that holds onto you till late in the night (feat that only Civ's managed up to now for me), even if the combat mechanic will be left in auto mode after a few rounds. The different races play drastically different, which is rare, and the design is gorgeous. On the down side, achievement hunters will scream to abuse and the music (altough neutral and diverse) gets boring after a while (which is sad for a genre accustomed to lenghty playthrough).			"

												Endless Space tries to live up to the greatness of the Master of Orion 4x series while still retaining its own identity and lore.  It is a great game as seen by the many people who play it.  However, something is missing.  Perhaps some personality as you swoop in to see the individual planets.  There's no interaction with the population of a planet which I enjoyed about the original MOO series.  Building space craft is really fun though.  Good game overall.  Also, they come out with a lot of free content.  Can't complain about that in an age where paid content is planned before the completion of a game.			"

												An excellent 4X game that's remnicent of the Civilization collection. At first glance, it was intimidating with all of the information that is thrown at you. However, play about 10 turns, click a lot of buttons, read the tech tree, etc. and the game starts to make sense. The pacing of it is excellent, and each achievement made in game (from levelling a hero to capturing star systems) feels very rewarding. I'm exciting to log more hours into this game, as well as playing its upcoming successor.			"

												At first the game is really romancing. Getting started and exploring vs risk and reward is something that is motivating. After you reach a certain level of fullness in the galaxy, which comes fairly fast on the largest maps, it becomes a game vs terrible A.I.. A.I. which is bent on its own destruction by sending weak fleets against your strategic positions until it builds up a strong enough one. Trade with tech is worthless, no one ever is willing to do a fair trade even when you are considered very close in relationship, an ally, etc. The trading screen is worthless outside of pounding down another civilization enough to offer peace with reassignment of their closest star systems. Other trade happens without effort. The battle system is unique and I found merit in it, but was disappointed by the repetitive nature of it. I could also exploit engineering cards to lose nothing and keep a steady rotation of heros and fleets repaired. I liked the update system for retrofitting my fleets. The ending... Well anti-climatic. YAY I GOT A REWARD CARD!!!! Felt like Master of Orion, but something is missing. There needs to be more mystery, more random events which involve the player late game. More hero dynamics and or relationship or options or what ever. I got the game on a deep sale.. If you like the idea of risk with your friends and have the ability to play this with several it would be a great game for that. But one player it doesn't have much pull for me to play it again. However I still think its a decent game, just not great. It seems to suffer from the late game boring side like the CIV series which I ADORE does.			"

												Before I review this I believe a bit of my background as a gamer is needed. Among the first games I started playing were the Command & Conquer games (they were SO good, until Zero Hour.. Then it went downhill), so I have experience with fast paced RTS's. I also have sunk many hours into Alpha Centauri, which is more of a 4X/Civ building game. I have played games such as Rise of Nations, Empire Earth, Age of Empires, and many other Strategy games. Now I feel like I know a good Strategy game when I see one, and let me tell you this one of those good ones. Endless Space is a great game for those of you that are 4X/CIv Building fans (not so much for the faster paced RTS fans though you may still enjoy it with the game speed cranked up). If you liked Alpha Centauri, and games like it, you will likely love this game (it is not as in-depth compared to Alpha Centauri too). So far I have sunk 40+ hours into the game (playing on normal speed, so that's only been 1 completed game and 2 that I have yet to complete). I have only played as 3 races thus far. The Sowers have been my favorite of the ones I have played as, they seem the most balanced and have a great late game ship class. The other races I played as, the Siphons and Sherydn (not sure on the spelling of those two), didn't seem as well balanced but are still very playable. Graphically and soundtrack wise the game is great too. I have had a few minor bugs (ship health being displayed incorrectly and one of my fleets derping out) but they were not too bad. As I said, just minor bugs.      Overall, it seems like a well put together game. If you're a fan of Alpha Centauri or games like it, get this for sure. I got the game on a Steam Sale, but I would have payed full price for it. It is well worth 30 dollars. Sorry, about the long review. Again, my main point is if you are a strategy fan and want a good space/sci-fi game then get this!			"

												An excellent 4X game that's remnicent of the Civilization collection. At first glance, it was intimidating with all of the information that is thrown at you. However, play about 10 turns, click a lot of buttons, read the tech tree, etc. and the game starts to make sense. The pacing of it is excellent, and each achievement made in game (from levelling a hero to capturing star systems) feels very rewarding. I'm exciting to log more hours into this game, as well as playing its upcoming successor.			"

												Endless Space is endless fun! A game with both windows and osx support, Endless space is your standard galactic empire building ""turn based"" strategy game. It is pretty in presentation and relatively straightforward to get into, although it falls short in content. It offers a large variety of faction customization options and play styles although the game simply boils down to galactic conquest. The story and single player experience is virtually non-existent, and as such it is a game probably better played online. It is a moderately active community at the time of writing this, however it should be noted that games take several hours to complete and often players leaving or the game crashing can be a frustrating experience. Returning to the gameplay it is about planetary colonization, expansion, resource management and of course combat. The former is all quite self explanatory and is a little difficult to optimize without spending a couple hours of trial and error, the latter being the combat takes place in ship engagements in which your ships fight and you give orders in a series of phases, ultimately it is the orders that matter and the combat is essentially just a cutscene displaying the results of your combat selections. Overall a decent game, it is definitely a very niche game so unless you are familiar to this style of galactic conquest games it or are interested in seeing what they are all about, it is not for you. If that is your thing however Endless Space is a decent entry in the genre.			"

												Amplitude's debut title in their Endless series was a mindblowingly excellent start. I acquired the game after the Disharmony update, and I initally had trouble getting into the game. However, after a few hours of getting accustomed to the control scheme and pace of the game, I had no issues with dropping time into games with a friend.			"

												Although I can understand why many people may have a different opinion to me, I believe this is easily one of my favourite games ever. The universe you are thrown into seems rich and developed yet not linear as every game of Endless Space seems to throw something new at you. The artwork and sound design is some of the best I have ever seen in a game and I personally find the UI beautiful and easy to navigate throughout however some may disagree with me here. The complexity of the game mechanics seems to find the perfect divide between being to simple and overly complicated allowing for an experience which is enjoyable to both new and veteran players. The only two downsides I see to this game are the combat system and part of the AI behaviour. Although the combat system has a few cool features such as the ability to select fleet formations, admirals, ship targeting behaviour and others, these features are built around a card based battle system which feels a bit like an underwhelming complecated version of scissors paper rock. The AI although I personally found to be one of the better AIs of 4X strategy games, seems to play an extremely aggressive expansion strategy in the early game every single time. Although this makes the early game fairly predictable, it also keeps the player on edge and competitive with the AI. Overall, I would highly reccomend this game if you enjoy 4X startegy games similar to Sid Meier's Civilization V and I really hope Endless Space 2 lives up to the great name this iteration of the Endless Space series has created. ( Really sorry for the lack of paragraphing and I hope this helps )			"

												Not sure how I completely feel about it. I definitely had fun, so I guess it's alright. Pretty standard 4E game. I enjoy the lore and artistic look. Space combat and customizing ships can be tiresome and often degraded into ""fling space crap at other space crap"", but that is sometimes and issue with 4E games in general. If you were ever a fan of Master of Orion or other ""Endless"" titles, I'd say it's a pretty good time.			"

												So far, I am enjoying this game. I really like builder games and especially outerspace ones. There is a little bit of poish missing, such as clearing the options in diplomatic negotiations, or having a button to push to see what the other faction might find acceptable. Also, when they offer a deal, there is no way to negotiate it; you either accept it or reject it. Civilization IV is probably best at diplomacy.There is good skill tree to learn, and good options for building and customizing your ships and fleets.I would like more info available, such as defensive details per planet/system, that sometimes is missing, but I don't find that a major setback.Overall (especially on sale!) it's a good game to play!

It follows fairly simple mechanics of expansion, warfare, research, trade and diplomacy, and it's definitely the kind of game I'd recommend to anyone who likes space & 4X games :DThe races also offer a nice variety of different approaches to the game, and I've found seeking out any of the available victory conditions a very fun experience.The soundtrack is also amazing - I use it as my work soundtrack and have probably listened to it alone more than I've played the actual game :PIt looks nice, it plays nice, it sounds nice, overall an enjoyable experience.

												Endless Space is easily the best space 4x I've ever played.  The diversity between factions is broad enough to allow for interesting replays without being so different as to be unbalanced.  Planet management is on the complex-but-reasonable side.  Ship design and development is fantastic and detailed, yet not micromanagerial.The integration of the components of the rest of The Endless series gives this a compelling universe as a backdrop, and you can easily imagine how an escape pod from one of your fleet became the explorers in Dungeon of the Endless or how one of the uncolonized planets you uncover could be the one you're developing in Endless Legend.Highly recommended as long as you don't mind spending hours playing ""one more turn.""

												This is one of the few 4x games I own. When I bought it, I was primarily looking for an entertaining space-themed game with cool battles, which is exactly what I got. It is worth mentioning, that I don't play this game on the higher difficulties which means that this review might not reflect the experience of those who do play on higher difficulties. I do believe that the game can become a bit boring in the mid- to lategame unless the focus lies on military expansion. The boredom will, however, be mitigated by learning technologies that allows for further colonization of different planet types. Furthermore, wars can, in my experience, become tedious since they easily become very focused on production and the mangement of damaged ships. On a final note, I want to mention a couple of positives. Besides from the beautiful combat cinematics, there are two things that I particularly enjoy about the game. Firstly, it is the advisors. These people, of all species, will aid the empire they are working for with their special skills and they can be specialized according to the players prefference. Secondly, I found the different species and the customization to be a fun factor. Mostly because it feels like the species are played differently from each other, and that they often have noticeable boons, and in some cases even drawbacks. I like the ability to create a new species, but the customization options are somewhat limited and it often feels like it is restricted to what already exists.In the end, I'd probably recommend this game, especially if it is on sale.

												I got this game for £1.00... THAT IS CRAZY. This game is incredibly detailed and has an immense amount of content and replayability. If you are familiar with the Civilization style of gameplay you will without a doubt enjoy this game. After playing my first 2 games I already feel like i have to grips with the basics of the game and am excited to learn to play better. I believe that this game has gameplay down greatly and is very enjoyable. It also has a very beautiful simulation of battles that i believe is very interesting to watch if you like that kind of stuff (I most certainly do!). This is overall such a solid game and although the graphics may at first glance not seem too pleasing they actually really start to grow on you and it is very good game for those interested in a single player space strategy game. If you are interested in in depth on how the game is multiplayer-wise then look at another review because I cannot give a accurate representation of this aspect of the game since it is not really my cup of tea. Brilliant game, well worth a look at.			"

												This game... lets just say before the review starts, I recommend this game. It is worth the money.Okay, the first time I played I played this game, was around the first time I started using steam. It was one of those free for the weekend deals. I tried it out. Its more than just the gameplay. Basically, one of the themes of this game (I personally feel) would have to be space. The music adds to that theme, the descriptive writing adds to it, the whole game gives off this awe inspiring mood to it. Not just it being epic, or cool, or relaxing. Whenever I play this, no matter how many times, I always feel like there is so much more to try to get at. You are put on a random system in a randomly generated map type of your choosing. The other factions are also placed randomly. I can honestly say I have never gone through a game the same way twice. The ships are fully customizable except for their appearance.When you play this game, it should come across your mind on how big the map is. You're not just in a solar system, you're in a galaxy. Your fleets are traveling to other systems, almost impossibly far away to imagine. The developers somewhat increased the size of the systems just so we can see these points. In reality, we wouldn't see anything from how far away the view is.This game is awe-inspiring, fun, and overall a great game.			"

When you colonize a star system, you choose one planet to colonize and when the population gets big enough you get the option to colonize a new planet.

												Pro:+ stable, simply works. It's actually sad that you have to point out something this basic+ a rather intuitive interface+ multiple ways to win the game, customizeable+ a simple, yet powerful race editor which is perk based + every race has small unique ""milestones"", for example the shipclass specs differ for each race+ community enchanced, people who like the genre have and still can give feedback which is used by the developers to increase the game experience+ good range of diplomacy options+ AI is well developed. Most races might invade if you present them with a too sweet target (no defences) and ignore the diplomacy, every (AI) race has different aproaches to win the game which is not just some random declaration of war.Con- a selected few descriptions still need to be improved to make more sense. For beginners it might not be clear for example that a kinetic weapon is most effective on close range if the description doesn't change between long, medium and close range. Veterans will take a look one on the values provided and will know what to use ( and might not even notice the desription at all). Beginners might also stumble upon the meaning of influence and some other minor things, but nothing mayor, Personal impressions The combat system needs to get used to. Think of it as a 3 phase combat (long, medium, close range) where you can give one general command per phase. Pre battle you can decide formation (which ships will be at the frontline?) and if you prefer to attack all ships, or focus fire on the first three or even on one ship a time. I really would like to see a little more options here, and further more race unique gizmos. At the moment every race can research every tech, save for the very few race specific techs. With a bigger tech tree, maybe even increasing the 4 general directions with a unique per chance tech tree, that would be real nice. Since MoO 2 this is the only game in the 4X turn based genre which is motivating me to continue for months and months to come.			"

												I really want to recommend this because I love like 90% of it; but it's absolutely ruined by the combat system. The combat system is awkward at best, and obtuse at worse. There is also something off with the AI (I'm playing the latest version as of 1/2/2016). The AI is extremely aggressive, even at lower difficultly levels. It is just too aggressive and the worst part about this is I can't learn the obtuse combat system because of it.Endless Legend is much better; just get that and play it. I respect this effort and look forward to Endless Space 2 but this either needs patches or it’s just not worth buying. Should I notice a patch or update, I’ll try the game again and update this review as appropriate. But for now, no, I can’t recommend it and should you be inclined to buy it, get it on sale at least. I think you’ll get a few hours out of it but conclude something similar on the combat & AI.

The combat can get a little repetitive but the AI is competitive and seems to learn from you and gets much tougher in a protracted war. It's a great game and will suck hours away from you.			"

												I really want to recommend this because I love like 90% of it; but it's absolutely ruined by the combat system. The combat system is awkward at best, and obtuse at worse. There is also something off with the AI (I'm playing the latest version as of 1/2/2016). The AI is extremely aggressive, even at lower difficultly levels. It is just too aggressive and the worst part about this is I can't learn the obtuse combat system because of it.Endless Legend is much better; just get that and play it. I respect this effort and look forward to Endless Space 2 but this either needs patches or it’s just not worth buying. Should I notice a patch or update, I’ll try the game again and update this review as appropriate. But for now, no, I can’t recommend it and should you be inclined to buy it, get it on sale at least. I think you’ll get a few hours out of it but conclude something similar on the combat & AI. Again, love 90% of the game but those two things just make this not worth the time to play.==============Update: After some effort to learn the combat system (and I still felt it could be better), I've actually played through the game twice.

												As someone who remembers playing the original Master of Orion back in the early 90s, this game has come the closest to capturing the enjoyment of the original MoO and MoO2 experience of my youth.It is not a perfect game, some people may not enjoy the more ""cinematic"" battles as opposed to controlling the fleets themselves.  Afterall, that's what made Homeworld such a fantastic game, was the minute RTS control of the entire fleet including the economy.However, I found that the pace of this game, and greater focus on Empire building and Macro development to more than make up for the battle instances.  And while it took me awhile to appreciate how the ""cinematic turn based"" fighting occurred, I became a big fan of sort of ""issuing a strategy"" and then watching as missiles, lasers, fighters and bombers did their work on the opposing fleet.While not quite as deep in ship design, as say, Galactic Civilizations, the interface is at least intuitive without needing to try to figure out ""where to stuff something.""  This ship design has X amount of things it can fit - and you fit what you want.Most importantly - the ability to retrofit your units to more modern designs as technology becomes available is simple, and keeps the game moving smoothly, since you usually have a bunch of other things to take care of each turn.In short, this is perhaps my favorite space-based 4x game I've played in the last decade.  And I really enjoyed the usual (Sword of the Stars and the like) ones, but for me this game has stood out.  It is not as complex as many of the games in the genre, but in my opinion really captured the spirit that I have not happened since I was a 10 year old sneaking onto the computer late at night to play Master of Orion until it was time for school in the morning.

But thanks to the $1.50 pricetag and my friend also already having bought it, I had a go.I found the game to be extremely fun and play it for 3 hours+ every night with my friend from now on. It allows you to win through multiple ways; Diplomacy, Economic, Supremacy and more. It additionally has an AMAZING soundtrack that I find quite relaxing.My advice to new players, is learn and play the game with a friend, who has already played the game for a couple hours, as the tutorial is pretty bad. If you have no friends that have the game, then simply watch a youtube video.Essentially, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games in general.			"

												A fun and addicting 4x space game with a relatively steep learning curve. Once you do get the hang of it, its a surprisingly chill game to play, mostly because of the great OST and ambiance. It has everything you would expect in a 4x game, except a stealth/spy system unfortunately. Combat looks spectacular, very pretty. It is semi automated, although you can still make decisions between ""rounds"" that affect your fleet's(maximize shields, focus fire a ship, counter a weapon type etc.) performance. Lots of options for what to do with systems and planets you own, from terraforming to population control. AI/relations with other factions is pretty straightforward, perhaps a little more competent than Civ5, as least in regards to how alliances work. Ive never had an ally backstab me or drop relations for no reason, which is nice. The UI is simple and polished imo, if you've played any other AMPLITUDE Studio's game, then you'll recognize most controls since its very similar to their other games. Overall a solid 8/10 game that you can easily dump many hours into.			"

												a very interesting and fun 4X a,e. each faction has unique characteristics, enough to really develope different playstyles. the customization of player made races hearkens back to MoO 2, and is greatly enjoyable. the only thing that i would say detracts from the game is the same thing that detracts from all games of the fenre. eventually you get to the point of mastering how to outplay the AI consistently, and each game tends to end up either being a wait-fest if you're going for a non-military victory, or a stomp fest where your superior fleets slowly roll over your opponents.overall i'd reccomend the game to any 4X lover, because it is a leader of its kind. and while the battles can be simple, they can be beautiful to watch, especially from the perspectives of fighters, without slowing down even moderately powerful computers.

This one reminds me of some real old school ones where I enjoyed a nice research tree and was able to pick or 'create'  a race that fits my style the best. They managed to strike the right balance between micro má agent, customization and automation. I still have some races I would like to try out and achievements to reach and I plan to do so at least until Endless Space 2 comes out.			"

Posted: December 21, 2015
												I was incredibly surprised by this game. I had received it as a gift awhile back and from looking at gameplay videos on YouTube, I decided at the time it wasn't for me. I was dead wrong. This is my first 4X game (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) and have passed on other popular games like the Civilization series thinking that they would not be to my liking. Where should I start?Graphically speaking, the game looks and performs very well. Are they top of the line, burn your motherboard-type graphics? No, but for what this game offers, I have been very pleased. As you can see from the pictures provided on this page, you'll spend most of your time looking at either the beautiful galaxy map or the various tabs located at the top left of your galaxy screen. Aside from staring at the galaxy map when zoomed out (which I particularly enjoy), the most eye candy you'll see in-game is of course the ""manual"" fleet battles that I'm sure you'll encounter during play. I have my graphics set to the maximum settings and the frame rate runs easily above 100 per second. ""Manual"" fleet battles give you a visual representation of the battles as well as an opportunity to change your strategy as it progresses.The tabs at the top of your screen consist of various actions you may queue up and/or perform on any turn. They range from your overall progression score compared to the other factions in the game to a comprehensive system list to manage your assets, research tree, fleet shipyard, diplomacy and finally your hero cards. These different tabs also range from useful to rather unnecessary. Later in the game (usually after 70 turns) I found myself using this tab the most so I could manage all of my systems happiness, tax rate, system improvements and resources and trade routes. The research tree is absolutely necessary to do anything in the game, but what I found out to be more important was to skip reading guides online and simply just sit down for an hour and read through all of the different tiles. The fleet shipyard isn't required much as you simply just research new ship types in one of the four available tech trees in the research tab along with your various weapons, defenses and support modules in other trees and just make your own designs to build. The hero tab is rather ho-hum as quite simply you look to hire hero cards to place on a system or in a fleet. Managing your ability points as your level them up can be done elsewhere.Diplomacy on the other hand is somewhat frustrating. Split between a sort of good and evil with some rather in between, 10 factions in the base game offer a wide variety of gameplay. There are tiles that you upgrade diplomacy through your research tab to give you various bonuses, however what it won't take into account is that each faction responds differently to diplomacy. Some won't engage in it and are completely hostile, others are hermits and avoid you almost altogether and others hate your guts if you're beating them economically like I have and take forever to form alliances and cooperative trade agreements. I don't quite like how it was designed and wished there was a little bit better way to draw up diplomatic relations more quickly and efficiently. If you're all for blowing them up and conquering systems, then diplomacy won't even be an afterthought for you. Personally, diplomacy has been much to what I described. They tend to either be violent due to the inherited nature or they hold a grudge against you for being better than you for a good two-thirds of the game and then suddenly they become bootlickers and ask for the most ridiculous trades imaginable. Example: I was playing as a peaceful Amoeba faction, exploring and expanding to three arms of an eight arm spiral galaxy with 5 other factions. One hated everyone and was suspicious of anyone (Cravers), one was constantly making threats and talking about glory and me being beneath them even though I was the master race for the whole game in terms of knowledge, diplomatic, expansive and economic power (Hissho); and the others kept to themselves and refused to talk to me until they decided I wasn't going anywhere (Pilgrams, Amoeba and another Hissho). The first Hissho decided an alliance would be good, but thought I was worthless and demanded I pay them a bunch of fuel resources to make the deal. After that I invited the pilgrams since they were 2nd to my capabilities and the Hissho eagerly agreed. Next the Amoeba decided that I'm peaceful enough that they may want to trade with me. At this point, for the rest of the game they kept asking for trade deals that are the worst imaginable. ""How about I give you 2 marbles and I'll throw in a jacket with a torn sleeve for 5 units of rocket fuel? Promise not to shoot at you? Our people believe this to be for the glory of the Empire!"" Blah Blah Blah.You get the idea.. These ""allies"" of mine are chumps and couldn't be trusted to fix a crack in the pavement let alone build an empire. Good luck getting good trades in of your own unless they love you to death for not shooting at them all game long. Lastly in regards to diplomacy, take care when you're in an alliance. If you declare war, your allies might not like this and then declare war on you, or in my case, I was in an alliance where one declared war on someone, bringing us into the fight when we didnt want it and I decided to stay whereas my other ally turned on me for staying. Let's just say that didn't end well and I learned my lesson. If you wish to side with other like-minded allies, just be careful when war breaks out.One other thing to keep in mind with the game is to read through each of the factions before you play. Very important as the traits allocated to each one is specific and will help cater to your particular playstyle. In other words, if you have a certain playstyle in mind, you might later on discover that other factions are better at accomplishing those goals. Once you get the handle on the game, take a look at designing your own faction. I haven't come close to mastering the game yet for me to go there, but I'm looking forward to it.Over all, as the 4X title suggests, you get to do a bit of everything and even if it doesn't seem like it will be fun, it is worth another look at the very least. I came from enjoying real-time strategy games like StarCraft, WarCraft, Red Alert and Company of Heroes to loving this game to death. I've only put 24 hours into this game and I've barely scratched the surface and will most definitely put many more hours into it. Even though the diplomacy aspect of the game is somewhat limiting, there is something there for someone who wants to build rather than destroy as well as the capability to just wreck havoc in a pretty decent space game. The faction biographies are fun to read as well as the little bits of information you glean from discoveries around the galaxy as you explore, expand, exploit and exterminate. Take the leap!			"

												Endless Space: There is ONLY WAR-- except when there isn’t - Hyper Abridged edition(I've played like nine hours of Endless Space despite Steam insisting I've only played five.)Like its terrestrial based cousin, Endless Space is a 4X game by Amplitude; with tons of character, great artwork, and a badass level of scale that really pulls everything together in a nice package.Also like almost every other 4X game I’ve played it’s obtuse and it makes me cry. Jokes aside, I do really like the 4X genre... But for some reason I seem to have poor luck with them. Even when I seemingly do everything right, something goes wrong. But, such is life- right? As a wise Space Captain once said,“It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.” I feel like that sums up my time so far with Endless Space. Except the mistakes part, I’m sure I made a lot of those. And while losing isn’t a bad thing, it’s certainly a bitter pill to swallow. Especially when you’re boxed into the eastern arm of a spiral galaxy and one hundred fifty galactic years of bitter and vicious war only let you expand your borders by one system, because the giant Space Amoebas swoop in and steal your hard fought systems out from under you with their super stupid advanced technology…...This review is WAY too long to post on steam, it literally won't let me! so if you like what you've read so far head on over to 100hoursave.com to read the rest! http://wp.me/p4gn9l-il more specifically.But I think it should go without saying, this game is dope as hell and you should buy it.

The biggest thing standing out from any AMPLITUDE games are their intuitive UI, which is very police and it just feels very fluent.The graphics and art is very nice and pleasent, but not that varied, but that is to be expected from a space game.

												A great game after the like of Galactic Civilizations, but with a bit narrower focus. It's a turn-based game of exploration, colonization, and occasionally combat that is not unlike Civilization in space. As you scout from your starting system you find additional solar systems connected by jump lanes, and you settle the planets in these systems and build upgrades on them to increase your resources and influence. Like GalCiv, the combat is a largely un-interactive rock-paper-scissors affair that has been expanded since the original release to allow a bit more flexibility. You customize your ships with a few categories of weapons, defenses, and other bonuses; ideally you create fleets that counter the technologies being fielded by your enemies. The progression is much like other turn-based strategy games, and victory can be achieved by expansion, conquest, or research. The pace of this game is generally slow, and it is well matched with an amazing soundtrack with ambient instrumental songs.			"

												Overall: 9/10.One of the best 4X space games in my opinion. The visual and audio presentation is excellent, the UI looks good and works well. The strategic level gameplay is pretty generic, but it is competently done. The combat system is unique and innovative and I love watching fleets shoot each other up.			"

												a very interesting and fun 4X a,e. each faction has unique characteristics, enough to really develope different playstyles. the customization of player made races hearkens back to MoO 2, and is greatly enjoyable. the only thing that i would say detracts from the game is the same thing that detracts from all games of the fenre. eventually you get to the point of mastering how to outplay the AI consistently, and each game tends to end up either being a wait-fest if you're going for a non-military victory, or a stomp fest where your superior fleets slowly roll over your opponents.overall i'd reccomend the game to any 4X lover, because it is a leader of its kind. and while the battles can be simple, they can be beautiful to watch, especially from the perspectives of fighters, without slowing down even moderately powerful computers.

												I am a big fan of strategy games and I particularly enjoy the space 4X if done well. This one reminds me of some real old school ones where I enjoyed a nice research tree and was able to pick or 'create'  a race that fits my style the best. They managed to strike the right balance between micro má agent, customization and automation. I still have some races I would like to try out and achievements to reach and I plan to do so at least until Endless Space 2 comes out.			"

Posted: December 21, 2015
												I was incredibly surprised by this game. I had received it as a gift awhile back and from looking at gameplay videos on YouTube, I decided at the time it wasn't for me. I was dead wrong. This is my first 4X game (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) and have passed on other popular games like the Civilization series thinking that they would not be to my liking. Where should I start?Graphically speaking, the game looks and performs very well. Are they top of the line, burn your motherboard-type graphics? No, but for what this game offers, I have been very pleased. As you can see from the pictures provided on this page, you'll spend most of your time looking at either the beautiful galaxy map or the various tabs located at the top left of your galaxy screen. Aside from staring at the galaxy map when zoomed out (which I particularly enjoy), the most eye candy you'll see in-game is of course the ""manual"" fleet battles that I'm sure you'll encounter during play. I have my graphics set to the maximum settings and the frame rate runs easily above 100 per second. ""Manual"" fleet battles give you a visual representation of the battles as well as an opportunity to change your strategy as it progresses.The tabs at the top of your screen consist of various actions you may queue up and/or perform on any turn. They range from your overall progression score compared to the other factions in the game to a comprehensive system list to manage your assets, research tree, fleet shipyard, diplomacy and finally your hero cards. These different tabs also range from useful to rather unnecessary. Later in the game (usually after 70 turns) I found myself using this tab the most so I could manage all of my systems happiness, tax rate, system improvements and resources and trade routes. The research tree is absolutely necessary to do anything in the game, but what I found out to be more important was to skip reading guides online and simply just sit down for an hour and read through all of the different tiles. The fleet shipyard isn't required much as you simply just research new ship types in one of the four available tech trees in the research tab along with your various weapons, defenses and support modules in other trees and just make your own designs to build. The hero tab is rather ho-hum as quite simply you look to hire hero cards to place on a system or in a fleet. Managing your ability points as your level them up can be done elsewhere.Diplomacy on the other hand is somewhat frustrating. Split between a sort of good and evil with some rather in between, 10 factions in the base game offer a wide variety of gameplay. There are tiles that you upgrade diplomacy through your research tab to give you various bonuses, however what it won't take into account is that each faction responds differently to diplomacy. Some won't engage in it and are completely hostile, others are hermits and avoid you almost altogether and others hate your guts if you're beating them economically like I have and take forever to form alliances and cooperative trade agreements. I don't quite like how it was designed and wished there was a little bit better way to draw up diplomatic relations more quickly and efficiently. If you're all for blowing them up and conquering systems, then diplomacy won't even be an afterthought for you. Personally, diplomacy has been much to what I described. They tend to either be violent due to the inherited nature or they hold a grudge against you for being better than you for a good two-thirds of the game and then suddenly they become bootlickers and ask for the most ridiculous trades imaginable. Example: I was playing as a peaceful Amoeba faction, exploring and expanding to three arms of an eight arm spiral galaxy with 5 other factions. One hated everyone and was suspicious of anyone (Cravers), one was constantly making threats and talking about glory and me being beneath them even though I was the master race for the whole game in terms of knowledge, diplomatic, expansive and economic power (Hissho); and the others kept to themselves and refused to talk to me until they decided I wasn't going anywhere (Pilgrams, Amoeba and another Hissho). The first Hissho decided an alliance would be good, but thought I was worthless and demanded I pay them a bunch of fuel resources to make the deal. After that I invited the pilgrams since they were 2nd to my capabilities and the Hissho eagerly agreed. Next the Amoeba decided that I'm peaceful enough that they may want to trade with me. At this point, for the rest of the game they kept asking for trade deals that are the worst imaginable. ""How about I give you 2 marbles and I'll throw in a jacket with a torn sleeve for 5 units of rocket fuel? Promise not to shoot at you? Our people believe this to be for the glory of the Empire!"" Blah Blah Blah.You get the idea.. These ""allies"" of mine are chumps and couldn't be trusted to fix a crack in the pavement let alone build an empire. Good luck getting good trades in of your own unless they love you to death for not shooting at them all game long. Lastly in regards to diplomacy, take care when you're in an alliance. If you declare war, your allies might not like this and then declare war on you, or in my case, I was in an alliance where one declared war on someone, bringing us into the fight when we didnt want it and I decided to stay whereas my other ally turned on me for staying. Let's just say that didn't end well and I learned my lesson. If you wish to side with other like-minded allies, just be careful when war breaks out.One other thing to keep in mind with the game is to read through each of the factions before you play. Very important as the traits allocated to each one is specific and will help cater to your particular playstyle. In other words, if you have a certain playstyle in mind, you might later on discover that other factions are better at accomplishing those goals. Once you get the handle on the game, take a look at designing your own faction. I haven't come close to mastering the game yet for me to go there, but I'm looking forward to it.Over all, as the 4X title suggests, you get to do a bit of everything and even if it doesn't seem like it will be fun, it is worth another look at the very least. I came from enjoying real-time strategy games like StarCraft, WarCraft, Red Alert and Company of Heroes to loving this game to death. I've only put 24 hours into this game and I've barely scratched the surface and will most definitely put many more hours into it. Even though the diplomacy aspect of the game is somewhat limiting, there is something there for someone who wants to build rather than destroy as well as the capability to just wreck havoc in a pretty decent space game. The faction biographies are fun to read as well as the little bits of information you glean from discoveries around the galaxy as you explore, expand, exploit and exterminate. Take the leap!			"

												Endless Space: There is ONLY WAR-- except when there isn’t - Hyper Abridged edition(I've played like nine hours of Endless Space despite Steam insisting I've only played five.)Like its terrestrial based cousin, Endless Space is a 4X game by Amplitude; with tons of character, great artwork, and a badass level of scale that really pulls everything together in a nice package.Also like almost every other 4X game I’ve played it’s obtuse and it makes me cry. Jokes aside, I do really like the 4X genre... But for some reason I seem to have poor luck with them. Even when I seemingly do everything right, something goes wrong. But, such is life- right? As a wise Space Captain once said,“It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.” I feel like that sums up my time so far with Endless Space. Except the mistakes part, I’m sure I made a lot of those. And while losing isn’t a bad thing, it’s certainly a bitter pill to swallow. Especially when you’re boxed into the eastern arm of a spiral galaxy and one hundred fifty galactic years of bitter and vicious war only let you expand your borders by one system, because the giant Space Amoebas swoop in and steal your hard fought systems out from under you with their super stupid advanced technology…...This review is WAY too long to post on steam, it literally won't let me! so if you like what you've read so far head on over to 100hoursave.com to read the rest! http://wp.me/p4gn9l-il more specifically.But I think it should go without saying, this game is dope as hell and you should buy it.

Its not without flaws, the AI could have been better for people who focus solely on playing verus AIs. This is true for every game though. The biggest thing standing out from any AMPLITUDE games are their intuitive UI, which is very police and it just feels very fluent.The graphics and art is very nice and pleasent, but not that varied, but that is to be expected from a space game.

												A great game after the like of Galactic Civilizations, but with a bit narrower focus. It's a turn-based game of exploration, colonization, and occasionally combat that is not unlike Civilization in space. As you scout from your starting system you find additional solar systems connected by jump lanes, and you settle the planets in these systems and build upgrades on them to increase your resources and influence. Like GalCiv, the combat is a largely un-interactive rock-paper-scissors affair that has been expanded since the original release to allow a bit more flexibility. You customize your ships with a few categories of weapons, defenses, and other bonuses; ideally you create fleets that counter the technologies being fielded by your enemies. The progression is much like other turn-based strategy games, and victory can be achieved by expansion, conquest, or research. The pace of this game is generally slow, and it is well matched with an amazing soundtrack with ambient instrumental songs.			"

Managing planets and systems likewise can become redundant. Fortunately, there is an Endless Space 2.			"

												Endless Space is a turn-based 4x game. You are the emperor of a galactic empire. You start off small and slowly through warfare, trade, diplomacy and exploitation you grow into a huge empire spanning hundreds of stars. There are a variety of empires to choose from ranging from a hive of robotic insects who wish to devour the universe to your standard galactic human empire and a gelatinous mass of cells who are peaceful and only wish to socialize. Another excellent point are the resources. There are your basic 4 resources Food, industry, science and dust (FIDS). But there is a wealth of others to choose from. There are 2 main types of these: Strategic resources which can be used in shipbuilding and luxury resources, which confer permanent or temporary bonuses on your empire. The tech tree is a mixed bag. It's HUGE. Now this may be a good or a bad thing. There is loads to research, almost too much. With many of the coolest ones at the very end. Even very important ones are locked away. Want an alliance? Well, you have to research about 3 techs to lead up to that. Found a new resource? You're going to have to research it. Want bigger and better ships? You need to research that too! This brings us up to the next point, ships. Ships are fully customisable. With about 6 ship classes and a wealth of add-ons and modules the possibilities are endless. Unfortunately, using the ships is a different kettle of fish. When engaging in a conflict you must pick 3 ""action cards, "" these come in a variety of formats, but basically work like rock, paper, scissors. But when the engagement begins you get to watch it play out like a battle from Star Wars. Its cool for a while, but it soon gets old.

												Endless mix of Sins of solar empire and Civilization game. And A FINE mix.+ : graphics, gameplay, custom civilization, one of the BEST ARTWORKS I have ever seen (and I love them), amazing ideas (ship design, wonders), terraforming, replayability (if that's a word), multiplayer, mods- : AI (but I didnt mind), no campaign (Thank you MTB-Fritz ^^), I kept forgeting where my ships are, what to do next, what did I do.. In overall, great game. Approved. 8/10 would space again			"

												I am so bad at this game, I only play it on the easiest difficulty in order to win and try out a bit of everything... BUT IT'S SO FUN. I may not be good at strategy games but this game still keeps me coming back to make a new empire, and thanks to the many difficulty and possible victory conditions i can try out everything without worrying to much about my horrible strategy skills. I love making new ships designed as anti-whatever the AI is currently using and pumping them out from an industrial solar system to suddenly push back an AI and make them start building their own new ships before i force them to peace out of a war. It's fun, deep, and continues to bring me back.			"

												I'd never heard of this game before trying it out, but it turns out to be an excellent 4X TBS title.This pretty much runs down the checklist of what I want in a game.  Variable alien races? check.  Expansive tech tree? check.  Randomized galaxy to explore, with good variety in system & planet types? check.  Combat is simple, but lets you have enough control?  check.My only complaints are that some of the techs and upgrades seem way more useful than others, and one of the victory types feels a bit too easy to achieve compared to the others.  Also, the combat system can be a bit swingy, and the outcome of an engagement depends on factors that may not be obvious.  Lastly, combat and the other systems aren't explained all that well in-game, so you have to peruse the wiki to get a good idea of what's going on.Still, I've sunk many hours into it, and have no problem suggesting it to others.

												If you have nostalgia about games like Masters of Orion II, this is the turn based space conquest game for you. Way better than Civilizations IMO. Oh and the multiplayer has an option to limit the time a player spends on his turn so this solves the issue of having to wait for slow players that often plagues the types of games.			"

Unfortunately due to the combat system every space battle is a glorified rock-paper-scissors for weapons and shields, giving you a 2/3 chance to do damage and a 2/3 chance to get vaporized, unless you decide to make a balanced ship which will give you a 3/3 chance to do little damage and die.

												""Looks shiny, but the AI is terrible and there's a severe lack of balance everywhere from combat to the tech tree to the stock races themselves (nevermind custom races). You'll have fun for a few hours, but quickly enough you'll figure out how the game works and realize there's a single best method for winning (not even a handful, a single one) barring random events (which are also unbalanced) and the AI is not a challenge at all, which makes things really bad because multiplayer is half-broken (used to be fully broken).""This and more. Wish I wouldn't have bought it. Combat boils down to a rock/paper/scissors thta can screw you over on one random wrong choice even if your force is vastly superior. The AI cheats, hard, even on normal, and unless you play extremely optimally you will lose. Diplomacy is not an option, the AI turns on you for no apparent reason even if you're in full peace treaty. New ship classes are nested in an exploration tree, fleet sizes are divided between war and diplomacy. Early expansion is the only way to win, and the dev sknow this and slot in extreme happiness penalties to doing this to penalize it, however, unless you do it, you cannot spam enough ships to win vs the ai.If you can maange to play against nothing but other humans, you might have a passable amount of fun.

												Among the best in its genre, Endless Space does a beautiful job delivering a fun strategic turn based game.  Most comparable to civilization 5, or other turn based games, Endless Space has you slowly take turns improving your solar systems and taking over the galaxy.  You are given races, which enable the gameplay to change, not to mention the endless customization for creating your own race, and controlling the size of your galaxy.  On top of the 100+ hours you will satisfyingly get, there are also numerous achievements to work for if you want to get all the achievements.  One of the best games I have ever played, Endless Space is a must have for your game library.  This is one game where the developers listened, and they delivered.			"

Every Civilization in the game plays diffrently and has thier own bit of lore giving which for me is wonderful. The AI in game if you ask me would beat quite a few strategy game's AI in difficalty making it a challange to win without trying.If you like strategy games give this a try you might just git lost in it.

												I haven't played since the Disharmony expansion came out, but this is a very nice 4X[en.wikipedia.org] game.  I rate it as the best space-themed 4X[en.wikipedia.org] game (of course, it's also among the newest) and second only to Sid Meier's Civilization games for best 4X[en.wikipedia.org] overall.  It would be tempting to call this Civ2 in Space, but that's not quite accurate.  Certainly, if you've played Civilization or any other 4X[en.wikipedia.org] game you'll recognize that the basic ideas and goals are the same - learning the /massive/ tech tree, manipulating heroes, and mastering the nuances of unit behavior will still take some time, however.  The interface is, unfortunately, clunky and hard to read in the same way that the old Civ games were.  The presentation problems are primarily related to the tiny fonts that don't seem to scale with screen resolution and the amazing complexity of the game.  Here, each hero has multiple disciplines with unique talent trees for each.  Deep options for ship customization almost make for a game within itself, as much time can be spent min/max optimizing weight budget by rotating out varying armaments, engines, colonization pods, hulls, and more.  Planetary systems are similarly complex, and require a fair amount of micromanagement for min/max players - it's a lot like the way it was necessary to position each villager for each town in old Civilization games at harder difficulties.  Unfortunately, it's also rather tedious.  If you're a fan of Civilization and the idea of Civ in space sounds enticing, then this is the game you should be looking at.  It's not perfect and the learning curve is substantial, but there's a lot of promise here.  I'm not sure if there is a follow-up in the works or not, but this is an amazing first effort and I can absolutely see the potential for successive versions to challenge Sid Meier's lordship over the 4X[en.wikipedia.org] genre.

It can be quite difficult to get a first hang of it but when you know what you're doing it is certainly a must have for RTS fans. The battle system is interesting and some might say a bit lacking on the interaction but seeing your ships blow up enemies is quite fulfilling on its own.The game also features an interesting resource system and there are quite a lot of them and the designers made sure you really want to colonize new planets and conquer them to receive more of the same or new resources.The game is a lot of fun by yourself but I personally would recommend playing it with some friends.

												Review of Endless SpacePros:-Relatively easy to learn compared to other 4X space games (i.e. stream-lined mechanics); tutorial itself is weak though so learning with friends help a lot-Great visuals-Good game length for 4X space game (ranges from 1 to 4 hours, depending on number of players, map size, and aggression of each player)-Diverse number of races and makes good use of the hero system-Gameplay itself is pretty good in terms of economy, expansion, and various aspects of ""empire building""Cons:-Mediocre combat system; uses a combat card system, pretty hands-off but it's better than full auto-resolve or micro-managing every battle-Diplomacy system is rather simple-Mediocre AI (if you only play single player, then you'll have much less enjoyment than if you play with your friends)-Increasing difficulty of AI just gives them ""cheat"" advantages-Some bugs that cause game crashes; however, it is mitigated by auto-saves so this isn't too bad-Other misc bugs can cause the need for loading of your auto-saveOverall 7.5/10. Would give it an 8.5 if it didn't have those annoying bugs and better AI. Recommend playing if you have friends that also enjoy 4X space games.			"

												It's a lot like Evil Empire 2, ok that's probably too obscure for anyone to know.It's like O-Game where you can design your own ships and it has good graphics.If you're to young to know O-Game, it's a little bit like Civilization in space or more like a turn based Sins of a Solar Empire.You get to colonize planets, grow the population, research technologies (the tree grows in 4 directions with lots of crossover in each branch so that few tech is really ""mandatory""), build your fleet and expand your empire.The different races play quite differently.It has it's weaknesses, the combat for example is not the best. My gripes with it is that you can't pick which fleet to attack when you attack enemy fleets around a solar system;Managing fleets is very cumbersome, you have to click a LOT to move ships around, split them, merge them, name the fleets, send them around and wonder why they don't listen to your clicks (e.g.  a combat has started somewhere else and I didn't notice the silent notification), pick them from the tiny window that you have to scroll a lot, find them in the other window after you've sent them to another solar system.You can't directly interact in combat, except for picking 3 strategies for the 3 combat phases and those strategy cards are not intuitive to use at all.I especially hate that the AI built ships with lots of defense but no offense, which I couldn't kill because I didn't focus on military research, but which also couldn't kill me because they had no offense. The AI would ""attack"" me every turn with them, which was borderline trolling and the kicker is that those ships were ""blockading"" the solar system which had economic downsides for me but they couldn't actually do any real harm.I'm still recommending it because it's overall a pretty good game. The GUI for economy is well thought out. It works pretty well in coop, you can do the most important actions for the turn, mark your turn as ready to end and continue to do less urgent actions which will still happen in the same turn if you manage to do them before everyone has passed their turn, or else just happen later. Also saving and loading multiplayer games works well.Just maybe wait for a sale :P			"

The UI could use dome work, but once you know where everything is it gets better obviously. Just a little over complicated at some points with tons of micro-management. One other thing is the combat is rock-paper-scissors, plain and simple. It has great cinimatics but you have no real control of your ships when fighting which is a big letdown. Otherwise this game is spectacular with a ton of customization and content to explore.			"

												A turn-based space 4x strategy game set on a grand scale of galactic proportions. Intended to be more of a sandbox start where the stage is set with back-story, races and factions, but it is up to you to define the story after that. While lacking some of the charm and character of a game like Civilization 5, where the characters were very immersive and the feeling of writing history compelled you on. Endless Space, while comparable to Civ 5 and other space strategy games, is not trying to be a copy but a beast of its own. The game also runs fairly well on machines built from crumpets, like mine, 100% 7 year old genuine golden machine right here.The games strength lies in the screen you will be spending a lot of time with, getting to know, making tea for and so on; the galaxy view, also FIDS is a guy you will have to get friendly with, get to know FIDS real well – FIDS stands for Food, Industry, Dust and Science; optimizing these will be important. The interface on the default view and the leaves that stemming from the branches connected to the galaxy interface are simple and relatively easy to navigate; the economy is rather solid, with many resources to monopolize and exploit, – my favourites being Bluecap Mold and Hydromiel - with resources set on low it can create some interesting situations. Managing and growing your empire is can be done easily, but to keep an empire at its optimal level some loving care to keep it in check and sound engineering ideas  are required to achieve a lovely, green and flowering empire. You can also zoom in and out of the galaxy view and into systems which you will find at helpful and the planets vivid colours pleasing to the eye.Hero’s can be important to your strategy too due to their boosting abilities and a variety of roles they can fill either in administration or fleet command, however they are not essential pieces to make keep your empire spinning – just be sure to pick them up and assign them to tasks if you can. Expansion is a very good thing and is a big part of the games early stage. Systems contain planets usually of varying tiers with nice planets being tier one and smelly gas planets + floating rocks being the highest tier, needless to say tier ones are better. You should probably colonise lots of systems as quickly as possible... but not too many at a pace your empire cannot keep up with... that could end very badly and happiness will snowball out of control very quickly; also keep an eye on the happiness of the populous, try to avoid planets with really bad happiness modifiers early on unless you have a good reason to colonise that system – such as a good happiness modifiers outweighing the bad one or a burning desire for that system. Initially colonised systems become outposts and over time will become colonies, colonies are better in many ways, for one they have an influence ring which is good for you but bad for your enemies systems if it swallows it whole; during their outpost state they can still be attacked without war being declared so you might want to defend them from the unforgiving galaxy until they mature. Also be sure to have each system doing something, even if it’s just Industry to Dust conversion, wasted turns don’t come back.Research, is a bit like a big expanding circle, you can plough through in one direction if you wanted to but before long you will have to turn back and follow up the other branches for important and relevant technologies; in game terms, N-Way Fusion Plants & Isolation Shields in the Applied Sciences tree is important early on while Applied Casmir Affect in the Exploration & Expansion tree is very good for early expansion, there are techs in the Diplomacy & Trading tree that is important to happiness and keeping yourself protected is always imperative to your survival so the Galactic Warfare tree will be visited regularly.The somewhat unusual combat system has a somewhat offhanded approach to it. The cinematic battle sequences while pretty and enjoyable to watch lacks some of the interactivity people are used to, where normally you needed to rely on positioning and particular manoeuvres in battle; however instead you rely more on the way you have set up your fleet beforehand which is assisted by a cards which designate actions your fleet can perform, whether or not a heroic Admiral is in the fleet and fleet targeting options during the battle. These battles can be auto-resolved if you wish; you can also invade systems with a number of methods such as a general siege, bombing or sending in the troops – of course you can turn to place to ashes after if you wanted to. The battles are not grand and truly epic but are enjoyable and perform their role rather well. Ships are arranged into fleets, which can be managed from the fleet tab on the galaxy screen, are custom built from hull designs, while the general blueprints are not yours to play with, the toys you attach to it are. Good ship design is essential to defend yourself from hungry Cravers or invade some helpless Sophons on an isolated system; while some understanding of the combat system and understanding how to achieve your design goal is crucial for success, designing the ships in question is quite easy once you know where to find shipyard is. Amplitude while being a small - French – studio, have put a lot of love into its first game, they have also allowed the community to get involved in a number of occasions to help make decisions for the future of the game through the Games2Gether system and forums and are updating the game regularly with content and fixes.

												This game is strangely addictive and then I realized... This is Civilization in space why wouldn't it be... I've owned it for less then a week and have sunk a good 30 hours into it already and will probably sink a lot more knowing how many hours I've given to civilization.-Deep game with awesome graphics even works well on slower machines(as long as you don't enter visual parts of battles and do the auto complete battle.)-Tech tree giant haven't fully explored after 5-6 playthroughs.-Great amount of customization with space ships less cookie cutter.Also if you like Sins of the Solar Empire you'll like this game unless you like the fast pace of Sins and not the turn based strategy of Civilization.

												Very much a well-done space-based Civilization style game, better than Galatic Civ II in my opinion.  That said, you will most likely need to spend more time understanding and learning the game's mechanics than with either Civ or Galactic Civ.  Expect to get trashed by the AI regularly until you figure things out (or turn the difficulty down).Worth the investment in patience, but I still get beaten by the AI more often with this game than comparable difficulties in Civ or GC.  Do yourself a favor and study the races and start with one that fits your play style... you will get frustrated less often with this approach.			"

												Endless Space is so much fun, If you have never played a 4x strategy I reccomend looking up a good guide. The UI could use dome work, but once you know where everything is it gets better obviously. Just a little over complicated at some points with tons of micro-management. One other thing is the combat is rock-paper-scissors, plain and simple. It has great cinimatics but you have no real control of your ships when fighting which is a big letdown. Otherwise this game is spectacular with a ton of customization and content to explore.			"

												A turn-based space 4x strategy game set on a grand scale of galactic proportions. Intended to be more of a sandbox start where the stage is set with back-story, races and factions, but it is up to you to define the story after that. While lacking some of the charm and character of a game like Civilization 5, where the characters were very immersive and the feeling of writing history compelled you on. Endless Space, while comparable to Civ 5 and other space strategy games, is not trying to be a copy but a beast of its own. The game also runs fairly well on machines built from crumpets, like mine, 100% 7 year old genuine golden machine right here.The games strength lies in the screen you will be spending a lot of time with, getting to know, making tea for and so on; the galaxy view, also FIDS is a guy you will have to get friendly with, get to know FIDS real well – FIDS stands for Food, Industry, Dust and Science; optimizing these will be important. The interface on the default view and the leaves that stemming from the branches connected to the galaxy interface are simple and relatively easy to navigate; the economy is rather solid, with many resources to monopolize and exploit, – my favourites being Bluecap Mold and Hydromiel - with resources set on low it can create some interesting situations. Managing and growing your empire is can be done easily, but to keep an empire at its optimal level some loving care to keep it in check and sound engineering ideas  are required to achieve a lovely, green and flowering empire. You can also zoom in and out of the galaxy view and into systems which you will find at helpful and the planets vivid colours pleasing to the eye.Hero’s can be important to your strategy too due to their boosting abilities and a variety of roles they can fill either in administration or fleet command, however they are not essential pieces to make keep your empire spinning – just be sure to pick them up and assign them to tasks if you can. Expansion is a very good thing and is a big part of the games early stage. Systems contain planets usually of varying tiers with nice planets being tier one and smelly gas planets + floating rocks being the highest tier, needless to say tier ones are better. You should probably colonise lots of systems as quickly as possible... but not too many at a pace your empire cannot keep up with... that could end very badly and happiness will snowball out of control very quickly; also keep an eye on the happiness of the populous, try to avoid planets with really bad happiness modifiers early on unless you have a good reason to colonise that system – such as a good happiness modifiers outweighing the bad one or a burning desire for that system.

												Endless Space is a space 4X game with a notably well-designed expansion mechanic. Unfortunately, the smaller details of this game's mechanics are not well-documented; while the mechanics overall are easy to understand, there are many sneaky factors that can cause a large impact on the game. For example, a star system outside your colored influence circles generate only HALF the science and money - but nowhere is this mentioned, save for a small ""distance from empire"" factor when you examine your science output in detail.The military system in Endless Space is often criticized. Indeed, space battles quickly devolve into mashing the auto button over and over, as you watch your indestructible ships blow up the AI's endless stream of useless fodder. Because of the common rebalances and redesigns of ship-building, it is extremely difficult to reason about the effectiveness of ship designs. Additionally, capturing star systems is less than glamorous, with bombardment reduced to watching a colored circle fill up and a turns left icon count down.Despite its flaws, Endless Space is in the end still a strong 4X game. Strategy in general remains the same no matter what race or victory type you play, but the game mechanics' nuances and relative importance of timing make mastering this strategy a great challenge.

												The AI is quite rubbish, but then 99.5% of all games suffer that problem.I think what a lot of people get frustrated with is the inability to just half♥♥♥♥♥♥an empire and win, which you can do in a lot of 4x games (Civ 5, for all it's acclaim and excellency, can very much be won just by randomly picking technology with a little conservation.)In Endless Space it's significantly harder. Whether by design or poor AI, the game more or less encourages you to decide on a victory strategy and go for it, and to do that you have to make significant steps backwards to get forwards. Taking the time to build up your navy is necessary for any real chance at a military victory, but doing so early enough to get a foot on the ladder and avoid risk of being flattened by the Cravers and other military empires really does impact your ability to research and build and expand...all three of which are increasingly necessary for building an effective empire.Similarly you can't just hump one research tree or one tactic to victory. If you only build ships, you won't be expanding and your research is crippled, which means your 70 destroyers will be flattened by a single ship before you realize your mistake. If you want a decent navy you need to unlock the better ships (second tree),spread to multiple worlds for the industrial power to build (second tree but not directly related to military at all), and nab the perks that build up your fleet size (third tree) as well as building better weapons (1st tree, and the only one dirctly 'military'), and to do all that in a timely fashion you need to invest in better research methods (4th tree, which also contains a few very vital techs for your fleet.)On top of all that, you need to do it in the right order, or you risk spending too much time on one area to the cost of another....and your empire.Summary: Endless space isn't perfect, but I think it's got the concept of Empire Building down pretty damn good. The reason the AI feels so overpowered and quite often throttles you with ramping up ship strength is because it's a computer, and usually much much better and prioritizing than you. "

												While I'm not very good at this game I still enjoy it. It's pretty easy to get into however there are parts that could really do with an actual tutorial rather than a text dump such as the starship builder but it is satisfying to spend the whole game steadly colonizing planets and filling the tech tree and getting all the money in the galazy and still loose. The one massive problem I found was after a really long game I got a weird pop up with a paragraph of code which crashed the game. I have no idea why it turned up but honestly it was so late in the game I couldn't really be bothered to start up the game again.All in all I still like this game, even if I don't fully understand how to play it properly.

												Firstly, the surface stuff. the graphics and music are pretty good - the sounds are quiet and atmospheric like you would expect for the universe it's based in. The visuals are nice, and the manual battle sequences are pretty while most of your time is really spent in the battle map, where the UI, once you get used to it, works well enough. I find in a lot of these 4X type games, once you have a large amount of planets/cities/systems/whatever, it gets kind of tedious giving them orders every turn, but for the most part, come end game, you're either pumping out units or pushing for production to research or dust bonuses, so it's not that bad.Now for story.  The factions all have stories and even intro videos that are actually interesting (the first time around). But don't get this game if you expect any kind of campaign because there is none - the story really ends at the beginning of a match. There isn't really much personality in the factions and how they act, it's more to do with some of the diplomatic factors you share with them. What is great though about factions is the multitude of customization traits. Each race has starting research and unique abilities and weakneses, and that you as someone who may want to make your own faction can try to balance yourself as you carve out their identity. Things like modifiers for diplomatic options, population growth, resource management, ship enchancements, etc.Now the negative - taking a bad path in research can lead you down a disasterous path. There are things that are important to get and things that are only time sinks, and it is hard to know which is which when you're first starting out. The random nature of battles makes it kind of annoying at times - the only real strategy when it comes to battle is fleet composition and using certain modifiers at certain times, like boosts to armor or weapons power, but direct control over things is not something that is possible. The AI is a little dumb as well - early on, placing colonies at choke points is a way to box them in and sometimes they don't really do anything about it. Their minds change constantly about you, and alliances fall apart quickly or pop up out of nowhere because of something as miniscule as the fact that your colonies are neighbours.But despite those points, I found the game quite enjoyable. The games take a long time, and there is a good amount of variety in customizing maps, so chances are you will get a fair amount of play time out of it. Basically, the more you play the more you will hone the route through the research tree and balancing all the other factors.I'd recommend this game for sure, but say that the expansion really is something you should only get if you like the game yourself - the amount of content it adds is decent, but you will not make or break your initial impression by missing out on it (or getting it for that matter).

												I'm a big fan of this genre from Masters of Orion.   For an indie game this is pretty amazing.   If you are expecting pure combat, I don't think this game is for you.   It is more about system development and expansion.   I lost the first couple of games on weakest AI because I was focused on military.   I finally won a game on easy using Science.    Micro management of the systems.This is actually very interesting.   I'm 40 hours in and I don't think I've mastered this at all.   My mid game, around 80 turns was very strong.  But my early game is still poor.   What is fun is to put the game in a window.  Then pull up dirty pleasure tv show off to the side and then just clicking through your planets to make them rapidly develop.   You actually have to read the system improvements because one size does NOT fit all.   In other words, on some systems it is a complete waste to build every improvement.  Tech TreeAgain another piece of the game that makes you think.   You don't need everything, especially if your are targeting a specific victory condition like dust, tech, aliance, etc.  Read and decide.  You must look at the planets near your home world before you unlock the colonization for those worlds.   Sure eventually you will get all but you need to race to unlock key strategic systems ExpansionThis is very cool.  It is easier to expand in sytems you own rather than sending out ships.  Makes sense right?   However you still need to send ships out to seed systems.  And you need to seed systems that either block other player's expansion or give you huge development potential.  And you haven't always developed the right technologies to seed the planets on the target system.  This makes for a great game play balance in the game.Ship UpgradesI really like the modification and retrofit system.  Very easy to use and key to keeping your fleet uptodate.CombatThis is a bit dull but not the focus of the game.   You pick attitudes for three rounds of combats, long range, mid range, short range, then your ships do their thing.   I've found repairs to be pretty good.   But again I don't think the focus of the game on combat, especially since you only have about 5 classes of ships to fly with various mods on them.  It is easy to win other ways.DiplomacyI'm still a bit lost.   I don't quite understand why I can't initiate peace treaties.   Maybe that is the way amoeba's are.   Not sure.   Alliances seem good until you get thrown into a battle you don't want to be in.Nay SayersIt always reminds me of players that want to play the way they think rather than the way the game allows them to think.  Sure we all have had our frustrations with that.   Even I had that with the first couple of games.  But once you start looking for other ways to do things, the game opens up.ValueI picked this up on steam sale.  Great value.   Fun little game completely worth the money.   "

												Note:  This review was written for just the Emporer Edition of the game.  I have not yet tried it with the expansion.  If I ever get the expansion, I will update my review.I felt conflicted about whether to recommend this game or not.  In the end, I decided that the pros outweigh the cons.  That being said, it has a lot of missed potential, and I hope they improve on a few things for the sequel.Pros:- The game is a lot of fun, especially beginning and mid game.  A lot of thought has been put into certain details, such as the tech tree, which makes it fun to explore all the different techs.- You can customize your own race, and choose its advantages and disadvantages.  This, to me, is one of its strongest points.  I had a lot of fun creating my own alien races to play as and play against- The game has an AI function that allows you to automate system management.  I didn't discover this feature until my 2nd playthrough, and let me tell you, it sped up the game a ton!  Now, you still need to keep tabs on what it is building and where, as the AI will not always make the choices that best suits your strategy, but for the most part it really speeds up the mid game.Cons:- The game as a steep learning curve.  The tutorial is more or less useless.  It took a lot of playing around with settings and features before I was able to figure out the ins and outs of the game.- Ship combat is a little boring, albeit fun to watch at least.- The End game leaves something to be desired.  Once you get past the mid game stage, the game tends to drag on.  This is especially true if you are trying to achieve different types of victories, such as the science or diplomatic.In conclusion, This game is fun, but requires patience towards the end.  I hope that when they do the sequel, they tap into the potential that this game had.6/10			"

												This is a great game that I recommend anyone who likes this type of game to buy, I have only one headache that every time I see it just makes me want to scream ""WHY DO THIS?!?!?!?"" at my monitor and that is the Hero system. Whoever designed them to be both useful on the ground and in space should have been dragged out the back of teh office and beaten with a stick till this was changed, as it cuts the usefulness of most of them in half. Having ones for space and ones for the ground would have made this game a lot more enjoyable than it is for me as I find i have to keep quitting and restarting the game around 5-10 times each time I want to start a new game so that I get at least 1 ground based Hero to begin with, but yeah other than that small headache the game is great :)			"

												Great game once you learn how to play it lol. Tutorial sucks♥♥♥♥♥so don't worry about learning everything immediately. You'll learn the tech tree and all of the other stuff eventually. As a side note, public multiplayer in this game is virtually nonexistent at this point. No games whatsoever set up (but what would you expect from a 4 year old 4x game with mixed reviews lol). Best case scenario is if you have some friends to play with. However, single player in this game also has many things to do and is nice because you can adjust the games to be whatever length you want.			"

												Very tentative recommendation, 6.5 or 7 out of 10.Frankly, I like the game, but it's shallow. Wide gameplay, but shallow depths. You have planets to manage, systems to conquer, fancy space battles you can watch and organise. Lots of things to do.Until you get into the game. My first match, normal, random AI, default starting stuff I spent a lot of time clicking the ""end turn"" button. If you don't get the AI to manage your systems for you, you will get waaaaayyyy too many systems to check up on. The research tree is pretty big, and learning what to research is kinda of difficult starting out.Essentially, there's too much of an info-dump of things that may or may not matter with the tutorial bits, and I did what I shouldn't and skipped it. Info-dump + not particularly complex gameplay. There's no mega-fleets (yet), or commanding ships like in E.V.E. of ""torpedoes on the port ship! Engage beam weapons!"". It's just a cutscene where you choose 3 tasks for your ships to do and that's it for ship vs ship stuff. Have not tried out ship vs planet stuff yet though.Will edit later. Leaning towards the ""not recommended"", but I don't think I've played the dlcs yet (still in first game, lol). 2-3 hours of my gameplay were spent idling. Game was purchased during steam sale for $14 or so.			"

												This game takes a while to get in to, and learn, and at first you will most likely fail a lot because the tutorial is trash, but look up guides on steam and you should grasp it quickly. the game is deep and really fun once you get the hang of it. The community is great as well. when i first got it i had problems starting t up, but i just deleted the logo movies that play on start up and it fixed the problem. overall the game is definitely worth a buy, the only real complaint i have about the gameplay is the terrible camera angles in battle, but those don't reall matter as the battles are automated so it only affects cinematic experience.

												Many of the game mechnics seem broken or unalanced, such as empire expansion leads to a weak empire prone to war declarations, while a smaller by scientific empire leads to easy wins. Taxation can be bypassed through diplomacy or industry to dust. There is also no system level tax to aid with unhappy systems. Battle seems to be a boring version rock paper scicccors. Ship repair costs are prohibitive. Varrious UX \ UI issues icuding fiddly controls for mananging system\planet populace, no highlightig or greaying out of improvements which make no difference to a system (e.g. you have to read through all the planet types, etc). Queue windows are too small, and dragging and dropping itesm to change priority is a boring chore. Large empires just devolve into micromanagement, but again large empires do not seem the way to go.			"

												Great game, decent graphics, sleepy music (not boring, just capable of making you wanna sleep), and though there is the rare freeze/crash/both, its still worth getting.+ customizable empires (however you like)+ Cool random events+ Influence colors shows your territory- have to research anything to do with galactic communication- battle numbers are unclear: you could have 26k power vs 12k power, and you could lose- Random event decision making isn't clear on ""good"" or ""bad"": You could be ""Hostile"" and get something great, but if you're ""Helpful"" you could get something horrible. Just think color coded effects would help (green for good, red for bad)- When making a new empire, click a trait (good/bad), you intend to remove just 1 from the group but game removes entire group. Extra negative is that the traits don't mention what group they are from (whether in title or description)+/- Race/Faction exclusive tech (good if you wanna beat everyone, bad if you're in coop)- Huge maps feel way too small+ Designing ships isn't complicated- Auto-Upgrade can make worst ships in the game, don't use it- Manual Battle is just aesthetic, you can see the battle in action, but thats it- BIG Negative - Can't exit manual battle mode? Can still get Tech Victory even if its turned off- Game admits it will CHEAT in harder difficultiesAnd just note, this is based on the EMPEROR EDITION without the DLC. Overall rating: 7.5/10I mentioned earlier that the game CAN freeze/crash/both, but that is PRETTY RARE. If you want maps that rival MOO3, you won't like.If you want a decent Space TB strategy game, get it.If you want a game that CAN beat you on Beginner mode, get it.If you can handle a game that WILL cheat to beat you, get it.If you can't handle a game that rarely crashes or freezes, GTFO Steam.

The community is great as well. when i first got it i had problems starting t up, but i just deleted the logo movies that play on start up and it fixed the problem. overall the game is definitely worth a buy, the only real complaint i have about the gameplay is the terrible camera angles in battle, but those don't reall matter as the battles are automated so it only affects cinematic experience.

												Many of the game mechnics seem broken or unalanced, such as empire expansion leads to a weak empire prone to war declarations, while a smaller by scientific empire leads to easy wins. Taxation can be bypassed through diplomacy or industry to dust. There is also no system level tax to aid with unhappy systems. Battle seems to be a boring version rock paper scicccors. Ship repair costs are prohibitive. Varrious UX \ UI issues icuding fiddly controls for mananging system\planet populace, no highlightig or greaying out of improvements which make no difference to a system (e.g. you have to read through all the planet types, etc). Queue windows are too small, and dragging and dropping itesm to change priority is a boring chore. Large empires just devolve into micromanagement, but again large empires do not seem the way to go.			"

												Great game, decent graphics, sleepy music (not boring, just capable of making you wanna sleep), and though there is the rare freeze/crash/both, its still worth getting.+ customizable empires (however you like)+ Cool random events+ Influence colors shows your territory- have to research anything to do with galactic communication- battle numbers are unclear: you could have 26k power vs 12k power, and you could lose- Random event decision making isn't clear on ""good"" or ""bad"": You could be ""Hostile"" and get something great, but if you're ""Helpful"" you could get something horrible. Just think color coded effects would help (green for good, red for bad)- When making a new empire, click a trait (good/bad), you intend to remove just 1 from the group but game removes entire group. Extra negative is that the traits don't mention what group they are from (whether in title or description)+/- Race/Faction exclusive tech (good if you wanna beat everyone, bad if you're in coop)- Huge maps feel way too small+ Designing ships isn't complicated- Auto-Upgrade can make worst ships in the game, don't use it- Manual Battle is just aesthetic, you can see the battle in action, but thats it- BIG Negative - Can't exit manual battle mode? Can still get Tech Victory even if its turned off- Game admits it will CHEAT in harder difficultiesAnd just note, this is based on the EMPEROR EDITION without the DLC. Overall rating: 7.5/10I mentioned earlier that the game CAN freeze/crash/both, but that is PRETTY RARE. If you want maps that rival MOO3, you won't like.If you want a decent Space TB strategy game, get it.If you want a game that CAN beat you on Beginner mode, get it.If you can handle a game that WILL cheat to beat you, get it.If you can't handle a game that rarely crashes or freezes, GTFO Steam.

												I actually got into this AFTER playing Endless Legend, and while I can see what lessons Amplitude took from ES and applied in EL, ES still gives an enjoyable experience for anyone looking for a Space 4X that isn't an RTS.To put it short, the game is very administration and automation heavy. If you're the kind of person who likes the exploitation part of 4X, and if you like automating each of your turns to a science, then this is the game for you. I personally love making research decisions, setting waypoints for fleets, etc. and I can forgive the game's poor combat, but if you're looking for a game to stretch your strategic skills this isn't it.I'm really enjoying this game. After Civilization V's expansion, Brave New World, Civ V became a bit biased towards smaller empires, so having a game that allows and repays rapid expansion and exploitation is welcome.Despite the relatively small size of the playable maps, empires and armies can get pretty huge. The U.I. lacks character, but  it's really clean so administrating your empire is very easy. This is also one of the problems, though, as you start to get into the groove of running your empire every turn starts to feel monotonous, only broken up by random events that, more often than not, end up hurting your empire.Battles are also not very strategic. The combat system is intriguing, but ultimately it just doesn't involve the player enough, and I hope in any future iterations of the game they use EL's battle system. Winning wars ultimately comes down to ship design (which you have to constantly evolve to keep up with your enemies) and outproducing your opponents. It feels really good to have twelve fleets going at once, though, and managing a large navy is also quite fun for me.Great game if you like micromanaging your empire, maximizing production, science, and economic output and planning, then this is the game for you. Unfortunately, anyone looking for a strategic challenge should pass.			"

												Played for around 6 hours, first couple were a little tough -- but much like jumping into Civilization for the first time, it starts to make sense. I will say that I won the first game I played, I think I was lucky that the AI Opponent was trying for diplomacy whilst I just built up my ships and went on the attack. Enjoyable and well worth the dollar I paid for it!			"

												Endless Space is a 4X game (expand/explore/exploit/exterminate) in the same vein as Civilization, with a lot of similarities to Civ IV. The game has a lot of interesting unique mechanics in addition to the normal Civ gameplay including a uniquely structured tech tree, purchasable heroes that can lead your troops or your planets, and a unique way to utilize your planets (cities essentially) for resources. In addition, the many traits that the different civilizations have change the dynamic of the game and your priorities. The ability to make custom civilations by mixing and matching these traits also gives a lot of room for creativity and new experiences.However, the main flaw of Endless Space is that it feels somewhat lifeless. It does a lot of things well, but there isn't anything it does particularly amazingly. The game ends up feeling somewhat generic because despite the unique mechanics there isn't anything that stands out as a large improvement over other 4X games. Overall I would recommend Endless Space to fans of 4X games, especially those that enjoyed CivIV more than CivV, and for people who enjoyed Endless Legend and want to try a similar game. However, for people who aren't huge fans of the genre I would recommend sticking to Civ or other common 4X games instead.			"

												I don't hate this game. The mechanics and features are fantastic (great tech tree, lot's of customisation, etc.). However....The A.I. sucks. They literally go around and try to colonise every single planet. After they have done that, they declare war on you because ""they don't have enough room for their population"" (even if you are allies). Then they launch infinite fleets of cruisers at your planets until you die (unless you have a decent defense). The A.I. has horrible descision making, and obviously cheats as well. Don't buy this game unless you want to play it with friends.			"

												The lore in this game is by far the best ever ! I only say that because there were many years where there was all these diferent lores, such as Star Wars, and Warhammer 40K. Yet none of them really interested me, and for a very long time I never understood fan bases that got made at directors or game developrs for making games or movies that didn't fit into the ""criteria"" for the lore being depicted. Then one day, Amplitude Studios arrives with a brand new game, Endless Space, and the game is just brilliant. The lore especially, its got a mysterious 'Endless' sort of view point, in the fact that in every game it focuses on the 'now' of the main factions and leaves the mystery part to the 'past' factions that all sort of coincide with each and every game. It was something original, and finally a place where I can could my own and understand the lore, and finally understand what its like to be a geek for someting as fictional and sci-fi as Endless Space. The reason I consider this a recommended review, is because this is the biggest appeal to me when I play Endless Space, I feel like I'm leading the factions to prosperity, and sometimes I would just mindless play the game to roleplay and go on a adventure that only this game could offer. There is no other strategy or 4X game that quite gives you this much sort of engagement in a storyline and lore. I also thought it would be important to note that I picked up this game in 2013, exactly before the day of the release of the Disharmony expansion. The love of the lore of Endless Space still going strong.			"

Posted: May 3, 2015
												First, let me get this off my chest. Appalling, nonsensical idiocies simply ooze out of this game.Exhibit A. Linear, corridor combat where even ships with no guns can 'blockade' your attacking force and prevent it from moving until you destroy those ships. And you must destroy them one fleet at a time regardless of their relative strength. Fleets of tiny cardboard scouts or huge bullet sponges with no guns can thus blockade overwhelmingly strong armadas and entire star systems for an indefinite number of turns as more worthless ships are churned out and added to the stack, or retreating ships immediately return and rejoin the fray. Combat pointlessly drags on and on where more sensibly you would blast out the entire stack of fleets in one turn or better yet, go around them because they don't have the firepower to prevent you. But not here. Here you are stuck in a 1D corridor and must blast out the barriers one at a time to get through. This is simply an appalling game mechanic for a 3D space game. No. No. No. *No!*Exhibit B. You cannot destroy planets only take them over after a minimum of 8 turns of siege or a highly costly invasion that can quickly deplete your population. This is simply a recipe for dragging out combat. Overwhelming strong sieges (100:1 or more) still take 8 turns whereas they should just blast right through the guy so you can move on. Here there objective seems to be to explicitly inhibit crushing weak enemies by blasting them into dust or by sweeping over them. This slows combat down and turns it into a slog.Exhibit C. Negotiating peace with one member of an alliance immediately forces peace with all the other members without compensation or negotiation. Nor can you negotiate peace with them all at once to get something from everybody. Very beneficial peace settlements with one member must therefore be ignored or the game grinds to a halt while you wait out the peace delay to continue your war with the rest of the alliance. Again, this just artificially drags out the game for no reason and no value.And I could go on, but *despite* these debilitating design decisions, Endless Space is still worth playing.The reason that this is so is because the other aspects of the game compensate for the dumbnesses and the grindy combat. The excellent and deep research tree, the ability to terraform your planets, the special race base characteristics combined with the very broad ability to customize your own race, and the excellent art assets all come together to produce something worth your while. You will need patience to put up with the grindy combat and the ability to turn a blind eye to some of the nonsensical things that go on, but if you can, you will be rewarded with an enjoyable and interesting game with significant replayability.

The a.i. aren't ridiculously stupid and will offer a good challenging fight that tests your abilities to make and control fleets, technological advancements are at a good, balanced pace, and each faction offers a unique way of playing; or you could make your own! About the only negative I can really think of and it isn't much of one is how you have to research being able to offer peace, make allianced, and trade. But overall this is a very good 4x game that I would give a 9/10 and do highly recommend it to anyone even remotely thinking of buying it.			"

												Endless Space is a great 4X strategy game (Explore, Expand, Exploit and Exterminate). I mostly play action games and shooters and never played a 4X strategy game before. So my experience is extremely limited to say the least. The only reason I got into this game is because of my love for the sci-fi. All those ships fighting in space looked very cool.This game has a learning curve, and you might need to watch some videos on how to actually play it, what researches to complete and in what order, for example, this chick knows her shít:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcw-IheRx7UqeOZMTU6fdz-gU8APFeDAhSo after watching her videos I was able to win my first game on normal difficulty (which is definitely not easy).Once you learn, it becomes very easy to understand what to do and when. It's just like in RTS games – you build armies and destroy opponent, only with more ways to win and everyone takes turns. To sum everything up, it’s a very good entrance to a 4X strategy genre. At this stage, this game is fun, perfectly polished, fast paced for a TBS and relatively easy to understand. So I definitely recommend it to all sci-fi fans out there. "

												10/10I recommend it.Endless Space is everthing I could hope for in a game.  It gives me the freedom to customize my Faction as I wish, and to customize what kind of map I'll play on.  All of the factions are very unique and detailed, providing a lot of well written background from which to draw a strong narative from.  The hand drawn art mixed in with top notch graphics is an especially nice touch, and some of the faction art was so nice it graced my desktop background for a time.  To top it off, the gameplay, though perhaps not the best I've seen, was really well suited to this type of game.All in all this was one of the few games that I thoroughly enjoyed playing, and my game time reflects this.

												I bought this game because I played Dungeon of the Endless and it was a lot of fun, namely because it was unique.I played this game for many more hours and I liked it. But there are much better 4X games out there.=== The Good: ====Simple and fast gameplay that's relatively easy to learn for a 4X game.Great graphics.Good music.Awesome stories.Good random events.Great simplified combat and interesting cinematic view. -- Wish there was a speed-up option.=== The Bad: ====As this is a thumbs down review, I will need to explain myself.1) The races are very similar and it's usually not that a good idea to specialize too much in tech.2) The UI is simple, but too simple.3) The game plays more like a board-game, this is also a double-edged sword.1) Races and the Tech Tree:- The hero pool is shared. The way they develop and grow is identical.- The races grant relatively small stat bonuses that don't seem to affect the gameplay too much; you can win in almost any way with any race without too much trouble.- Races do not modify the tech tree with the exception of the starting couple of tier-1 (basically free) techs and the locations of a couple various other technologies.- The tech tree balances everyone's research, which basically makes every empire the same even as the game progresses, making specialization sometimes even harmful:a) for bigger military fleets, you must research diplomacy;b) for new combat ship chassis, you must research colonization;c) for more combat tactics, you must research architecture;d) for more armor against one kind of weapon, you must research a different kind of weapon;e) for more heroes, you must research 10 other technologies;f) if you resarch enough of one weapon, you can research high levels of another weapon without researching its preceding levels.I'm sure that there are more examples, but these are the main ones that I thought seemed too illogical. I think that the tech tree should be more linear. Whatever you want more/better of, that's what you research. Also, certain races should have exclusive access to entire branches, not just a slightly earlier tier-4 missile.2) The UI is Bare-Bones Simple:This greatly helps find the important information you need right away. Also, perhaps the game is trying to lower its learning curve, but it makes it hard to get the information you need to get your most out of your empire without going online.- You can't know too much about certain fleet stats until you're in certain situations where they are directly applied, for instance, invasion/bombardment stats.- You can't see clearly what a ship is equipped with or what abilities is has.- You can't see what a class is designed with without going in to modify it.- You can't really see what enemy ships have (even ones you've fought) without fighting them adn watching the cinematic view.- By-turn math for resources seems mostly transparent and listed out quite plainly, but they often don't add up right. That hero's ability isn't reflected in the score correctly, or that +50 dust bonus isn't showing in the system or in the universe as it should, or that operator that you thought should be multiplied was maybe added. I think it's good that they try to show everything, yet it doesn't _quite_ show everything and it makes me uncertain whether it's bugged or if certain things just aren't shown or whether the description doesn't match the actual effect(s).- The specific effects of many facilities are unclear from their descriptions. After building them (see above), they don't seem to add together right according to what the description(s) made me think.- Trade routes are undisplayed (as far as I can tell) in the UI yet there are so many abilities and facilities that deal with them so they are probably quite important. Values that seem to be purely integers have percentage modifiers that can be applied which doesn't really make sense.3) It's a Board Game:- With similar fleet layouts, whoever has the higher battle rating wins mostly unharmed, so a wealthy empire has no way of swarming (and beating) a much smaller yet only slightly higher-tech empire.- Countering card types is more important than actually paying attention to what a card does, so the content of your fleet and the compatibility with the card is not very important; instead you'll find yourself either guessing what the AI will probably do or just start save scumming if it's a close battle.- Some of the random events are too random, too powerful, or scripted poorly. Need 1000 dust to save your homeworld from an attack of 5 large pirate fleets but you only have 34 dust? Not a problem! -- Did you just spend 34 dust and basically wipe out 4 empires? Lucky! -- Did you wait five turns investing (resource) to unveil some Endless secret but never get a message? What a pity!- You can't micromanage ships very much, you can't customize ships very much, you can't rename ships, you can't choose how you renovate ships. It's literally as if they're fixed game pieces on a board. There's a very finite number of ship chassis (6) to work with that offer little in the way of diversifying.- All the planets develop mostly the same way, by building one of each of the same buildings on them. I prefer the facility limit method where you have to pick which ones you want yet you can repeat certain ones to create mega-factories that would starve without outside food. Yet, you can terraform planets to specialize planets. So that almost balances out this situation.- There are literally 3 weapons and 3 armors. You are playing adaptive rock-paper-scissors.- Heroes are all the same between empires, options are limited with how they interact, hero development follows a fixed perk tree, it plays out exactly like a board game. A more RPG, free-growth stat style (optionally, with perks) would be more immersive.If you like fast, very balanced, simple gameplay, being like a board game is a feature. I would rather not need to focus on rules and ideal build orders as much.Final verdict:This is a pretty, story-tastic quick bare-bones 4X that meets the demands of the genre and stops right there. If you're new to this genre, this is a great way to get into them. The combat mechanics are simplified, rule-oriented and even a little card-y. The sides are quite balanced, too. If you like Risk, you will probably like this game.I want to feel like I'm leading an intergalactic empire in a very asymmetric universe. This game is a little oversimplified for me and the limitations of the UI alongside the general lack of options make it feel very unimmersive.Hope #2 is more complicated, it certainly looks that way in the previews.

												Terrific RTS game design enjoyed by my son and I.  However it CONSTANTLY has multiplayer sync issues making it virtually unplayable.  We have played over a dozen times in the last year and not finished once because of sync issues that sometimes happen right at the beginning or worse, after 50 or so turns.  Very unstable platform.  Too bad.			"

												Despite all the negativity this game has been getting recently I still do believe it is absolutely superb. The a.i. aren't ridiculously stupid and will offer a good challenging fight that tests your abilities to make and control fleets, technological advancements are at a good, balanced pace, and each faction offers a unique way of playing; or you could make your own! About the only negative I can really think of and it isn't much of one is how you have to research being able to offer peace, make allianced, and trade. But overall this is a very good 4x game that I would give a 9/10 and do highly recommend it to anyone even remotely thinking of buying it.			"

												Endless Space is a great 4X strategy game (Explore, Expand, Exploit and Exterminate). I mostly play action games and shooters and never played a 4X strategy game before. So my experience is extremely limited to say the least. The only reason I got into this game is because of my love for the sci-fi. All those ships fighting in space looked very cool.This game has a learning curve, and you might need to watch some videos on how to actually play it, what researches to complete and in what order, for example, this chick knows her shít:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcw-IheRx7UqeOZMTU6fdz-gU8APFeDAhSo after watching her videos I was able to win my first game on normal difficulty (which is definitely not easy).Once you learn, it becomes very easy to understand what to do and when. It's just like in RTS games – you build armies and destroy opponent, only with more ways to win and everyone takes turns. To sum everything up, it’s a very good entrance to a 4X strategy genre. At this stage, this game is fun, perfectly polished, fast paced for a TBS and relatively easy to understand. So I definitely recommend it to all sci-fi fans out there. "

												10/10I recommend it.Endless Space is everthing I could hope for in a game.  It gives me the freedom to customize my Faction as I wish, and to customize what kind of map I'll play on.  All of the factions are very unique and detailed, providing a lot of well written background from which to draw a strong narative from.  The hand drawn art mixed in with top notch graphics is an especially nice touch, and some of the faction art was so nice it graced my desktop background for a time.  To top it off, the gameplay, though perhaps not the best I've seen, was really well suited to this type of game.All in all this was one of the few games that I thoroughly enjoyed playing, and my game time reflects this.

												I bought this game because I played Dungeon of the Endless and it was a lot of fun, namely because it was unique.I played this game for many more hours and I liked it. But there are much better 4X games out there.=== The Good: ====Simple and fast gameplay that's relatively easy to learn for a 4X game.Great graphics.Good music.Awesome stories.Good random events.Great simplified combat and interesting cinematic view. -- Wish there was a speed-up option.=== The Bad: ====As this is a thumbs down review, I will need to explain myself.1) The races are very similar and it's usually not that a good idea to specialize too much in tech.2) The UI is simple, but too simple.3) The game plays more like a board-game, this is also a double-edged sword.1) Races and the Tech Tree:- The hero pool is shared. The way they develop and grow is identical.- The races grant relatively small stat bonuses that don't seem to affect the gameplay too much; you can win in almost any way with any race without too much trouble.- Races do not modify the tech tree with the exception of the starting couple of tier-1 (basically free) techs and the locations of a couple various other technologies.- The tech tree balances everyone's research, which basically makes every empire the same even as the game progresses, making specialization sometimes even harmful:a) for bigger military fleets, you must research diplomacy;b) for new combat ship chassis, you must research colonization;c) for more combat tactics, you must research architecture;d) for more armor against one kind of weapon, you must research a different kind of weapon;e) for more heroes, you must research 10 other technologies;f) if you resarch enough of one weapon, you can research high levels of another weapon without researching its preceding levels.I'm sure that there are more examples, but these are the main ones that I thought seemed too illogical. I think that the tech tree should be more linear. Whatever you want more/better of, that's what you research. Also, certain races should have exclusive access to entire branches, not just a slightly earlier tier-4 missile.2) The UI is Bare-Bones Simple:This greatly helps find the important information you need right away. Also, perhaps the game is trying to lower its learning curve, but it makes it hard to get the information you need to get your most out of your empire without going online.- You can't know too much about certain fleet stats until you're in certain situations where they are directly applied, for instance, invasion/bombardment stats.- You can't see clearly what a ship is equipped with or what abilities is has.- You can't see what a class is designed with without going in to modify it.- You can't really see what enemy ships have (even ones you've fought) without fighting them adn watching the cinematic view.- By-turn math for resources seems mostly transparent and listed out quite plainly, but they often don't add up right. That hero's ability isn't reflected in the score correctly, or that +50 dust bonus isn't showing in the system or in the universe as it should, or that operator that you thought should be multiplied was maybe added. I think it's good that they try to show everything, yet it doesn't _quite_ show everything and it makes me uncertain whether it's bugged or if certain things just aren't shown or whether the description doesn't match the actual effect(s).- The specific effects of many facilities are unclear from their descriptions.

It has a learning curve like the side of Mount Everest, and simply pans out into nothing once you actually have some idea of going on. The interface seems like it was intentionally made to♥♥♥♥♥♥players off, and once you do master the great art of being able to send stuff places or actually getting things built, it throws other pointless curveballs at you.You might actually enjoy this game if you are the sort of massachist who enjoyed the entirely joyless Eve simply because there was space involved, but the long wait for a decent voyage into the final frontier is far from over.

												Let's keep my review simple. I will assume you know what a 4X space game is about and just list how Endless Space fares in my opinion.What Endless Space does really well:- Impressive graphics- Keeps micromanagement surprisingly low- Balanced tech-tree- Even with differences in research levels, battles are still not one-sided- The KI opponents are quite capable diplomats. Where I usually NEVER accept an offer from KI-opponents in other games, the ""Endless Space"" ones managed to ""sell"" me deals by offering the right incentives.What it does okay (meaning it's nothing special):- Several ways to win- Different species and the option to create your own- The KI opponents are quite good although they do get an unfair ingame advantage. I would prefer to be able to choose their difficulty AND the amount of ""advantage"" they get seperately.- Diplomatic options have to be researched. While it does make for an interesting game mechanic I would still prefer to have all diplomatic options from the start.What is missing:- No espionage, sabotage, inciting rebellions etc.- There is basically NOTHING besides the respective faction-intro to evoke some atmosphere in the game. Even when you finally win you only get a small picture of your faction and a rather neutral text telling you that you've just achieved economic / military / scientifiy victory.SummaryAll in all I would give it 4 out of 5 stars. It's very good and addictive but putting some atmosphere in there (voice-overs, a few animated messages etc.) would go a long way. Having some espionage and full access to diplomatic functions from the start would also help to make it even better.			"

												This game has so, so much potential. To bad it doesn't really achieve any of it. The complete lack of a campaign, the lack of a meaningful story, the fact you have no reason to get into the game just killed it for me. The fact that the mechanics feel like a more passive Civilization adds to what I already mentioned to make it a pretty boring game.I am very dispointed I got this game.More whining about the game can be found on my review of it on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2013/12/endless-space.html.

												If I had one word to describe this game it would be ""meh"".I got it for $1 and glad I didn't pay more.  It doesn't grip you with the ""one more turn"" desire like most 4x.   I love most 4x but this one you never feel like you're immersed or part of a grand strategy.  The combat is annoying and confusing.  The pirates are more powerful than the enemy AI, the graphics are boring.  The ship design all seems pointless and flat, like it doesn't really matter what you pick.  The UI is unintuitive, or worse, it's almost like they tried to make it poor.It all just seems a little bit boring.This isn't as fun as Master Of Orion, or Galactic Civilizations.  It doesn't have the polish of civilization.7 hrs in, I'm still a little confused as to what I'm doing.  I could spend more time to figure it out but I kinda wonder ""why bother"" I have other games in this genre that are more fun, more intuitive , and yes, prettier.I think I'll go back to one of the others.

												At start it looked pretty good, but once you start to have the game in hands i was quickly bored and disappointed. I like Peace as my main pleasure in this kind of games is to explore, i want to see it all on the map :) But you just can't even when you have peaceful pacts and are exploring you can't get through their zone, I was wandering with the smallest ship available and they brake pact saying that the presence of your fleet (euh 1 small ship) is invading them and don't trust me anymore so break it and attack all your planets... if this is 1 factions ok... not 3 of the 4... So the game only pushes you to war between civilizations, making other research abilities a bit pointless. so you go to war but then get a pretty awful combat system... But the biggest flaw was that there is so little to do. Build ship send it out to planet terraform and go next one and so on... Even SPAZ that is small exploration game and simplified has more to do then this...I do like the interface and how planets are represented, it is clean, colorful and very well designed, it is a pleasure to go through the menus.4/10			"

												This game sucks. The tutorial is worthless, the manual is worse, and the game is nowhere nears as streamlined or easy to pick up as Civ. Tired of beating my head against a wall to try to figure out things that should have been clearly explained. For instance, I've researched building destroyers and cruisers. Why then can I only build defenders? What other chicken sacrifices must occur before I can build these ships? Or why do entire fleets get stuck around systems in other civilizations? Or why turn-based really doesn't mean turn-based? For example, I'm trying to move two fleets together to join them. I get both of the fleets togther, and then I get a message that ""An attack is imminent"" and I can't do anything after that. What happened to it being my turn?Just overall not a well-thought-out game.			"

												I think it's pretty dry.Until you research the technology for each interaction, there isn't much you can do with other species besides declare war. Battles look very impressive, but are extremely repetitive because of their format: 3 rounds in which you select bonuses to give to your ships and watch them duke it out. I found myself auto-completing battles before I finished my first campaign. Example: 


YouTube™ Video: Endless Space - Space Battles 

			Views: 116,180		

			The first section i took from the multi-player game i was playing with Neko. He was not involved in those battles but the Pilgrims declared war on me because my influence was touching their influence...		

There doesn't seem to be enough to do each turn and for a large part of each game, I find myself rapid-fire ending my turn.The galaxy map/solar system map is very well designed and presents available information in fewer screens than any 4x game I've played.			"

												I have semi jokingly renamed this game Endless Waste. Let me explain why.Sure you have fleets in space check. You have planets you can build stuff on check. You can research technologies all check. What they don't tell you is there are plenty of 4x strategy games that accomplish these basics. The question is does this game accomplish it better? My answer is meh..... Yes, meh.......Let me ellaborate. Many people complain of the card system for fleet battles in this game. By way of explanation before one of the three rounds starts you and the A.I must choose a card that fits your strategy. You have many options even starting off and more when you research them. How do they work in actual application? The difference is negligible really. Yeah the right card choice can make a tie a victory and the wrong card choice can make a tie a loss. What it can't do is make superior vessels lose. While i respect this choice for balance's sake it has one major drawback. Space conflict does not require much thought. Planning yes, thought no. TBH the disaster that was MOO3 is better in that sense but not graphically of course. The space battles do look nice.Moving on to planets. Like i said yeah you can build on planets. The way they implement planetary research and production meh.... You can not have individual planetary production queues. I'd be fine with that if it were more like Galactic Civ 3 and you have the option of having a spacedock at every planet producing ships slowly or sending industry to one spacedock. This game does not have that option. Don't take me wrong I am not a Galactic Civ fanboy by any means. IMHO they are mediocre as well for one simple fact. The gaming experience does not evolve that much. Yet this game suffers from that sentiment even more.Moving on to research. Yeah they have research. How do i rate it a tiny bit above meh.... to meeehhhh??.... While on paper the research ideas are good. The way the game implements them is very meh.... This is not the reaserch tree's fault though. It is the planet building and space combat's fault. Those systems make seeing tangible results not so immersive. Which is where Galactic Civ 3 shines and Endless Waste does not. Endless Waste is not very immersive. In Galciv 3 for instance it is surprisingly clear what effect the combat research has in combat. You can watch the missile hit and do damage to another ship. You see the ship catch on fire if it does not have enough Point Defense and the missile is strong enough. In Endless Waste you don't have that. Point defense don't launch lasers or countermeasures etc. Missile impacts don't leave clouds of debris and ships smoking and/or flaming. Making it feel like frankly not much is happening. It becomes quickly boring except through statistics... if you are a statistical person. The same with planetary infrastructure even though TBH the same can be said about that with majority of 4X strategy games including Galactic Civ 3. The major difference is with nothing truly immersive in Endless Waste you don't really feel compelled to keep playing. Your choices simply do not matter except through statistics. So in essence since neither planetray infrastructure or space combat is immersive how can research be immersive? The other two affect the one.Leaving to one last consideration money. Is Endless Waste worth the money? To that I say depends. Let me elaborate. If you love statistics, if you love space and the concept of technologies, if you love that when on sale this is drastically cheaper than Galactic Civ 3 this is for you. For everyone else at most just like myself it's meh... at best.In summary Endless Waste except for the select few is just that an Endless Waste of potential. If they only put in a tiny bit more effort this game would be playable for most of us. Right now not so much. It's too bad because i liked the concept.			"

												Revised my last review and giving a more detailed review of this game.  Verdict still doesn't change, as I think you can buy far better games.First, let's start with the Pro's of this game.- The Cinimatics are nice.- The Soundscore is awesome.- The U.I. is very clean.- Ship design is unique and cool looking.Now, for the long list of Con's.- The A.I. is cheaty and only seems to play one way.- There is no real feeling of exploration.- No visuals of any kind for planetary upgrades.- Limited ship builds which are very basic.- Simple bugs such as destroyed enemy ships warping cinematic never fixed.- Gameplay leaves you longing for more.Basically, this game feels like a good Beta build.  Much of everything is there, but lacks a lot of polish which would make this game exceptional.  The A.I. does not seem to hide the cheaty nature of what normally would be impossible play for a normal player.  Little things such as showing devlopment of planets when you upgrade them, were never added.  Even building your ships have a severe hindrance of being very very basic in design.Many little details leave you feeling like this is an unfinished game.  Small bugs which should have been patched out long ago, like seeing a 'warp away' cinematic even if you destroy all the enemy ships, still remain in this game.  Exploration consists of visiting the next planetary system over, but has left out any other type of 'anomaly' exploration.  (ie. no Blackholes, Vagrant ships, Pulsars, etc.)In the end, with a bit more devlopment, and the addition of just a few things, the game would have improved significantly.  It feels like a format for a game was designed, but a vast majority of content was left out, leaving some nice eye-candy, but nothing filling.I would not recommend this game if you are looking for something long-term... I mean, unless you are interested in playing Multiplayer only, because Single player, the A.I. pulls fleets of ships from nowhere.  Management is minimal and a lot of the game focuses solely on moving ships around and your research tree.  Really, there is no depth here.			"

												ES is all in all not a terrible 4X. You have different races, turn based gameplay and a large tech tree as well as quite a few weapon and module variations for your fleet and ships. However, from my limited time with the game I also have too many more or less negative points I'd like to list:- Faction differences sometimes seem a bit minor. Pretty much all the races play similarly. Ok, with one race you get bonuses for continuously and constantly winning battles. From another race you can't flee in combat. These are all details though and don't really change the general gameplay completely imho. One exception might be the ""Harmony"", the race introduced with the addon, who don't use ""Dust"", one of the resources in the game, and get actually punished for using it. That's a cool concept. Apart from that all other races use exactly the same sort of weapons, modules and ship types. The differences seem mainly in the numbers. Visually the ships look distinct, but they all fulfill the same roles: Corvettes, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships and Dreadnought as well as colony ships and fighters/bombers.- The tech trees are too samey. Ties in with the above point. Even though every race HAS some unique technologies, they don't seem that interesting compared to the huge tech tree. I don't feel diverse enough to be honest. Speaking of the gigantic tech tree. This is divided into 4 sections, I wonder, however, why stronger and better ships require research into a completely different tree than military. Basically you can either invest in better ships or better weapons, but of course you also need research from the other 2 sections to make something even halfway worthwhile. I feel it would have been better to more clearly differentiate the trees into: military (ships, weapons, armor, modules), exploration (engines, wormhole travel, scanning, etc.), colonization (how to make different sorts of planets colonizable, how to improve the living conditions on those planets) and planetary improvements (highways, supermarkets, things adding to production of any resource in general).- The ""exploitation"" mechanic is finicky, if you have to constantly change it for every planet, but can't even see on the overview which planet is being exploited in what way. Maybe I'm just blind.- The fleet battles are generally a mess. These are divided into 3 main sections: long range, medium range and short range. For every section you can choose a ""battle card"" (more can be unlocked via research or your heroes), the effect of which is totally random, since it can be countered by the enemy fleet. Since nobody knows what cards the opposite faction is playing, this is pure luck and can either win you the game or ♥♥♥♥ you over completely. Not to mention that the game doesn't do a good job of actually explaining what the different ships do, how to properly equip them, etc. There is just no feedback in the game. Suddenly your Dreadnought got destroyed by a cruiser with half health and 4 scouts...SCOUTS!!!! And you have no idea why or how that is even possible. So, that's annoying.That is a problem the game has in spades. Since there is no in game wiki, you have to basically look up everything online. Compare this game to Civ 5, in which you have a progressive (albeit boring) tech tree. You can pretty much look at that for 1 minute and know what you're going to do, since everything has a purpose and leads to the next thing. You can leave tech out and focus on what you want to do...either military or economic or cultural or just plain old money or space race. It's easy to get into. Endless Space's tech tree is just a big mess and a beginner has no idea what a good research route looks like. And that doesn't even include the rest of the gameplay, where your empire suddenly collapses, because you have expanded too much and your people are annoyed, and the tech to pacify them is light years away.So, to conclude: ES is decent enough I guess, if you have the time and dedication to spend at least 50 hours figuring out all its internal mechanisms. I hope ES 2 is more newbie friendly and perhaps introduces the individual races in a sort of ""endless"" campaign like they did with Endless Legend. ES 1 just feels to samey for me to invest more time into it and the combat system is too arbitrary for my taste. I want more variation in ships and weapons. Why does a completely organic race use the same weapons as a fleet from Earth or technologically advanced researchers? Why are beam weapons just laser blasts and not actual beams? At least change the colour of some weapons...and give different races different support craft. Maybe organic suicide bombers. Spore launchers. And also boarding torpedoes. The sky is the limit.			"

Too Complicated For My Liking, Steep Learning Curve I'm going to start off by saying this is not a review. This Is a suggestion that you try to find a demo or some way to play the game before you buy it. I have not played this game nearly enough to review it, This could be a really good game, There are certainly solid design ideas and game mechanics but... I'm really doubting that I'll be able to get into it. Allow me to explain. In a game like civ 5, my experience has been that while there is strategic depth to be had, its not forced on you. I was able to pick up the concepts of civ 5 fairly quick, and I didn't have the feeling that I needed to understand everything to play the game. This game was precisely the opposite. I was so completely overwhelmed in the tutorial by the sheer number of screens, boxes, information tabs, icons, phases, etc, that I quit the game out of frustration because I felt like I was retaining almost none of the information dumped upon me. Add to that the fact that almost every tab background was the same semi-transparent grey box making them all look fairly similar and the unnessary complication of the  renaming of game concepts like money and resources to things like ""dust"" and ""FIDS"", and it's pretty clear to me that there were plenty of things that could have been made so much simpler without any real loss in depth. To fans of the game, Please don't misunderstand me. I'm sure its a terrific game. I wanted to enjoy it as much as anyone else, but I have neither an extraordinary amount of patience nor a fantastic memory, and I feel like one of those things is required to enjoy this game.			"

												Honestly? It's not very good. The UI is decent, but the tech tree is confusing and takes a long time to understand how tech relates to gameplay. The tutorial is slow and takes a some going over again and again to fully grasp. It's basically Civizilation in space, but worse.I wish it were different, but damn.			"

Short version:--If you're expecting Master of Orion 2, skip this title.  Ship designs and combat are lacking, and turns take too long.--If you're expecting Sid Meier's Civilization: In Space, get this title.  There are more likenesses to Civilization than any other game I can think of.Long version:I put over 20 hours into this game, and played three games.  I picked it up after checking the resoundingly positive reviews, hoping it'd be something it wasn't.PROS:-A well made game.  This is not some Flash or iPhone game that got ported.  A lot of work and love was put into its creation.-Diverse techtree and upgrade paths let you pick which way you want to develop.-Multiple win conditions, (even though it eventually veers towards enemy battleships coming to take you down when the game tells on you for being close to victory)CONS:-Steep learning curve, laden with pages upon pages of text in tutorials that overwhelm the new player with information they are unlikely to remember or make use of when it is explained.-Game prone to freezes and crashes.-Game ends before you're ready.  ""Oh, you captured MOST of the population.  we'll just take it as read that you won.  Good game!  Have a title screen!""-Nuances of combat can be incredibly frustrating.  ""Enemy fleet occupying your system, and you want to make them run?  Attack!  Oh.  They retreated?  That's cool, too.  ... ... but why are they still in my system? >_>""  This can go on for several turns before you figure out what's causing it, or how to stop it.-Combat is too simple, and you don't even get to play it.  You pick three ""cards"" for three phases of combat, then sit back and watch it play out (Or more realistically, Auto through it).-Balance in combat leaves a bit to be desired.  ""Pack 9001 beams onto a ship, and use cards that amplify beam efficacy"" tends to trump a diversely equipped spaceship.-Race picks for custom races are oddly specific, and awkwardly costed.  ""The Price of Beauty"" does not automatically spark in my brain ""Oh, that must mean ""increased ship costs"", right?  And the 30 point pick (nearly half your base pick points), Tolerant, is a pick designed to allow for quick expansion before necessary colonizing techs have been researched, but the morale drawbacks quickly overpower that bonus.  However, the 10 point cost ""Optimistic"" gives a system wide morale bonus, which directly translates into more resources, both early and late.			"

												Looks pretty. You think 4x, you think dialogues, dramatic events, strange new places. This doesn't have any of that. The research trees don't tell you what stuff does. There is no real way to change your development. The tech trees for weapons don't appear to change anything. Ship combat is reduced to some strange rock paper scissor mechanic that is never explained. I'm assuming to play this the devs expected you to read a large instruction manual, read every technology, and know what space rock, scissor, and paper looks like by instinct. If you wanted Star Control, this is not even close. It is a race to the biggest rock, paper, or scissors of doom. Darned if I care which is which. I got if for a dollar and I still wouldn't recommend this. You play for 3 hours, then the bots crush all your planets, hopes, and dreams in a few turns.Honestly, there are Facebook games with stronger mechanics and tactics. Endless is my disappointment.   "

I like this game and would recommend it, if the game did not fataly crash about 100 turns into 30-50% of my games. (Index out of Range error).      The AI also seems to pile up on planet choke points in the spiral maps. I have seen 2-4 AI players (8 player game) with 10+ fleets each all sitting on one planet doing nothing.  This can be exploited for training a fleet commander of by bypassing a large segment of an enemys fleets and attacking rear planets.			"

												Should be called Endless Cr*p or as a friend calls it Endless Boredom. All you do is wait for research and colonize. Tutorial pretty much sux, you just have to learn it as you play.It seems that the AI has unlimited resources and is only interested in fighting you. You have to actually research diplomancy, like cease fire. Only 1 game did I not get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked on easy level. How you supposed to learn a game when the AI just walks all over you constantly.One senario I had 20 systems (every planet colonized), AI had 4 (with 1 or 2 planets colonized) and yet managed to keep up with me in research and it had way more ships then me. Which meant it only builds ships and nothing else. I had the AI blocked in, attacked a planet with my 25 ship fleet (cruisers and battleships)  and then all of a sudden it was pumping out 25 ships (corvets initially,  then cruisers and battleships) per turn. Just walked all over me, since I couldn't keep up in ship production, since my ships take anywhere from 4-20 turns to build, depending on improvements. I did manage to capture 1 system, and yet it had no improvments at all.I also don't like how you capture systems, evey ship can be used to capture a system. You don't have troops, bombs or anything like that. Just move a ship into a enemy system and it can capture it. Ofcourse the bigger the fleet, that faster it can capture a system. I had ships defending a neutral system, meaning any enemy ship entering that system was supposed to be attack immediately. Yet that didn't happen, AI just shot right past them. Didn't even notice it until it was too late.I should mention that everyone has exactly the same research options. There's no unique research for different races.Even though systems have multiple planets, you only build as a system. Six planets and you can still only build as a system, why even have multiple planets in a system if you can't build individualy on each?THere is  an approval rating, but I can never keep it in the green, no matter how much you try. Frankly I just ignore it, doesn't seem to have any affect on thing. Went 60 turns with a zero approval rating in many of my systems, it didn't slow anything down.Lots of thingss I still don't understand about the game and never will, it just gets boring and it frustrates the sh*t out of you.The most annoying bug in the game is that all of a sudden in every system everything takes 999 turns to build, meaning you will never build anything again. Happens randomly, earilest was on turn 20, latest was on turn 70. I clicked forward a couple of turn to see if it clears up, it didn't and I quit that game. Haven't been able to complete a game yet.I quit playing this months ago, thought I'd try it and it's still a pile of sh*t.			"

												Fun for 10 hours.Buggy and AI loops creating a milking scenarios. Was winning a game on hard until AI started running fleets into one of my systems. They'd attack and immediately retreat, exausting my fleets moves. Was unable to attack them on the retreat. This meant they could sit siege weapons on the system unharmed; unable to attack them, unable to attack any other fleets.Cynamitics were cool at first. Until you figure out it's the same sequence every time.Ship building is fun in the beginning. But you start to realise how limited your options are. There are only 2 kinds of ships in the end; war ships and siege ships. You can't diversify your war ships because you can't choose who's on the front-line in space. Meaning, the only diversity you'l have in your fleet is between your upgraded units and your older units. Medium range and short range weapons are worthless so load up on medium and short range defense and stack long range attack.The game feels a little spread thin. What is there is good but after 10 hours you feel like you've seen it all.In summary: Very fun in the beginning but eventually loses it's charm. Good buy on a steam 80% off deal but don't buy at full price. With that said, Ill probably play another 5 hours of this.			"

												Making a well-balanced X4 is really hard.Endless Space gets a lot right -- a rich technology tree, interesting ship equipment options, strategic decisions in a lot of places that fit nicely together at a macroscopic level, and some eye-candy to stick it all together. Yet, it failed to convince me. The story felt too shallow, the worlds too unpersonal, and the interactions with the AI too simple. Most surprisingly, research felt linear and boring, as each new technology was found within 1~2 turns, which took away all the excitement and anticipation.Playing with friends would probably alleviate a lot of these critics. But for single-player, it just didn't work me up like Freeciv. Not a bad game, but not enticing enough for me to recommend.			"

												I was pretty gungho for a new 4x game. I mean who doesn't love homeworld or sins of a solar empire eh?I bought the early access emporer edition and decided to wait till it became a full release. At the time of writting the expansion/dlc has come out so its been a good while since they've patched issues.I booted up the game and got into playing the United Empire. I was expecting some awesome ship battles and wide colony expansion. I went into the game on easy mode. Since this is a 4x game I thought, like most good 4x games that gameplay would be self intuitive. Turns out I was wrong. First time you enter the game you are greeted by walls of text and diagrams for a ""tutorial"" You spend the first 50 turns figuring out the game and wondering why your score is miserably behind. 100 turns later you lose to an economic vitory by the computer player to which there is nothing you can do about it. ♥♥♥♥ing lovely for an ""easy"" mode.The ship battles are lame. The fleets line up and take pop shots at each other with 3 different kinds of weapons. The only in battle abilities come from these cards you play that makes the whole battle feel like rock paper scisors. It offers nothing of the joy that you get from games like homeworld or Sins. You have some customization options but again the game poorly explains that too so you also spend the first 50 turns wondering why the destroyer you just researched is no where to be found. in the end instead of mixed fleets you end up with 2 types of fleets. First one consists of mini missle boats whose objective and sole purpose is to take out the second fleet type. The second fleet type consists of your most high tiered ship armed with as many defenses and singular guns as possible. Nothing else is viable.The few guides I managed to find on this game barely give any point in the right direction. Also it seems that according to the community that the game is very unbalaced and also ""anti-human"", as in no human race faction is competitve against the other races in any sense. The different races barely offer any true difference in gameplay, just different focuses. If that doesn't turn you off then the diplomacy text boxesthat feel like they were written by a twelve year old will...Finally and what REALLY turned me off is the random events that occur in game that only affect the human player. What's this? A deadly plague that offers you 3 options to go screw yourself with? Ok you think to yourself, if this will hamper me then surely the computer is having a hard time too. 20 turns later the computer is double your score with advanced tech and ships and you got NOTHING. Yep thats balanced...If you want a ""good"" 4x experience then lok else where. You like the whole ""civilization"" style? Look elsewhere too. Feel like playing a medocre 4x game? Play this alongside sword of the stars 2 and the other crappy 4x titles. Do yourself a favor and put your time toward better things.			"

												Nice game. Complex, but not that hard-to-master 4X turn-based game like I was expecting for quite some time. The AI is quite challenging, even if plagued with some consistent bug (they still keep invading systems without siege power, AFAIK), and there's a really excellent interface that allows you to quickly manage even a vast space empire. Space combat is quite basic, and very different if compared to Master of Orion 2 (if you don't know what I'm talking about, consider it as the current standard for this kind of games): no more ship direct controlo nor tactical combat, simply choose your tactics and watch the video. This is NOT necessarily bad, mind you: it's a game more focused on strategic empire management than ship micromanagement, and it's quite great at it. Still, you can't shrug off the feeling that MoO2 was more complete and immersive, and that's a shame because ES had every card to strip Master of Orion of his crown.			"

												If you want Civ 4 in space, buy it. Otherwise don't bother.Graphics are nice but barely ever seen.90% of the game is administration of dots with lines in between them whether it's the map screen and the dots are solar systems or the solar system map and the dots are planets or the research screen and the dots are technologies urgh. Large games get slow super fast - not graphically but logistically - as the AI and yourself begins to do more. Late game combat is huge numbers of ships divided into fleets of limited size all attacking each other one by one to see who wins (just like Civ 4). That said if you like Civ 4 and don't mind the lategame grind (unless you rush culture etc) and the fact that the combat in this is about as interactive as the combat in Civ 4 (Attack this - oh♥♥♥♥♥♥you're dead. Lets hope one of the 19 other units just like you eventually wins) then you'll get along well with this.So reccomended just be warned. The pretty screenshots are less than 10% of the game. Most of it is admin. Admin with a good soundtrack, interesting lore, nicely balanced but feeling difference races and racial ships etc.			"

												Best space 4X game I've played since GalCiv 2. My only major complaint is the AI, it's terrible. Even on normal difficulty the AI gets artificial boosts to make them ""competitive"" with the player. The combat system is different, basically rock paper scissors. Everything counters 1 other card (resulting in a boost), and is countered by one. I was pleasantly surprised to see the AI seems to learn from the system and adapts its strat around your habits.			"

												(There is no return policy that I know or pre-demo of this game. This is why I am writing this review.( Edit..I have played Multi and changed my views on the product. )---------------------------------Edit... i would rate this game 6/10 now do to the Multi player content and recomend it as a buy now...the following is the old view based on the solo game.This game is built for multi players as a ""board game"" it is not a traditional computer game.------------------------------ oldI expected real time combat when I bought this game.  what I got was a Master of Orion Clone from 1995.  But in MOO there was REAL Combat for ship to ship. Endless Space  ""Ship to Ship Combat""  is an ""Art Board""... An 'auto computer feed', 100% true combat in Endless Space is  two pictures of ships ...? blinking ?...  at each other in combat. Like Chrismas lights on a Holiday Tree.This is a flash game... 2d..., Yes flat screen...  it is pasted on a windows wall paper back drop of some stars. The game play looks like a child's dot to dot coloring book.The Music loops and I with in the 1st 30 minutes I turned sound to Mute.I thank God that it was a 75% off buy.    If I knew what i was getting into for the 8$ I dropped on this game I would been ""OK"" with it. But the video is a pure fraud of real game play, No video I watched has anything Truthful about game play.  However, I love space games and will put up with a lot. This game does not meet the standers of a game made in 1995 MOO2.It is an... ""OK game"" ... for the 75% off sale... but i expected more I am sorry.  I will play it more but I am not thrilled about it. I am sorry to the makers of this game for this comment, but, your combat system was totally lacking in content and was poor.Good points about this game.  It is streamless game play so that can click the button and it will warn you about tasks not done. The ""Sim City"" part of this game is limited, so you can play it and not be forced to micro manage it. The planet are beautiful, the Music is lovely but limited, the pictures and art is lovely.  It is worth 8$ not 30$.i give it a <Edit (6/10).  I can  recommend this game  on sale for 75% off.  Then I will say it is worth the buy.>You should Look at Youtube for real game play before you make a buy here. It might or might not be to your taste. This is more of a Board game from real life then a computer game.			"

												This game is a fantastic space alternative to Civ V. I personally love Civ V but just became bored of it after a while because I felt it was too cluttered and it really annoyed me for some reason. Endless Space has so much to offer but at the same time the UI is one of cleanest I have ever used. It is fairly simple to get into as I felt I knew the mechanics very well after just a few hours of playing the game. Also, the graphics are extraordinary in my opinion. I don't feel like any of the battles could graphically be any more polished (besides some variation in ship positions, which would make them feel less repetitive). Overall I strongly reccommend this game and I think you are a fool to not buy it at its current sale price ($7.49). If strategy games are one of your favorite genres, I can guarantee you will enjoy this one!			"

												This game provides hours of fun. It doesn't matter if you already are familiar with 4Xish space strategy games or not. For those old master of orion veterans, there is much to love and to complain about which will keep you testing and enjoying for weeks. Coming to this kind of gameplay newly, this is the best introduce you might get. For me everything what might be boring about this genre is tweaked so nicely. Every game start feels promising and encouraging. The turn based concept makes it perfect for chilled gaming sessions alone.pros:- lore and story, for me as a fan of scifi: everything fits fine and interacts well with the different races/backgrounds- intuitive user interface (for real maybe the best thing 4x-turn-based experienced the last 10 years)- ship builder- easy to track influences on game mechanics - and thus favourable to learn and understand the game- extends the classic gameplay slightly but all so impactful- leaves out overaged mechanics- game pricecons:- turn based, games with extended turn number will take for ever, not recommended for multiplayer, but it never was with this kind of games- fighting can be disappointing, because influences are not that clear and heroes overwhelm any strategy choices			"

												 This is one heck of a Turn based strategy game. Its on par with Civ 5 in my opinion. Just exchange the numerous different cultures you can play in Civ with a great back story and some interesting alien ""races"". As with all new strategy titles there is a small learning curve, and depending on what race you play as will affect what playstyle and type of victory you will probably go for. Multiplayer and singleplayer, and to be completely fair I haven't even messed around with any of the features just been playing a couple of the single player games.  So if strategy games are your thing, get this. I think Endless Space will become a title just as known as Civilization, Star Craft, and Command and Conquer.			"

												If you like 4x games then this one is a solid game, although lacking in character. There are a number of alien races, though most are just different human factions. They each have rich details backstories, and the game continues to give you more snippets of a larger story as it plays out. Combat is atypical, being more of a dice-roll and technology competition than any actual strategy. You design your ships (each race has a series of different ship platforms that range in size and function, but they all look basically the same, which was a disappointment), and then choose 3 ""cards"". The cards give you bonuses, and can cancel out your opponents 3 cards if  you're lucky, and you can get access to new cards through unlocking technologies. The tech tree is massive and interesting, with detaild lore-filled descriptions of each technology. The game is fun overall, but after a while becomes very bland. Most factions feel very similar to eachother, and with the way invasion and system-capture works, wars can become extremely drawn out affairs. The computer AIs are easily exploited via the diplomacy screen by offering trades that require large ammounts of gold per turn from them in exchange for resoruces or luxuries. They will accept the deal (with a few one-time payments of dust, technology, or whatever else you want), and cancel it the next turn when they can't afford the price, giving you any one-time payments they agreed to for free. The other issue the game suffers from is a lack of clarity. I still haven't figured out what food does, and why I should bother getting more than the bare minimum on my planets, but the technology tree is littered with farming improvements. Compared to games like Masters of Orion II, or Space Empires IV, ES is very pretty and interesting, but a little too much like a spreadsheet rather than a game. If you like 4x you'll enjoy it for a while, but don't spend more than 5 bucks on this one.			"

												Endless Space is quite a fun game too play. If you expect the depth of a Civilisation title you'll better don't get it. But is has some of it within. There is a great tech tree, some neat mechanics and a great Ship Modification System. Playtime of a full set of course depends on how many enemies and which difficulty you choose. I really, really like to give some big props to the Developers, because it's beautifully designed and nice and clean to play. These things really make me want to check out the Endless Dungeons Title from them. So in conclusion; In case you search some turnbased strategy in space and you don't want to get all too deep into the Civilisations thing - get it. The first 30min are preserved to get into the game, but I'm sure almost everyone will actually get into it after these minutes of training. Speaking of training, there is only a textbased Tutorial which covers about 85% of the mechanics basics. But, for me, it was enought to figure out the rest of the gameplay. What is sad, is that the multiplayer (at least the public one) is almost dead. About 2 to max. 3 Games are going on, whenever I log in. So you'd better pick your friends and start a nice game. :)			"

												Endless Space is to the 4X space strategy genre what Civilization is to real time strategy games. An extensive tech tree and custom ship designs leave lots of room for variety, and as the game progresses these factors force changes in tactics to keep players on their toes. The expansion and colonisation system is remarkably good, and even with dozens of worlds to manage the beautifully simple UI ensures it is never a chore. Combat may not be to the taste of everyone, however. A very hands off affair, the player chooses cards to establish their tactics in a three-turn battle, and then it plays out itself. For those who love real-time battles this could be a turn off, for those of us who prefer combat to be less of a distraction it''s a godsend. For me personally, Endless Space has rendered all other 4X games obsolete.			"

As a person that has played quite a bit of this game, I do have a specific gripe however. When one gets to the point that he starts to control many solar systems, the management of those systems is very time consuming and repetetive in nature. From my playthrough's, this is a signficant issue that severely diminishes the fun of late-game Endless Space.Otherwise, I adore this game and absolutely recommend it.			"

Even on normal difficulty the AI gets artificial boosts to make them ""competitive"" with the player. The combat system is different, basically rock paper scissors. Everything counters 1 other card (resulting in a boost), and is countered by one. I was pleasantly surprised to see the AI seems to learn from the system and adapts its strat around your habits.			"

												(There is no return policy that I know or pre-demo of this game. This is why I am writing this review.( Edit..I have played Multi and changed my views on the product. )---------------------------------Edit... i would rate this game 6/10 now do to the Multi player content and recomend it as a buy now...the following is the old view based on the solo game.This game is built for multi players as a ""board game"" it is not a traditional computer game.------------------------------ oldI expected real time combat when I bought this game.  what I got was a Master of Orion Clone from 1995.  But in MOO there was REAL Combat for ship to ship. Endless Space  ""Ship to Ship Combat""  is an ""Art Board""... An 'auto computer feed', 100% true combat in Endless Space is  two pictures of ships ...? blinking ?...  at each other in combat. Like Chrismas lights on a Holiday Tree.This is a flash game... 2d..., Yes flat screen...  it is pasted on a windows wall paper back drop of some stars. The game play looks like a child's dot to dot coloring book.The Music loops and I with in the 1st 30 minutes I turned sound to Mute.I thank God that it was a 75% off buy.    If I knew what i was getting into for the 8$ I dropped on this game I would been ""OK"" with it. But the video is a pure fraud of real game play, No video I watched has anything Truthful about game play.  However, I love space games and will put up with a lot. This game does not meet the standers of a game made in 1995 MOO2.It is an... ""OK game"" ... for the 75% off sale... but i expected more I am sorry.  I will play it more but I am not thrilled about it. I am sorry to the makers of this game for this comment, but, your combat system was totally lacking in content and was poor.Good points about this game.  It is streamless game play so that can click the button and it will warn you about tasks not done. The ""Sim City"" part of this game is limited, so you can play it and not be forced to micro manage it. The planet are beautiful, the Music is lovely but limited, the pictures and art is lovely.  It is worth 8$ not 30$.i give it a <Edit (6/10).  I can  recommend this game  on sale for 75% off.  Then I will say it is worth the buy.>You should Look at Youtube for real game play before you make a buy here. It might or might not be to your taste. This is more of a Board game from real life then a computer game.			"

												I really enjoy this game. It is a lot like Civilization except the obvious fact that it is space. There is A LOT of micromanagment in this game. Also, the combat system is kind of wierd but you get used to it. But overall, I recommend this game if you like turn based strategy and spacey themed.			"

												It was fun at first, as this type of games tend to be. Just colonising worlds to find resources and building your empire of peaceful robots dedicating their lives to science. And spaceships, you can't forget the spaceships.What sucked the fun for me? The AI. After a while playing it would send message that reads something like: ""Oh you're doing too well. This means war!"" and then proceeds to spam you with every ship it has. As a guy, who likes to do things peacefully, exploring and building colonies instead of warships, I find this very irritating.The micromanagemend is also tedious. Your solar system has six planets, but you still can't build more than one improvement at once.			"

												Absolutely addicting. I'm not sure that I'm a very good gamer. Some games like warcraft III or Civilization IV I try to play on the normal difficulty and I get stomped. This game though I think I'm able to win on the normal difficulty. It could be though that the AI are really dumb, but I'll take what I can get.It's poorly documented. I kept accidentally right clicking out of the tutorials and the combat tutorial didn't pause the combat. In order to find out how to do things like queue technologies and make a custom travel path you can do a bit of googling though and find the FAQ or some discussion and figure it out.			"

												EDITED: Since installing dishonored, the game no longer starts. Might be something to do with all the updates, but have tried all the usual forums and fixes and nothing. So dissapointed, and as usual can't get my money back.ORIGINAL: This game is too hard. Regardless of settings, unless you're a master strategist and/or know strategy games inside out, you just can't beat it. It's really annoying, because i really like what this game offers i.e. good gameplay at the start, nice 3d environment and solar systems, ship design, tech research etc.... but then it spoils it when you're nice little growing solar systems are overrun with enemies every time. Yes i get that it's seemingly a more serious game than most strategy games (which it doesn't really communicate in the listing), but when i pay ~£20 for a game i want to be able to at least use one mode of that normal folk can use. Other than the difficulty issue, its a really good game.			"

												This game, this game. Probably has one of the better tech trees and economies I've seen in a 4X game. Extremely solid on both sides that keeps you guessing pretty handily. The combat is insanely beautiful, but gets rather...stale early on and the campaign map, if you will, is sparse and extremely disappointing. No ability to see the planets, and everything is basically a circle with a line to each other really took it down a notch for me. The differing races and how they effect the map is very well done, so I would recommend this game to those who aren't too choosy on presentation of a map and care more about balancing economy/pretty combat.

												It takes time, it takes patience, and it takes a willingness to lose. But if you put these 3 key ingrediants into this game it'll start to connect. Aside from very silly game bugs (like having a just-captured system take only one turn to reconquer on either side), there isn't much to complain about. Expect to be a little flustered however, because this game has an intricate tech tree and unique game mechanics. These will leave in the dust a little bit, so start your first game on an easier game setting. But aside from that, this game offers an enriching strategical environment in which you can truly show your guff and mettle on an interstellar level.			"

												The game has so much potential but falls to the floor on the technical aspect :( I picked up this game hoping it was going to get me back to the feeling of playing Orion, but it left me dissappointed. The game itself is build on the same bricks, pick your prefabricated race or design your own. Colonize first the system you find yourself on, and then expand out to the known universe while building you science, economy and not least your army!But while Orion had a smooth learning curve and an intuitive research grid, Endless Space gives you nothing on which direction you want to go. Just random discoveries that tell you nothing. You want to be able to invade your neighbors? well you have to guess on what research you need. You want to bring down maintenance cost? Good luck. You want to research bombers? Go for it, but unfortunately you will then learn that you haven't researched the resources actually needed to build it....The game might have become enjoyable to play after 4 or 5 runs when you have learned what the various things do, and you can be expected to be able to formulate a strategy. Unfortunately the game then throws you another curveball in that saves after about 100 turns tend to be corrupt, and you then have to restart the game before you actually have learned what you need to make sure the next run will be more fun...Don't buy this game unless you feel like having a discussion about why you feel you have wasted your time and money!

												I have played this game again and I changed my thought about it so I will rewrite my review.Endless Space is a strategy game that plays in space. (duhh)Your objective is colonize planets and discover other races and wage war with them.The tutorial is useless and I had to search most things on my phone and that's not what I want, I want to play the damn game!I must say that the graphics are average, sometimes the game looks good, but sometimes it doesn't.Singleplayer:It looks a bit like Civilization 5 but then downgraded...Especially with battles between ships, we all expect Star Wars like battles but instead, you get a cutscene, which is boring.Overall the game is pretty boring and it's just really hard to like the game and believe me, I tried to like it...There is one thing the game does very well and that's the resarch, you have 4 different research types and you kinda need to choose which one you want to concentrate on.Multiplayer:I couldn't find any match, it's totally DEAD!I also want to mention that this game eats RAM for me so if you have 4GB of RAM, you might want to reconsider buying it.Final verdict:The game does some things well, but it's just boring, boring and boring :(I give it a 4/10.

The problem is that the in-game options available to you are limitlessly deep, but there is almost no supporting information about how to implement those choices into a coherent strategy.

												Endless Space is best summed up as 'Civilization in Space'. Multiple victory types, strategic gameplay, massively stupid AI. But Endless Space somehow manages to do combat even worse than Civ. Think about that for a second: Civ's combat was pretty bad. One unit per square, chunky movement, and penalties for even thinking about building a large, war-minded empire.Endless Space's combat is even worse than that.Every fight is rock-paper-scissors. Literally. Didn't guess the correct defense for your opponent's offense? You lose. Parity of offense and defense? Nothing at all happens. Add to this an annoying, time-consuming ""card"" system that adds ANOTHER layer of roshambo and you have the most annoying combat system ever encountered in gaming. Combat invariably boils down either to turtling or kamikaze attacks.It can be a fun game and has a unique setting, but if you're looking for any kind of smooth, interesting, or even just functional combat system, you should look elsewhere.Edit after achievement hunting: If you're the type that enjoys getting all the achievements in a game, you'll be dismayed - as I was - to find that Endless Space has many hidden achievements. They are nearly all incredibly difficult to get. Not challenging, mind you. They just take hours and hours of grind, luck, and AI decisions randomly working in your favor. Annoying and not worth the time.			"

												I'm a big fan of the 4X genre, but not all of them can be a Civilization. In fact, this feels way too much like the disastrous Master of Orion III, a game that spent most of the time playing itself. I didn't feel like I understood the consequences of choices in the game at all, especially technology selection. Despite being able to pick up the basics in a tutorial, it took watching a few community videos to start trying to get the hang of it. In contrast, Galactic Civilizations II was immediately familiar and easy to figure out from my many hours of playing MOO II.If you have the patience to really invest in learning the game, you might be rewarded for it. Personally, I think there's 4X space games much more deserving of your dollars.			"

												Don't waste your money! I don't know why but for some reason, a decent amount of people seem to like the Endless Brand.  I bought both Endless games because of the reviews BUT, like Endless Legend, Endless Space is boring, clunky and just plain uniteresting. If you buy this game, do not expect an epic space battle like the ending of Mass Effect 3. In fact do not expect some sort of control over war affairs that you would expect in a 4X game. While it did provide the 4 ""x's"", it doesn't offer a complex gameplay that players wanted and expected in a 4X game. Playing this game is like playing a facebook game. It felts like a point and click game. There is no such thing as a micromanagement. What they have is not enough. For example, you can't micromanage your Spaceships apart from making a fleet or ""pimping them up"". You can't even group up fleets to better defend yourself from a strong enemy. The battle scene is quite sad! You are literally watching a 60 second clip where the ship move to one direction while the other is right behind them.  There is not a lot of options you can choose from during a battle except for selecting ""Battle Cards"" which if you play the game for quite some time, it gets pretty boring and repititive. The ship design is unimaginative piece of crap. Also, upgrading a ship changes the stats but not the appearance which can really break focus on the game. You may think that since you can pimp your ship that the apperance would look different but that is not the case. The battle animation is lack luster. Like I said, you don't even have any control of the movement of the fleet or try a daring strategy. The planets and systems are quite boring. There is no lore to them and you don't even feel any sort of feeling of belonging towards your empire. If you are looking for a decent sim space/4x game, check out Sins of the Solar Empire.			"

Graphics, sound, and music are AAA worthy.  The UI approaches perfection.   Fleet battles, cleverly handled in real time, are cinematic while allowing tactical stratagems by playing maneuver ""cards"":  This keeps multiplayer combat very brisk, allows you to influence tactics, yet lets you sit back and enjoy the 60 sec interactive yet cinematic custcene (detractors, imho, are dead wrong).   Sure, a few oddities, but....No one has gotten this close to space strategy since Microprose in ~1998.   This studio nailed it.			"

												Speaking as a former gaming journalist and gamer who's had MOO2 installed on every PC he's ever owned since it was published, I don't think people have been fair to this game. It's belongs in the 8s, not the 7s, IMO.As many have said. It's pretty.Something not many have said is that the UI is uncharacteristically strong for the genre, which is something I especially appreciate now that I write UI rather than game reviews for a living.Most importantly, it scratches the MOO itch like nothing else has for me to date . I tried but could never really get into Gal Civ. SoTs was heaps of fun while it lasted but not really a similar enough experience to satisfy the same cravings. More than any other 4X sci-fi game I've played to date, Endless comes closest to the MOO2 experience not because it's trying too hard  as a me-too game, but because deep in the roots of Endless's game design, you can see that its designers really understand a lot of the critical aspects of what made that game fun (and even some of the things it could have done better).There's definitely some stuff that I wish was different of course.For instance, the best terraforming tech is way too far up the tech tree. By the time you've come close to perfecting all of your worlds, the AI will be threatening to clobber you with one of many non-eXterminating victories if you haven't all but stomped it into near oblivion at that point. Enjoying the role of magitech one-climate-world planetologist as much as I have in many games over the years, it bummed me out a little but I haven't tried fiddling with the settings that slow the game's pace down yet.To be fair, however, there's plenty of planet-tinkering to be done and the game takes the stances that there really should be no useless planets. Asteroids bring unique system improvement opportunities. A certain hero gives insanely beefy boosts to gas giants which give the strongest resource boosts per colonist but to a high degree of specialty and with a very low max pop. Barren and volcano worlds suck for the reasons they typically do but can actually boost their specialty resource production higher than more ideal equivalents once a given system can afford the unhappy colonist hit.For the most part, upgrades are system-wide (which makes high world count systems extremely desirable since most resource-boosting improvements are per-colonist) but each planet can also have an ""exploitation"" built for it which essentially gives an added boost in one of the resource types with additional boosts for specific planet types.Resource balancing is pretty unobtrusive. If one of the four resource units isn't in enough supply you'll notice in the form of things not happening as fast as you would like them to rather than disaster. No food means zero pop growth, rather than starvation, for instance. I'm a little dizzy at times so I appreciate this. I also like that the game won't let you end a turn without research selected as there are a ton of topics and research can move pretty fast.Happiness is the thing you have to really think about or risk being punished for it. Colonists dislike excessive expansion. They can actually get grumpy at you for overpopulation and excessive expansion at the same time (uncanny realism for the human-originating factions, IMO). This effectively eliminates colony-spamming as the one-true-colonizing strategy, making it better to focus not just on quality systems at first but on where you're colonizing them due to the game's zone of influence mechanic, which is basically a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on/flag-planting mechanic where colonies sprout faction territory zones after (arbitrary perhaps, but it works) 30 turns. Zones grow and push each other and you can't colonize inside another faction's  zone, which forces a lot of interesting strategic decisions and requires thinking about colonization rather than Zerging it.I actually like the AI for the most part. The only thing I'm still on the fence about is the fact that a faction will sometimes go to war on you because your score is getting too high. I kind of wish I could turn that off because that makes the AI opponents feel more like simulations of not-very-smart human opponents than simulations of other alien factions but that brings me to a point I really love about the AI. I know that the AI declared war on me for that reason because THE GAME TOLD ME. It's possible the AI will go to war on you for stupid reasons, but never for ""no reason"" as the most helpful review to date reports. The game tells you why the AI did what it did. All you have to do is read the event report and it usually makes sense.The other thing that's fun about the AI is that it isn't stingey and it knows when to quit.  When an AI faction declares war on you and you immediately start gobbling up its colonies like popcorn it will offer you several systems to get you to stop in the hastily offered surrender agreement. It's a nice change from those cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to hock their antimissile rockets for your Xentronium armor for the 20th time in a game or having to conquer 3/4 of their entire empire before they'll even consider peace.It's still terribly stupid when it comes to evaluating circumstances like the fact that every ship in your considerably smaller armada has 4 layers of kinetic shielding and beam weapons and every ship in its fleets has kinetic weapons and zero beam shielding but I wouldn't have it any other way. Punishing that kind of stupid is fun.Combat and ship design were satisfying enough for me, but could use more nuance and there's essentially no tactics. There are three weapon types that each work best at a certain range/phase of battle. Each has a counter defense. Weapons and defenses can be added in quantity at their respective hardpoints. There are a variety of support and special modules but most serve to add fixed modifiers to that essential formula (fighters and bombers being an exception). So design is really around offense vs. the defense and what the AI is likely to be fielding (hint: mostly kinetic in the early game).Fights consist of setting targeting priorities and special power cards to play for three phases/ranges of battles that can cancel other player's cards out if they're of the right category and then hitting ""manual"" to watch the fight play it or ""auto"" if you feel safe not watching a different algorithm sort the battle out, potentially killing ships that would otherwise be nigh impregnable in a watched battle.As I said, satisfying enough and I like the cards better in practice than I did on paper. Hero levelling and tech unlock fairly interesting ones and they won't overturn a major disadvantage. But I prefer gadgets and a wide variety of weaponry with quirks and unique behavior within a given type. There's no clever gyro-destabilizer/tractor beam combos to be had here and absolutely no thought to be put into whether you want the next level of kinetic, beam, or missile weapon because it's just bettter and there's really only one upgrade path for each. I definitely hope we get something more tactical and varied if there's an ES2 as this is one of the few spots I felt the game overstreamlined things.One thing that impressed me on the other hand is the way they handled custom factions. ES has MOO's faction detailed individuality cake (granular stuff like research specialties and other races they liked/hated) and eats MOO2's customization too by giving each of the established factions a faction affinity that's a sort of template of specialized abilities, tech tree options and diplomatic dispositions that are decoupled from a fairly detailed point-buy system and whatever appearance you choose.Any criticism aside, this game is a very solid addition to the genre with a lot of good ideas. It may not have the 1000+ hours longevity like MOO2 has had for me but it might have MOO1's and I fully expect to get a lot of play out of it.			"

												I absolutely love this game! Though it holds some similarities with Spore and the Harmony faction reminds me of the crystal species from Stargate SG-1. If you have a lot of time on your hands or enjoy games that take a long time then this is the game for you. A nice turn based strategy game that gives you a 4 branched skill tree, with every species having their own special skills. Maps can be tiny to huge! I love that you can pick  the type of galaxy you play in and being able to make your own faction. Ship building is very complex though you cant actually design a ship but you can add or remove components to change the function of a ship. Space battles are, in my opinion, really awesome! At the beginning of the encounter you pick a counter measure for each of the 3 phases and then either click Automatic or Manual. Automatic does a quick battle showing health bars and what not. Manual on the other hand goes through a cinematic of the attacking fleet coming out of warp near the defending fleet, and then the battle begins. Some counter measures will cancel the other fleets out and some will allow both to be used. Depending on your faction you have to keep your populations happy or they will go on strike. Many factors such as anomolies on planets, overpopulation, and expanding too fast through out the galaxy all play apart in population happiness.  You can terraform planets to your needs and discover ancient technologies made by the mysterious Endless.			"

												Best space 4X game I've played since GalCiv 2. My only major complaint is the AI, it's terrible. Even on normal difficulty the AI gets artificial boosts to make them ""competitive"" with the player. The combat system is different, basically rock paper scissors. Everything counters 1 other card (resulting in a boost), and is countered by one. I was pleasantly surprised to see the AI seems to learn from the system and adapts its strat around your habits.			"

												(There is no return policy that I know or pre-demo of this game. This is why I am writing this review.( Edit..I have played Multi and changed my views on the product. )---------------------------------Edit... i would rate this game 6/10 now do to the Multi player content and recomend it as a buy now...the following is the old view based on the solo game.This game is built for multi players as a ""board game"" it is not a traditional computer game.------------------------------ oldI expected real time combat when I bought this game.  what I got was a Master of Orion Clone from 1995.  But in MOO there was REAL Combat for ship to ship. Endless Space  ""Ship to Ship Combat""  is an ""Art Board""... An 'auto computer feed', 100% true combat in Endless Space is  two pictures of ships ...? blinking ?...  at each other in combat. Like Chrismas lights on a Holiday Tree.This is a flash game... 2d..., Yes flat screen...  it is pasted on a windows wall paper back drop of some stars. The game play looks like a child's dot to dot coloring book.The Music loops and I with in the 1st 30 minutes I turned sound to Mute.I thank God that it was a 75% off buy.    If I knew what i was getting into for the 8$ I dropped on this game I would been ""OK"" with it. But the video is a pure fraud of real game play, No video I watched has anything Truthful about game play.  However, I love space games and will put up with a lot. This game does not meet the standers of a game made in 1995 MOO2.It is an... ""OK game"" ... for the 75% off sale... but i expected more I am sorry.  I will play it more but I am not thrilled about it. I am sorry to the makers of this game for this comment, but, your combat system was totally lacking in content and was poor.Good points about this game.  It is streamless game play so that can click the button and it will warn you about tasks not done. The ""Sim City"" part of this game is limited, so you can play it and not be forced to micro manage it. The planet are beautiful, the Music is lovely but limited, the pictures and art is lovely.  It is worth 8$ not 30$.i give it a <Edit (6/10).  I can  recommend this game  on sale for 75% off.  Then I will say it is worth the buy.>You should Look at Youtube for real game play before you make a buy here. It might or might not be to your taste. This is more of a Board game from real life then a computer game.			"

												If you like 4x games then this one is a solid game, although lacking in character. There are a number of alien races, though most are just different human factions. They each have rich details backstories, and the game continues to give you more snippets of a larger story as it plays out. Combat is atypical, being more of a dice-roll and technology competition than any actual strategy. You design your ships (each race has a series of different ship platforms that range in size and function, but they all look basically the same, which was a disappointment), and then choose 3 ""cards"". The cards give you bonuses, and can cancel out your opponents 3 cards if  you're lucky, and you can get access to new cards through unlocking technologies. The tech tree is massive and interesting, with detaild lore-filled descriptions of each technology. The game is fun overall, but after a while becomes very bland. Most factions feel very similar to eachother, and with the way invasion and system-capture works, wars can become extremely drawn out affairs. The computer AIs are easily exploited via the diplomacy screen by offering trades that require large ammounts of gold per turn from them in exchange for resoruces or luxuries. They will accept the deal (with a few one-time payments of dust, technology, or whatever else you want), and cancel it the next turn when they can't afford the price, giving you any one-time payments they agreed to for free. The other issue the game suffers from is a lack of clarity. I still haven't figured out what food does, and why I should bother getting more than the bare minimum on my planets, but the technology tree is littered with farming improvements. Compared to games like Masters of Orion II, or Space Empires IV, ES is very pretty and interesting, but a little too much like a spreadsheet rather than a game. If you like 4x you'll enjoy it for a while, but don't spend more than 5 bucks on this one.			"

												Endless Space is quite a fun game too play. If you expect the depth of a Civilisation title you'll better don't get it. But is has some of it within. There is a great tech tree, some neat mechanics and a great Ship Modification System. Playtime of a full set of course depends on how many enemies and which difficulty you choose. I really, really like to give some big props to the Developers, because it's beautifully designed and nice and clean to play. These things really make me want to check out the Endless Dungeons Title from them. So in conclusion; In case you search some turnbased strategy in space and you don't want to get all too deep into the Civilisations thing - get it. The first 30min are preserved to get into the game, but I'm sure almost everyone will actually get into it after these minutes of training. Speaking of training, there is only a textbased Tutorial which covers about 85% of the mechanics basics. But, for me, it was enought to figure out the rest of the gameplay. What is sad, is that the multiplayer (at least the public one) is almost dead. About 2 to max. 3 Games are going on, whenever I log in. So you'd better pick your friends and start a nice game. :)			"

So if you have no job or lots of time on your hands this game is an excellent way to kill time. Along with that the 29 dollar price tag of the game is not worth it. The game feels incomplete in some areas and you should only by the game when it is on sale when it is at least 50- 80% off is the only time you should buy this.			"

												Endless Space is to the 4X space strategy genre what Civilization is to real time strategy games. An extensive tech tree and custom ship designs leave lots of room for variety, and as the game progresses these factors force changes in tactics to keep players on their toes. The expansion and colonisation system is remarkably good, and even with dozens of worlds to manage the beautifully simple UI ensures it is never a chore. Combat may not be to the taste of everyone, however. A very hands off affair, the player chooses cards to establish their tactics in a three-turn battle, and then it plays out itself. For those who love real-time battles this could be a turn off, for those of us who prefer combat to be less of a distraction it''s a godsend. For me personally, Endless Space has rendered all other 4X games obsolete.			"

												This is a great 4x game with amazing visuals. It has a unique and simple battle system so anybody new to 4x games will know what to do.Every game you start feels different from the last one, even if you keep to the same setup. Also there is no solid learning curve as there are many possibilities and out comes. Even if you do come across a situation that feels familiar the out come and your position with in the game may lead you down a completely different path than the one you were expecting. This makes every game you play highly unpredictable.The game can be quite difficult and frustrating for beginners, even on easy. The level of weapons tech of your enemies very quickly matches yours if you do not invest in your own weapons technologies during a conflict. This makes the game challenging on every level.After long play the game can get repetitive. Dealing with all your planets on each turn can get complicated and frustrating. You can save on any turn.The game graphics are stunning. The level of detail they have put in, on the planets, the galaxy and the battle scenes are amazing. You can tell they have taken there time to get this game looking good.The sound effects are not quite in the same power of the graphic. However they are simple and effective for this type of game. The sound track is very good and sets the tone of the game well.The controls work very well. You can operate most of the game with just a click of a mouse. You do have the option to name planets and ships which obviously requires a keyboard.I do recommend this game for the amount of detail they have put in to the graphics, storyline and descriptions of technologies. However some players may find it difficult and also after long play you may find it repetitive and frustrating.			"

												If you want Civ 4 in space, buy it. Otherwise don't bother.Graphics are nice but barely ever seen.90% of the game is administration of dots with lines in between them whether it's the map screen and the dots are solar systems or the solar system map and the dots are planets or the research screen and the dots are technologies urgh. Large games get slow super fast - not graphically but logistically - as the AI and yourself begins to do more. Late game combat is huge numbers of ships divided into fleets of limited size all attacking each other one by one to see who wins (just like Civ 4). That said if you like Civ 4 and don't mind the lategame grind (unless you rush culture etc) and the fact that the combat in this is about as interactive as the combat in Civ 4 (Attack this - oh♥♥♥♥♥♥you're dead. Lets hope one of the 19 other units just like you eventually wins) then you'll get along well with this.So reccomended just be warned. The pretty screenshots are less than 10% of the game. Most of it is admin. Admin with a good soundtrack, interesting lore, nicely balanced but feeling difference races and racial ships etc.			"

												Nice game. Complex, but not that hard-to-master 4X turn-based game like I was expecting for quite some time. The AI is quite challenging, even if plagued with some consistent bug (they still keep invading systems without siege power, AFAIK), and there's a really excellent interface that allows you to quickly manage even a vast space empire. Space combat is quite basic, and very different if compared to Master of Orion 2 (if you don't know what I'm talking about, consider it as the current standard for this kind of games): no more ship direct controlo nor tactical combat, simply choose your tactics and watch the video. This is NOT necessarily bad, mind you: it's a game more focused on strategic empire management than ship micromanagement, and it's quite great at it. Still, you can't shrug off the feeling that MoO2 was more complete and immersive, and that's a shame because ES had every card to strip Master of Orion of his crown.			"

												Quite entertaining - there's a learning curve, but it's not too steep.  I could wish for a bit more detail when it comes to designing ships, but what's there is still very functional.My only complaint is that as the game progresses, it slows down, a LOT, despite running it on a quad-core machine with 8GB of ram.In the end, though?  You'll definitely get your moneys' worth.			"

												Do you like Civilization?? did you ever wonder what would happen if after you got the space victory in Civ then added aliens and got rid of money for currency and used a new resource called dust along with 50 or so more resources to generate a economy and colonize the stars....well then ENDLESS SPACE is the game for you...

												This game is another classic Turn Baased Strategy Game but does involve some knowledge and what you want to shoot for in the MetaView of the game.You colonize star systems, build structures that enhance your output, and can even terraform the planets to suit your needs.The ability to choose what your armada contains means you can have the same ship 20 different ways to suit your needs.Battles work in a Ro Sham Bo format.  You pick a card which is a particular type then it follows a weapon triangle.  If you lose that does not mean you take a beating but your play is less likely to succeed with the possibility of taking more damage.I prefer to play as the Harmony, which do not have dust, this puts us at a disadvantage of not being able to force rush buildings and such, but is beneficial to many of the other aspects.  Planets can only be taken over with ships with siege damage unless you want to wait 999 turns.  This is not really feasible early on in the game.Overall definitely a quality Turn Based Strategy Game.  10/10			"

												Pretty much what a 4x game should be.There are only 2 problems with this game.--There should be an option for even bigger galaxies. Play this for a while and you will want HUGGGEEE galaxies, but there just isn't an option for it. They pretty much just max out at Med size.--The other problem is fleet size is based on research tree. You can only have x amount of ships per fleet.  Your neighbors beat you because they researched a technology that allow them to have one extra tiny ship in the battle. And their 1 fleet beat your 12 because fleets can only engage 1 at a time.And that is the part most ridiculous. The game has no kinda tipping point for sheer numbers winning. it's like 2 guys with a machine gun kill 10k guys because they aren't advanced enough to overwhelm them. Even with spoons they would get over whelmed eventually.  Which seems ultra unrealistic.You can literally have 1k ships at a system but will loose because the enemy has a slighter tech advantage so it can deploy more ships in a fleet, and dispose of you, because you can only fight one fleet vs one fleet at a time.

												Never ever before have I felt so damn conflicted about a game. NEVER! Not once in my 20+ years of gaming! Endless Space offers INCREDIBLY deep gameplay elements, from micromanaging an empire of planets with trading routes and various planetary exploitation, to customizing your units down to engine tuning and weapon power, and exploring INSANELY huge tech-trees. It even has some mild elements of humour in it, with jokes about low gravity on planets making kids happy (really, that's what the tooltip says!). But yet, I still feel... put off by the game. There's just SOMETHING about it, something I can't put my finger on, that's making me back away slowly with a questioning stare. Honestly, I don't think I'm capable of reviewing this game properly due to my ambiguous feelings towards it. So, I'm afraid I can't give this one a proper grading, boyos. ?/10			"

												First thing you should know: This game is gonna hurt you. It's gonna make you realize that you're not half as good -quarter as good- as you thought you were. This game is HARD in the way that there are a million factors to consider, and one extra food on turn 10 can mean victory or defeat 200 turns later. It's much easier on the lower difficulties, but if you try to play this on even the Normal setting first time through, you will cry.THAT BEING SAID. This game is also deep and interesting. There are almost a dozen different ways to win, and the AI have individual personalities and act accordingly. Resources make sense, and the UI is very easy to use and understand (once you put in a little effort.)One flaw with the game is that it does have a huge, deep, steep, nearly bottomless learning curve. There are, as I said, a ton of things to learn and consider. However, once that curve is mastered, the game has a ton of replay value. Aside from the dozen different and unique factions, you can design your own, meaning that you can make thousands of different races that all play differently.The universe is variable to the last detail, but even if you have the smallest settings, it's almost impossible to get even remotely close universes across different games, so everything plays out differently. Overall, the only grudges I can hold against the game is the learning curve, and the amount of time needed to invest to master it. This is NOT a game to pick up and play for five minutes a day. But if you've got the inclination and time, this is quite possibly the best 4X game in existence.			"

												I'm not sure if I am using the phrase 'Indie sleeper hit' correctly, but I do not care. This is in my top 5 games of 2012, and is probably one of my favorites of all time. It combines elements of civilization and Galactic civilizations into one neatly packaged, entertaining game. Those who are not fans of comparatively slow paced strategy games may feel the length of turns at times, but the feeling of reward turn after turn is rewarding. The combat is unique for it's kind, if not intuitive. It can add lengths to turns, but that is it's only detriment. The custom faction bit adds a lot of replayability after you get comfortable with the game, and I have barely touched the online scene. All in all, if you like strategy games, space sims, or any combination of the forementioned games, I HIGHLY reccomend this. The only thing that I can gripe about is it's unforgiving difficulty, and complexity of research. I give this 9 out of 10 corborbs.			"

												Endless Space is best summed up as 'Civilization in Space'. Multiple victory types, strategic gameplay, massively stupid AI. But Endless Space somehow manages to do combat even worse than Civ. Think about that for a second: Civ's combat was pretty bad. One unit per square, chunky movement, and penalties for even thinking about building a large, war-minded empire.Endless Space's combat is even worse than that.Every fight is rock-paper-scissors. Literally. Didn't guess the correct defense for your opponent's offense? You lose. Parity of offense and defense? Nothing at all happens. Add to this an annoying, time-consuming ""card"" system that adds ANOTHER layer of roshambo and you have the most annoying combat system ever encountered in gaming. Combat invariably boils down either to turtling or kamikaze attacks.It can be a fun game and has a unique setting, but if you're looking for any kind of smooth, interesting, or even just functional combat system, you should look elsewhere.Edit after achievement hunting: If you're the type that enjoys getting all the achievements in a game, you'll be dismayed - as I was - to find that Endless Space has many hidden achievements. They are nearly all incredibly difficult to get. Not challenging, mind you. They just take hours and hours of grind, luck, and AI decisions randomly working in your favor. Annoying and not worth the time.			"

												Considering I love space games and I played Civilization 5 (with 250+ hours) I believed this would be the next favorite. I was very wrong. I have only played the game a few hours (8 hours) and through one play through but so far it has been dry and quite bulky interface wise. The interface is complicated and the galaxy and graphics are bland. It has a Civilization set up feel to it but about half the complexity, a third of the balance, and even smaller fraction of the fun. The Space battles are interesting the way they are set up but your control is very limited to 3 minor choices and the rest is automatic with luck thrown in. The game seems heavily based on building ships and lots of them. Comparing it to Civilization which after 5 games has balanced everything down to a science, Endless Space seems to be heavily out of BALANCE.Perhaps I did not put enough time into the game but some key disappointing features were:*tech tree seemed pointless*reviews for the game were really high*the game seems overly complex in information wise with little meaning behind it*there is just to much to manage for the game to be fun, felt more like homework at one point when I was setting up all my ships from scratch and by the time i build a fleet I need to do it all overi would petition anyone wanting to buy this game to DEMO it first.If i had to give the game a score:2/5			"

												I did not like this game. Theoretically it has everything it takes to make a great strategy game. It's stable and not buggy. What it's missing is colour. Flavour. Spice. Endless Space is, like outer space, boring.The science research is generally pretty boring. Either it adds a point to this or that stat, or lets you build a new building that enhances a stat. There's nothing that feels fun, where you anticipate getting a research item because it opens up cool new possibilities in strategic depth. It's more like, ""Oh now my fleets can have 6 ships instead of 5... wow..."" Compare and contrast with Master of Orion, where you could have black hole weapons and teleporters, cool stuff that change how the game plays.Combat is worse. There is only one (possibly 2) viable strategy and a dumb card mechanic and super boring non-interactive combat scenes. I started reading something else while the combat scenes were going, because they're so long and uninteresting. As a game design mechanic they have you play cards during the battle. I believe they did this to encourage people to watch the combat, but all it does is force you to sit through the combat if you want to play the game optimally. Bad design. Compare with Master of Magic's highly tactical combat, or Civ 5's simple and quick combat, either style of which is much better.I think Endless Space 2, where they've retooled everything and made it fun, would be great. Endless Space the original, however, I don't recommend.			"

												Endless space is a difficult to learn empire oriented turn based. I've played Civ and Endless Legend but none of that prepared for the confusion I was going to be in when I started playing this game. The concept of being unable to move unless you click on a different system/city was very infuriating. Why? Just why? All the games I've played allowed me to move where I damn pleased within reason. As I played further on I got got even more confused by the concept that the system had planets that allowed me to treat the system as a city. It confused me because I felt like every planet to be an individual city inside the massive city known as the system. Apparently not.After closing the game and giving up on it a good friend of mine finally showed me the ropes of the game. It finally bagan to make sense. Like every other Endless game it took me a bit to grasp of what the hell I was supposed to do. After passing the first hurdle it becomes rewarding with victories and ego inflating expansions to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the AI.What confused me the most initially was the tech tree. Everything was everywhere in 4 categories that took me a complete game to allow my feeble brain comprehend on what's what and how it is useful. The fact you have about 4 ships to unlock it got me a bit confused. As I played more I realised that while some had the same space and general stats they had their unique bonus that can change how you mod your ships. Oh, you have to mod your ships as well as creating them. Because you can unlock it and be unable to build it until you create a blueprint so to speak. Which isn't hard; you just have to remember to do it.AI, for certain factions are ruthless, system hogs and full to the brim of testosterone. Automatons, Sowers, Sophons, Cravers, Sheredyn, Hissho, Horatio, Pilgrims, Amoeba, Harmony, Vaulters. Guess which ones are the most powerful compared to the rest.♥♥♥♥ the United Empire. More like United ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s for the amount of expansion they accomplish.Beware the Automatons. Literally capable of building a mass army in one turn. If you do play this game, a rule you should go by is don't like Harmony and the Cravers gain too much power. In fact kill them as soon as you are able to. Harmony will destroy the currency on systems, Cravers consume planets and make it weaker for anyone else who isn't them. If you want all the resources to mass construct and expand, you don't want their  systems if they get their way. It's a hard game to get a hold of at first. But if you are prepared for the challenge and want a nice game. Get this.8.5			"

												This game has one of the most akward layouts from tech trees to system management that I have ever played with and I have played with a lot of them. For example one of the most important things to have a chance to survive at all is increase fleet size. The techs for it are scattered all over the place. Once you finally figure out how to eventually scroll in on the tech tree, instead of having the description right there and easy to see and use, you now have to hover over the specific icon within the description. Meanwhile your so zoomed in that it becomes a pain to just glance over nearby techs you might want to be able to see so you end up wandering around in the zoomed in mode. Some might not care but to me its just tedious and annoying. They need to get rid of the useless and crappy story descricptive nonsense for each tech and make the actually techs easier to read. For crying out loud!Then you get to the system management ... you only have 1 building queve for the entire solor system whether you have 1 planet or 6. You can only make one thing per solor system. I mean seriously why bother to even have planets. They are all so mixed up you can't really build anything useful in most of them anyways. For instance, arid planets earn you dust(so valuable ...) then tundra planets are good at research(who knows why) so you en up half the time with half the planets for one thing and half for the other. So even though you have 5 planets its no more useful than one with 2 planets of the same type. It's just a very poor system design.Ship customization...no not really. Yes, you can swap weapons out and some core components but there is zero difference in apearence. Your battleships will all look the same no matter how you outfit them. I mean how pathetic is that for a game made in this day and age.The battle system ... it's just horrible. Your fleet is not commanded by you but instead you use generic command cards for 3 different battle phases. You will soon find most of them are completely useless since there is very little diveristy in weapons. It's just glorified paper, rock, and scissors.Master of Orion 2 made in 1996, that's almost 20 years ago, is head and heals above the quailty of this game. After 20 years of progress this is the best they could put out there? Seriously?!!! They don't even have the right to call themselves  gamemakers with this kind of crap.I strongly, very strongly, recommend that you don't waste your money on this crappy game. The only way people put a positive review fo this game is because they must not have ever played a decent space turn based stradegy game.			"

												Overall, pretty decent 4x space game. At first I LOVED it. Thought it was what MoO3 should have been. Sadly, the combat is dull, the AI weak and some of the mechanisms behind the scenes not clear enough.On the plus side, empire management is pretty fun. and some of the sense of wonder that (imo) is the key to a good space-based 4x is present.Need to play a few more games before really getting a complete picture but so far I'd say it's certainly worth ago if this kind of thing is your bag.

												I have played this game again and I changed my thought about it so I will rewrite my review.Endless Space is a strategy game that plays in space. (duhh)Your objective is colonize planets and discover other races and wage war with them.The tutorial is useless and I had to search most things on my phone and that's not what I want, I want to play the damn game!I must say that the graphics are average, sometimes the game looks good, but sometimes it doesn't.Singleplayer:It looks a bit like Civilization 5 but then downgraded...Especially with battles between ships, we all expect Star Wars like battles but instead, you get a cutscene, which is boring.Overall the game is pretty boring and it's just really hard to like the game and believe me, I tried to like it...There is one thing the game does very well and that's the resarch, you have 4 different research types and you kinda need to choose which one you want to concentrate on.Multiplayer:I couldn't find any match, it's totally DEAD!I also want to mention that this game eats RAM for me so if you have 4GB of RAM, you might want to reconsider buying it.Final verdict:The game does some things well, but it's just boring, boring and boring :(I give it a 4/10.

												Endless Space is best summed up as 'Civilization in Space'. Multiple victory types, strategic gameplay, massively stupid AI. But Endless Space somehow manages to do combat even worse than Civ. Think about that for a second: Civ's combat was pretty bad. One unit per square, chunky movement, and penalties for even thinking about building a large, war-minded empire.Endless Space's combat is even worse than that.Every fight is rock-paper-scissors. Literally. Didn't guess the correct defense for your opponent's offense? You lose. Parity of offense and defense? Nothing at all happens. Add to this an annoying, time-consuming ""card"" system that adds ANOTHER layer of roshambo and you have the most annoying combat system ever encountered in gaming. Combat invariably boils down either to turtling or kamikaze attacks.It can be a fun game and has a unique setting, but if you're looking for any kind of smooth, interesting, or even just functional combat system, you should look elsewhere.Edit after achievement hunting: If you're the type that enjoys getting all the achievements in a game, you'll be dismayed - as I was - to find that Endless Space has many hidden achievements. They are nearly all incredibly difficult to get. Not challenging, mind you. They just take hours and hours of grind, luck, and AI decisions randomly working in your favor. Annoying and not worth the time.			"

												I'm a big fan of the 4X genre, but not all of them can be a Civilization. In fact, this feels way too much like the disastrous Master of Orion III, a game that spent most of the time playing itself. I didn't feel like I understood the consequences of choices in the game at all, especially technology selection. Despite being able to pick up the basics in a tutorial, it took watching a few community videos to start trying to get the hang of it. In contrast, Galactic Civilizations II was immediately familiar and easy to figure out from my many hours of playing MOO II.If you have the patience to really invest in learning the game, you might be rewarded for it. Personally, I think there's 4X space games much more deserving of your dollars.			"

												I've sunk quite a few hours into this game, and I've found it generally entertaining and occassionally genuinely challenging.  Why the negative review then?  The game is really superficial.The AI is a bit dull witted, and the only reason it presents a challenge at higher levels is because it cheats like hell.  You know your devs have phoned it in when the only way to make the game difficult is to penalize the player.  At any difficulty level, there alway seems to be an opponent who will immediately start building up a fleet of warships from Turn 1 so that it can lay the smackdown on you within the first 30 turns, which is incredibly irritating when you're playing a non-martial race.There's not a lot of help available, and the tutorial is totally lacking in substance.  The ability tree overview hasn't been updated since before Disharmony came out, resulting in misinformation that I just find annoying, but would probably frustrate the hell out of your average first time player.  Wording on technologies, abilities, and battle cards is vague and leads to confusion.  I'm still not entirely sure what actual effects some of the battle cards have.  Balancing seems to be an ongoing issue, with 2 races that had to be entirely reengineered because they were bricks from the get-go.And yes, I'm going to kvetch about the Vaulters, because I shouldn't have to purchase another game from a different genre to make the game I already paid for complete.  That's just silly.  Amplitude said the rest of us would get them eventually, when Dungeon of the Endless was released, but that was 9 months ago and the game is still in Beta.  I've already lost my interest in the game, and I doubt it's going to come back because the upgrade cycle appears to have already finished and there's not going to be any further content updates.tldr: Can be fun, but suffers from cheap AI and lack of support.  Generally lacks substance.			"

												So much potential to be a great game. Unfortunately it falls short. The combat is incredibly lame( despite there being a manual and automatic option there is very little difference other than watching a slow rendered and uncontrollable fight take place). Tutorial has little to explanation on how to win the game, despite my best efforts I score three times less than the AI despite playing on easy and do not understand why. All the technologies are pretty much the same and the customizable ships are pretty lame. Very disappointed I spent the money on the game. Unless you get it for under ten dollars I wouldn’t bother with this. Edit 8/16/14 For the same money you can buy Galctic Empires III. Much better game and its only in beta. Would not buy this game, I wish I could return it			"

The ship building interface is a particular stand-out, and the tech tree presents well-balanced and interesting choices.  The trade and diplomacy system is a modest improvement over Civilization's.  If you don't like Endless Space, it'll probably be because of the card game inspired combat system or board game style movement options.			"

												I first downloaded endless space because it was on sale for something super low, about a year ago or more. Next thing I know, after creating a booming scientific empire founded on diplomacy and peace (without taking a single military science), I got sick and tired of dying to pirates roaming around my interior and finally just switched direction. We're talking complete right angle here. Worlds which had once been prized for their upholding of human rights were transformed into bleak industryscapes where you work to build warships for your entire life, or are exiled to space. We crushed the pirate dogs. And then we turned to the alliance we worked so hard to build. All races in the galaxy save for one. I declared war on that one, and then left the alliance to fight a war they did not want.  When the loan race proved more cunning than the alliance, I declared war on the alliance and conglomerated an entire civilization all at once. They begged for a cease fire. I said ""no"". My people cast uneasy looks about one another and wonder internally how they came to be this. I sit back, laugh and revel at how I have 170 hours sank into this game. 10/10 absolutely recommend			"

												The concept of this game intruiged me, but I found the actual gameplay to be tedius and unrewarding. I found there was little sense of progress as I explored new words. I flew to a planet and started building improvements and flew to the next planet and did the same thing and on and on it goes. Each turn I'd click through 20 or 30 messages which often contained unimportsnt information, which I suppose was intended to provide some texture to the game.I'm writing this review because when I check out the reviews no-one had a single bad thing to say about the game. After buying the game, I find that a little dubious. Be warned, just because you liked civilization or some other strategy game like that, does mean this game is the right game for you.			"

												Endless Space is a 4X Strategy game you can choose between a number of races and victory conditions depending on your play style. Like many games of this style you conquer, colonise and generally expand your empire in order to be better than everyone else. I will briefly go through the good and ugly below…Good; Depp strategy elements, with a good amount of micro-management. Nice set of ways to win other than your standard kill everyone else. Nice detailed tech tree. An “ok” diplomacy section with races not always either agreeing with your or out to kill you because you sneezed a nice balance if you like. Like other endless games you have a nice set of heroes with some minor RPG elements. OK’ish graphics and sound/music.Ugly; Tutorial was ok but could have been a little more detailed for those not used to these types of games. A major gripe is the combat which is more akin to a card game or none complicated game of rock/paper/scissors than your typical strategy game. Later on in game micro-management can become very time consuming.Overall I would give it a thumbs up, worth a look on sale maybe not full price considering what you can get nowadays in the same genre.

												I want to say this is a good game, for its age it has fairly good graphics, it has a nice tech tree, it has a fair amount of RNG and a good amount of environmental options, what isn't to like you may ask then? Simple, the freaking AI is the worst pile of steaming crap I have ever seen in a game, once they engage you in war 90% of the time it is NOTHING except notification spam. You get a little pop-up in the corner, and says ""enemy has attacked your fleet"" click on it, and then they retreat, over and over and over and over 2, 3, 10, 20 times in a single turn even, it is so god-awful annoying and pointless. I have less than 8 hours in the game, half of that time is the AI running away from battles and just spamming me with notifications.With that said though, I got it for $1 and for just a single dollar, it is worth messing around in to waste away a boring afternoon, but not worth a penny more			"

												i'm going to be completely honest with this review, when i first got this game and booted it up, i was almost turned off, between the at the time, encumbering ui, and the way it looked, i was about to ask for a refund, but after watching a few youtube videos on it, i figured i would give it another shot, and i am glad i did, as this time, i was not an idiot and i actually read the tutorial, and found out that i love this game! there are a few different races you can choose from, each with a diplomatic alignment, either good or evil, but there is a special race here, one that is going to be an interesting playthrough, this race, is an insect like race, with no goal but to expand and consume all matter of life, ranging from plants to animals/mammals, it reminds me of a race in, i think, mass effect 2 (i think it was 2) but it just goes from colony to colony taking out humans, it reminds me of that race on crack, speaking of crack, this game is like sid meiers civ games on crack, in terms of the combat scenes, its not like the civ games, you can actually move the camera around and get up close and personel with the ships as they fight, all the while choosing actions to do in the 3 ranges, long range, medium range and close range, the actions that you choose are card like, some have a cost while others dont, and the actions differ in types, from offensive to defenseive to engineering, and they have effects on weaponary, shields and armor, among other things. so the combat is not only sexy, but it is also involving more so then the civ games (i'm not knocking the civ games either, i have been a huge fan and still am!) so to sum up this review, this is an amazing 4x game, with quite a deal of depth, but when you first start i highly reconmend reading the tutorial! well worth the money in my honest opinion!

												Decent 4X game with a few interesting innovations that make it worth checking out.  The ship building interface is a particular stand-out, and the tech tree presents well-balanced and interesting choices.  The trade and diplomacy system is a modest improvement over Civilization's.  If you don't like Endless Space, it'll probably be because of the card game inspired combat system or board game style movement options.			"

												Endless Space is a 4X Strategy game you can choose between a number of races and victory conditions depending on your play style. Like many games of this style you conquer, colonise and generally expand your empire in order to be better than everyone else. I will briefly go through the good and ugly below…Good; Depp strategy elements, with a good amount of micro-management. Nice set of ways to win other than your standard kill everyone else. Nice detailed tech tree. An “ok” diplomacy section with races not always either agreeing with your or out to kill you because you sneezed a nice balance if you like. Like other endless games you have a nice set of heroes with some minor RPG elements. OK’ish graphics and sound/music.Ugly; Tutorial was ok but could have been a little more detailed for those not used to these types of games. A major gripe is the combat which is more akin to a card game or none complicated game of rock/paper/scissors than your typical strategy game. Later on in game micro-management can become very time consuming.Overall I would give it a thumbs up, worth a look on sale maybe not full price considering what you can get nowadays in the same genre.

												Almost everything about this game is well done - until you have your first combat. After playing for about 13 hours, I just couldn't do it anymore. The strategy is fun, but the fighting is so un-fun that I eventually just stopped playing, and haven't come back for months.			"

												I want to say this is a good game, for its age it has fairly good graphics, it has a nice tech tree, it has a fair amount of RNG and a good amount of environmental options, what isn't to like you may ask then? Simple, the freaking AI is the worst pile of steaming crap I have ever seen in a game, once they engage you in war 90% of the time it is NOTHING except notification spam. You get a little pop-up in the corner, and says ""enemy has attacked your fleet"" click on it, and then they retreat, over and over and over and over 2, 3, 10, 20 times in a single turn even, it is so god-awful annoying and pointless. I have less than 8 hours in the game, half of that time is the AI running away from battles and just spamming me with notifications.With that said though, I got it for $1 and for just a single dollar, it is worth messing around in to waste away a boring afternoon, but not worth a penny more			"

												i'm going to be completely honest with this review, when i first got this game and booted it up, i was almost turned off, between the at the time, encumbering ui, and the way it looked, i was about to ask for a refund, but after watching a few youtube videos on it, i figured i would give it another shot, and i am glad i did, as this time, i was not an idiot and i actually read the tutorial, and found out that i love this game! there are a few different races you can choose from, each with a diplomatic alignment, either good or evil, but there is a special race here, one that is going to be an interesting playthrough, this race, is an insect like race, with no goal but to expand and consume all matter of life, ranging from plants to animals/mammals, it reminds me of a race in, i think, mass effect 2 (i think it was 2) but it just goes from colony to colony taking out humans, it reminds me of that race on crack, speaking of crack, this game is like sid meiers civ games on crack, in terms of the combat scenes, its not like the civ games, you can actually move the camera around and get up close and personel with the ships as they fight, all the while choosing actions to do in the 3 ranges, long range, medium range and close range, the actions that you choose are card like, some have a cost while others dont, and the actions differ in types, from offensive to defenseive to engineering, and they have effects on weaponary, shields and armor, among other things. so the combat is not only sexy, but it is also involving more so then the civ games (i'm not knocking the civ games either, i have been a huge fan and still am!) so to sum up this review, this is an amazing 4x game, with quite a deal of depth, but when you first start i highly reconmend reading the tutorial! well worth the money in my honest opinion!

												I have been playing this game on-and-off for quite some time now and conclude that I quite like it. For me, there is a bit too much micromanagement to make it super enjoyable, but is well balanced so that various types of players will still like it.The pros is that the game is beautiful with nice art and spaceships that cool. You can customize your ships extensively to introduce strengths and/or weaknesses to certain weapon types. The tech tree is pretty good with some strategy needed to determine exactly what you are trying to accomplish.The negatives are that the AI is not very good and cheats badly to try to be competitive. You will never have the feeling that you got outmaneuvered militarily and/or diplomatically, just that the 500% resource bonus or whatever will wear you down through attrition. The battle system is also needlessly complex - I understand they probably spent a ton of time building a beautiful real time fighting display, but you have such limited control that it just slows the game down. Even picking ""cards"" is annoying when the AI spams you with dozens of stacks of ships. I hope things will be improved with Endless Space 2!Also, I did end up buying the DLC that I am torn over. The Harmony are a cool race with much different mechanics, but other than that, I feel that it is not worth the cost. It simply adds even more micro (troops, fighters, etc) to a game that arguably has too much already.			"

												LOL, this game.  First its a great idea and play routine, but it goes horribly wrong after that point.  The 'retrofit feature seems to only work for the AI, and even when I attempt to use a hero to spy it tells me nothing about what the ships the AI are packing.  What kind of firepower and defenses etc.  However the AI knows this, and in moments retrofits thier entire fleet to thwart your newest fleet creation (EVEN ON NEWBIE MODE).  The AI also apparently does not have to deal with unrest in any form, I say this because they create wave after wave after wave of new ships, thier research speed is incredible (I was fighting ships with 1500+ offensive scores while I was still around 500, IN NEWBIE MODE) and while I was struggling to keep 3 fleets going and dealing with unrest (even PERMA-UNREST on some colonies) the AI just chugs along and steam roles you.  Steam is a great thing these days, lets us gamers have access to a multitude of games ... but STEAM you need to start offering refunds.  I would definetly get a refund on this game as it is right now and a couple others, there's ALOT of junk being sold these days :(			"

												My first and favourite 4X. I'd only seen Civ games for years, and didn't really bother playing them. That one got me, and got me really well. My current game (normal galaxy, 5 factions) has lasted 38 intense and pleasing hours so far. It's got a lot of reasons to be so good :Decently challenging AI ? Check.An exhaustive victory conditions set ? Check and doublecheck.Custom factions, maps, rules and units ? Check.A huge and well designed tech tree ? Check.An imaginative and inspiring story universe ? Check. Granted, some of the tech descriptions don't really seem to match their effects, but the writing is excellent (English version). Especially considering Amplitude is French. We aren't exactly aces when it comes to foreign languages.My only complaint would be that the battles and card-set feel kind of bland and repetitive. There is a great need for more variety when it comes to cards. The fighter/bomber mechanic that was introduced in Disharmony really should have been in vanilla ES as an update, if you ask me. Otherwise, go grab it if you haven't already. :)			"

												I own both Endless Legend and Endless Space and they both suffer from the same basic problems ... it's like the developers haven't played 4x games in the past 15 years. They're missing key features that have become key in modern times. No hotkey binding? Come on. Management screens are devoid of crucial information. I still can't seem to find where it shows how much you're paying on maintenance for your fleets. There's a published formula but why can't I see it at a glance?That said, the game is very pretty. The artwork is beautifully done. The gameplay is pretty good, though the AI sucks (which seems to be a consistent theme with this developer ... Endless Legend AI sucks too.) It's playable even on older computers and the storyline is engrossing. The default races are wonderfully done. The technology tree has had a lot of thought put into it and is fascinating just to read through if you're a fan of science fiction. In short, the game is worth playing (especially if you can pick it up on a sale) but it's not as good as even Space Empires IV in terms of a strategic/tactical 4x. I would call it ""strategy-lite"" in many ways and I don't expect it to have a lot of replayability once I've seen all the events, heroes, and story.			"

												It's not a bad game but I felt it was very underwhelming... the cheap artsy Civ-5 style (even worse) graphics instead of 3-D representation in many aspects of the game, the abstract and exaggerated but at the same time lifeless foes which make you feel like you're back in some 2000 card game, similarly weird backstory about some old 'endless' civilization that vanished and you find remnants of... or the absence of story with the endless just being an excuse. It's just uninspiring because I have little to empathize with in this lifeless game, and when you actually start thinking about what it actually represents, this is not space at all.. space is not supposed to be a 2-d plane. This is not a legit galaxy exploration game. In a real space exploration game your movement and star positions cannot be constrained to one plane. So it's just a board game with space cosmetics like a civ mod. It's also funny how the huge map has hundreds of stars drawn on the 'galaxy' but only a few select are actually real, and a star cluster according to them can only consist of 5 stars. To understand what I mean, get Mass Effect and look at what a real space atlas is supposed to look like, then look back at your 'huge' Endless Space map and realise how much of a childish game you're playing.p.s. I've played and steamrolled my first game on a huge map with United Empire on normal. I have been reading the enemy is supposed to be a vicious cheater and very difficult even on easier difficulties, but I didn't really find the match very challenging. I just made cheap fleets with nothing but rockets, spat out 5-10 units a turn from one system and just spammed my enemy to death.. won an economic victory because of how long it takes to conquer enemy systems. By the end of the game I was begging for it to end because of this. I'll be trying the higher difficulty now.update: No I can't take this game anymore. It's just bland, boring and eats my time. I'm done with it forever.			"

												A really great space 4X game.  It has a hands-off battle system where the player defines the tactics to be used before the battle begins. Research is split into 4 tech trees, which can be described as economics, industry, expansion, and combat.  Colonization is done at both system-wide and planetary levels, and most of your improvements apply system-wide, with planets constructing specialization structures and terraforming.  The diplomacy system is straight forward and functional, if not exceptionally deep.			"

You don't directly command your ships, nor was I able to change tactics mid-battle. I'd just play Sins of a Solar Empire.			"

												I purchased this game under the assumption that it was space Real Time Strategy. It is in a way. If you're looking for more space combat/warfare, I would recommend looking at Homeworld: Remastered. But as it stands, this is more of Civilization in space.My first and only problem is that when you play the game for the first time, the game starts telling you♥♥♥♥♥♥ WAYYYY too much♥♥♥♥♥♥ Every little thing you click on or highlight on the user-interface gives you 2-3 paragraphs to read on what it does. I feel they over-complicated the tutorial as a result, but I'm glad I stuck through it, as what I got was a game that totally surprised me in its addictive nature. The combat may be on rails, but building a space empire sets the story to make the battle unique and epic without actually controlling the battle. The diplomatic side to the AI is lacking and one Race seems to dominate over the others in solo campaigns, but these games are usually intended for online multiplayer experiences, so this shouldn't be an issue if that's what you're looking for.Not happy with the Races to choose from? Make your own. Not happy with the destructive firepower of your destroyers? Change it to your liking. There's hours of content here making it pretty good value for money.			"

												6/10What a dumb game.  After researching this and another space strategy title I decided to go for this one since it was part of the Steam sale ($7 something so not so much of a loss on this 'investment').  While it has its charm the tech tree and some of the rules related to how to play the game are ridiculous.Say you have 7 ships (destroyers or corvettes, no difference in tonnage so does not matter which - another stupid tech tree option but I digress), and you have an additional group of 7 ships of the same type.  That leaves you with 14 ships right?  NOPE.  You have the enemy show up with 12 ships and they attack the 7 while the other 7 sit in the same star system and watch their comrades in arms get blown to bits without interveneing.  How can this game be rated so high with such an obvious lack of logic in the tech tree is beyond me.  You have to research the ability to put more in your fleet which is completely stupid.  I understand the adminral might not be able to do as well with more ships but then just give a battle penalty or something until he improves or until he researches the required tech, do not just limit ships at 7 or 9 per armada until you research the tech to put more in your fleet, this kills the game.Further where they have stuff in the tech tree is annoying as it forces you to go back and forth between tech areas (the one on the left verses the one on the bottom).The game is not all bad, but compared to the strats of Civilization 4 or 5, Europa Universalis 4, Master of Orion 2, or Space Empires 5, Endless Space is a waste of money.  Space Empires 5 especially was MUCH MUCH BETTER in terms of game mechanics, as of course was Master of Orion 2.  For those really into the space battles and who feel that is why this game is great, check out Sins of a Solar Empire (I think it was Sins, someone feel free to correct me if not and I will figure out which one it was as there is one game where you have space battles VERY similar to Babylon 5 the tv series).  MUCH better firefights...Anyhow I digress.  I still have yet to finish my first game so maybe I will change my mind once I get use to the tech tree (I find it problematic to find anything I want to research as the names for things are not intuiative in my opinion), but honestly I am so disappointed.  Here I was thinking I was finding a diamond in the rough (excuse the cliche) and instead I found a ring missing the diamond, not bad but definitely not as good as it could be, and not as good as many titles that came before it that they could have followed...1st edit: (after 15 hours) - still standing by all my initial statements above...the tech tree setup is horrible, I want to research what I need to bomb my enemies, no civilopedia or anything like you would get in Civilization, and YOUTUBE and guides online do not cover quite a number of my questions at all (some were answered though you have to research a lot).  Went through a period where I was taking 999 turns to research something and though I knew why (random event affecting science), would have been nice to see a countdown on how many more turns I would have to suffer...if you are into games where you want to understand what is going on all the time, this is not it, if you are into games where you need to research a ton online (Europa Universalis) and trial and error and figure out what is going on all the time this is not it either.  You want a game that you are 'flying blind'  in a number of areas for a LONG TIME (15 hours and counting at the moment), than this is it.  I am winning my current game but still I just want to bomb the enemy (yeah yeah I need invasion points more than they do or something like that, where do I even find that, trial and error figuring out how to build something that can bomb or bring invaders, would not be that hard in reality, I got a ship, I got an asteroid belt, they have no ships, I shoot them from the sky with rocks until their cities are in shambles...no option for something like that here, bah...)

												Amazing potential, yet not very original.  The game lacks that extra layer of development that one needs to get really sucked in.  Hard to not indorse this title, but must all the same.  Excited for future installments.  Perhaps those will reach that extra layer.  Buy this one on sale, not full price.			"

												I've only spent a few hours playing but it really doesnt seem to have any thrill that pulled me in and made me want to keep playing.  I love the 4x genre but the problem I keep seeing with Space-based 4x is something of scale.  I've tried several games in the space-based 4x niche, and will keep on trying them,  but somewhere along the development they alway lose the thrill of exploration and management and try to replace that with ship battles and wars that never really hit home.  I'm new to Steam so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt, my opinion may change with wider access to these kinds of games, but for the moment I'm just going to say that this game deosn't stand out in any meaningful manner for me.

												For me at least, I would require personnel who developed the game to explain to me how the game's mechanics run. It's really hard to understand; there's no margin of difficulty for the AI (Very Easy acts as though it is on hard, no dumbing of AI for game familiarization). I had high hopes for the game early off its release though, and it has come a long way from its beta release to today. Still hoping that they would dumb down the AI and simplify the tutorial scheme. I would still recommend it, but only for Strategy buffs who would understand the game their first two or three tries.EDIT:Gave the game a second go, at least with help from a youtube video (because the in-game tutorial sucks), and now I'm disappointed more than ever with it. I really couldn't grip the bare basics of the game, with the AI beating me in points five-fold (usually by turn 30 I'd have 300 points to the enemy's 1500+ points), I couldn't see where else in my game I've not been doing things right, I followed the tutorial and all, I even watched youtube tutorials for this game and still nothing. Why has God forsaken me?EDIT V2:lol gave the game another go for about 15 hours or so, played starting with easy. Bumped it up today to normal. Yes, I am hardcore, and ♥♥♥♥ you. And all I gotta say is ♥♥♥♥ Yo Game			"

												This is solid game exept for one aspect, the random events, they can either make or break a play through and in a strategy game you should either have the randomness at the core, see blood bowl and tabletop warhammmer for good examples of this, or not have it at all, this game has some random event that if it comes up you may as well restart. for example, sometimes you will get a thing come up about pirates and there are no good options no matter what you pick there will be at least one fleet of around 250-300 strength at a valuble or weak point on your empire, dependat on what you pick its either your latest colonised world, you homeworld and one more option that spawns 2 fleets, i cant rember the exact details, the point is you should not have events this devistating be totaly random, earily on this can completely wipe out your empire. if the game added in restrictions as to when certain events come up like the pirate one i mentioned earlier it would be brilliant but things like this are enfuriating, espesialy when your starting out or building a diplomatic empire. basically if you are building a game with randomness then you should place some restrictions on when things can happen, or it can ruin the expirence for some players, from what i've played at conventions the evil within looks to be slipping into the smae trap so i cant blame the developers for this when massive companys like bethesda are making the same mistakes but if you are reading this mr/miss dev, please restrict events that can pop up to only ones you have the means to deal with so unstopable forces beyond your controll dont ♥♥♥♥ the game up, please, this game would be a absoloute gem if you did but things like this are ruining it. anway this turnt a bit rambaly so im going to wrap things up, if you're willing to restart 5, 10, 15 or more times in the hopes that this time you dont get screwed by the randomness then go for it, if you can look past that then you will find a brilliant 4X strategy game, i personaly cant however, it gets in the way of me building a diplomatic and rich empire when i have to pour most of that wealth into my millitary to survive roming bands of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. now i have deffinatly gone on long enough so to close of, restrict randomness please.

												It's endless... endlessly boring.This is quite a harsh statement, so here are my reasons when comparing it to similar games (of which there are.. well.. endless amounts):- Nothing happening at first, then everything happens at once.- Micromanagement doesn't exist... nice? no. I feel like I am not even there. I feel like I am shouting a command down a tube which is then shouted down more tubes by other people and 10 tubes further becomes something I don't even care about anymore. Oh yea and the response is ""oh there is actually a planet and we are now doing something abstact you don't need to know about"".- Who are those aliens? Well, I felt like I didn't need to know.Why did I pay money for this game? God knows. I'm sure he's the only one.			"

												Ive persisted, but I cannot seem to get into this game. If you're looking for a 4x game where military victories are your go to, then this is the game for you. I personally found the other victory conditions near impossible to achieve and thus the game became quite dull. In addition the combat is not very exciting. Just build ships and load them with kinetic weapons. All of the other options are pretty much pointless. I also found large chunks of the games I was just ending turns, with very little happening. I recently purchased Endless Legend, which seems a lot more enjoyable. My advice if you're torn between the 2, dont opt for this.			"

												This game has way too many linear upgrades. Ohhh look now I can just increase my attack on my ships. Boring. Upgrades to make it so I can colinize all the planets as fast as possible, boring. It took the formula in Civ 5, grafted onto a space theme in a creative way and then made the combat and tech tree complete rubish. The whole game is so empty of strategy I feel like I spend the whole game grinding through the technology tree just to change the number on my weapons or the amount of science production I have. Sure, the UI is great. Sure, the art is great. But your combat is absolute BLAH and you expect us to just turn our heads. Ohhh ya linear upgrades and little movie combat scenes totaly add strategy and depth to this game. NO! It's lazyness! There is no advantage to having combat that can result in a draw OVER and OVER again. Ya, because ships totaly can't follow each other. In this universe the only type of combat is Drive By combat. Nobody has time to stick around and fight each other?!?			"

												- Too many bugs for a game that has been out for a couple of years. Performance is also an issue on the strategy screen in the late game, on a desktop i7 and a GTX 780.- AI uses a different set of rules than the player. They get to move their units before, after, or during the player's turn. The player can't do the same. This is not challenging, just very VERY annoying because it feels like the game makes up the rules as it goes, and the rules are not intuitive (""I forgot they could do that. Load last save. They can do that too? Ridiculous. Load last save."") For example if you want to assign 3 ships from one fleet to another, you must first remove them from their original fleet, then add them to their new fleet, which are both orbiting the same system. As soon as you remove the 3 ships from the original fleet, the AI will interrupt your turn and attack the original fleet minus the 3 ships. So you need to remember that you need to remove 1 ship first, then assign it to the new fleet, then repeat 2 more times, instead of just moving the 3 ships. The AI rearranges their fleets instantly.- Diplomacy is broken. On hardest difficulty the way to win is to finance your empire and drive your enemies into financial ruin by trading anything against X Gold per Turn. The more money an AI makes the more willing they are to give it to you.The empire building and research tree is mostly well done, altough the finer workings of the expansion penalty are rather unintuitive. This could have been a great game if it had better diplomacy, fewer bugs, and a round robin turn system instead of the abdomination they used instead. If they had also added decent combat it would even have been competition to the 1996 title MoO2, which so far remains unchallenged.			"

												Gather around little ones and I'll tell you a tale of an excentric trillionaire and nasty neighbors. A tale of generousity and betrayal. Allow me to tell you a tale from Endless Space. I started this game with the only race who really seemed appealing. The Horatio. The Horatio are clones, narcissistic clones of the original Horatio who genetically altered himself to create the 'perfect being' and now wants to make the universe more perfect by filling it with himself. Fans of Red Dwarf will suddenly be reminded of the episode in which Rimmer, an equally narcissistic character, did the same thing with Rimmer World. Hilarity ensued.So we start of with a bunch of scout ships being sent in opposite directioins about the ring of the galaxy, eventually encountering the other sentient race who on this occasion were the Vaulters. Now since I've never played this before, I knew nothing of this race and so I promptly left them be. Eventually setting up outposts on wormholes to the east and west of them. Relations were fine at first and trade routes established but trying to appease them proved almost impossible as they appeared to really dislike having neighbors. Eventually I get a request from them asking to open borders. This struck me as odd since they were anything but friendly towards my people. So I declined and carried on learning the finer points of gardening and economics. Then another request to open borders. This time it dawned on me and a big grin formed across my face - I had boxed them into a corner of the galaxy because I had colonized the only two wormholes out. After the 4th declined request to open borders they finally declared war on me and stormed through the wormholes with a moderately impressive fleet. But due to their hampered development they were unable to conquer any planets as their defences were too good. So they blockaded them instead and denied me the profits of those worlds. When I called for a cease fire they didn't return home either, they continued to blockage the systems so a game and cat and mouse ensued as they'd sometimes wander from system to system setting up blockades and I'd move manufacturing around to compensate. After galactic war 3 I finally got sick of them and forced a peace-treaty with a very generous donation of technology and a per round donation of Dust to appease them. Did it work? No. They just couldn't be apeased so the peace turned to a cold war and the cold war turned into outright invasion. Only this time, they'd used my generous donations to create several fleets of impressive power with heroes heading each one of them. Since most of my time had been spent focussing on the sciences and expanding the clone army across the stars my ships were totally unprepared for this. A brutal retreating battle of attrition ensued as fleet after fleet of clones were thrown at this Vaulter Armada created using our own funds. Eventually war ended and I suggested a cease fire - but little did they know I had a plan.With so much invested into the sciences it was easy to suddenly develop ships capable of standing up to this new threat and within next to no time I broke the cease fire and caught all of the Vaulter fleets offguard. When the last one was destroyed I looked to the diplomatic menu, expecting to see the negative consequences of a broken cease fire agreement. What did I see? Bonus points of respect from the Vaulters who were impressed by the might of my new fleet?! Oooo....kayyy.... then.... Suddenly understanding that our neighbors were complete nutcases who loved nothing more than a good fight I promptly dispatched my own fleets to blockade every single one of their planets and suffocated any of their efforts to build anything more impressive than a knife and fork. A scientific victory followed as the Horatio achieved the next plane of digital existance. My only conerns now is that without the need to return to our corporeal worlds the Vaulters are now free again to go rampaging through the galaxy looking for the next good fight.Now then, why was it nessersary to tell you this tale for a review? Well.. because these are the events which took place but it took over 20 hours of gameplay to happen and none of it is as impressive as it sounds. Endless Space literally has you spending most of your time looking at menus. All of the drama described really only happens when you sum up events in your head. It's like reading a book. It's nothing more than a bunch of words and page after page of more and more of them, but with some imagination it becomes alive. Endless Space is like that. It only works with imagination because in reality it looks very, very dull. The learning curve is also incredible as it isn't really clear what you should be doing most of the time and only with some pre-reading of guides are you going to get any enjoyment out of it. Can I recommend it? Not really. I've seen other 4X titles and they really do give you some visual feedback to how your empire is progressing and ES just doesn't really do that. Having more dots on the starmap in your colour just isn't very interesting and doesn't give you that sense of achievement needed to keep you moving forwards. The 'exploration' is limited as you are essentially on-rails due to the cosmic string and wormhole limitations. When you discover new planets there really isn't much variety to what you can find there. Quite often the game falls completely flat as you need to take several turns before you need to do anything else. Numbers are moving behind the scenes but you just don't get the nessersary feedback you need to understand if you have made good choices or bad ones. Maybe ES2 will address these issues and I certainly hope so because there is plenty of potential here for a rewarding experience once some changes are made.(this was a re-review from my previous one done quite some time ago. I gave the game more of a fair chance but still consider it as something I cannot recommend even on discount)			"

												It's fun, up until you run into an enemy. So far, even by races marked as ""peaceful,"" they do nothing but immediately slap me silly. The AI is far too difficult for me to have any fun, which is unfortunate. Whether I work really hard, or if I'm just screwing around, somehow the AI is like, 100 turns ahead of me. When I am working on my army, and have been focusing on it the entire game, and the AI shows up out of nowhere with a 15 ship army, to my 5, with a 3,500 strength, to my 800, something is wrong. I don't think I'll ever play this again.			"

Only this time, they'd used my generous donations to create several fleets of impressive power with heroes heading each one of them. Since most of my time had been spent focussing on the sciences and expanding the clone army across the stars my ships were totally unprepared for this. A brutal retreating battle of attrition ensued as fleet after fleet of clones were thrown at this Vaulter Armada created using our own funds. Eventually war ended and I suggested a cease fire - but little did they know I had a plan.With so much invested into the sciences it was easy to suddenly develop ships capable of standing up to this new threat and within next to no time I broke the cease fire and caught all of the Vaulter fleets offguard. When the last one was destroyed I looked to the diplomatic menu, expecting to see the negative consequences of a broken cease fire agreement. What did I see? Bonus points of respect from the Vaulters who were impressed by the might of my new fleet?! Oooo....kayyy.... then.... Suddenly understanding that our neighbors were complete nutcases who loved nothing more than a good fight I promptly dispatched my own fleets to blockade every single one of their planets and suffocated any of their efforts to build anything more impressive than a knife and fork. A scientific victory followed as the Horatio achieved the next plane of digital existance. My only conerns now is that without the need to return to our corporeal worlds the Vaulters are now free again to go rampaging through the galaxy looking for the next good fight.Now then, why was it nessersary to tell you this tale for a review? Well.. because these are the events which took place but it took over 20 hours of gameplay to happen and none of it is as impressive as it sounds. Endless Space literally has you spending most of your time looking at menus. All of the drama described really only happens when you sum up events in your head. It's like reading a book. It's nothing more than a bunch of words and page after page of more and more of them, but with some imagination it becomes alive. Endless Space is like that. It only works with imagination because in reality it looks very, very dull. The learning curve is also incredible as it isn't really clear what you should be doing most of the time and only with some pre-reading of guides are you going to get any enjoyment out of it. Can I recommend it? Not really. I've seen other 4X titles and they really do give you some visual feedback to how your empire is progressing and ES just doesn't really do that. Having more dots on the starmap in your colour just isn't very interesting and doesn't give you that sense of achievement needed to keep you moving forwards. The 'exploration' is limited as you are essentially on-rails due to the cosmic string and wormhole limitations. When you discover new planets there really isn't much variety to what you can find there. Quite often the game falls completely flat as you need to take several turns before you need to do anything else. Numbers are moving behind the scenes but you just don't get the nessersary feedback you need to understand if you have made good choices or bad ones. Maybe ES2 will address these issues and I certainly hope so because there is plenty of potential here for a rewarding experience once some changes are made.(this was a re-review from my previous one done quite some time ago. I gave the game more of a fair chance but still consider it as something I cannot recommend even on discount)			"

												It's fun, up until you run into an enemy. So far, even by races marked as ""peaceful,"" they do nothing but immediately slap me silly. The AI is far too difficult for me to have any fun, which is unfortunate. Whether I work really hard, or if I'm just screwing around, somehow the AI is like, 100 turns ahead of me. When I am working on my army, and have been focusing on it the entire game, and the AI shows up out of nowhere with a 15 ship army, to my 5, with a 3,500 strength, to my 800, something is wrong. I don't think I'll ever play this again.			"

												This game looks cool, but its really one of the most boring games I've played. You have almost no control over what happends in the game. Combat is based on cards with pretty graphics, and the only things really left to you to do are making sure all your systems have the exact same tech you just researched. The tech web looks intriguing, but is really just a bunch of stuff you either, a) have to research, or b) are +/- % of things that dont change anything. I love endless legend, so this is a shame.

												I would say ""Civilization... IN SPACE."" But it's far more than that. You can create your own custom race with strengths and weaknesses (like building an RPG character), customize your ships part-for-part, explore a HUGE tech tree, and generally not understand most of what's going on until you wiki or google it. A great 4X game to pass the time with that ""one more turn..."" mentality.Word of warning to anyone coming from Civ 5, though, this is SIGNIFICANTLY harder than that game and even on the lowest difficulty, it is possible to be OBLITERATED by the AI right-quick if you aren't playing in the most optimal way. It can make the game very anti-fun at times...			"

												I didn't like recent 4X games like Civilization and Fallen Enchantress so I was expecting to not enjoy this. Maybe I just didn't understand those other games or the genre has passed me by but they frustrated me. I also heard that this game has poor tutorials so I didn't have high hopes.In fact, I found the tutorials to be useful and informative. I didn't feel completely lost when I played and the game does a nice job of letting the player discover things for themselves. The tech tree is still intimidating and a handful of things confuse me (the battle cards for example, they don't explain well which of the powers affect you and which affect your opponent) but I understood the game enough to win my second game, albeit on the easiest difficulty. Everything about it seems really good so far, I'm looking forward to playing more.			"

												Solid game.Although I will write that I play Harmony, and they are anything but unplayable.  I will concede and say that their ""stock"" faction does not tap into their true potential, and a custom Harmony build is required.I found a mechanic within their faction trait that I have outright exploited - their resonant vessels FIS bonus.  Pair this mechanic with the maxed out ""big fleets"" trait, park 15 the cheapest ships (scout with no upgrades except for 1 deflector) in orbit, and enjoy a 30+ bonus to Food, Industry, and Science. Per planet.This faction is a juggernaut.I'm looking forward to the sequel, and I hope the sequel takes the ""Terminator 2"" approach to this franchise.			"

												-NEW REVIEW-After lots of research on this game, I won.To start off with, this game is ridiculously hard, even on the easiest difficulty. The AI was still beating me in score. The only reason I won is because the only weakness the AI has on the easiest difficulty is that it has no inhibitions on trading. I won through economic victory by having all of the AI pay me all of their money for nothing in exchange. Not so much of a victory to me.The AI on this game puts no limits on itself when it comes to expansion and production. The ""Newbie"" difficulty is basically normal difficulty with the exception that the AI loves you after you make peace with them (you start out in a cold war state, in which the AI will invade all of your systems unless you make the AI start on the other side of the map) and that they will just give you free money.I can unfortunately not bring myself to reccomend this game because of the ridiculously hard AI, even though the game is fun to an extent. -OLD REVIEW (I was salty)-So being new to this game I set the difficulty to ""Newbie"" which states ""all you would have to do is just hit the end turn button and you could almost win"". I did everything right, built a warship, some improvements, ect, and on this supposedly ""newbie"" difficulty, I got ƒucking invaded 15 turns in by three warships from another empire and lost. 15 turns in on the easiest ƒucking difficulty. Plus the linear system of movement is annoying, boring, and illogical. So, if you like to play against ridiculously hard and creepishly unpredictable AI and like to take 20 turns to get to a planet 5 star systems away because of the horrid movement system, as well as almost unreadable small text and a terrible UI, this is quite the game for you. I do not recommend this if you are a fan of the Civilization series at all. This was the sole reason I bought the game: to expand my 4x knowledge, and I was completely disappointed at my self at my waste of money that I could've used to buy Beyond Earth. Good day.			"

												At first this game seemed generic for a 4x, but as I got better the game got more complex. The complexity lies in the design of your empire as a whole. Every development is trading one benefit for another and the degree with which you can fine tune your Empire is pretty insane. The ability to sacrifice one aspect like population growth for researching technology. Getting invaded? In a dozen or so turns you can turn that research oriented empire into a production beast. How about repurposing your battle fleet as an extension of your research? Oh yeah, done in one turn. This game does drop the ball on combat. It's theatrical battles are beautiful and fun to watch, but they don't serve any greater function. The auto-battle button will be worn thin quickly. Also, the AI will instigate war for no reason when you get close to a victory. Then after losing said war, will pretty much all but stop trying. The AI is a very soar loser, I mean that literally. It gets very butt-hurt, very easily.That said, this game does lose a lot of it's appeal playing small maps and/or quick games. For a quick game it loses most of it's appeal. If you're looking for a quick action packed experience, this is about the farthest thing from what you want.If you're looking for a time investing empire manager, then this is worth the money. If you're looking for epic space battles, your enjoyment may be short lived with the exception of a couple of the playable races.			"

												It's Civ5 but on a galactic scale and 100 times more things to mess with.  There is a lot of this game that I don't understand but with time I've come to kind of get the idea.  The tutorials are the most BORING thing I've ever come across, but I guess thats to be expected since this game has so many different options.  You would spend hours if they tried to introduce every little thing to you in an informative video/scenario.  Your not just dealing with nations.  Your unlocking technology, building armadas, designing ships and dealing with alien races.  The combat I still haven't figured out so I'm 0-20.  It happens in 3 phases, long range, mid, and close.  They also have some bonus card perk system that I have no clue.Just because your smart enough to play Civ doesn't mean your smart enough for this game.  Yet  It still has the ""One more turn"" addiction factor			"

												I have played this game again and I changed my thought about it so I will rewrite my review.Endless Space is a strategy game that plays in space. (duhh)Your objective is colonize planets and discover other races and wage war with them.The tutorial is useless and I had to search most things on my phone and that's not what I want, I want to play the damn game!I must say that the graphics are average, sometimes the game looks good, but sometimes it doesn't.Singleplayer:It looks a bit like Civilization 5 but then downgraded...Especially with battles between ships, we all expect Star Wars like battles but instead, you get a cutscene, which is boring.Overall the game is pretty boring and it's just really hard to like the game and believe me, I tried to like it...There is one thing the game does very well and that's the resarch, you have 4 different research types and you kinda need to choose which one you want to concentrate on.Multiplayer:I couldn't find any match, it's totally DEAD!I also want to mention that this game eats RAM for me so if you have 4GB of RAM, you might want to reconsider buying it.Final verdict:The game does some things well, but it's just boring, boring and boring :(I give it a 4/10.

												I am not only a huge fan of 4x games, but I absolutely love the scifi genre. I was quite excited to play this game but unfortunately I was disappointed in the final product.While the game is entertaining, my largest complaint is content. The tech trees are are very similar, and there really just isn't much to the game. I expect my 4x games to last 30-40 hours at the very least for each playthrough. Games in Endless Space are usually over in a matter of hours, even on the largest of maps. The battle system is extremely boring and not very tactical at all, so after the first few playthroughs I would just select my cards and auto resolve the battles.Having bought it on sale for a steep discount, I can feel that I got my money's worth out of it, but it just doesn't hold my interest the way other 4x titles have. It simply just doesn't have the content to compete with other titles in the genre.			"

												The main problem with the majority of these 4X space games is that they never feel as if they have any guts to them. By which I mean you select AI opponents which may or may not have some flavour text but they invariably DON'T feel like individual alien races - just a few stats and traits different here and there. Where is the real exploration? The real thrill of encountering a new sentient but strange race? The adventure. It's all very well having varied systems that you slowly dominate with formulaic build patterns but the issue I have with these games is that they always feel just like games. It's like a board game - all tactics and no heart. And this one is no different. Whilst it may well be strategic and tactical it still doesn't feel like you are actually exploring space and for this reason I, personally, can't reccommend it. The whole genre has not really progressed since 1999's Alpha Centauri. After sixteen years one would have expected some kind of tangible progress.			"

												The sequal is now in early access and looks like they've put the effort where it's needed. When you have a game with this slick of a UI, it builds up expectations and makes the flaws stand out even more. It's a pretty big let down to spend a 1/2 day building up towards a space battle only to be majorly dissapointed by the mechanics.It was expected (based on the reviews I read), but I had to see for myself as the UI drew me in.Very curious to see how Endless Space 2 does. I like they're approach to simplify this genre while maintaining depth...  and I hope they pull if off.			"

												It is not a bad game, but it isn't a good game either, so I'll give a thumbs down.First of, there is nothing innovative about this game, it basically feels like Civ, but in space, with some weird/counterintuitive mechanics. For example:The combat is basically autoresolve, but with cards you can play. Those cards buff your fleet or debuff the enemy fleet and different card counter each other, on paper it sounds not bad, basically some sort of rock-paper-scissor system. BUT! There are so many cards and some cards even counter itself, that rock-paper-scissor becomes some weird thing where paper can suddenly counter scissors and rocks are a stupid thing to use agains scissors.Another thing is restricted fleet sizes. You can up the fleet size through techs to 22 Points (different ships use different set of points, for example Battleships use 2 Points, Dreadnoughts use initally 4, after a techupgrade 3). This leads to:a) rushing the techs for bigger fleets (Most of the time Bigger Fleet > Smaller Fleet)b) Quality of Ships > Quantity of Ships (Point a is still valid, but you can't zerg a superior ship with 20-30 Ships)Overall I would recommend rather to play Sword of the Stars (The first one, not the second), instead of this game.Good Points of this game are:Somewhat pretty graphicsEasy to get into/Hard to master (mainly because many things are somewhat explained poorly)Nice Lore (All the alien races are somewhat interesting)			"

												Beneath it's shiny surface lays a game that is ultimately frustrating. The setting, while never adequately explained, revolves around the idea that there are all these races developing in the wake of the ever-mysterious ""Endless."" A sterile user-interface, unsatisfying combat, lack of customizability, and a limited range of graphics often make this game feel soulless. Rather than feeling free to explore an endless expanse of stars, I more often am updating my building priority queue every time I get a new tech. This is the Excel spreadsheet of space games, I'm sticking with GalCiv 2.			"

Overall i wouldnt recommend this game because its 4x aspects aren't that good in my opinon. so if your looking for a 4xy game i would say stellaris would be better but if your looking for a indepth combat system this is the game for you.

I honestly REGRET giving $5 to this company. I would not give 1 cent to this company so that they do not continue producing GARBAGE like this game.Question for the nerd game developer. If I was a species in space developing ships and I built 50 ships in orbit around my planet, what would stop me from sending all 50 at once to attack an invading armada?

												I've been playing strategy games for a long time now. I started with the famous GalCiv 4x games and decided to get into RTS with Distant Worlds. I've gotten bored with both of them and decided to look for something new. Endless Space EE was one of the games that I picked up during the Autumn Sale, so I didn't spend a lot for it. Although it's 4x, I was willing to delve back into the genre just for something different.I have tried to like this game. I really have. The problem is that I can't get too far into it before I start to encounter a glitch. My ships won't move when I tell them to. I've researched this issue and found out that it's been an on-going thing now since the game first came out.I'm not going to slam the game. But having to quit a game that I JUST LOADED and reload (or even been playing for a bit) is irritating. It's a show-stopper and a deal-breaker for me, especially in light of the fact that the bug has existed for a long time and has never been fixed. Steam overlay is not the problem, since I've only used it ONCE during the several times I've tried to play this game.I'm normally more forgiving when it comes to bugs and glitches. Usually I can find workarounds for them, or just accept them as part of the game play experience. Heck, some bugs can be entertaining. But I can't overlook this one, since it breaks the experience for me.I could go on but I don't want to waste anymore time with this game. If you can tolorate a glitch of this magnitude and the game is on sale, go ahead and give it a try. Otherwise, stay clear of it. Maybe Endless Space 2 will be better...			"

												I played Endless Legend before I played Endless Space and I think that more than anything is why I don't care for ES as much. The one aspect that I really enjoy a lot more is the tech, in that it's much bigger and more varied and their is more to change and customize on your ships than the units in EL. That said the tech tree is also a hurdle as you either have to play several starter games to get a feel for it (like almost every other aspect of this game really) or sit and read through dozens of tiny tool tips to figure out what everything does and where you should be focusing your research. I find both games lack in diplomacy a bit. I found Endless Legend's tech tree to be easier to understand and better paced. I felt like I knew where I needed to be at a given point in the game while in Endless Space there is just too much to really know how and where to focus my research, though given enough play throughs I'm sure I'll figure it out.Also, the ability of enemy fleets to just appear in the middle of your empire due to warp jumps is a bit of a strain. It might be an interesting tactical crisis occassionally, but I prefer a game that lets me plan ahead, rather than having to garrison everything.Also just as in EL, the restrictions on army size are annoying, but seem worse here as there doesn't appear to be a way for armies to reenforce one another. So if your enemy has tech giving him a larger fleet size, you either can't fight him, or you have to watch fleet after fleet die just to weaken his fleet enough for one of yours to beat it.Lastly, just as in EL, the tactical battles are a draw back for me. I much prefer the sort of abstracted combat of other 4X style games. I don't need a battle mini-game to drag down an already long and slow genre.Over all, I recommend you go for either Galactic Civ 2, or Endless Legend instead of this. The former because I feel it does space 4x better, and the latter because it's basically a clone of Endless Space that does everything better.			"

												4/10 at full price. 5/10 on Steam sale.First, consider the source: I am not a huge 4X fan. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind building my empire by exploring, investing in improvements, researching technologies and creating ships. Creating ships to actually fight, but more on this later. Explore, Exploit, Expand and Eliminate are the four elements of this genre, but I believe this game is seriously unbalanced. Explore is okay. You build ships to go out and find planets. You eventually run into wormholes which you need a specific technology to use. You can research to get it, which has a certain interest. The problem is that expanding your empire results in a happiness hit to your people. I found the subjects of my empire becoming progressively more unhappy because of expansion. Okay, I can see that, but it seemed to be impossible to make them happy by investing in their systems by creating improvements, generating more FIDS (food, industry, dust and science-the point system at the heart of the game), or building ships. It made no sense. One of the other reasons they were unhappy was listed as ""population overcrowding"", but none of the planets were anywhere near their caps. But if one of the pillars of 4X results in a penalty, it kind of wrecks the experience, doesn't it?That said, if one enjoys that sort of thing, i.e. fighting the actual game to figure out how to keep your people happy while researching technologies and actually expanding your realm, then this game is probably going to be for you. The tech tree was kind of neat, but it was very unclear what each technology actually did. Some showed up as system improvements, others were weapon systems and ship types. Others required research in other branches of the tree. Some seemed to have no reason other than spending Science points. I don't mind planning and investing in new tech, but I would like to have a clearer idea of where my return on investment is going to lead.Diplomacy and trade. I never could figure out if the other AI was offering crappy deals or what. I never saw an advantage to trading with the AI. I formed an alliance with the other AI, but to break it when I wanted to expand into its territory, I had to wait 10 turns. Then, I had to wait another 10 turns to declare war. So forget launching a sneak attack or anything like that. Who would want to EVER do that in an empire-building game, right?The so-called combat mode was the worst part of the game. This is a 4x space game, not Pokemon! You set up one of three tactics, Spread Fire, which is every ship firing at every other ship. Nosebreaker, where every ship targets the first ship, and Guillotine where you target the first 1/3 of the other side's ships. You then have an assortment of strategy cards you can play at various points in the ""battle."" Battle itself is separated into 5 segments The Approach, Long Range, Medium Range, Melee and Results. Nothing happens during Approach and Results. So during 2/5s of the ""combat"" system, nothing really happens. That is a problem that doesn't really get much better.I have to admit, the individual ships look great, and the animations are slow, but smooth as the camera cuts around the Approach.Then combat starts, and you find that despite the fact that the ships are a mere several ship lengths from one another, the ships can't hit each other! They contain technologies that let them navigate the galaxy. They have thousands of Dust points invested in them, but they make Star Wars Stormtroopers look like Anne Oakley! And it had NOTHING to do with the strategy cards you play as far as I could tell. Even when both ships played Overclock, most of the shots missed at all distances.And the lack of ability to target individual ships is arbitrary and frustrating! My opponent would show up with a behemoth ship that was all Deflectors and Shields escorting other ships that some of which had damage, but there was no way to ""target"" any other ship. And it was all very repetitive; the ships Approach in the same order each time in orbit around what seems like the same planet. After I got tired of watching the same animations with ships inexplicably missing each other time after time, and ending in draws, I decided to set my formations and strategies ahead of time and let the computer auto resolve the battle. Then, of course, I lost half my fleet!And I kept getting draws. If one craft from either side is left alive, the battle is considered a draw. The ships simply drift, right next to one another during the results phase. Overall, the system is very silly.This system makes the idea of going through the 4x system really repulsive because it takes the ""Eliminate"" out of the whole system. I want a combat system where movement, formation, offensive and defensive systems, propulsion, ship size and planetary system features allow/require me to formulate my own strategy and fight the battle until one side's ships are destroyed, or they surrender or flee the field.I've played StarDrive 2, Vangard Prophecy and Sid Meyer's Starships. I enjoy the turn based combat from VP where you set the motion movement of the ships based on a balance of Engines, Shields and Weapons and the ship moves into position on the next turn firing as it goes. How you move and the balance of ESW help determine whether you are successful. Unfortunately, there is no Explore, Exploit and Expand to that game.The hex grid board game feel of Starships at the in-system level was also enjoyable requiring you to think how you move, when you fire and what system you use. The battle card system is important, but it doesn't necessarily make or break your tactics. StarDrive simply felt like Gratuitous Space Battles grafted onto Endless Space's 4X system. It needed more tactical movement and targeting options, IMO.The problem is that even after 20 hours in the game; I really have no idea what I should do different the next time. IMO, you should be able to play a game and learn from the outcomes what to do differently to effect the next outcome. For this reason as well as others listed in this review, I really can't recomment this game.			"

												Its not what you think it is...its far worse...Its turn based game (Which isnt bad, but its something they seem to avoid mentioning) more akin to Risk then say Sins of a Solar Empire. Its as much as a space stratigy game as Settlers of Catan is a City Simular. Personally i was dissapointed in it from the get go. The graphics were simplistic and flat. Im not sure where they got those pictures from on the store page.I got it when it was on sale and i still regret spending money on it. Do i recommend this game?NOYou have far better options out there and some at a better price. Try Planetary Anhilation. Or a good 90s game: Starwars Rebellion. Both of which are far better priced for what they offer then this game.Or even StarDrive, as it allows you to make your own civilization up.			"

												i got this game from humble bundle so i did not pay full price for it nor any of its sale prices, whatever those might be. this is why i recommend this game. now for 30$... i would most likely not pay that amount of money to play this game. i was not expecting for it to get me hooked, and yet 2 hours passed and i was still playing this game, but that is how long it took me to get the hang of it. the tutorials give you a fair amount of information but i found the ""google it when you encounter it"" method to help me more than reading through the tutorial, but nonetheless it is there.the game is quite in depth, requiring a certain strategy, according to what faction you are playing as. the maps can be either tiny or extremely massive with various shapes. the atmosphere of the game is nice with a very relaxing soundtrack playing in the background. no voice acting but that is not an issue.my issue is the fact that a campaign is lacking. that really challenges the longevity of the game, thus my innability to recommend the game for 30$.

												Endless space is a 4x (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) turn-based strategy game. As any 4x game, you have different victory conditions that you may choose to pursue in order to beat your opponents, be it technological victory,plain domination or whatever your preferred style of play is.The Factions are balanced and nicely done, not only that, you can even create your own faction by selecting positive and negative traits. I like how they all play out differently and each of them has their own story and culture.To make your ""civilization"" flourish you have to colonize new planets, balance their output of basic resources and collect the luxury resources that help your empire. You can set Taxes, decide what to build in the entire system and specialize the single planets.Every hero has two classes and statistics that help you determine what is his best role, you can place it as a Governor on a system or to command a specific type of fleet. Heroes gain experience and you can choose various skill in a big tree, big enough so I can safely say that even if both players get the same hero (which is impossible in the same game) they might end up with completely different characters.The combat is original. Some hate it, some love it. Me? I personally like it a lot. When two fleets encounter, they engage in a battle consistent of 5 phases (3 of them are combat phases). The Initial phase, where everyone lines up, the Long range phase, the Medium range phase, the Short range phase and the conclusion. In these phases you can give orders and play ""cards"" that represent tactics (which you can unlock through technology or heroes). Every tactic then has a general group that can counter or be countered by what the enemy plays. I find it a streamlined fun experience, it just gives you the good stuff to do while you watch the battle unfold.The customization of the ships is near perfect imho, you choose the components you want to install, modules, weapons (and at what range), defenses, of course, after first choosing a ""frame"". After that you name your ship and you can produce it in series. Later, when your technology is better, you might want to Update your old design, you can do that simply and then update any old ship of the same class.The learning curve is so-so, I mean, it's still a 4x game, but it's very easy to learn compared to other ones. I think it has a good balance between accessibility and complexity. You could really say it's easy to learn but hard to master, especially against human foes. The AI is good, but not the best, I would recommend playing it with friends or other people, even if it's just you and another friend with 6 bots.All in all, I recommend this to anyone who likes space sci-fi and 4x games, buy it with the expansion, it's worth it, especially new players coming into the 4x genre. Sword of the Stars players might find this game too casual, then again, I find the SotS series, while great, very demanding, more like a chore than an actual game; that's why I prefer this one.			"

												The biggest waste of time I ever had.In the short time I played it, I yelled more in frustration then any other game.I disable the tips...I like to play games without tips and just learn as I go,but this game's setup if such ridiculous amounts of garbage, that you pretty much need to have them on so not to completely♥♥♥♥♥yourself at the beginning.First game,started on newbie difficulty since it was my first time playing the game.Sent my starting fleet to the first planet, one ship (the scout) got there before the other,even though they where in the same fleet.There where two pirates, and they destroyed the scout without a problem.I then started over.Second game, also newbie difficulty,I decided to try and make a bigger fleet at the start...There is no way to see how much food or scrap you have...You can see how much research and dust you have, but not food and scrap? Why?But in the fleet page thing where you make you ship setups there wasn't a build button.Which is just ridiculous.To build a ship, you go to a colonized planet, and in the bottom left part of the menu, is where you build your ships.It then takes several turns to make them.Which, I found out each turn is one in game year...It took me 28 turns to build three ships,I then got a event, with the choices,+500 dust,100 xp to weakest hero,50 xp to strongest hero.I didn't have any heroes yet,so I hired all three with the saved dust I had.I then chose the 100 xp for the weakest hero...And not a one of my heroes got a single xp point.They all had 0/10 before and after, so more wasted time.Then after more rage, I assigned one to my fleet, and one to my system,without looking at their stats.I did though and found that I chose the wrong heroes for the job, and tried to switch them out...But I couldn't, I had to wait 6 turns to re-assign my heroes...6 in game years to assign my heroes to new positions...That is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.This game game me a missive head-ache,so I just un-installed it.If you like overly complicated turn based galactic civilization sims, with garbage interfaces, that you need tips enable to fully understand,then this game is for you.

												For me this game could have been great seeing as it's in space, and is turned based stratergy but soewhere between initial concept and develpment they made some interesting choices. I found the number of races a little disapointing having come out of Civ 5. Admitidally in Civ 5 there is much less to differentiate between each empire except colour and indiidual units but some races seemed a little lazy for example The Terran Empire and A Machine Race share the same ship designs which was annoying for me. I also found the interface anoying and unhelpful. An example of this was when I had amassed several very large fleets of top end ships and decided to declare war. The interface told me my strength was 2nd. Nothing else and no indication of who was the strongest and weakest. Regardless I plowed on and declared war. After some rather poor Rock Paper Scissor combat in some systems (more on that later) I started my invasion, only to find that in my next turn I was being opposed by (in one system) 17 fleets.  This is just an example of how the game refuses to give you important and in depth information like a game such as Civ 5 does. Where you are able to find out your milatary strength against others and are advised on whether you at least stand a chance of winning in a war against an opposing empire. Another problem I have with the interface and general magement is the management of your systems. Again if we use Civ 5 as a comparison, in Civ 5 you are prompted on production in your cities and are once again advised on what to build depending on the direction you are going. Endless Space however desides to do none of this and will gladly let you waste valuable turns not doing anyting in systems making management a chore as I ended up constantly checking my economy screen to see if anthing was bone idle. The game was also rather unhelpful when it came to deciding what to build. Yes a game that holds your hand each step of the way in games like this isn't fun but at least an indication or a sugestion that if your citizen satisfaction is 0% try building these would be nice instead of forcing me to wonder for hours why everyone is striking. Now to the combat, Endless Space bosts a big cinematic battle where from artsy camera shots you can watch your fleets go toe to toe with enemies in epic space battles. Sadly this is not the case, yes you do get to watch as fleets fight each other but your only involvement is through picking 'cards' to use in a rock paper scissors type match. This completely mechanic ruins the combat for me and ruins the game as I watch helplessely while my vastly superior fleet gets destroyed becus their card trumped mine. The other annoying part of the combat is that I was unable to choose which enemy fleet to attack( even when there are 17 of them) which caused more frustration as I find I can't attack the same fleet twice (if I have several fleets and they have several fleets in the same system). This frustration and the combats complete shallowness adds up to make rather boring battles overall. Especially when you compare it to something like Civ 5 which lets you choose who you want to attack AND if your unit is superior to your enemies one you win. Revolutionary! Overall then this game looks good on the surface but on the inside (for me at least) the core is thoroughly rotten. Give this one a miss a miss and if you want a turn based trategy game get Civ 5 its much much better			"

												Endless Space is a great 4X game.  I keep coming back to it to play again and again.  At first I wasn't sure how I would like the tactical battles where you only decide formation and attack plan, but no actualy command.  BUT...I really like it.  It allows me to make commander like decisions and see how my fleet acts it out.  The heroes are a nice touch and the races each have definitive pros and cons.  The thing I like most is how every time I play the map generator keeps the game interesting.  I've logged over 300 hrs and will continue to log even more.  This game will remain one of my all time favorite games.			"

												This game I've been very up and down about, in terms of opinion. When I first played it I immediately started noticeing problems, such as the terrible tutorial (while thorough is incredibly boring), or all in all the lack of AI communications! As a big total war and civilization fan it was pretty disapointing, but I decided to stick with it and keep trying. As a progressed further and learned things on my own I got to experience a lot more (such as the ability to research more diplomatic negotiations previously unavailable) and also learned of the different ways to manage the economy and exploit certain economic grown (meaning to have your planets be a bit more elite in producing whatever you wish to use it for). I started to have a lot more fun, and although the battles are rather boring (it doesn't allow for interaction during it without the disharmony DLC, which I plan to get) it is still a ton of fun. Don't be like me and try this game for 5 minutes and be aggravated by the lack of content, all it takes is some love and time and plenty is introduced. Especially with the disharmony DLC and the DLC coming out for it, this game is indeed as complicated, and just as fun as Civilization 5 or any of the Total War series and I definately recommend it!

												Could be a great game, if it wasn't for two things:1) The combat system, while it is an interesting approach, in the end tends to boil down to luck, with little real influence on the player side.2) The UI is slow, really really slow. How such an interface can, on a modern quadcore computer, feel like you are stuck knee-deep in a puddle of mud, with an 80 pound backpack on your shoulders, is beyond me. Finishing calculations for a turn takes a good while, even with a very small galaxy and a single opponent. Even moving your fleets, or scrolling the map feels sluggish.If those two things are not a problem for you, give it a spin, as the tech tree is pretty well designed, the races well-balanced and it does have a distinct addictivity to it.

												TLDR: Basically a simplistic version of most 4X games out there.Gameplay is based around simplified versions of tech tree, diplomacy and base improvement in combination with a tech-prerequesite based expansion a la GalCiv2. Will probably put off most standard 4X players who want more depth than this. At least the UI is pretty slick in comparison to other 4X games. Can only reccomend to players who really want to try the 4X genre but are confused by the many options and choices presented in other games.			"

												An incredibly bland 4x startegy game for the kind of people who play Civilization with a calculator and a spreadsheet, and think that the fun in Grand Strategy is eeking out every last optimised drop of waffle production from your digital serfs. Completely devoid of anything resembling charm bar some flavour text which doesn't impact on the strange, monolithic screens of graphs and text that after completing your Endless Spaceology PhD. will allow you to discern what your space-empire is doing. The game offers numerous means of automating the experience, which I appreciated as an acknowledgeent by the developers that actually playing Endless Space is not enjoyable in the least. You can watch your ships battle and win or lose based on the unknowable workings of the machine. It's a bit like watching somebody else play Homeworld whilst you're at work.			"

												This game seems good until you hit turn 150. After that you can expect crashes, freeze ups and huge memory loss. The tech tree in the game is very...How can I say this....All over the place....I'm so glad I didn't pay $80 for full Endless package and instead got the Emperor Edition on sale. Think I'll stick with some other 4x game and hope for the devs to go under while I wait for a fan made unoffical patch that fixes the bugs. Other than that the game does look good in the graphics department. But overall your better off playing some other 4x title.Since I now have it bought I will play it to test the limits more.UPDATE....I have now decided to play on small maps to beat the game with every empire and so far it hasn't crashed with only 2 empires in. With this game fully patched up it might be worth a second look if you can snag it at the right price. As for other saying about the loss of old techs, Don't listen to them. There are arrows to the side of each tech when building a new ship. Those arrows will let you select an older tech if its needed due to a loss of a resource via war. I will give this game one more update after playtesting large maps again, Because thats whay I bought the game. I might even change my thumbs down to a thumbs up.			"

												When i bought this i was led to believe that buy buying the emporer edotion it would come with free updates and you were entitled to dlc content thats like a seaon pass. its for that reason why i even bought the emperor edition and now there is a 9.99 dlc for one race and some ships. Now other then that its a good game but you can get more money out of distant worlds universe + some mods and its easy to mod and there is alot of mod content endless space has none of that. However if your a sucker for amazing visual like a cat on lsd staring mindlessly at a screen then ya its a great game. Not much depth there are no aspects of this game you cant find in many other games and there done better minus the visuals they realy are prety! Years later its an $60 game that has 30 hours loged, and the diapointment from this game is why i ahve not bought another endless title, nor will i get the 2nd and i love 4x look at my libary for proof of that!

												While i say i like it, it comes with a huge rider on it.  It is enjoyable on the first play thru, but once you have played to a certain point, it is repetitive and tedious.  I have tried to play a second or third time with a different faction and it does not have the same magic as first time thru.  Good if you can get it super cheap but be warned, most people will only play it once......			"

Posted: October 29, 2015
												I was very much looking forward to a decent modern 4X game. Having very much enjoyed the Master of Orion games and Ascendancy from the DOS days, I was hoping for something new and exciting from the genre. I had tried Galactic Civilizations 2 before and it was clunky, uninspired and unfun, maybe this would be different?This game was completely unfun to play from the beginning. It was very frustrating all around and I couldn't get into the game at all. The star system looks beautiful, I love the way the worlds look and slowly rotate, esp. since you can zoom in on each one... but the UI and game play were not intuitive nor entertaining.The races seemed largely unoriginal, and almost all of them were based on humans, unlike the vastly different races available in Master of Orion and Ascendancy. The tutorials just had popup text over the actual window and only told you what parts of the view port were, not how to use them. Way too much informationation all at once, and not letting you actually poke at any of them while explaining things did not help you figure it out.It took a long time to figure out how to even move ships. I noticed a ship icon next to my home world and couldn't figure out how to tell it to move until I right clicked directly on a system and away a ship went. Right clicking a little bit off just unselected the ship, so I kept thinking I was doing something wrong, and the mouse cursor doesn't change to indicate that the ship would move. Ok... So you right click to move. Except after exploring a nearby system, trying to explore the next star system just doesn't work again (unselecting again), probably because I need some research to be able to travel further from my home world, but I couldn't even figure out what any of the drives did, how to move further, or what was wrong. The game didn't give me a message when I tried to go to nearby stars to tell me why I couldn't go to that one vs this one, it just unselected the movement, like slapping my hand for doing something wrong without saying why. A message saying, ""You need Long Distance Space Exploration"" or whatever would have gone a long way here. In fact, looking things up in the Wiki and doing searches for this never came up with the information necessary to explore, and I looked all over through the research tree, which was it's own lesson in frustration.The research tree gives minimalistic information in popups, that told you the names of what you could get from the research and some story about that research, but didn't tell you a darned thing about the research itself. And you can't mouse over things in the popups to figure out what the heck they are (though Ascendancy also had this problem). The research tree tells you almost nothing useful, and the names of a lot of things mean nothing.An example: A research you get near the beginning is called ""Compact Fusion Reactors"". This has the text:""While great leaps forward in fusion technology are on the horizon, the ability to miniaturize and simplify existing fusion technology also provides practical rewards."" - Ok... this doesn't tell me much.It says it unlocks ""Advanced Magnetics Drive"" and ""Colonize Arctic"". Ok, I get the Colonize one (though who knows why a new Fusion reactor would unlock colonizing arctic worlds), but what the heck does ""Advanced Magnetics Drive"" do? Does it allow my ships to travel further? Faster? Is it a new module for engines for building new ships? Apparently, it just adds 2 movement speed to all of your ships once you get it. I had to look it up on a Wiki to figure out what it did.The combat system was incredibly confusing from a new player's perspective. I experienced combat on turn 3 with my scout ship up against a couple of pirates... I didn't want to lose my scout ship, so I had all these cards to pick from, so I just picked retreat cause I knew I was going to die otherwise. Then a weird cinematic-ish battle happened where I couldn't tell what was happening at all... and suddenly my ship ran away, back towards my home system. Which is where another pirate was waiting, and this time succeeded in destroying my scout. On turn 4. Great way to learn the game!I never even met up with another race because I couldn't travel very far in the couple of attempts to play, and was so frustrated by the game at this point, I switched back to playing old MS-DOS 4x games again.AddendumThis game is taking many ideas from Master of Orion 2, which I played again after writing this review and could see all the parallels. But MoO2 is intuitive and doesn't require a tutorial, let along a 3rd party guide to play. It came with a book, yes, but even that wasn't necessary because it was easy to just jump into the game having played 4X games before.In MoO2, when you click a ship and then mouse over a star system, it does one of two things. If it is in range of your systems, it draws a green line and gives an ETA for how long it would take to get there. If it is out of range, it draws a red line to it and says how far away it is so you can tell it's too far for your fuel to reach. In ES, there is no indication that the game has a clue there is another system there, no cursor change, no highlight, nothing.In MoO2, when you are presented with the 8 different research trees and which branches you can learn, if you right click on a research, it tells you what it gives you. Right from the beginning, I can right click on ""Standard Fuel Cells"" and it tells me ""Supplies sufficient energy to propel a ship 4 parsecs before refueling."" - Ok, I now know exactly what research to work towards if I want to travel further. I don't even know what it says for the correct research in ES, since I could never find it, but I doubt it mentions anything about your ships travelling further from the popup information...I spent almost 2 hours trying to get this game to work for me, and I could not. I'm certain other people pushed themselves through the problems, but to me spending 2 hours and still not even knowing what to do was frustrating.			"

												 I'm not gonna go deep into description about ES here, as other reviews have already covered that quite well.  The one helpfull thing I can say about it is: THIS GAME IS EVERYTHING STARSHIPS UNLIMITED SHOULD HAVE BEEN. If you're looking for a better version of SU: look no further. Not to slam on SU; it was a great and addictive game. But this has a better and more diverse tech tree, better graphics, better music (slightly), the combat is different, but easy enough to figure out after a couple times.  I am very happy I bought it. 10/10. Well done devs...			"

												This is a good 4X game and deceptively addictive. You will lose hours playing it and then want to come back for more, not really knowing why.Pros:-Easy to use menus.

You have to think and plan ahead. Seriously. Cons:-While the famous tech tree is cool, it is also BS. They basically stripped basic tech from a space faring civ so you have to research simple things. And sometimes a simple piece of tech will require another item to be researched to be fully used. -You will read about how hard it is. It is hard. Very hard.

												Combat is completely broken (word is: long-range kinetics always win) and the victory conditions are not well thought out (straight-up currency win? what?). I was hoping to scrach that itch left from the disappointing vanilla release of Civ: Beyond Earth, but these are not the droids you're looking for. Scuttlebutt says the developer abandoned updates, balances and fixes for this title early to work on the (recently announced) sequel. Desparately needs some kind of scenario or campaign mode to teach you its lore and game mechanics.			"

												To give an idea of the gameplay, it is essentially a civilization clone. It is streamlined and dumbed down to be more accessible to new players.Rather than having a terrain system, each planet comes with it's own perks, making it easier for newcomers to understand the habitation system. The research is presented as a web, which is very easy to understand. The resources are more straightforward. The units are where the game shines, where you are allowed a good amount of customization.What could be so bad about this game, then?- With the simplification of the terrain, the replay value died. Every game you play has a pretty similar feel, whereas you could change the settings of a Civ game and have it go completely differently. After a few games, I feel I've seen all the game has to offer.- With the streamlining of the game, there's not a lot to do. Select options. Expand borders. Sometimes attack. The strategy of the game incorporates no abstract thinking, and you find the key to success is how well you can handle the menus. This is boring.- As I said, customization of units are the best thing about this game. For the first little while, it's fun checking out all the options a ship has. However, especially since a ship has limited stats, the novelty dies off, and you'll wish for pre-sets.- Each battle comes with the option to view a cutscene. You'll want to see this cutscene twice, at most. It's long and boring.This game doesn't do anything that Civ hasn't done better. If you want a similar experience for free, ""CivFree"" is a pretty similar game. Definitely do not pay $30 for this game that I would bet you would not spend 10 hours on.			"

Many and editable factions with influence on the strategy. Good editable random space-systems. I like the battles, you choose tactics for three battle-rounds, the rest is up to your ships, this is different in Endless Legends. Great soundtrack, I would compare it even with the Mass-Effect-Soundtrack. Contra: Well, the AI is very hard, but you can choose your level of difficulty. The diplomacy works, but rather simple.So, welcome on board, Captain.			"

Because this actually had a lot more potential and looked a lot better and the videos were great.The videos draw you in, show a lot of exciting combat.

End turn.  Build one more thing. End turn. (x10).Yep.  You basically just end turn, a lot.  The tutorial is terrible.  It's a picture with text (Ok, an advanced picture with text).  I lost my fleet because the tutorial came up and stopped me from clicking anything, I lost before I could finish reading the large volume of text information, and it canceled it's self so I couldn't finish learning battles.  I tried a manual battle, it sucked.  Auto is the way to go.  Which kinda sucks too.  There are only 3 ship classes you can use, this is after I researched 60% of the military research and 40% of everything else.  It's a really long boring RTS with great graphics with misleading videos to get you to buy it.			"

												Gave this game around ten hours or so of play and in the end the best thing I can say is I'm glad I bought it on sale for one dollar. The basic theme and systems of the game make sense but there is absolutely zero polish to the game. There are problems here which a decent Q&A testing or even an open Beta testing series would have found and fixed. The game just feels unfinished. Diplomacy is a joke; the diplomacy system in Civ games is better (and that's saying something). The tech tree takes forever to move through in the early game and the different ship classes can all be skipped. Only the final ship class is even worth your time. Space combat is a joke; pick three ""cards"" to determine your fleets' strategy and then sit back. You can't control or change a thing. Horrible idea, horrible. I won't be continuing to play this game.			"

End turn.  Build one more thing. End turn. (x10).Yep.  You basically just end turn, a lot.  The tutorial is terrible.  It's a picture with text (Ok, an advanced picture with text).  I lost my fleet because the tutorial came up and stopped me from clicking anything, I lost before I could finish reading the large volume of text information, and it canceled it's self so I couldn't finish learning battles.  I tried a manual battle, it sucked.  Auto is the way to go.  Which kinda sucks too.  There are only 3 ship classes you can use, this is after I researched 60% of the military research and 40% of everything else.  It's a really long boring RTS with great graphics with misleading videos to get you to buy it.			"

												I have the Emperor Edition, and, when I use Endless Space Game Save Editor and see how my chances of success are before the first turn right  out of the box, then playing a slot machine in Vegas is eaually good or bad (I don't play slot machines).The graphics are really outdated and performance really sucks but it's made with Unity - so what is to fix there?Most importantly, Endless Space... yeah, where is it ?I didn't get the feeling of Endless Space but Endless Space wasted on my hard disk, so the game got spaced !

												Very deep and complex yet awesome strategy game, I'm enjoying and loving it so far. Can't wait to play it again and again and again. I recommend this only to people who have lots of PATIENCE, I tell you, this has a bit of a steep learning curve for people who aren't familiar with these kinds of games. But overall, once you get the hang out of it, it's really fun, I guarantee it.			"

												This is a good if shallow space 4x. The UI is probably the best in class. Minimalistic, simple, and intuitive. Each species also ends up playing differently. I also like the random events that happens. It can be frustrating sometimes but freshens up the game.It does come with some big cons though. Ai is nonexistent and the way they compensate is to have them cheat like a mofo. You can have triple your enemy's output and they will still be able to out-supply and out-produce you in a war. The technology tree is also very shallow which basically boils down to bigger values and better upgradesI would recommend 4x and space fans to try it out on a sale or free weekend. It's gone on sale for dirt cheap a couple of times, the latest one being $1			"

												I really do like this game.  It's like Civ but in space.  The factions give you enough different ways of playing the game to keep it interesting and you can even customize them.  I have a very big problem with it, though.  I have tried playing multiple times with friends and one of us always runs into a game breaking bug before we can finish a game.  We've tried playing through a dozen or so games and we have yet to be able to complete one.  This is unacceptable.  I wouldn't consider buying anything by AMPLITUDE in the future unless I knew it wasn't this poorly made.  They were so close to having a great game.  Try at your own risk.			"

												Its a strange one this game, I find myself going back to it now and again because its a nice attractive strategy game that gives you a lot to think about once all the races are met and you have built up your empire and fleets. It is quite slow at the start though and it could do with better diplomacy, better invasion graphics, more choice for the events, and a bit more character throughout. But its a sedate enjoyable strategy game and the combat is always great to watch. Yet to get to grips with the new expansion but it looks promising.			"

												Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing ruined with this ""Emperor Edition"". Planets are now instantly conquered regardless of how much defence you have built on a system. The racial abilities have all been butchered to death and all have the same bonuses for EVERY ship of that race, making it pointless to use anything by the largest ships. Awful. Shame on you Amplitude Studios. The mark of a good developer is knowing when to leave well alone...A great game that has been BROKEN and will never be the same again.			"

												Clumsy AI, really poor combat system and a bad blend of a concept. Pretty to look at but it tries to forcefully merge jump-in and sit-down gameplay. Think of it as a very, very basic empire management game that attempts to overcompensate with a strange (and poorly explained) approach to warfare. Would be really decent if it settles on one side of the coin.			"

												This is a great 4X game.  The UI is very nice, but the art beneth the UI is fairly simplistic.  Deciding where to go in the tech tree is a bit tough when other empires are at war with you.  And it took a bit for me to figure out how to raid planets, basically you must have troops, and the other seige units are just to take out the defenses.  I wish you had more autonomy / control in the detailed battles, like being able to fire the shots yourself.  Instead the detailed battles are just cinematics, with the ability to change the next tactic.  Since you don't know what they will choose anyway, changing the next tactic doesn't really gain you anything unless the battle is evenly matched.  I really like 4X games the first time so I spent quite a few hours on this.  But once I got through the tech tree and beat the game a number of ways, I was ready to move on to a non-4X game.If you like 4X games, you'll probably like this one.  The new things it brings to the table is futuristic technology.  But the gameplay is pretty much the same as any other 4X.			"

												this game is basically like if your parents bought you every single birthday present ever, and gave them to you all at once, there're just soooo much content. everything, from the shape of the galaxy to the individual perks of your custom race can be changed. and the gameplay is no different. while not as epic or spectacular as games like Civiliation, you'll launch this game, and after a while you'll switch windows to check the time when you realise you've spent the whole day just playing this one game. it engrosses you in a weird way, rather than shoving action and epicness at you, it smothers you with endless amounts of content, and the best part is that very little of the game is hard to understand. One would assume that with so much detail to go into, the menus would be cluttered and getting from one emu to another would be a chore. Nope. the way this game handles it's content is amazing as well. With a few exceptions, I knew what every option and every symbol in the game meant simply by hovering over the icon. The organisation and streamline is amazing as well. everything is exactly where you'd want it to be, because it makes so much sense. I cannot recommend this game enough to you. please, get it if you love 4X games and want to do justice to yourself, I am not disappointed.			"

												Endless Space is a decent 4X game. The races are very diverse and uunique. The skill tree is large yet easy to navigate. The randomness of the galaxy and solar systems allow enough variance that you much constantly adapt strategy. There is no one route to victory. The negatives are combat is about as bland as it can get and very confusing the first few skirmishes. Just acept the fact you will loose almost all encounters in your first play through.  Which isn't that bad, but the deal breaker for me is the fact this game doesn't tell you when a unit still has moves. Say you're at war with another race and you send a fleet around to flank. The move order takes 3 turns to complete, which is outside of your empire and you forget about them. Well they'll just sit there and never make a sound until they are attacked or you happen to move the map to there sector and remember them. I just couldn't play the game like that. I'd get caught up managing systems and tech and realize I hadn't moved a unit for 10 turns.			"

Suffer from the perinial poor AI and harder settings just means the CPU gets a ridiculous bump in stats, but plays so badly so it's all about playing the early game right. Still, very enjoyable and I've been playing too much. Has a nice balance between elements and a lot of little polish elements.

The reaserch tree has the same problems all the same colors for each tree (again to bland) The combat is interesting at first, but after awhile the lack of options gets a bit dull) If you like 4X and can pick it up on sale (I did) this game will be a good value.

												4X turn-based strategy with a focus on economy & tactics. The music is very immersive and changes based on where you are in the game (planetary view, shipyard, etc.). Combined with the crisp, clean visuals the devs have found a way to make the sterile menu navigation somehow not boring. Sadly this charm can only last so long since most of the game is spent digging through menus trying to balance your empire on a see-saw. The biggest graphical disappointment is how ""flat"" the galaxy feels; there are eye-catching planetary views when zoomed into a star but from above it feels like playing a board game. Although there is combat, there is an ""Auto"" mode that lets you pre-load commands so many battles end up playing themselves. Even with the wealth of tooltips, many basic game features are hard to grasp, such as the seven victory conditions. The devs have been working hard to improve the game but the current tutorial is really barebones and is basically popup screenshots that explain things that the tooltips already show.Endless Space is a highly customizable sandbox in space that offers you many unique ways to conquer the galaxy (or not at all; you can disable all victory conditions). A work in progress worth picking up if you can handle the difficulty and steep learning curve.			"

												It's different enough from Civ that I enjoy playing it every once in a while, but the amount that sheer random chance factors into the game makes it unappealing at times. Whichever player starts the game with a super powerful system nearby is very likely to crush their adjacent enemies and just win the game. It can make player decision making and overall skill feel incredibly irrelevant.			"

												I think this is probably the best 4X type game that I've ever played, and the developers seem pretty serious about continually expanding it. It seems like if you're into this sort of turn-based game then this is THE one to buy. I'm still not sure how I like the ""card"" mechanic for ship battles, but it's certainly more interesting than the usual stuff that's based purely on random number generation. The tech trees and diplomacy systems are very well done. The diplomacy system in particular is the best such system I've seen in this type of game.			"

Also turn off the Pirate option because for whatever reason, the pirates tend to either be very weak or attack your ships with full might. I recommand getting an online guide to go along with it. There's so many ways to win and also to loose. This game...it's just really hard....			"

												Endless Space is one of the better 4X Space games out there. On the surface it’s a lot like the rest of the Master of Orion “clones.” You’ll take control a galactic empire, research new ways to oppress your subjects and exterminate your neighbors, design ships to suit your whims, build great public works projects, and generally act like cartoon Space Nazis. What makes Endless Space a little different is the amount of customization. For instance, there are tons of ways to upgrade the planets in your star systems. Want to turn an Edenic Paradise into frozen tundra planet populated by only a few scientists? Endless Space will let you do that.  I especially like the heroes who can lead your fleets or act as Governors on your planets. They gain xp for their service and can be upgraded in numerous different ways. Maybe you could train one hero to be a magnificent propagandist who just needs a microphone to stave off riots. Or perhaps your hero could focus on raising food production, increasing research output, or being better at blowing up enemy ships.There are some downsides. For instance, I don’t like the combat which sort of plays out like rock, paper, scissors. It really sucks. Also, the tutorial is inadequate.TLDR; It’s interesting if you want to manage a big galactic empire, but combat is disappointing. If you prefer blowing up ships and conquering empires to building them then you should look into something else.  "

No but seriously - it's challenging but doesn't cheat - it's complex but not confusing (well, once you understand the resource system) - it's hilarious, smart, and full of some of the more interesting sci-fi races and backstory out there. If you play one 4X game in your life, this should be it :) My one complaint is that it could use a stronger (voiced?) tutorial - but if you give it 30m of initial confusion - you will begin to see why it's awesome :)			"

The combat can get old, but there is an option of autoresolving it after you have chosen your three round actions.I never actually finished a playthrough because I got bored. I suspect that has to do with the fact that technological advances are kind of boring; they don't change the game play in any way, just boost stats or let you add colonies on new worlds, which basically just boosts stats a bit more.I had fun when I played it and don't regret the purchase. Wouldn't think of it as big as a AAA game though.Civ with more complex combat and less complex city building and exploring.			"

You can create technological upgrades for your army in order to build best fighting ships in the galaxy.Dont have anything negative to say about this game.

												The game Beyond Earth/Starships should have been, at least in terms of depth, lore, combat, character styles and replayability. You can dive in at a low difficulty and just play a combat game, or go higher and micromanage planets and moons. Expected to play it for a couple of hours and then get bored, and, well... after playing most races and dozens of galaxies, there's still tons of fun to be had. Faction-specific technologies are whole new playing styles, for a start, instead of a specific improvement/unit. An essential example of how games ought to be, with a tiny footprint, great graphics, and a heavy focus on story.			"

												I would recommend it. The custom factions seemed a little bit underdone, and feel like an afterthought. The battles, though, are pretty awesome. The late-game kinetics are especially fantastic, and I like the difficulty settings. Its replayabilty is great and it really makes for some great 4x gameplay. Hardcore Die-hard 4x fans will be sorely disappointed with the networkabilty in this game.			"

												A fun little TBS, not very complex, but with just enough depth to become immersed. Plays like a mash of MoO3 and Civ4, with a dash of GalCiv2. Heroes, however, really set it apart and makes the game stand out among the space TBS genre. They're integrated quite well into the gameplay, as governers and captains with a leveling system. Oh, and the soundtrack. Damn it's amazing. I'm very limited in musical knowledge, but I believe it's a ambient electronic type dealio.			"

												I got this game with the DLC while they were on sale for $7. I thought it looked like a fairly entertaining, outer space turn-based strategy, and honestly wasn't expecting much after looking through the negative reviews. Then, I spent an hour just reading the applied science and military branches of the tech tree in game. And I don't normally care about such detail in a game.Don't listen to the bad reviews. If you like space stuff, strategy and/or turn-based games, or Civilization-style games, you will enjoy Endless Space tremendously. It is a beautiful, surprisingly humorous, addictive, and intense masterpiece. The graphics are very playable even on the lowest settings, but look phenomenal if you can run them at their highest. The universe is interesting and pulls you in. The game is deep, and manages to be very balanced while also keeping every race unique as far as their strengths and weaknesses. The attacking side in battle always starts with a better firing position, forcing the defenderer to take sustained fire for a little while before being able to shoot back at maximum efficacy. That was one thing I didn't like. In fact, the combat system seems bad at first. I wish that players had more direct control over their ships. The combat is nevertheless quite fun once you get used to it, because it has the oppossing sides choose cards to play at each phase, and there is basically a time limit. It has that inexplicable joy that card games like Pokemon have. Due to the factions being well-blanced, the slightest difference can decide the outcome of a battle. As in real life, it is only ""safe"" to attack when you have a clear advantage.Overall, an amazing game for its genre and worth the price even if you don't get it on sale, in my opinion.			"

												4X turn-based strategy with a focus on economy & tactics. The music is very immersive and changes based on where you are in the game (planetary view, shipyard, etc.). Combined with the crisp, clean visuals the devs have found a way to make the sterile menu navigation somehow not boring. Sadly this charm can only last so long since most of the game is spent digging through menus trying to balance your empire on a see-saw. The biggest graphical disappointment is how ""flat"" the galaxy feels; there are eye-catching planetary views when zoomed into a star but from above it feels like playing a board game. Although there is combat, there is an ""Auto"" mode that lets you pre-load commands so many battles end up playing themselves. Even with the wealth of tooltips, many basic game features are hard to grasp, such as the seven victory conditions. The devs have been working hard to improve the game but the current tutorial is really barebones and is basically popup screenshots that explain things that the tooltips already show.Endless Space is a highly customizable sandbox in space that offers you many unique ways to conquer the galaxy (or not at all; you can disable all victory conditions). A work in progress worth picking up if you can handle the difficulty and steep learning curve.			"

												I think this is probably the best 4X type game that I've ever played, and the developers seem pretty serious about continually expanding it. It seems like if you're into this sort of turn-based game then this is THE one to buy. I'm still not sure how I like the ""card"" mechanic for ship battles, but it's certainly more interesting than the usual stuff that's based purely on random number generation. The tech trees and diplomacy systems are very well done. The diplomacy system in particular is the best such system I've seen in this type of game.			"

												OK, but not great.  I came back to play this one again, and found I didn't care for it as much as I had on first impression.The mechanics are ham-fisted and arbitrary.  Metrics like ""approval"" are illogical in the game context, and simply there to slow down the player's rational march toward victory.  Example: citizens on planet 1 are rioting because you colonized planet 7 in another system.  Why?  There is no rational reason within the fiction of the game.  It is not like overpopulation on a single planet.  And there are actually good logical reasons for people to be proud, like any other civilization in history.  Yet the designers want to slow you down, since you will obviously want to Xpand, which is why you came to play this game.  So you either take the hit to an empire-wide reduction in output, which is self-defeating, or you pause to build expensive infrastructure on every single star system in order to magically make people happier.  Oh, and don't forget that you have to first lengthily research the arbitrary technologies to build the  happy places.There are some interesting features here, but they are overwhelmed by the chores put in place to slow your rational progress down the 4X path.

												I was hoping this game would have the best of Master of Orion 3 (ha! sorry surely that was a joke eh?) and the best of Master of Orion 2 combined. WRONG!It's just, well, stupid to be frank. I mean how can you have gas giant planets with ""Acidic Soils"" or ""Volcanic Activity"" eh? Nearly EVERY planet is a terran or subterran planet. Barren planets can illogically be ""Ecologically Fertile"" or have ""Gardens of Eden"". Whoever wrote this had even less astronomy knowledge (and logic) than whoever wrote MOO2 over 20 years ago!And the game is just so ""left-wing"". It doesn't even have a proper ship combat routine. You just sit there watching your ships auto-combat while flashing the occasional ""fire of wrath"" type ""card"" which make jack-all difference anyway! And people complained MOO3 was ""pacifistic""..... they ain't seen NOTHING yet till they see ""Endless Boredom"".Good job I paid only about £6 for this trash. Normally it would be at least £25. I'd have been FURIOUS paying £25 for this utter bilge!			"

I disagree with that comparison, and would say ES occupies a slightly different niche: a complex, but not /quite/ as complex 4X game, very pretty to look at, very good music, and plenty of fun.Compared to MOOII, there's less to optimize, battles are played out faster, per turn you spend less time on giving orders, so I'd say it's overall slightly less complex, and a bit more ""casual"" -- but not by much.So MOOII (and perhaps: Civ), and Endless Space on the other hand, fulfill two different kind of 4X needs, in my opinion: maximum complexity, but sometimes being a bit dragged out for the former, very enjoyable, easy to jump in and out, but a bit more casual, the latter.

												Good game, plenty to do although i did find ship customization a little hard to get the hang of and was constantly getting killed early in the game or have my planets surrounded by pirates when all i wanted was to colonize my system and reasearch everything. Multiplayer is good if you are only playing with humans dont bother playing with AI they will just sit in their system and accept whatever deal you ask them and they dont attack they just like to relax while the humans battle it out for supremacy. Other wise the game looked good and has alot to do and cool space battles for single player in multiplayer its just an annoyance if someone chooses to watch the battle.			"

												Overall a very pleasant 4X experience. A bit oversimplified at some aspects, but nothing that takes the fun away. The only things that strike me as visible cons are as follows:Overly sterile UI that requires a bit too much clicking at the...Lategame, which becomes more of a chore than a gaming experience.Factions, which get boring after awhile, along with a quite limited customization for custom ones....And that's it, the rest is okay. Strongly recommend.			"

												Interesting concept for a 4x game. The combat seems a bit weird, but not bad. It's just different since it tries to go above the rock>scisors>paper system by implementing the cards. My complaint with it is that it seems to start off really slow (something I consider a plus on 4x games) but in the end it becomes a stomp.			"

												I love playing this game, but then it went down and the customer service to try to get this game operational again is non existent. Even steam won't touch it. It is really fun, but when it stops working and you can't play it for long periods and no one gets back to you on your technical problem it makes you want to quit playing computer games altogether. If I could get some technical help I will take this down, but as of now it has been over a week and I haven't heard from anyone. Seems like kind of waste of money and over priced to not offer any technical help. And why spend some much time programing if you aren't going to help people actually play it.			"

												It's a quality game, but like most all Civ like games, the AI suffers. The problem with this one is that it's like a game of constatn whack-a-mole. If you are being invaded, you can't just fight the enemy fleet and win. They will retreat every time, and send 5-10 small sized fleets to constantly harass you. Basically, it's not fun and fruststaing and pointless combat mechanics. Especially if you are playing a defensive empire and aren't the one the attack.			"

												Endless Space is a fine 4X strategy games from a very enthusiastic developer, however it lacks on certain parts and fails to deliver a fully fun experience.Let’s just start by saying that the DLC (disharmony) is a  MUST  for this game since it improves on numerous aspects and gameplay. So either buy it in the bundle (gold edition) on doesn’t at all.The game is not a hardcore space simulation rather than a more casual but fun take on the 4x genera.  It’ fairly simplistic and you don’t have much “tools” in your hand to manage your empire. You will colonize planets to planets with your colony ship, discover and exploit resources, build improvements, creating, customizing and assembling ships until your meet the enemy. Leveling your heroes and deal with Random Events are also a thing, but that’s about it.Combat is similar to Galactic Civilization where you don’t have much “live” impact on the battle. You need to choose a card (representing a battle tactic) and match with the enemy’s card and that’s pretty much it (also you can set formations and attack pattern). The battle will automatically goes on without the player getting involved, and it all comes down on how did you customized the ships and what card you choose.And that’s where the game lacks a bit. Although combat is fun, there is not much variety to go for meaning that there are no special attacks, weapons or tactics (you will discover cards later on, but none of them are OP) that will surely break the enemy. You can only choose kinetic, beam and missile weapons (or combination of the 3), assemble the ship and hope the enemy did not develop defenses against the chosen weapon. I find this a little bit lacking.Another problem is the late game/endgame. Victory conditions are ridiculous for Science and the Invulnerable Empire building victory (Wonder) requires 40-50 turns (so around 170 tops) with massive science and labor points already. The game is TOO LONG for these victory types. The only thing you can go for is Domination and/or Score. But the AI is like a brick spamming ships and improvements like hell and even an easy AI will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ When there is just 1 or 2 AI left you will find yourself in a trench war where everyone is ultra-powered and since there are no special weapons or tactics you cannot break each other. And if you go to war it will be a constant battle for one system since the AI will just spam ships faster than you can defeat his fleet. After some turns combat will be so frequent (you will have 4-5 battle every turn) that you just stop caring and pressing the quick combat button.  This is when you will turn to multiplayer instead. However there is a major flaw/bug in the game which is called the De-synch bug. It turns out when you play with a friend to beat the AI the game will freeze up on random turns and you cannot go forward or back. You need to reload a previous save, hovewer the game will stuck at the same turn. THE END! It’s a pretty much  GAMEBREAKING BUG . I have opened threads and contacted support numerous times but these issues have not been resolved for a long time now and there seems to be no fix for it. Many people suffer from this issue, not just me. (see below the forum thread)http://forums.amplitude-studios.com/showthread.php?47367-End-Turn-Game-Freeze-Stuck-Multiplayer-BUG&p=225289#post225289This bug essentially makes it impossible to play Multiplayer, and sometimes even when you 1v1 will freeze up.-------------------------------------Endless Space is a good 4x game from a pretty much new developer.  I would say even though its flaws I like the game, and did not regret buying and supporting it. The Devs are nice guys, although direct customer service are not their strengths (as mentioned above) Now that Endless Space 2 is announced I hope they listen to the critics and make it a truly awesome game.If you are looking for a decent 4X game with great graphics and you can overlook its limits than you can safely purchase Endless Space. 7/10 Good  "

												Endless Space is a fairly traditional 4X game.  Colonize, expand, build a fleet, conquer stuff, and so on.  It does have a small twist of a simultanious turn system(aka everyone is taking their turns at once, so someone could lock down one of your fleets by engaging them before you move them and so on).  Some like this, some don't.  I'm fairly neutral about it myself.  While I'm pretty slow about making my decisions, sometimes it's actually helped that I tend to go later in the turn order as I get to see what everyone else is doing and then make my moves accordingly.  Sometimes of course it hurts as an enemy moves somewhere preventing me from doing what I was originally planning.  Graphically it's nothing amazing by today's standards but the graphics are functional.  The game as far as I can tell is mostly bug free.  There was one game breaking bug I came across and I don't know if it's gone(there have been multiple updates since that happened and I've never been in the situation that caused it the first time) where lots of ship stacks from different empires all going into the same spot would cause the space battle warning but wouldn't allow me to actually go into the fight and wouldn't let me end the turn since there was a battle that needed resolution.  It happened in my second game I haven't seen it since and other than that I haven't seen any bugs at all.  I do wish the empires had a bit more variety than they do(other than ship designs they feel a bit too similar to me with one exception) perhaps via having more unique techs than they do but honestly I've had a lot of fun nonetheless.  Outside of empires feeling a bit samey, my only real complaint is the diplomacy system and to be entirely honest I'm at a loss for a game with a good diplomacy system.  Civilization, Galactic Empires, this, none of them seem able to get diplomacy out in such a way that it doesn't feel tacked on.  The AI especially gets really weird about diplomacy at times wanting you to be at a very specific strength or it'll hate you for being too strong or too weak and if someone attacks you it gets pissy about you building a large fleet to fight off the attacker.  I had excellent relations with two AI empires, then the Cravers went genocidal on me forcing me to build a massive fleet to push them back, by the end of our war the other two empires(both Pilgrims) had gone from excellent relations to neutral ones.  On the other hand kudos for them not doing the whole attack, surrender, attack immediately after they surrender stupidity that some other games(Warlock, I'm looking at you) have done.  The Pilgrims never attacked me once the entire game even after ending our alliances and peace treaties.Overall I'd say this is a competent by the numbers 4X game that won't wow you but also won't dissapoint.

												Fankly, fun game except for two big problems.  I regret my purchase.  I invested time, energy and money into what was ultimately a poor investment.One: Crappy muplayer bugs.  Amongst my friends we have 6 copies of this game.  We were looking forward to playing multiplayer cause the AI gets somewhat boring once you learn the game.  There were a variety of multiplayer ""out of sync""  issues that ultimately led all of us to stop playing cold turkey.  Super lame.  If you want multiplayer DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  Two: Mentioned above, computer AI is buffed by the numbers, not so much tactics.  In single player (which works properly), later in the game battles get monotonous.  Computer just spams you with same old, same old, doesn't learn from its mistakes.  If multiplayer worked more consistently this would be ok.  Since it doesn't, it's more important as most of the game's value is in single player.I would LIKE to recommend this game cause there's a lot to like, but the developer failed in a very crucial way.  They have no plans to fix this.  They are developing a new game and have been very clear that fixing multiplayer problems is complicated and time consuming, something their small team afford.  BE AWARE.			"

												Fankly, fun game except for two big problems.  I regret my purchase.  I invested time, energy and money into what was ultimately a poor investment.One: Crappy muplayer bugs.  Amongst my friends we have 6 copies of this game.  We were looking forward to playing multiplayer cause the AI gets somewhat boring once you learn the game.  There were a variety of multiplayer ""out of sync""  issues that ultimately led all of us to stop playing cold turkey.  Super lame.  If you want multiplayer DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  Two: Mentioned above, computer AI is buffed by the numbers, not so much tactics.  In single player (which works properly), later in the game battles get monotonous.  Computer just spams you with same old, same old, doesn't learn from its mistakes.  If multiplayer worked more consistently this would be ok.  Since it doesn't, it's more important as most of the game's value is in single player.I would LIKE to recommend this game cause there's a lot to like, but the developer failed in a very crucial way.  They have no plans to fix this.  They are developing a new game and have been very clear that fixing multiplayer problems is complicated and time consuming, something their small team afford.  BE AWARE.			"

												Endless space is a 4X game with some of the highest production values in the genre.The graphics and sound design are very attractive. The battle system is a unique and intersting game of strategic gambling where you try to guess your opponent's actions and prepare for them. The races are varied even to the point that some use different resources and currency than the others.If you like 4X space games at all, I highly recommend it.			"

												Very nice game, good designs, but one thing, if your looking for a action packed game which you control who wins, well...not really, its basically a card game, that card counters that one. That is the combat system, if I had more control on combat I would say the is a 9.5/10, but it is a 7/10 mostly for the combat system.			"

												Note: review only applies to the game with Disharmony DLC; don't bother with the vanilla classic mode.Endless Space is a fine turn-based space 4x, but it's not on the same level as the timeless classics such as MoO2 or GalCiv2. Compared to contemporaries, Endless Space is nowhere as great and deep as Distant Worlds (but boasts vastly superior graphics), way better than Sins of a Solar Empire in terms of vanilla customization and replayability (but not in replayability due to mods and overall depth/lore/flavor), and vastly superior to Sid Meier's turned-based space 4x games.PROS:+ Customizable faction/race (stats/traits-wise, not appearance)+ Customizable ship modules (stats/traits-wise, not appearance)+ Can rename star systems+ Relaxing automated combat; almost no tactical control aside from choosing tactics+ Decent graphics+ Good BGM+ Sleek UI+ Pleasant gameflow IF you know what you're doing+ Large skill trees+ Acceptable amount of planetary/installation customization+ Stats/traits, etc. are mod-friendly+ Decent replayability, though definitely not ""endless""+ He is the Horatio. They are the Horatio. Horatio gazes upon the stars and wishes to fill up the galaxies with the most beautiful thing in the universe: Himself. Horatio.CONS:- Pre-chosen number of factions; no emergent factions, such as pre-spacefaring species for enslavement, experiment, worship, etc.- No end-game return of old race/death horde, despite the lore existence of one that features prominently throughout the game- Vanilla faction/race roster lacks distinctiveness, mostly humans and robotics- Automated combat gets old fast, the tactic cards system sounded nice on paper but more often than not is no better than ""educated"" rock-paper-scissors- Near non-existent tutorial that leads to unnecessarily steeper learning curve; good luck figuring everything out without wiki/faq/forum guidance- Frustratingly opaque game mechanics, despite the sleek-looking UI; confusing/misleading stat descriptions- Suffers the same zero-sum AI mentality that plagues many 4x and grand strategy games: diplomacy is highly unreliable because even the most trusted and friendly ally will backstab and hate the player forever because of Win Conditions- Graphics not moddable, so can't introduce new races or ship skins. Because of this, replayability can drop drastically after a few playthroughs if you don't enjoy the vanilla factions--your mileage may vary- Severe desync issues in multiplayer campaigns that effectively ruined multiplayerOverall, Endless Space is a pretty good space 4x that looks nice and plays well IF you take the time to study the mechanics OUTSIDE of the game... or learn through mistakes and repetition. And no, that's not good game design and polish. Despite all of its flaws, Endless Space is still one of the better contemporary space 4x games out there, just a bit below SoaSE and DW.			"

												This game is good if you thought Galactic Civilizations was good.  Which I certainly didn't.  Spring for Sword of the Stars II if you want cool space combat (but not much else) and Space Empires V if you want everything else (although I recommend looking up Captain Kwok's balance mod, which contains major AI improvements that will be necessary once you get better at the game).Seriously though, this is Galactic Civilizations 3.  The simplistic rock paper scissors combat system, the lack of depth for forging your own society, and the meaningless events all over again.  At least this time I didn't spot any glaring typos.			"

												It's been more than three years since I last played Endless Space. Seeing that it's on sale this weekend makes me remember how much I really wanted to like this game. You hear people say that a lot about games...no♥♥♥♥♥♥ eh? Bought it, of course you want to like it.Skip the blah and straight to the TLDR summary;Endless Space is boring and disappointing. Though somewhat challenging, it's dull and doesn't do enough to hold my interest. End result...to live up to the challenge, I'd be doing so only for the achievements or just out of complete hardheadedness. There are plenty of better games to play, and most of us have friends and/or family that deserve more of our time than this.			"

												Disappointing. Lacking a proper interactive tutorial. Lacking in polish. I don't know what it is about 4x strategy developers these days are thinking when they design their tactical situations, but they are clearly not trying to appeal to me. I don't particularly want minimal involvement with the situation, deciding on an overall strategy and then letting the AI fight it out. I like to be hands-on with my space battles, thank you. Master of Orion always got this - and it's the strategy series that (with the exception of the awful MOO3) everyone tries to live up to. The tutorial is pretty much worthless. It explains all the functions of every screen, but it's intrusive, and provides no hands-on demonstration of what each screen does (apparently you're expected to thoroughly read an understand each instruction it gives before moving on to the next). The game needs a truly interactive tutorial mode. In all, I am quite disappointed in this game. I played it for about 2 hours, and don't plan on playing it one second more.			"

												Got this for 1 buck while it was on Sale.First of all, I started right into Multiplayer and Tried most of the Factions aviable. The ""Singleplayer"" is basicly a you vs x ai. Nothing else, but thats normal for those kind of Games. Thats why a couple of Friends and me played it. Much more fun that way but the Multiplayer occasianly Crashes for various reasons. No big Deal since the game autosaves everey Round start but still annoying that its somewhat constant. Rougly every 2 to 3 hours the game has a Crash. After every Crash all players had to revalidate the Game data on steam. Didnt mind it the first 10 times, but after playing for a long weekend like an addict it became annoying as well.First of, the game has in My opinion a very shallow combat. You got 3 main weapon types: Kinetic(machine guns), Beams (obviously Lasers PewPew) and Missiles. All those 3 weapons are tooltipped to be for a Special Fighting Range. But guess what, we quickly learned its simply the Best to use Cheap Hulls and load them with as much Kinetic set to long Range. Most battles didnt even came to a Medium Range or Melee combat. So much for that.Also, the ship building is very ""uninterresting"" for me. You got several hull types, obviously the bigger ones need research, and you just click how many Modules of what kind you want. Fun for the first 5 times but annoying that you need to create your ""one use"" designs"" every game. It felt very repetetive, like the most of this game.Same with the whole economic and exploration stuff, nothing new here. If you ever have played a 4x strategy game, you wont see anything new here. You go and build your Empire with the planets randomly generated in your vicinity, make the best out of them and then go Annihilate your Enemys. There is one major let down here, if you Manage to form an Alliance and destroy everyone else, beside you and your Allies, you still dont Win. Either you Kill your Ally or you go for Scientific Victory, that takes ages to achieve, or... well. You could also win by having the majority of the systems what is somewhat unlikely if you have allies.This game is basicly just a machine that turns your Time into Frustration after you played it a while. Fun at first but becomes Boring, repetetive and uninterresting as you play it. I can only recommend it to Hardcore 4x Fans.			"

												You will spend hours learning this game and once you get into it you'll discover that there isn't much to it. Very much a shadow of traditional 4x games, but also very much a poster child for the problems with modern strategy games having been dumbed down so far in order to appeal to casual gamers that they don't really serve a point. I speculate this is why the documentation is so poor - to keep you from figuring out that you should just return the thing before your two hours run out.			"

												I have attempted several times to replay this game hoping for the best as it was originally hailed as  parallel to the fabled, ""Masters of Orion"" series but after pre ordering and recieving a half finished program replete with bug after bug into the realm of inplayability, I gave up. Subsequent attempts at replay after following the updates have yielded an unbalanced concoction of simplistic drawing schemes and a half attempt at a technology tree that the computer always outpaces you at. the combat system is completely unteresting using ""playing cards"" which you unlock more options through research. Prior to the start of a ""battle"" you can chose 3 cards, 1 for long, middle, and melee range hoping that your card cancels out theirs or at least brings that phase of the battle to a draw. The battles waste several minutes watching terrible camera angles fire pew pew style at a distance in the hopes that you might see an explosion. You can chose to auto battle but it seems these are destined to lose more often than not forcing you to waste your time in the ""theater mode battle."" Bare in mind you have zero control once the battle has started and the only contribution you gave was the selection of cards at the beginning of the battle in hopes that the odds may be ever in your favor.1/10 and a waste of hard earned money on a half finished concept with little player involvement.

												This is my first review for any game I have ever bought, on Steam or otherwise but I thought I should talk about my experience. I bought this game for Mac (OS 10.10) and it worked great for about a week. One day it froze while I was playing so I force quit it, not a big deal since a lot of games don't work perfectly on Mac. Now, however, whenever I try and open the game it immediately quits with an error. I wrote to the developers asking for a refund becauase I can't play the game anymore but they never got back to me. I was really hoping for more, I enjoyed the game while it worked. Don't waste your money if you have a Mac.			"

												Another clone of Galactiv Civilizations 1/2/3. I will not return to this game - after almost 18 hours of play. 1) strange diplomacy, lack od spying and dyplomacy options, computer oponents and their AI F**** with war options. You can give everything to oponent ... war will come ! and this is diplomacy ? ONE BIG LOL !! Aliances ... just forget. This game have no diplomacy. Im bored of games in oponent's atack my fraction after lack of space system to colonize. So you may have aliance wiht francion after for example 9 turns ... You are in war with this fraction. Totaly stupid resolution for diplomacy.2) battles on paper ! maybe lot of stuff for ships ... but who cares ? if 90% all stuff is unusable. Even Imperium Galactica 1 have better battle options !!! Ships ... i don't like this desing. Space battles, i don't know - after 15 battles all looks the same. There is no place for tactics, so you may have better ships but you may lose. Like in Civilization I - veteran tank destroyed by milita. Simplified compat for game in such scale is not an resolution. 3) WHO RULES EMPIRE ? !!! ... management system in Master of Orion III was better (and it was Excel like system). Endless space have any management system ? One view option on main page ? This game don't have management system. 4) Research - i like it, it was good, guite nice balanced; forget about funds for science. 5) Building on planets ! ... it is a joke ... you build on system not on planets ! ... ;/ who think about this ? System management and planets management simplified to maximum. You can't even build trade ships and spy ships. 6) Area of game, maps, stars, galaxies ! well it is main positive of this game ! well prepared i really liked it.7) MUSIC ... just turn it of. THIS GAME have the worst MUSIC IN ALL 4X space games !! After 2 hours of contiual play i have to turn it off. 8) Graphics ? Videos ? ... 4/5 after technological victory screen. Overal: 3/8 "

												A dissapointing game, certainly not on a MOO2 level, not even Galciv.For something released so long ago and spawn an add-on it has a lot of bugs. Combat is a mess - basically a rock-paper-scissors game without any real tactics involved, with fleets as ""large"" as 8-10 ships max - and you have no control on what they do. All other elements like lore, exploration, science and planets management is average at best and generally boring.Also, tutorial is very limited and doesn't tell you a lot of important and non-intuitive mechanics (how to bomb or capture planets? what are the different ways to win the game?), no built-in encyclopedia and help.

												Endless Space has a lot of potential, and even lives up to some of it. For instance, if you're looking for some beautiful space battles, you've got 'em. Please don't use them in multiplayer, though. And you've got - count 'em - four tech trees. Of course their interdependencies and documentation leave something to be desired. Ah, and you want a nice game you can play LAN-only. Well, um, no. Simultaneous turn-based play? Yep! Oh, but save often because you will undoubtedly crash. Oh, and save often because you will also likely have saved game corruption. It's a fun game for single-player, and if you keep the pace fast enough you might even finish a small multiplayer round.But this one is less ""a diamond in the rough"" than it is a chunk of coal that just didn't get enough heat and pressure.

												I played the game for about two hours on doing skirmishes and trying out various things to come to the conclusion that while the game is enjoyable for the most part but fell down in my opinion with the card-based fleet battle and general lack of controll of how your ships moved and preformed in combat. Occasionally, the extra RNG of the cards just made an otherwise winning plan ultimately fail. On the other hand, the planatary management and research were quite streamlined and easy to follow, if slightly simplistic. I would recommend this as a starting point for those just entering the genre, but hard core fans may wish to look elsewhere.			"

												2-sentence review for solo play : it's not really a bad game in itself, but it lacks any strong points, and thus falls way behind the major titles of the strategy world. About as fun as an excel sheet on start, it got a bit better with time till I noticed the total lack of epic feeling, and the awful repetitiveness of the management.Pros:- <2-min thinking> ... sorry, I'm dry... >_<   Maybe a bit of ""1-more-turn"" magic, but all turn-based games have it, so can't really be a noticeable proCons:- hard to learn, easy to master (this guy explains it better than me => http://steamcommunity.com/id/jewthanasia/recommended/208140/ )- no real tutorial (there's only on-screen explanation about what the buttons do)- extremely painful tech-tree where you have to read tons of stuff to decide amongst the dozen of choices proposed to you- no exploration feelings, nor any real empowered feeling ; for a 4X, that's a big fail- idiotic battle system based on luck, extremely repetitive without any strategy involvement- visually extremely austere (it feels like you're spending your time looking at spreadsheets with a galaxy screensaver as background)			"

												I applaud the developer for the creativity they pour in to each and every Endless game that they make.  I just don't feel that the design choices for Endless Space yielded an enjoyable game.  There are so many things about this game that are either completely counterintuitive or are never explained.  My criticism here is the same as for Endless Legend:  if you are going to do something radically different, you really ought to do a better job explaining it to avoid turning away new players.  The tutorial and manual may as well not exist because they are both useless.  They explain all of the things you are immediately able to figure out for yourself and absolutely none of the nonobvious stuff.But even after I figured out how to play properly, I wasn't having fun doing it.  Endless Space just isn't fun for me.  I install it again from time to time hoping my opinion will change (because it is such a neat concept) but it never does.			"

												This game is not great, in fact in my opinion it isn't even good. I wouldn't say I'm a die-hard 4X player but throughout my life I've put anywhere from 600-700 hours of 4X gaming into my life. Endless Space only accounted 6 hours of that, which is rather small. The reasons behind this are simple, too. 1- The User Interface is horrifying in my personal opinion. The tutorial goes over the majority of it all, however it's just- ugly. Descriptions of tools and buttons are paragraphs long, the colors are dull, and the panels to access key game elements don't stand out, as if they're hiding from you.2- The Music. I didn't have any problems with it at first. The music was unique and entertaining to listen to, for the first 10 minutes or so. Afterwards it's extremely aching to the head. Constant and useless noise echoing through my ears is what I remember of it.3- The Battles. Endless Space is like no other 4X game that I've played. The battles are won by cards and luck, and they're cinematics rather than the player controlling the battle himself, on top of that they get very tedious after the first four or five times. 4- The overall lack of immersion really kills it for me. I'm big on immersion. Whether it be Arma, Stellaris, or even Mario Kart on the Wii, I always want to feel as immersed as I can be. Video games are meant to shift your mind into a new world, with new experiences and activities. Endless Space does not do this, in fact it does the opposite. For me, playing Endless Space wasn't immersive at all. When I played it felt like a chore, me pushing to WANT to enjoy the game. I hate doing that, and it ruins the overall vibes.5- The lacking of any strategy was surprising and a big reason why I haven't clicked the ""Play"" button on this game since July 2016. I get it, I explore systems with no diversion other than the color of the planets surface and size, colonize any available worlds, and expand. This is natural in any 4X game, yet when I do it in Endless Space I grow, well bored. There is no real reason to choose certain worlds other than their size for maximum population, and when interacting with other nations I feel as if I'm playing Civilization 1. It's the typical bland diplomacy system with a few various options. In the end, you'll almost always go to war with all of the nations anyway, so you might as well forget diplomacy entirely. AS I've said before, the combat system is also extremely dull.6- The map of the game and even the game itself feels dull. I'm not certain how to describe something of this nature other than the fact that it's missing something most other 4X games have. I don't know, maybe replayablility perhaps? Overall, the game works well, and the developers put there time and money into this game, so I'll be nice and recommend it. But in the end, most people won't put more than 50 hours into this game. In fact, haven't even gone over 10 yet.			"

I enjoyed Sins of a Solar Empire very much as well, but I wished it wasn't real time. Sins is really a close second, but it has always lacked diversity of planets, buiding options and so on for me. Endless Space delivers much more diverse planets and industry / empire building options.4x should be turn based. It's just impossible to do 4x real time AND have that crazy amount of technology, research and exploration at the same time.			"

Then you have to hope  if you reload it from an auto save it don't do it again and also hope that people feel like rejoining. I personally don't rejoin because I will be playing for a long time enjoying it but then the erros or bugs happen and I am just like I had enough so I don't rejoin.I really like this game though  if they just fix the glitches ! ! give us an update fix the errors and this game will be 100% satisfaction			"

												Freaking wonderful turn based space 4x.  The development of this game was a lot of fun as the dev's let loose their crazed fans into a forum like atmosphere and let them vote on features the team would work on.  It was a wonderful idea because some things I voted for and wanted are in the game!! it also sucks because some things I wanted and voted for didn't make it.  but it was a good thing because it helped this game become great (and for me it gave me a greater sense of attatchment to the final product I think).  The best UI of all time award from me goes to this game, easy and intuitive I often find my self cussing other games UI's more often after I have played this game. The create your own race feature is nearly flawless.

												This is a game I HIGHLY reccommend, which I don't do often. It is one of the most complete Turn-By-Turn strategy games I have ever played. Very complicated but that's what makes it brillaint. Only complaint is that the game needs expanded with more races, ships and other things but even without that, the game is amazing.			"

												Freaking wonderful turn based space 4x.  The development of this game was a lot of fun as the dev's let loose their crazed fans into a forum like atmosphere and let them vote on features the team would work on.  It was a wonderful idea because some things I voted for and wanted are in the game!! it also sucks because some things I wanted and voted for didn't make it.  but it was a good thing because it helped this game become great (and for me it gave me a greater sense of attatchment to the final product I think).  The best UI of all time award from me goes to this game, easy and intuitive I often find my self cussing other games UI's more often after I have played this game. The create your own race feature is nearly flawless.  I only wish more depth in look customization and that there were some way to design our own main abilitiy or choose from a longer list, even if items on said list didn't come from one of the premade races.

Then you have to hope  if you reload it from an auto save it don't do it again and also hope that people feel like rejoining. I personally don't rejoin because I will be playing for a long time enjoying it but then the erros or bugs happen and I am just like I had enough so I don't rejoin.I really like this game though  if they just fix the glitches ! ! give us an update fix the errors and this game will be 100% satisfaction			"

												This is easily one of the best space-themed 4x games out there, and it has a ton of really neat ideas. Sadly, the game falls pretty short in execution (with AI opponents at least). Several in-game systems just don't work in practice. The diplomacy aspect of the game is probably the most aggregious offender of broken mechanics. Computers will violate or end treaties willy-nilly even when it benefits you and hurts them. The computers appear to suffer from mass technology trading (to your detriment) like older Civ games did. Additionally, the game will often kill treaties for nonsensical reasons. On multiple occasions I've had alliances and cooperation aggrements auto-cancelled by the game because I lost a resource, even though the resource was never involved in the trade. Amusingly, this even sometimes happen in error when the game somehow thought I had lost a resource. The combat system initially feels neat; however, it gets tiring quickly. For some bizarre reason the designers thought it would be a good idea to incorporate an arbitrary time limit before you can resolve any combat. It's possible this is some weird technical reason because of simultaneous online/AI play. Regardless, it's dumb; it gets old extremely fast. Additionally, the computer seems to play their combat cards randomly. You can reload and replay the same encounters 10 times and you'll get 10 different sets of cards played by the computer. Often the cards the computer plays makes absolutely no sense. Also, the combat system will often say you have an (often large) advantage with combat, you can counter multiple computer cards, and yet somehow still lose your fleet without killing a single ship. This isn't a rare occurrence; it's frequent. To make matters worse, I've found that the fleet design system seems to work really well if you just let the computer design ships for you based on your best components. When prompted, the computer will always pick one weapon and one defense piece and use only those pieces. Finally, there doesn't appear to be a way to examine the makeup of an enemy fleet until you click the combat button. Once you've clicked that button there's no way to cancel it, which is asinine. The game lacks a true tutorial and instead uses in-line help. Unfortunately, the inline help is shown the very first time you go to any screen, which means you spend the first 30 minutes being bombarded by walls of text only to forget it all an hour or two down the line when you're trying to remember how some advanced mechanics worked (which you didn't have access to when the inline help was going).The game also appears to several necessities that we've come to expect from 4X games (like Civilization). It lacks victory tracking (for you or the enemy) other than some extremely basic percentages that aren't explained and are hidden, an in-game encyclopedia (civlopedia style), advisors to help you when you're just starting out, an online community (there's very basic ones starting up, but they are small), or a mod community. The largest issue I found was that the diplomacy system was extremely shallow and boring. You don't unlock any interesting diplomatic options until several techs into the tree. Once you get them, you'll find that anything sufficiently interesting is missing. There's no way to convince others to go to war, peace doesn't protect your colonies (which makes little to no sense; at least provide a separate option for this), and the game forces you to break your alliance for often trivial, nonsensical reasons.  To top off some failed mechanics, the game has some really obvious and extremely frustrating bugs. My favorites include game screens that are sometimes inaccessible for no discernible reason (spam clicking will sometimes bring them up), buggy math where global % modifiers are applied incorrectly to colonies with negative output (this works both ways amusingly, a negative % modifier and a negative output can cause a positive total output), and some amusing visual bugs where ships and systems will twitch in place. Likely the biggest bugs in the game are those revolving around diplomacy. More than a few times I've had ships get effectively stuck in systems because of an odd confluence of borders, treaties, and ships in orbit defending airspace.			"

												First off, I'll say that while this isn't a terrible game by any means, there are much better 4X space games out there.The one thing I like about this game that most other space 4X games don't do is heroes. You can recruit and assign heroes to fleets and star systems and the hero will gain experience and level up and provide various bonuses. The graphics are pretty nice as well and the descriptions and the lore are interesting to read.Unfortunately for the rest of the game, other games have pulled off the same mechanics in better ways, but even though this is a newer game it did not learn from the games that came before it.First off, the UI could use some work. Some things are hard to find (and the tutorials don't tell you where everything is so you have to dig around) and some things don't make sense. For example, when a random event happens that generates random anomalies on random planets, it doesn't tell you what planets, you have to manually check all of yours to see.The tech tree is kind of annoying and illogical at times. You start in the middle and can research technologies in 4 independent trees. The thing is, 3 of them have various forms of shield tech but you have to get halfway up in each tree separately to get to that point even though it seems like a basic shield precursor should lead to all those techs. All of the same factions also share the same tech tree which Combat is also a boring automatic numbers game. You can customize your ships, but in reality this customization is pretty limited and all that really matters is the final combat rating. There's a poorly named manual mode which isn't actually manual, it just shows a little cinematic of your ships blowing each other up but otherwise works exactly the same way as automatic resolution. Whoever has the most ships and the highest combat rating wins, there's really no tactics involved.The AI is annoying on any difficulty level. They spam combat ships and will overwhelm beginner players regardless of difficulty, but they're one trick ponies (doesn't matter what civilization) and don't learn from your actions so once you learn how to beat them all the difficulty levels become trivial.All upgrades are built on the system level and their cost doesn't change regardless of how many planets are actually affected by them, so building an upgrade costs the same in a system with 5 planets vs one planet, yet the system with 5 planets gets a much bigger bonus. This illogical behavior is a cornerstone of the game and makes it difficult for me to enjoy. Each system is also limited to a single production queue regardless of the number of planets.Overall, I was disappointed with this game and have a hard time recommending it over the other available 4X space games, especially at the asking price.

												The game is playable and enjoyable up to a certain point and then the limited parameters of the  clumsy tactical combat system lock you into an ""Endless"" war. Retreating ships cannot be fired upon???? Who came up with that brilliant idea???  The tech tree is almost undecipherable until you play the game a few times and is laced with pedantic and misleading verbiage.  There is very little room for diplomacy and you can't really engage in cloak and dagger shenanigans or black ops  such as assassinations or clandestine raids on outpost systems. There are no orbital battle stations or defensive systems (satellites or mines) which would discourage  multiple incursions into your space and free up your fleets to engage and repel the enemy. While on that subject you should be able to disengage a fleet from a system being besieged in order to protect or relieve another beleaguered fleet or planet. Planetary sieges are extremely boring  since there is no quick way to completely neutralize a planet or system by means of neutron weapons or biological warfare. Planetary defenses are visually nonexistent and dependent on simple variables.  Please note: I've only played this in single player mode so some of my criticisms may or may not apply to the multiplayer version .There's supposed to be a sequel to this game and I hope they improve on the combat, diplomacy, orbital defenses and tech systems in order to make the sequel more immersive and rewarding.

												After playing this for a couple hundred hours, I can now conclusively state that while this was certainly promising as an update to that old classic ""Spaceward-ho!"", it is actually stupidly broken. The main problem has to do with siege dynamics. You can place as many defenses as you want on a planet, but if the attacker has siege points on their ships wherin marines can land, well, the siege lasts about 2 turns. This rapid mechanic makes the strategy aspect of positioning fleets irrelevant.  I have also tried their other ""endless"" universe games, and they are also just bad. I don't understand the praise for these games.			"

												After seeing how many positive reviews Endless Space got and it being on sale, I thought I'd give it a go.  Having played anything from MMO's, turn-based and real-time space games I was quite excited with the whole colonizing aspect of ES and combat looked so cool!  What a disappointment!  Combat is interesting to watch the first handful of times and after that I let the AI take over just to get it over with.  You cannot control your ships, just throw cards at it and see what happens.  The story line starts of being quite interesting, after that it just becomes a bunch of text since it doesn't really have much influence on your gameplay.This is by far one of the most boring games I've ever played.  If you're looking for exciting space combat then this is not the game for you.  Give it a go if you like reading a bunch of meaningless text and throwing stuff in queues and wait how many turns for it to complete so that you can do 1 simple little thing.Utterly disappointed!

												Well, I take back everything positive I had said.  Ignore the ""peaceful"" nature of your enemies.  Ignore the peace treaties, trade treaties and big gap between your borders.  Forget trying to have a big fleet to deter attack, or no fleet so you don't threaten anyone into war.  The AI can populate 20 planets to your 10 (literally), get to a point where it has 30 command points of warships to your 5, can develop troop landing and build invasion ships while you are only half way there and WILL attack you even when you have been at peace since you met.  To cap it all you scamble a fleet together and send it to the system they are attacking.  Does it A)  Take on the invasion fleet that has 6 command points to your 12, or B) attack a sodding scout ship and therefore you loose your homeworld?  Have a guess.  This game can be great, but sometimes it's less fun that putting your hand in a blender, and just as pointless.			"

												Positiv things:Races are quite different to play.Race editor.Ship editorthe PriceHerosNegative Things:Galaxyies are to small, even the biggest.Miss of strategic points  in the wars.     -With heros you can cut a blocade    -FTL technlogy allows you at one point to go you own way. At this moment there is no defense strategie possible ,becouse at this point the enemy and you can attack any point how you please. And becouse there is no possible way to intercept fleets in Space before there arrival.    -Systems with Certain rare bonuses are not that good.Miss of animations, like a little  Coloniazation Cut scene or Invasion Vid woud be nice, also the Battle animation suck.The AI is terrible, instead of an better AI, it gets Bonuses, massive Bonuses, Gigantic Bonuses. AI sucks in an mostly AI enemy enviroment.Conclusion3 out of 5   without the good prize(8 Bucks) it would be 2/5			"

												After seeing how many positive reviews Endless Space got and it being on sale, I thought I'd give it a go.  Having played anything from MMO's, turn-based and real-time space games I was quite excited with the whole colonizing aspect of ES and combat looked so cool!  What a disappointment!  Combat is interesting to watch the first handful of times and after that I let the AI take over just to get it over with.  You cannot control your ships, just throw cards at it and see what happens.  The story line starts of being quite interesting, after that it just becomes a bunch of text since it doesn't really have much influence on your gameplay.This is by far one of the most boring games I've ever played.  If you're looking for exciting space combat then this is not the game for you.  Give it a go if you like reading a bunch of meaningless text and throwing stuff in queues and wait how many turns for it to complete so that you can do 1 simple little thing.Utterly disappointed!

												It was only a dollar when I got it and it is certainly a good game for a dollar and is worth more. However the game doesn't load anymore(a common problem they decided not to fix), and so far the devs/mods have been useless. It feels like i've been scammed, I got to play for 20hr and now I can't anymore, i cant return it and have to accept my loss. Thankfully it was only 1$ but I can't reccomend that you purchase it for more than a dollar because who knows how long it will work for you.			"

												I bought it and it's DLC for 66% off during a sale, and then an additional 50% off because I was a Founder for Endless Legend. At first, the game will be overwelming and you'll have no clue what to do. The tutorial available is quite in depth, and took me 20 or so minutes to go through and read all the information available. If you've played Endless Legend, this is just like that but in Space. You colonise and terraform different planets, build and manage fleets, establish trade routes and form diplomatic agreements aswell as going to war, which you have the option of bombing the planet, or sending ground troops. The game has utterly beautiful graphics, and it looks a little like a David Attenborough documentary when you're looking at the planet overview with the graphics set to Fantastic. There's a diverse number of species, ships aswell as different planet types. I love the types that are rich jungles or entirely oceanic as they're great eye candy. Much like Endless Legend, there's wonders that effect your planet/systems outputs (FIDS) for the better or worse. I'd STRONGLY recommend buying this game if you love stuff like Civilization. Games good points:- BEAUTIFUL graphics.- Rich lore (Just like EVERY other Amplitude title). - Vast upgrade tree.- Multitudes of options.- Ability to change a planets geographical layout to your needs.- Several different playable races.- Hundreds, if not thousands of hours of gametime. - Cheap if brought on sale. Games bad points:- Costly if not on sale.- Hard to learn at first, which may be offputting.- Slightly buggy save system, will not allow me to rename my saves. All in all, a strong 9/10.			"

												I liked this game, but the latest version appears to overly cheating, i am invading an empire with 2 planets left both of them undersiege by my fleets, AI keeps spoofing out of nowhere spaceships every turn, even with an excellent hero i can not keep up with the amount of ships a single planet with no special ressources produces, not only the game cheats by pooling ships out of nowhere but my hero constantly keeps failing in using any abilities, the AI also has  a good array of at least 3 heros, there is no way 2 medium planets with no special ressources can maintain 3 heros of level 5-10 and their fleets, AI heros are healed next turn. Myself with my hero 15 and 2 fleets of 7 have to change production to coin making, i got annoyed of this as every game has the same result, there is no mathematical way of winning against an AI with infinite spaceship numbers and no expenses, the only chance is the AI is not as smart as a normal player so in the long run it is possible to kick the AI, but the fact this game AI cheats extremely hardcore just killed my fun and preference for this game.

												Gave this game an honest chance after playing a disapointing demo when it first came out. The very poor AI is given advantages across the board to compensate, which makes for an ultimately un-enjoyable game. If you win, it will be because the AI is so stupid as to throw its fleets at you a single file. If you lose, it will be because the resource and science advantages the AI get (even on easy difficulties) means that in late game the AI will have an insurmountable advantage.Also the diplomacy options are very limited - even poorer than Civ. Not a disastrous game, but I came to expect better AI and more depth.			"

												I hated this game.A friend recommended it and kept pushing me to play it with him. We ended up getting a multiplayer game and argh... Boring. I'm not too sure what to say about this game really, if you like turn based titles then this might be worth looking into. I had never played a turn based title before and I found this aspect awful.The races are interesting but you don't really get much of an immersion effect going. The battles are boring, the research tree is uninteresting. The visuals of the map were beautiful, but it's quickly ruined by the fact that your armada must take turns. It felt too board game like, and if I wanted to play a board game I would... on a board. This 90's tradition of plane paper gaming has expired in my opinion, and is only kept up by fanatical nerds who suck at playing more in-time titles. Sorry, truth hurts.Not for me, I would recommend Sins of the Solar Empire with the Star Trek 3 Armada Mod. Much better experience than this game.0/5, garbage.			"

												Gave this game an honest chance after playing a disapointing demo when it first came out. The very poor AI is given advantages across the board to compensate, which makes for an ultimately un-enjoyable game. If you win, it will be because the AI is so stupid as to throw its fleets at you a single file. If you lose, it will be because the resource and science advantages the AI get (even on easy difficulties) means that in late game the AI will have an insurmountable advantage.Also the diplomacy options are very limited - even poorer than Civ. Not a disastrous game, but I came to expect better AI and more depth.			"

												I recommend it only if you are getting it on sale and with add-ons. It can entertain you for few hours. More if you get somebody to play multiplayer with you.It might have been great those years ago.Pros:-climaticCons:-too easy-AI is dumb (eg. keeps sending colony ships to its system which I am currently siegeing)-AI actions make no sense (eg. even if you declare war on AI twice as big as you, after set amount of turns it will accept white peace and heck, it will even ally you after)-the game only pretends to have multiple victory conditions (apart from economic - where the AI instead of stockpiling dust gladly sells it to you so you can win..)-AI ship designs give it almost no chance to win, even if fleet powers is on the same level as mine, they don't stack HP, so they eventually lose all ships, while they can't shoot any of yours.

On top of that I've encountered several bugs after only a few hours of play.I cannot possibly recommend this mess. I recommend looking at some of the other numerous space strategy games out there.

												This game has everything you would want in a 4x space strategy game.  Except for one key thing that imho is most vital in a 4x strategy game ... the space combat is absolutely, without a doubt, the worst I have ever seen in a 4x strategy game with the possible exception of MOO 3.  Its just a matter of seleting a few 'cards' at the start of the battle and click a button.  Thats it.  No strategy and no real planning.  Just hope you pick the one card that trumps whatever random card the AI happens to pick (If the fleets are evenly matched).  There is no way of possibly guessing or knowing what the enemy will pick based on thier weapon platforms (that I could tell) and ship design.  Might as well close your eyes and pick, its just as effective as anything else you might pick (tested!).  Than click a button and watch the ships slug it out (no fleet control) and cross your fingers! This is most unfortunate because the rest of the game has everything you would want! Customizable races, heroes and fleets that level up, deep/rich/interesting tech tree, lotsa resources to Xploit, customizable ships... ect ect.  It seems the dev spent all this time in creating an awesome game then spent about 10 minutes implementing a combat system before release.  If you arent into the combat aspect of 4x games you would really like this title but if interesting/tactical/fun combat is something you are looking for in a space strategy game stay away from this one!

												You want to spend 5+ hours clicking a button? Then this game is for you. It has an amazing amount of micromanagement resulting in you constantly clicking ""End turn"" until something happens. As usual with games like these, it's almost impossible to balance weapons and expansion. If you spend on expansion one of your AI allies will turn on you and begin eradicating you. If you focus on weapons you miss out on colonization and research. In the end I wasted 10 hours trying this game twice and both times it was infuriating how long it took for something to actually happen. I wish I could get my money back.			"

												I started playing this game alot.  No tutorial.  Just learning as I go.  It seemed like something I'd really like until I got to the combat.  Literally the dumbest thing I've seen.  You'll have a war going on.  You'll mass your forces into a fleet and barricade a system.  The computer will split its army in fragments.  What this means is you can only attack 1 time per turn.  So you'll have your massive pile of army and the enemy will have it's massive pile of army as well as ten thousand fragmented individual units.  Of course when you click the attack button you can't select the big army.  Oh no you get to kill the computer's army 1 unit at a time forever because you have no control over what you attack.  That's just one system.  It will be like that at every system and I have 24.  Just pure garbage.  If I'm at my system where I barricade it before the enemy got there I should have an unlimited amount of clicks espcially if you are going to have the computer fragment its army which is ignorant in the first place.  I'm killing the enemy literally in my system.  I'd fragment my army too to compensate but you have no control over what unit attacks what unit so when you click attack with your 1 unit the computer puts that up against the huge army and not one of the fragments.  This is so stupid it made a 10/10 game a 0/10 game.  Unplayable!			"

												Endless SpaceThe Basics: Turn Based 4x Space Strategy GamePrevious Time Spent: 15 minutesExpectation of learning Curve: mediumWhy I bought this: Super-cheap steam sale, reviews, art styleFirst Impressions: Endless Space has lovely art and interestingly thought out factions full of intelligent beings of different mindsets and abilities. I found myself lingering over the various sliders that come with starting a game, including galaxy size, relative connectivity of star-systems, and the age of the galaxy. I was also taken aback by the differences in the groups, and found myself settling on ""The Cravers,"" a group of cyborg-insects, which bore a strong similarity to the Borg, and seemed like an interesting start. Everything looked cool, and the first few turns seemed to provide interesting choices and goals.  My 3 hours: I spent my first hour with Endless Space trying to learn, following through in-game tutorials to make sure that I understood the systems involved in the game. I played as the Cravers for my first hour, and spent some time tooling about the galaxy and focusing on trying to colonize other worlds. I had set up the galaxy so that spreading out was fairly challenging, and my ambitions of spreading like cyber-locusts and darkening the skies of the entire Galaxy were ended when a heroic space pirate set up a blockade around my home system, effectively preventing construction and further growth. With that, I scrapped my first game, and first hour within the game. Overall, I found myself liking the feel of the game, and finding the basic systems well-described, but frustrated by a lack of external benchmarks for my performance. In hour 2, I excitedly restarted the game, this time taking on the role of some kind of birdlike warrior race (think Goose-Klingons or something), and I ended up in a less doomed starting position, but ultimately not getting very far. This came down to the barren galaxy I had chosen  to set up, and what seemed to be a relatively non-transparent system for colonizing. There are a variety of technologies needed for colonizing non-earthlike planets, and I focused too much energy on learning how to colonize fairly exotic planets, instead of covering the basics. This led to the area around me getting taken over by more pragmatic aliens, and a lot of lessons learned.In hour 3, I restarted once again, this time as a species of friendly space Amoebas. My goal here was a focus on mostly peaceful expansion throughout the cosmos. I knew the systems far better, and was this time able to concentrate on gaining the ability to colonize actually useful nearby worlds, creating a small foothold in my galactic neighborhood. I also experienced some mild conflict with my neighbors here, without ever escalating into a declared war. This allowed me to see the way the game handled combat, which I quite liked. When a battle is about to commence, you as the player don't get to control your fleets directly. Instead, you have something like a deck of tactical cards, built up by your technology and other special abilities, and play one card per combat phase, which generally dictates what your assembled fleet will do. There's a bit of a rock paper scissors match to this, with some cards effectively countering eachother at various phases. I'd like to see this in more detail in the later stages of this game, with higher technology and fleet sizes, but for the scale I saw it in, it was satifying. My Highlight:  Testing out if an opponent would be willing to declare war after I chose to destroy one of their scout vessels that had been trespassing far into my territory and threatening an area I was eyeing for colonization. I got to feel some legitimate fear as I entered combat, crushing their ships, and waiting for a diplomatic response. Realizing that my foes were too smart to be baited into war by one hostile act was exciting to see. My Verdict:  Endless Space is a game with a lot of character, and some great writing. But, ultimately, I don't see myself returning to it in the near future, as once I had the basic systems down, I more or less felt like I was clicking through turns, waiting for things to happen. I think if I had more time on my hands, my verdict might be very different, but for now, it's not for me.			"

												Too many things wrong with this game that don't make sense. My biggest pain point was having my ships trapped inside of a system unable to leave because opponents were barricading, and every time I attack they just run away. If they run away, then they shouldn't be able to keep me in the system. Bad mechanics overall.			"

If you are considering this I highly recomend Master of Orion or Galactic Civilizations II or III. they are much better games without the sad lack of depth and almost unplayability that Endless Space has.

Uninstalling and reinstalling it doesn't work. Stay away from this nonfunctional game. Save your money.I am having better luck running it on my old gaming PC. My suggestion at this point is if you intend to play it on Windows it is a fun game. The Mac version is temperamental and unstable. Valve should pull support for OSX because it is misleading.My recommendation at this point is neutral.			"

												The game initially seems to be a better developed Space Empires with streamlined battle mechanics.There's a significant learning curve further complicated by the fact that you cant try something and see what it does - the resolution will take dozens of turns and will be mixed with results of dozens of actions you will take in-between; luckily, wiki and Steam community guides are quite helpful.I tried to play on easy mode and found the gameplay to be very very dull with the only mid/end game (annoying) challenge being the pirates that are stronger than enemy empires.

												“Endless Space is smart, polished and intelligent game of countless permutations. Its strength lies in how carefully and how cleverly it's balanced, as well as how it rewards all kinds of playing styles. We haven't seen a strategy game quite like this in a while.” 8/10 – IGN “In case it's not yet clear: go for it. If you are an experienced player, go for it. You are rather inexperienced with the 4X genre and it frightens you? Go for it.” 9/10 – FactorNews “For a first game, it is surprisingly complex, demanding and motivating.” 82% – GameStar==This is the game that made me realize I don't ever need to read a review from IGN, FactorNews, or GameStar again.Thank you Endless Space.

												I have tried -TRIED- to get into this game multiple times.  It took multiple attempts just to get through the early game (thanks to Pirate fleets that spawn at like 4-8x times stronger than anything you start with).  The main UI is so small as to be illegible at 1080p.  The research screen is a mess of random symbols and presentation.  Even with expansions this is a mess.If you really want 4x space action there's substantially better out there (Galactic Civilization or Sins of A Solar Empire).  If you really want 4x in the Endless / Auriga universe then just get Endless Legend instead.			"

												This game should be for me and I should enjoy it so much. I love similar kind of games and I was really interested in playing this, now I regret it. Exploration seem great, tech tree is fairly interesting, also colonization, but then the combat and invasion of planets comes up and it is just bad. It gets so boring and neverending and in the end I really feel powerless in the fights, I lose even with super strong fleet, I just feel like that there is not much I can do. Maybe I will come back to this game later, but now I just feel disappointed.			"

												My son and I played this game for the first time today for about 3 hours when suddenly error boxes pop up twice and the game screen goes all blury. The game error windows were the only things not legible. The error windows were not from windows OS but from the game itself. We closed the game, loaded up a save, and discovered that all improvements on our planets were gone, all of our planet exploitations were gone, and the AI player went from having half our individual points to double.  This game has been out 4.5 years and they still don't have the bugs worked out. Why support a publisher that does not support it's product? I had hoped that this program would run like Master of Orions 1 or 2. We used to run an 8 player hotseat game every other weekend and MOO never crashed on an old Pentium 1 with windows 95 back in 1997. Where is the pride in craftmanship? GONE. They couldn't even come up with much original content. SOPHONS = PSILONS they even look the same.			"

												""2001: A Space Odyssey"" AKA ""Endless Space""  is a 1968 British-American science fiction film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay was written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, and was partially inspired by Clarke's short story ""The Sentinel"". Clarke concurrently wrote the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey which was published soon after the film was released. The story deals with a series of encounters between humans and mysterious black monoliths that are apparently affecting human evolution, and a voyage to Jupiter tracing a signal emitted by one such monolith found on the Moon. The film is frequently described as an epic, both for its length and scope, and for its affinity with classical epics.			"

												I find this game... boring.There's nothing really especially bad about it per se, it's just boring.To begin with the engine was really poor optimised, it runs really crappily on my machine and my machine is a machine that can handle Skyrim at 35 fps on medium/high settings. A 4x strategy game should not run this slowly. It was actually worse than Vanilla Civ V for how slow it was to turn.The UI is, impenetrable, to say it a single word. I don't need to say much more than that.Getting to the meat of the game. The Civilizations are boring and bland, the universe is unoriginal and uninspired. All the sci fi tropes are present. Vagrant nomad civilization? Check. Amoral secretive aliens bend on destroying the universe as we know it? Check. A currency system lifted straight out of Dune? Check.The only good thing about this game that I can say is that at least the developers -tried- to be original in one respect. The combat. It's fought with cards... for reasons... And I will be honest, I don't like it. I'd much rather direct the combat personally with the option to auto it with the cards instead of having to just use these stupid cards all the time (and let's face it card game battling in a 4x game is jarring and weird to say the least).A friend of mine recommended I buy this game over Stardrive (because apparently Stardrive is terrible) and I wish he hadn't. It was a complete waste of money for me as I felt like it was a game that was all flash/bling and no trousers/substance.I don't generally review games I don't like, because I am not a negative person but honestly this one has got to be a no from me. Don't buy.			"

AI that doesn't get Deity-level cheating as soon as you go one difficulty notch above normal.This game does not have that.Nor does it have combat that explains itself (or makes sense), so you really can't tell why the various ship designs you make work (or don't). Sometimes you smash enemy fleets, sometimes they smash you, and the game gives almost no feedback as to why.			"

												So, I recently got into Moo2 the other day, and upon doing reserach into the franchise, discovered remakes and clones. This one was on sale for ~$9 and I thought why not, it looked fun an interesting. Well, I was wrong. It's woefully balanced in favor if the AI. Always. I have attempted a few tries, and everytime, I am at war with a faction that is so overwpowering that I have no hope of standing a chance. And it happens way too early in the game for it to be natural gameplaying evolution. I lowered the difficulty from normal to very easy, and I get beat even worse.And if you're on a mac, there are actually fucntions of the game that just don't work (like rush production, a standard in these types of games). You are literally at the mercy of just waiting for every production, every time. You can't use your income to help at all. Sadly, I got this because it was on sale, as opposed to Master of Orion Conquer the Stars, because I really just wanted to play a game but wasn't ready to commit to $50. But I feel like the level of testing and development put into it made the $8 not worth it. And actual functionality of the game not working is a serious problem.If you have a Mac, I would recommend sataying away.			"

												I bought this and the expansion for $1, played for about 3 hours, and I'm not sure I will pick it up again. I love the theme and universe of the game but the UI and gameplay are needlessly obtuse and repetitive.  There is too much clicking involved to get into and out of menus (click on a star system, click on a planet, select a thing for the planet to do, click out of the planet, click out of the star system, repeat with next star system/planet). A system like Attila TW for selecting provinces and then choosing upgrades from a panel at the bottom would be much better.   Combat is another weak area. I thought it would be really cool to make your own ships and choose 'cards' (tactics)  etc and it is...but it also is not:There are so many meaningless combat skirmishes that take up loads of time. Half the time the AI retreats if it is outmatched which devolves into your fleet chasing a single ship (or worse, 3 ships that split up into 3 separate fleets) all around your interior. So you ignore those and move to take enemy planets, but then these small ships just camp there and blockade your planets and strangle your economy.  Overall I have found the game to be a big frustration.   Surprisingly there are a few annoying similarities between this and the total war series (like clicking 'end turn' over and over again) but I enjoy TW much more because the gameplay feels decisive and there is a sense of accomplishment, even though Im craving for a good space game.  I would recommend that prospective buyers buy Endless Legend instead,  or something like Sins of a Solar Empire.  Ultimately for $1 it was worth a shot but if I had paid full price I would be pretty regretful now, wishing I'd bought something like Stellaris instead.			"

												I got this game very cheap and went into it open minded however there was just too much to take in. I'm not hugely familiar with space games so this might be one of the reasons, but I really tried with the tutorial, reading it till I could understand most of it. However when left to my own devices after the tutorial I just didn't know what my goal was or what I should do. First impressions are important and this game didn't give a good one.tldr: I wanted to enjoy this game as someone new(ish) to space games but was overwhelmed by the tutorial			"

												Just another 4X space game.In this game, you manage a space empire. Expand to new planets, research technology, build ships, fight aliens, and so on. This is a turn-based strategy game. This game is nearly identical to : Master of Orion (original), Master of Orion 2, Master of Orion (modern), Space Empires V, Galactic Civilizations, Galactic Civilizations 2, Galactic Civilizations 3, Sword of the Stars, and probably a bunch of others I am forgetting. It has no notable distinguishing features, and the UI and polish are overall inferior to the likes of the Galactiv Civilizations and Master of Orion series. There is absolutely no reason to play this game if you have played some of the others.If you haven't played some of the others, there is still no reason to play this game. Pick up the latest Master of Orion or Galactic Civilizations instead.			"

												At 25hr play time this game is left wanting. Why is the AI so strong when I have 10X the systems resources and research? I'm built up to 10x the systems and can only research by the limited amount. How does the AI get so strong when you own 30 systems to the AI's 4 systems? How do the AI ships get 10x as strong as you with so little investment? This is entertaining for the first few hours. But then you realize it's convoluted nonsense. I can not see a path getting even close to the strength of the AI.When you compare the end game stats it makes no sense that the AI has so much more than you when they have so little. How did they get so strong while investing so little? While you are trying to figure this out. Why are you robbed at every turn? You learn nothing and can not do anything about it. Or why you are being robbed. Your stuff just vanishes. Turn after turn you go broke with no way to stop it or why it's happening. It's all convoluted nonsense that looks like a complicated game. If there is a reason it is hidden so it takes you longer to find out it's gibberish.			"

												I don't know what it is with me and space 4X games. I love Civ V, and the same kinda thing should work in a sci fi setting. I tried Galactic Civilizations III and Sins of A Solar Empire; they both sucked. I played 17 hrs of Endless Legend until I got bored, though, so I figured I'd try Endless Space. It's not a bad game, really, just empty and lifeless. They show you a short ""video"" for your faction at the beginning of a game and that's about all you ever hear from them. Every faction plays the same. They all have the same technology tree and the same random events. A disease rampages through the galaxy, and it's affecting my machine empire, huh? Curious how that works. The planets don't have any personality, they're just for resources and minor customizations. I'd love to have a space 4X where you feel like the planets in your empire are real entities. This game won't even let you customize their names. If the star systems name is, say, Mars, all the planets are called Mars I through VI. I guess giving them individual names would make it harder to manage them; like if a message says ""This and that happened on planet Bill Clinton"", you might be like ""Where's that again?"", but that's only because all the planets are the same, anyway. GC3 was better at that, I guess, but it still felt bland. Starships are all the same, too, except for their looks.All in all, I can't recommend this game, except if you can get it cheap and just need something for 5 hrs, which is as far as I made it.			"

 Endless Space	 Kosmiczna strategia grana w trybie turowym paryskiego zespołu ""Amplitude""	 O grze:  Akcja gry jest w odległej przyszłości w galaktyce zamieszkiwanej przez 8 cywilizacji.Gracz wybiera postać i obejmuje kontrolę nad jedną z cywilizacj. Jego zadaniem jest zdominowanie pozostałych cywilizacji. Wszystkie strony wykonują swoje ruchy jednocześnie, co znacznie przyśpiesza zabawę w trybie multiplayer.W świecie gry znajdziemy setki planetarnych systemów i każdy z nich posiada randomowe : planety , surowce oraz sekrety. Autorzy przygotowali też rozbudowany system modyfikowania statków, który pozwala samodzielnie wybrać uzbrojenie, napęd, opancerzenie oraz systemy pokładowe każdej jednostki.Nie zabrakło również elementów dyplomacji. Rasy mogą zawierać sojusze, zawieszenia broni, prowadzić wymianę surowców, technologii a nawet całych układów planetarnych.  Moja opinia  Ta gra jest bardzo rozbudowana oraz miła do gry. Zarównież trzeba użyć sprytnośći oraz inteligencji. Reseachować inne rzeczy. Przejmować planety na których tworzy się kojene statki do walki , defensywy oraz do przejmowania innych planet. Oraz ustawiać na planetach co mają tam robić twoi. Atakować inne cywlizcje. Bronić się przed nimi.Według mnie ta gra jest opłacalna do zakupu jej.

												This game is  bugged out enough that I have decided to uninstall and never return to it. if you alt tab out of the game it breaks a number of features in very covert ways that took many hours of testing to confirm. every few hours a curroption will randomly occour for a number of difrent ui funtcions. mainly the changing of population density between planets. To top this off the games difficulty to my knowlegde dosn't give the ai an unfair advantage it gives you an unfair disadvantage by decreasing the quality of your start. the gameplay is incredibly slow and understanding what is better between two options requires two complete attempts at a play through. I really wanted to love this game and I feel that it does many things qeiut well but at large it causes more stress in me then it elviates and so feels more like work then a game.			"

												well i spent about 6 hours of my day learning to play this. The tratorial was a disaster only text on the screen like im reading a book when what i needed was hands on the game and not reading about it and unable to come back and read it if need be. Fallowed by after all that work. the enimy showed up with one icon. i was thinking one ship. He he had merged 10 ships in that thing. i got wreaked. meanwhile in the fight the tratorial popped up and was overlaying the game. SO i was busy reading it. Needless to say i didnt know the fight was happening in the backdrop so i lost all my fleet while reading a dam tratorial on how to battle. next thing i know they declare war on me. As if they hadent already made that apparent. They flow in with 4 more icons within the one turn. Im now outnumbered 30 ships to 4. i got wreaked again and died within 2 minutes. soo needless to say im gonna say DO NOT get this game. its not worth your time and effert if the game is somehow able to make 30 ships to your 5 ships. Witch i could hardly afford with the upkeep thern after i found out oh just play one team in the game because they dont need to worry about upkeep or funds. They can just build away and hammer all the other players who have to struggle to get enough to get by. sooo there is a broken mechanic right there. anyway no i say dont get this game. Its not worth it. Speshually when you can better spend your money on a much better game.			"

												Please ignore the limited time spent in game, as I discovered the reason for my review in the extra research I did after purchasing the game on sale.In short, in a game that is very like SotS, Civilizations, and SoaSE (which have teams,) there are no teams (only temporary alliances) and only one player can win. You cannot win with a friend, and will eventually have to either crush them or just quit the game. In all fairness to the developer and players who think this is a piddly reason for a negative review, consider this. Many players purchase games like this specifically to play with their friends, and it should be a relatively easy thing to add, so how could both they and we benefit from such a move??? Why is this a review and not on their forums???	Quite simply this is because the game has been out for 5 years and Disharmony out for 3, so this change is most likely never going to happen, nor will it happen 1 year after its launch like it should've.To those who say this would've broken the game: 1. It would also be easy to lock this feature to Singleplayer and Private Multiplayer to keep it out of public servers.2. It will not break YOUR game, it will only break the games of those who CHOOSE to use team systems.To those who say  it wasn't worth it, there were two bonuses there:1. Adding Co-op to the tags opens up the game to a wider market, not only to players with co-op friends but also to less strategic minded players who wouldn't be able to win singleplayer without a bot on their team.2. The change would detract froms reviews like this.To those that think co-op is dumb for this game:1. Sins of a Solar Empire2. Civ 53. Sword of the Stars4. Galactic Civilizations II5. Supreme Commander (V and FA)Name one, RTS or 4X, that doesn't benefit experience-wise from playing with your friends.			"

You go back in with close to same fire power. Then magikly or the knows what stratigy to use all of a suddon and poof your fleet goes boom.

												Master of Orion have always been special to me and I always look for the next great space strategy game. This game was fun the first ten hours. It was addictive even. Colony building was somewhat simpler than Galactic Civilization which was a plus in the beginning but became a little monotonous later on. Nonetheless, I kept going. I wanted to rule the galaxy afterall. Then the game totally went to♥♥♥♥♥♥for me after the population started revolting literally everywhere. It was crippling and completely progress killing. Pretty much stopped me cold from playing any further.4.5/10.			"

												I enjoy real-time strategies - I can't say I always enjoy turn-based, but I've disregarded that for my review. When I saw this for a buck, I figured I'd grab it. Somehow, I feel robbed. I feel like a lot of work went into it, and it's worth that whole dollar to someone, but not me. In no way could I ever see it being worth $30. That's ludicrous. At most, I see this being originally released at $10 and something I might find on a Wal-Mart shelf along with some hidden object games.The UI is terrible, the font makes me feel like I'm working, the game has so much minutia that it clouds gameplay and the gameplay itself was just, well, boring. If I was younger, and had an endless summer with no end in-sight... no, even then I don't think I'd recommend it; there are much better games out there.So, I don't think this is worth even a dollar, albeit, I have known people that enjoy tedium that's a result of poor design, not interesting gameplay, have their lives to waste away, don't mind the lack of any inspiring content, can happily click their life away to no real benefit and don't mind staring down the Arial font for hours on-end. If you find yourself in that camp, you might enjoy it. I still, though, even to those poor souls, would not recommend it. Go, find yourself a friend. Maybe pick up a hobby that meets in groups.			"

												Similar to Endless Legend, this game is quite dull. You spend lots of time micromanaging planets and the decisions you make aren't that interesting. But most of all the combat sucks. It's non-interactive, you are provided little feedback or understanding as to why a battle was win or lost, and the ship customization ability is not very interesting.			"

												It might be a great game, if you understand it. But the tutorial is terrible. It throws so much information at you all at once the first time you try to play. It doesn't even let you do much without giving you several paragraphs to read about what your doing. Every button seems to lead to five other buttons, and every button cines with a paragraph that you have to read. Again I'd love to understand and play this game but I can't get past the tutorial. If you're a visual, hands on learner, do not buy this game.			"

												NO NO NO, This game has some potentials.. but no, simply no..Reason? Well.. at start, its a bad copy of galactic civilizations.. and.. its too hardI know, thats sounds like a tempting nut to conqeur, but unless you have some super ultra strategy skills and a temper that reaches way and beyond this isnt a game for you.OK, i really need to point out that i am one of those guys that could really stuck for games like this, and keep on trying over and over again but this game i realize that its for no use.There are x amount of difficult levels.., starts of at newbie, then very easy.. at very easy the computer will attack you.. and take your systems.. and you loose.. i mean Very easy? after very easy.. easy, and then.. Normal! dont waste your time and money Not recommended for a million years, trust me.. i wouldnt have said this if i didnt really mean it, there are lots of better games in this category (and i should have listened to the reviews myself damn it)			"

												The only interesting thing about this game is the exploration. Everything else is pretty dull really. Designing your own ships seems interesting but I found it all a bit complicated and in the end just ended up pressing the Auto upgrade button. Every 10 turns or something. Which is exactly what the AI does and this comes apparent when you are attacked by a bunch of ships 'xxx Destroyer 78'. Which leads on to combat, which is dull. You have 2 options, Manual and Auto. Manual supposedly lets you choose 'cards' to play but is basically a cut scene. Auto just skips the cutscene. Unless your fleet is massively larger than the other fleet, it will be a draw.Invading other systems seems to be if your invade score is bigger than their defend score. Then how long it takes is dependant on the difference. So, if your attacking score is 3600 and their defend score is 2500, then it will only take about 60 turns to invade. Snore.  I know at their core all games are just about numbers but most games hide this fact. Endless Space doesn't. It is a very thinly veiled numbers game.I tried to like it, I really did. MOO2 is one of my favourite games but I guess I'm still looking for a decent replacement because this ain't it.			"

												Nope. Just Nope. You guys know.I am seriously a Fan of Games in this Genre. And Generally Endless Space is not an Bad Idea. Its just that the actual Result they got Sucks. Many Events and other Stuff just have no Real Explanation. Hell you get Events of stuff and have no Idea what even happened cause its not even telling you were something happened on your Planets. Needless to say that you first have to look into each nook and cranny to find out what stuff is even doing at all. And even then sometimes there is just some Modifier and you got no idea that it was there or why its there....The Interface in General is very annoying. Alot of stuff requires you to Check every system manually over and over. And you cant just Build everything on one Place to build out one System you have to Search for the Stuff on each Planet itself. But you know.The Interface and Events and all that Stuff can be Acceptable.It makes the Game really hard to get into as an Beginner. But once you know everything. You can Play it fairly Good with that. The 2 Things really Breaking this Game for me. Are 1. That the Game is entirely Unstable in Multiplayer.After Round 100 you can Expect it to Crash or Freeze once per 20 Turns. Which is entirely Unacceptable. 2.The Game is creating an very very stupid mix. Its setting you up in very small Places right next to other Empires thus pretty much forcing you into an very fast paced Combat situation. While at the same Time Combat is entirely Automatic only allowing for minimal Influence from your Side. The Strong Point of this Game which is Management and Strategy is Completely Dropped because you never get a Chance to really make use of it. As even on the absolute biggest Map Settings you will meet the First Enemy in Turn 30 and thats given your really Lucky. But the Combat Aspect of the Game is seriously not worth mentioning. It lacks replayability. So even if Winning a War your just not feeling Good on it. Because well your basicly just cliking through the Combat after a While because there is no real sense in doing anything else. So in the End.It could have been a Great Game if they would have Fixed the Stability Issues. And would have Enlarged the Maps so you can actually make some use of the good Parts of the Game and dont end up thrown into a War right away anyways.  "

												This game is not friendly for people who have no experience with this sort of thing. There are so many missed opportunities in the tutorials for learning such a complex system. In selecting a standard single-player game, all there is are walls of text and still portraits that ""explain"" things to you.Walls upon walls upon walls of text. Trump style walls. There are no animations, voices, or interactions. Factions are explained in text. Help is explained in text. The tutorial is nothing but text. The only thing I saw in trying this game that has video and voices are the short videos after you select a faction.Make no mistake, there is TONS of potential here, but they really dropped the ball on the immersion for outsiders. To its credit, it seems like a game that would get better and give back 100x the more time you put in to it; however, like a good novel, you must be drawn in at the beginning too.Not recommended unless you know what you're getting in to and have a lot of time, energy, and patience to put in to it.

												Save your money and buy a better game, there are many games in this nitch and this one game didn't make me feel very good about how I spent my money. It was fun at first but gets very repetitive in all aspects. After playing just 5 games I could predict the AI so well I would know if I would win or loose a war after just a few battles. The AI has unfair advantages that far outpace even the best defenses possible to build and the AIs act with no logic most the time. This game in all fairness kills time but other than a time killer I would advise aginst this game being in your library. 4/10. That is my thoughts of the game. Not everyone will have the same experinces but to me this game was poor. Very poor.			"

												It's a good game -- see other reviews for pros/cons, but at the end of the day it nails just-one-more-turn -- but I don't recommend it unless on sale, for the soundtrack. The reason is simple: planet text in the system screen (which you spend a lot of time in) is horribly blurry! I've spent a fair bit of time playing with game and computer graphics settings but to no avail. Internet research shows that this is not unique to my computer. It's a shame though, because other screens such as the galaxy overview, skill tree, and combat UI are all crystal clear. Oh, well...Just save your money for Endless Space 2 if you're concerned.			"

I've had two unexplored star systems I've been trying to reach, but I cannot, I do not know why, distance? barrier? I do not see any way I can research or develop means to reach those systems. I remain stuck in the 5 systems I was able to colonize, I do not recognize any progress, despite being able to advance in some research trees. I do not understand how to create better ships and where improvements come from.  I do not have the time to try to go through the ""learning curve"" that some say this game has.

												Tedious game......even w/16 GB RAM & 8 CPU i7, there's about 30+ second pause between turns (when playing AI or using AI to manage worlds)......game is much less tedious with small galaxies & only a few opponents, but then it's boringly easy against the AI......you can up the difficulty...but that doesn't make the AI better players, just passes the AI more resources...which is more tedious than fun.Playing against people is even more tedious.The game is just tedious (or boring).

The AI overpowers and overmatches you right from the getgo. I am actually surprised this hasn't been adjusted in all this time. I believe i had bought this in early access aways back.

The graphics are great and the music is awesome. Still, the pace and overall flow of the game is quite simply a drag.Picked up Sorcerer King and Endless Space cheap. Tried them both.And Civ 5 on sale. Haven't tried yet.I'm still open to giving them a chance but currently it's looking grim....Sins of a Solar Empire and Stellaris are much more engaging and immersive.			"

The tutorial about as fun as reading a textbook for a class in which you accidentally enrolled.  The interface is clunky and unintuitive.  I love simulation games, but this one just missed the mark for me.  I don't understand all the gushing praise.  It's just a Civ game re-skinned in space with all the polish of an open-source Linux tool made in someone's basement.  Just go play Civ again or perhaps Farm Simulator.  You'll be much better off.

												Endless Space is a 4X game in every way, shape, and form, all presented in a beautiful science fiction setting. As per usual, you'll gather resrouces, expand your empire, and try to rule the galaxy in a variety of ways. What I love most about Endless Space: 1. One of the most impressive UIs I've ever used in a game of this kind. Seamless controls, intuitive, easy to learn. The design of the UI is just flat-out brilliant. 2. The variety of ships and combat strategies separate this game from most 4X games. Instead of just a results screen, you can watch combat unfold in epic real-time, even controlling the camera in any way you want. So combat, while still essentially all based on mathematical values, is visually stunning and fun. Where I think Endless Space lacks: 1. As with most 4X games, diplomacy is weird and factions can do some very random things. For instance, a faction offered me a Cooperative Alliance which I accepted. I hit ""end turn"" and they declared war on me. Strange, but common to me in my experience playing these types of games. 2. More of personal hope, more compatibility between Mac and PC, so that my brother and I don't have to try several times to get a multiplayer match going. :) All in all, if you are a fan of 4X games and want a scifi themed one, look no further. Endless Space is beautiful to look at, a breeze to control while playing, and a very in-depth game experience.			"

												So many races and different technologies for each. Combat is a 3 phased battle. Long range, mid, and close. You have different abilities that you can pick from that can be countered by others(ex: shield boost vs an emp pulse). Some are more effective depending on the phase they are chosen. (missles are best at long range while kinetic weps are best for close). You can customize each of your ships to be whatever kind of comatants you wish. Very well detailed turn based space deplomacy/economic/scientific/conquest stratogy game. 9/10			"

												Excellent 4x Space strategy, slick UI, gorgeous graphics, excellent yet unobstrusive music and sufficient variety in races, playstyles and victory conditions to keep things interesting for a long time.  I'd call it a standout in an oftentimes underwhelming genre.That said it is sadly not perfect, the most notable flaw being the rather uninvolved battle sequences, which feel especially out of place against the exceedingly well designed empire management. Definitely enjoyable, well worth its cost. Don't get eaten by the Cravers!8.742/10			"

												A great space strategy game. It contains lots of different races which all have something that makes them special. However, I feel it is only in some small ways they are different from each other, and besides those small differences. One might have more durable ships or be able to reproduce faster, but they all more or less go through the same technology tree and therefore are basicly the same at that point. BUT, there are some of the races who truelly have a different gameplay, and it is a shame that they havn't done this with all the other races. It would have given a much better sense that you actually are playing a different race with a different culture, way of life and biology (or lack of it).But overall, the game is very well done and is definatly well worth the money.

												Amazing turn-based strategy, one of the best I've played in years. The gameplay is well planned, the balance between the factions and their racial abilities is kept, it's not overly boring or frustrating thanks to the quick pace, so even if nothing special happens for a few turns you won't feel it that much. The storyline, although a bit in the background, is also well thought out. This position is a great choice for any strategy lovers out there. It will keep you warm during long, cold, winter nights, and cool during the summer :P.			"

												A quite good 4X game which seems to take its inspiration from the legendary classic Master of Orion 2.True to its forefathers there are custom races which compete for the mastery of the galaxy with multiple possible victory options. This means planet management, technology trees, ship design and to an extent diplomacy with heroes added to the mix. The space combat is nicely animated (if you want to have a look at how it goes) and is resolved neatly in phases with rock-scissors-paper style tactics which can make or break the battle. Even though at it seems to have all the elements and these are decently implemented, there is still something missing, which eventually drops the game to only quite good. The problem is that it is streamlined and polished to an extent that nothing really sticks out. The technologies go forward and help you in your campaign, but there are no death rays or anything else to look forward for. The events in the galaxy are only text boxes to click through and diplomatic relations feel the same regardless of the races involved. So in a long run it just dries up to turns executed in a routine fashion and statistics. Still, while this game does not really compare to the legends, it is still an entertaining exercise to play though and can be recommended to fans of the genre.			"

												Truely amazing game. A packed tech tree, split up into different catagories to control your empire. Unlike other games like this, you can create your own ships by adding different components to the standard ship. Graphics are excellent quality and instead of a user directing the ships in combat, the combat options are chosen from a selection that gets bigger as you discover more technology, then the combat happens automatically or you have the option to watch it. The diplomacy GUI is well done with all options available at the time easy to spot and you can see the diplomatic relations between the other factions. The galaxy maps have seemless zoom in and out but could do with an expantion and made much bigger, as it can get a little cluttered. Bigger maps are always a good idea.Finally just remember there's always that one faction hell bent on taking over the galaxy, the trick is to make sure that its you.			"

												That old 4X feeling!Not since the days of Master of Orion 2 have I enjoyed a Space 4X as much as Endless Space. It had a clean interface, great combat visuals, and a solid blend of ease-of-use and customization. While certain management aspects feel too easy on the standard difficultly level, it does provide a good learning curve, allowing you to juggle all of the elements of your empire with ease.The combat is the real stand out element, as the tactics choices for each phase (Long, Medium, and Melee) really add a strong element of player control, without slowing down the game.

Didn't quite get what I was looking for, but only because the game is so low-impact. Needs more crunch.All that said, if you're lookin' for a space-bound 4X game, you could do a hell of a lot worse.			"

												Great game. The visuals are well done and the interface looks amazing as well. Gameplay is good somewhat similar to the Civ games so players of Civ shouldn't find the game to hard to get into. The only things that annoy me is a lack of decent detail on the abilities of some of the races and very little infomation on some mechanics as well (such as Lucust Points or LP) but that could just be me as well. Another problem while this may be a bug is sometimes notifcations come and go before I have a chance to look at them which does get a little frustrating at times. Otherwise I love this game and I would highly recomend it to anyone.			"

												Overall, the idea behind this game is a good one, and the setting is a lot of fun. ES takes a lot of the things I love about other titles, like Master of Orion 2 and Sins of a Solar Empire, and combines them into a pretty decent 4x game. However, the game can be buggy at times, the races and techs are unbalanced, and the AI is horrible.Computer players seems fun and interesting, at first, with a variety of reactions to your proposals and to the way you build your empire, but in the end, it's almost always the same: The other races start declaring war on you, one after the other, often seemingly out of nowhere; this is simply because (among the many factors that can influence AI attitudes)...you're doing well. Winning makes everyone hate you, apparently. Expand too much? War. Expand too quickly? War. Get too far ahead in science? War. Monopoly on valuable resources? War. Build too many ships? War. Make friends with too many other races? War. Score gets too high? War. That means, in the end, because war is pretty much inevitable, the only rewarding or realistic way to win is by determined conquest. There's a diplomacy, scientific, expansion, ""supremacy,"" and even an economic victory option, but they're all a pain to attempt when you're constantly at war and having to account for that.Endless Space is pretty; it's creative in a lot of ways; and it manages to hold my interest when I'm playing with humans, who are less predictable and a lot more entertaining. Overall, I recommend the game, but as a multiplayer experience: Skip the single player and don't bother with AI opponents if you want the most for your money, unless you like playing the same wargame over and over and over. Until the developer improves the AI and does some rebalancing, I can't in good consicence  really say anything positive about the single-player experience.			"

												Everything I've ever wanted in a strategic space sim. The space battles can be a bit repetitive and perhaps not too interesting but the ability to manually control portions of it or let it run through automatically and skip the battle is a handy feature. The scale is perfect for a game set in space, with many solar systems to explore, colonise, and profit from. It can seem slow in parts, especially when you take turns with nothing happening but I could not put this game down (hours passed without me knowing). Highly recommend for those looking for a large scale space strategy game.			"

												Such a great little space game, well worth the money specially in the steam sales. Played this for quite some time solo, even better with a friend, the AI can be down right brutal on harder difficulties if you are looking for a challenge. its like Civ ++ as theyve tinkered the type of battle system of civs style in a different way (hate havin archers kill my tanks :s) so now research means victory.

												It's a 4X game. Pretty. but the graphics are not tied in as deeply to the game mechanics as they seem to suggest. You can design your own ships and you have a range of cool technology which is pretty straight forward. Tabulated data for management. Reasonably fast paced.  Interesting use of cards in order to modify combat. Not as good as Master of Orion but what is?			"

												This game does a very good job of immersing you in whichever mode of gameplay you choose to do, whether it be the scientist, the economist or the warlord. The game makes you think about which stars you colonize: there were many points where I had to really consider taking a planet in the moment and securing what it had, or taking another planet and risk another empire taking the first. The game was a little difficult to get used to but after the first game everything made sense. This game is perfect for those looking for a space-empire type of game.			"

												FIRST IMPRESSIONS: it has one of the best interfaces I've seen in a 4X game in a long (long!) time. Streamlined, polished, modern... whatever action/item you want access to is usually no farther than 2 clicks away. This is not a minor feat, since interface is what you are constantly interacting with in these kind of games. Combat system, with its ""card game"" mechanics, is a mixed bag -I liked so far, but I can undersand people reacting negatively to it. I think I will have a more educated opinion with a couple of dozen hours of gamplay under my belt, but as I said, so far combat is working for me. Tech tree is comprehensive and intrincate, nothing to envy of Galactic Civilizations or Sid Meier's Civilization itself. Exploring is compelling and empire management hits the right balance between being detailed but not overwhelming.As I said, these are just FIRST IMPRESSIONS, with only around 5 hours of gameplay. Most important feature yet to evaluate is AI; too litlle interaction yet. So far, I recommend this game as a true succesor of GalCivII. I will update further down the road.			"

												People that have been fans of Turn Based Strategies for a long time like myself may remember a little gem from back in the day called Master of Orion 2.  MoO2 was a game that I and other fans of the genre remember fondly and sunk hours of our lives into because of how much depth there was to the game play and the options available to you to make a game session unique from every other.Endless Space comes pretty damn close to recreating that feel from that classic game and refining certain aspects to update everything for a more modern space epic 4X game.  ""Just one more turn"" is in full force!			"

												A really complex, yet simple looking and nice programed, game with a spacial theme. The new Civ 5 spaceship brother comes to us with this amazing independent game. I'm still wondering the effort it took for making this game, it looks amazing, and doesn't need a super computer to work; mechanics are pretty well designed, you can even use the AI to aid you, programming it for constructing, for example; battles are, a bit strange coming from this type of games, it reminds me some kind of rock-paper-scissors kid game, but much more complex than it seems, you really have to plan every bit of the battle to trully have a considerable advantage, and believe me I've seen from small fleets destroying great armies with a good usage of the strategy, to massive fleets obliterating everything without need of any tactic at all; economics is a great part of the game too, taxation is a very important part, and is directly related with aproval (this is, how much your people likes you, bread and circus and you have an empire), and everything is related to this, food (which is related to population), industry (production,have it high and you will build armies in a couple of turns), and science (believe me, science is very, very important in this game).There are also events, relics, heroes...and everything that makes a good game of this style just lovely and addictive.We have enough for saying this is a great game, and I'm willing to have more from this Endless adventure :)I give it a 9 / 10, I really like the freedom it gives, makes you feel you are playing with your faction, and that's amazing. AI is a huge bonus to the game too. On the other hand, graphics and design are great too, but music isn't amazing, just ""enough"", it works, makes the job done, but I know games that music is omg...indescriptible.			"

												The TRUE spiritual successor to Masters of Orion 1 and 2, Endless Space takes everything they did right and puts in a few twists of its own. While I think true MOO enthusiasts will feel right at home with the research, planetary development, and diplomacy options, one of the biggest improvements in my opinion is their ""tactical card"" based battle system and hero upgrading. The game is loads of fun for any turn based 4X fan, so come on all you Civ5 lovers and let's play some multiplayer!Still has some big glaring issues, but they can be forgiven since it's still alpha. The biggest to me is their weak notification system for incoming events. It's easy to skip over them by spamming the next turn button (hey I know I sound impatient but c'mon - YOU KNOW YOU GUYS DO IT TOO!!!). Besides that, I wish there was better ship customization.			"

Well coming from a long history of games dating back to the apple 2E and Tandy Raido Shack model 80 pc's i found it to be lacking content in favor of graphics.So if its on sale cheep id say pick it up. If full price well.... Find something else on steam.			"

												While Endless Space certainly has some problems the good far outweigh the bad. Most likely people will hear about the combat, how it's essentially a guessing game and you have no direct control over the ships. The combat is mainly based around manuvers and abilities cosen before a certain ""Round"" if you will, starts. All of these are unlocked through the tech tree, which can seem dauting at first glance but once one reads the descriptors it becomes more apparent. The map design is well done, and actually resembles a strange alien galaxy. The story is a bit confusing but story is rarely important to a 4x game of any sort, most of the time the player makes up their own story. The ability to make a custom race added alot to the immersion, allowing the choice of ship aesthetics and bonuses to the game. Some act as though this game is a spiritual successor to Master of Orion 2 (or 1 they were both awesome), it really isnt. While it is similar in a few ideals it is it's own game. Endless Space is a good 4x space game, with its wonderful graphics and smooth gameplay its a wonder this didn't get to be more widespread. It's challenging but not without being fun. A good choice for any fan of the genre.			"

												Endless Space is a complex, gorgeous and heavily emphasized on overall strategy game that changes the pace from the conventional 4X games such as Civilization. Amplitude studios have came up with a most flamboyant game that will ignite your screen with a palette of vibrant colours and one can easily spent countless hours contemplating the elegance of the endless space. The dept of each technology trees, decisions about diplomatic relationships, positioning of fleets and planetary expansion makes the game feel alive to your every decisions, as you try to negotiate a truce to secure your stern while positioning your fleets to invade a hostile nation.However the game is not without its shortcomings: although there are multiple ways to secure a victory the AI seems to always put an emphasis on domination victory (war), even pacifist nations such as the Sophons will eventually agress you. Furthermore, the game is axed on the overview of galatic conquest and players who are expecting an up-close and more tactical real-time strategy mechanics will be disappointed. The game does offer cinematics for space engagement only, but players will be unable to control their fleets directly, instead they will be asked to issue general commands to be used during the skirmishes and much like a rock-paper-scissor pattern some commands are superior to others and each have their own weakness. Overall, this is a game I would only recommend to space science fiction fans who values high quality graphics and do not mind the lack of real time strategy aspect. For all its pros and cons, Endless Space is a (7.5/10 - above average) in my personal opinion.			"

												Endless Space has you playing a turn based game very reminiscent to the final space age mode of the Maxis game ‘Spore’ along with the mapping structure of said title and others like Galactic Civilizations I and II.Both games display forms of colonization, terra forming and research to upgrade your planets. Endless Space takes on a less direct approach than Spore however, eliminating the space to planet surfacing system that Spore displays for direct town upgrades such as turrets.Instead Endless space gives you a huge verity of research upgrades that can benefit anything from your tech, military prowess, planet upgrades (including money, defenses, offences weapons and fleet sizes) and diplomacy. There are 8-10 races to choose from or you can make your own race using one of the avatars provided in game, whilst picking your own pros and cons to balance said race.The galaxy can feel empty without getting to put a face or faces to your empire, which was addressed within Endless Space. Giving you multiple heroes at your disposal, three are given to you each time you start the game, completely at random. You do need to hire them though and your max hero quota is 3 to begin with, but can be upgraded through tech. Heroes also have classes. Multi classes can be found on each hero, but they always start with a preselected 2 that are constant for that hero in every game. Ranging from warrior types such as Spy, commander and Pilot, plus other types that benefit planets and systems more so.I only have one thing bad to say about the game that really isn’t bad. The tutorial system in the game is vast and helps out, but only to a certain degree as it is only text based. Throughout my first 3-5 playthroughs I found myself still confused about little things that stumped me as I went along. Such as keeping my population happy, how to keep up with my fellow civilizations that were developing within the same system as myself.All in all it is a great game; all it really needs is an upgraded tutorial system in my opinion, perhaps voiced instead of text based, or both at the same time.Pros: Immersive game playextreme detailing for an indie gameHuge upgrade tree systemWide verity of races and heroesBang for your buck.Cons: You blink and the time goes by.Despite a vast text tutorial you’re left confused and moments that will be vital in the long run.8.5/10			"

												A more polished and flashy but slightly less fun version of Galactic Civilizations 2.  That is not to say Endless Space is bad, no not at all, just sort of uninteresting at times with turns that literally have to be just clicked through.  A lot of the random events arent as fun or involve decisions, and the cinematic strategy card battle system is different and gives you some mild form of input, but is still kinda meh.  The overall graphics, user interface, and presentation are all very good in my opinion.  Other strong points are that the 8 or 9 different races all have an interesting little backstory compared to some other 4x games, and they actually do play a little differently.  The tech tree provides some unique options for each race and provides enough info about the techs that it feels more like actually discovering something instead of just ""lasers 1, lasers 2, lasers 3"" type progression like most 4x games.  Overall its not quite the deepest or most involved strategy game but its certainly worth a spin if you are a fan of this genre or are looking to try out a turn based strategy game that is a bit easier to pick up than say something like Europa Univeralis or Crusader Kings.

												Great game. The visuals are well done and the interface looks amazing as well. Gameplay is good somewhat similar to the Civ games so players of Civ shouldn't find the game to hard to get into. The only things that annoy me is a lack of decent detail on the abilities of some of the races and very little infomation on some mechanics as well (such as Lucust Points or LP) but that could just be me as well. Another problem while this may be a bug is sometimes notifcations come and go before I have a chance to look at them which does get a little frustrating at times. Otherwise I love this game and I would highly recomend it to anyone.			"

However, the game can be buggy at times, the races and techs are unbalanced, and the AI is horrible.Computer players seems fun and interesting, at first, with a variety of reactions to your proposals and to the way you build your empire, but in the end, it's almost always the same: The other races start declaring war on you, one after the other, often seemingly out of nowhere; this is simply because (among the many factors that can influence AI attitudes)...you're doing well. Winning makes everyone hate you, apparently. Expand too much? War. Expand too quickly? War. Get too far ahead in science? War. Monopoly on valuable resources? War. Build too many ships? War. Make friends with too many other races? War. Score gets too high? War. That means, in the end, because war is pretty much inevitable, the only rewarding or realistic way to win is by determined conquest. There's a diplomacy, scientific, expansion, ""supremacy,"" and even an economic victory option, but they're all a pain to attempt when you're constantly at war and having to account for that.Endless Space is pretty; it's creative in a lot of ways; and it manages to hold my interest when I'm playing with humans, who are less predictable and a lot more entertaining. Overall, I recommend the game, but as a multiplayer experience: Skip the single player and don't bother with AI opponents if you want the most for your money, unless you like playing the same wargame over and over and over. Until the developer improves the AI and does some rebalancing, I can't in good consicence  really say anything positive about the single-player experience.			"

												If you have ever been to a spa and had your feet soak in warm water while a beautiful woman gently massages your forehead temples as you drift into a state of bliss surrounded by ambient music, then you might have some idea how it feels to become addicted to Endless Space; the first 4X space strategy title from Amplitude Studios (released July, 2012). The relaxing music, the simple interface, the soft click of every command you give to your fledgling empire and the impressive space board all combine with a decided lack of action and stress to make establishing an empire as much a chore as a nice nap with a well-fed kitty kneading your back.Read full preview at Steam1ST:http://www.steamfirst.com/a-small-step-into-endless-space/ "

												To get it straight. This game is not Master of Orion and it is not meant to be. It obviously takes a few of the old school elements like the turn based approach but that's about it.The game by itself is neatly done. The AI can be tricky for starters but its not unbeatable.People complaining about missing videos and storyline seem to miss the idea about this 4x style game and the fact that it was an Indie-production. It is supposed to do some things differently!The game does what it is supposed to. Entertain the strategy fans of us. There is no rule for how deep certain aspects have to go in order to be well done. This is just a matter of personal preference. Obviously the balancing of technologies or the rock-paper-scissor-system can be critizied but this will happen even if we all the sudden had a new shiny version of MoO2.People just love to b*tch about how things have been better before.So, to come to a conclusion. This game would be a solid 8´-8,5 out of 10 if people could abstain from downvoting just for not liking the idea. Sure it can be rated lower if you do not like it. but giving a 0-2 for a fully functional and neatly done title is a joke. Makes the complete user review idea abundant.			"

												4 Stars.  This is the best turn based space strategy game I've played.  It's fairly well balanced, to do better from what I've played I can only think of Civ4.  And the graphics and gameplay are top notch.  I particularly enjoyed the solar system layout and development.  On the downside it's almost a bit too big and unweildy sometimes.  As with Civ4 there is no such thing as a short game.  But for what it is I highly recommend it.			"

												I had really been looking for something in space to replace Civilization 4 and with several hundred hours played in Civ 4 I feel I can speak pretty well. This game has depth, customization, the ability to automate(effectively I will add, I have not seen the automation do anything I wouldn't have except for when I am focusing on a certain starting strategy so far) the mundane brainless activities so you can really get down to the nitty gritty fun parts of the game like HEY dude I just made it through the first half of the game without having to do too much point-click upgrade this brainlessness. The game really focuses on the fun parts of the turn-based strategy genre: what to research and when for the most streamlined development, what race fits your playstyle most, and most importantly making your way through the game while still being completely enveloped in its atmosphere. Lets face it, turn-based games aren't fun because of how long each turn takes, but because your strategy works best. TLDR: I don't know where the talent that gave us Diablo 1 & 2, Fable, and others went but these guys got it right. This is what quality games should be and put anything else out there these days to shame.			"

												Sort review, worth a fiver (quid)Longer review I got this game cheap, and for the price i paid (a few quid at the time) it was a good purchase, it can be fun managaing your empire to win either a military, financial or diplomatic victory but while its fun the game does have some let downs, although these let downs could easily be fixed with updates and continued support These are the let downs that nagged me the most.Crashing, end of string error or something like that will become your worst nightmare on this game, although its quite good at auto saving so when it does give you that error and crash, you haven't lost too much, but still annoying as heck.'clunky' controls, it seems to me like sometimes i have to double click or re-try a set of commands in order to get my ships to follow it, not much of a problem but it really is annoying.Want a full scale, insanely massive war? Too bad, max ships you can build in 1 fleet is about 23, and those are the rubbish ships, i want the limit raised so i can have massive numbers of heavy war ships flying around the galaxy tearing through any fleet i come across, plus, a space battle just isn't the same with four or five heavy ships compared to 40-50 of the buggers. Yes you can have alot of fleets, but I would like to see bigger numbers of ships in these fleets for even better space battlesOptomisation problems, i run a cross fire (2x7950's overclocked) and this game doesn't understand what that is so runs my 2nd GPU at max and the first GPU barely warms up (to solve this i had to disable crossfire), when this game could easily be ran on probably Intel HD4400 graphics.  Although it does have some frame rate issues mid battle, which for the graphics and cards im running is a little dissapointing.It seems there is only one music track (or multiple similar sounding tracks), which for a game where you can spend hours playing, you really like a change every now and again. So I often get some music going on YT and reduce sound of game. The initial game instructions left me scratching my head confused as hell as to how to play the game, I had to actually go off the game and watch youtube videos to work out how to actually play. Actually a second thought, SP mission modes would be good for this game to ease you more into whats going on.Battle system is meh at best, you have cards and tactics that you can chose for your ships to use, but nothing more, it would be nice to place ships and be able to give each ship you control an order, e.g you target this ship, defend this ship to the death, you ram this one or something like that would give the battle part of this game an awesome edge over some comp.So as you can see this game has got some things that could be improved but dont let that put you off, it really is a good fun game, but beware, if you buy, give it patcience to learn how to play and time for a game, it can be a very long enduring game.

												This game is really great actually. It can be a bit buggy at times, and the combat isn't all that smooth, but it has potential to be incredibly fun to play with a group of friends (the less AI's you play with, the better). One of the best things about this game is the variety in the different factions, and the ability to customize your own faction. There isn't much purpose to play this game 1v1, so again, I want to stress that the value you get from this game exponentially increases with more human players.At the very least, keep it on your wishlist for when it goes on sale. It is absolutely worth the money at like $15. You might as well get Disharmony too, as I'm pretty sure most people that actually play the game use the DLC.			"

												Civilization meets Sword of the Stars, meets Galatic Civilizations 2.  Meet other races, befriend them or kill them, Research technology, develop your infastructure, colonize new planets and solar systems, expand your resource base. Conquer the Galaxy.The interface is easy to figure out and movement around the galaxy is MUCH better than SOTS.Another nice aspect of this game is you can design, build and upgrade your starships as you see fit. You can create Dreadnoughs full of Missiles or Curisers loaded with Beam Weapoons...etc. The computer players will change their ship designs based on your designs, so what worked in the previous battle may not work the next. This forces you to adapt your strategy.If you are going to buy it, look for the Gold Edition with the expasnion pack for even more fun.			"

												Lots of fun to conquer the galaxy, build neat ships, out-tech opponents and exploit planets. One thing worth noting is that the screenshots with all of the space battles are all cinematics, you aren't actually controlling anything when that is on the screen. Battles have three phases where you pick an action to perform and the you can watch a cinematic to see how it plays out. Overall I played about 20 hours before I got bored/frustrated with the mechanics. I found that the macro game got quite tedious and there were a few things which I would have liked to see automated-streaming battleships from a star system to the battlezone (basically infinite construction of a specific ship type and have them move to a specific point after being created)-automate battles: when I had a lot of fleets 10-20 and each turn had roughly that many battles it was tedious to select battle cards for all phases (leaving them blank puts you at a big disadvantage). It would have been great to see an AI for fleets similar to what happened for systemsI would recommend this for people that like Risk, or the Galactic Conquest campaign in Star Wars Battlefront (although it lacks the high-intensity action of the actual battles).

												Endless Space is a 4X game in every way, shape, and form, all presented in a beautiful science fiction setting. As per usual, you'll gather resrouces, expand your empire, and try to rule the galaxy in a variety of ways. What I love most about Endless Space: 1. One of the most impressive UIs I've ever used in a game of this kind. Seamless controls, intuitive, easy to learn. The design of the UI is just flat-out brilliant. 2. The variety of ships and combat strategies separate this game from most 4X games. Instead of just a results screen, you can watch combat unfold in epic real-time, even controlling the camera in any way you want. So combat, while still essentially all based on mathematical values, is visually stunning and fun. Where I think Endless Space lacks: 1. As with most 4X games, diplomacy is weird and factions can do some very random things. For instance, a faction offered me a Cooperative Alliance which I accepted. I hit ""end turn"" and they declared war on me. Strange, but common to me in my experience playing these types of games. 2. More of personal hope, more compatibility between Mac and PC, so that my brother and I don't have to try several times to get a multiplayer match going. :) All in all, if you are a fan of 4X games and want a scifi themed one, look no further. Endless Space is beautiful to look at, a breeze to control while playing, and a very in-depth game experience.			"

												Basically a faster-playing Civ, in space, with some weird clone guy as well.  Trust me, you will want to play it.  The only con would be the race creation, which is robust, but highly rail-roaded.			"

												So many races and different technologies for each. Combat is a 3 phased battle. Long range, mid, and close. You have different abilities that you can pick from that can be countered by others(ex: shield boost vs an emp pulse). Some are more effective depending on the phase they are chosen. (missles are best at long range while kinetic weps are best for close). You can customize each of your ships to be whatever kind of comatants you wish. Very well detailed turn based space deplomacy/economic/scientific/conquest stratogy game. 9/10			"

												One of the best 4X game I've ever seen. Endless Space has a solid background, a clear interface and an accessible (but complex) gameplay. Definitely a must have for all sci-fi fans.Buy it, you won't regret it. No matter if you're a beginner or a master of 4X games, this one will amaze you.			"

												This is a turn-based strategy game, that is similar to Civ games in the sense that it is turn based and the way the managiment is controlled; also the management of the star systems i feel is similar to Spore in some ways. Certainly the layout of the galaxy and trade routes.The aim of the game is to build a stable and Strong Empire, making alliances and wars with AI or human players. A few issues atm. the tutorial need to be more engaging rather than a list of bullet points and number popping up appartently at ramdom on a scren shot, and the trading system is very one sided, when an AI offers a trade you can either accept or refuse, you cannot work out the details so all are happy.Over all an ace game, i would recommend it to all my friends. Try it, Love it!			"

												This game is amazing. Even though this is my first 4x genre game, I still have a blast every time I play this. The in-game mechanics may take a while to understand and get used to, but there is a whole community of people who can help. The artwork for the game is spectacular, and lots of it can even be used as wallpaper for your desktop! The people who have made this game, AMPLITUDE Studios, also collaborate with their community with GAMES2GETHER, where you can suggest game ideas. One of the in-game factions, the Automatons, were created by a player of this game.TL;DR: BUY THIS GAME NOW			"

												I can really only recommend this game if you enjoy playing 4x strategy games. Overall this game is very visually appealing with interesting character designs and stunning ship designs. Initially I thought that the introductory lore behind each of the races was compelling but the story doesn't develop any further than that and there isn't any real interaction between races outside of diplomatic actions. After trying out the game with all of the different races there is not a whole lot of really distinguishable differences in gameplay between the different races and even the tech trees for all of the races are exactly the same, so it becomes less of a tech tree and more of an arms race. The space battles are fun to watch, especially once the largest ship types are available. However the battle strategy is determined before the battle starts which may turn some people off. Endless Space is a worthy entry in 4x strategy games, however I'm hoping if a sequel is developed that Amplitude Studios improves on what is good with this game and adds more story, more interaction between races, and maybe just maybe include some gameplay that goes more indepth into invading a system and laying siege on individual planets. Maybe even include some mechanic where each colonized planet in a system has to be conquered before a player can take control of a system? Come for the art design, stay for the space battles.			"

												I do really love this game but all and all I won't lie it's a space based civilzation, a normal game is about 7 hours long with 7 AI, and the tech tree is about half that of civilzation 4 but with random map ""seeds"" each game it has very good replay vaule, it's well worth the money 7/10.

												Many people compare this game with the classic space 4x game, Master of Orion 2. As one who sunk many hours into that game, I can see where thay are comming from; this game containes (and in some cases improves) many of the features that I loved, but still keeps a few that I hated.Heres the things I like about it:Heroes are much more Dynamic in their leveling, with their own skill trees and abilities.The races are more diverse while still containing the same point buy system from its predessors.The planetary anomolies, giving bonusses and penalties to planets throughout the galaxy.Some things I hate about it:While the card system is an interesting idea, it still dosen't change the fact that combat is either an automatic uninteresting button click, or a painfully long cinimatic experience. Though to be fair it is an improvement to MoO2.Late game fleet managment is a nightmare of navigating through menus and figuring out who is where and who still has a turn.The AI (both Player and Improvement) is terrable. The Improvement AI will constantly Build military building that aren't nessasary and eat up your dust (money).final thoughts: If you like MoO2 or Alpha Centauri and want another game like that than you have to look no further. If you were expecting something else, then it's best to keep moving.			"

												Gorgeous graphics, simple and intuitive UI, and fun galaxy-hopping gameplay.  Combat could be better, there could be more to explore in space (nebulae, novae, etc.), and ship design could do with some improvement, but it's still a really fun experience. The best space-based 4x game at this time.			"

												Very good game, lots of possibilities and lots of replay options. Takes a while to learn how to play each Race effectively as they are quite different from each other. Easy to dip in and out of for short periods of play but will also keep you hooked for hours progressing your empire.			"
