http://cnc-online.net/ <- go here for multiplayer.With that out of the way, let me just remind you of what you're getting into here - everything about this game is over-the-top - the story, the characters, the artstyle, the units, the actresses' cleavage. Basically, a Red Alert game like any other, maybe except for that last part.There are three factions to choose from, the Allies, the Soviet Union, and the Empire of the Rising Sun. Don't ask. Okay, you just had to, fine. Einstein invented the time machine, erased Hitler from the timeline. Soviets got ballsy and started WWII instead of Nazi Germany which is now nonexistent. Then Allies kicked their asses twice, and at that point they invented a time machine of their own to kill Einstein. ""Wait, that would mean there is Nazi Germany now and-"" No, shut up and go defend your refinery from cryocopters.Behind the nonsense of a story, there is a jewel of RTS design, hands down. Every unit has a secondary attack, meaning more micro options. There are air, land and sea units (every building except barracks and war factory can be built on water), some can freely switch between two or even all three. Every faction is unique to play down to the way they build their bases, each has something different to offer depending on your preferences and they're overall balanced relative to each other. People might tell you that Allies are the best faction which is kind of true but there was a time when they said the same about Empire so whatever. Just play Soviets, they have bears.			"

												The Good:Red Alert 3 is a great game. The easy user interface combined with the fast action make me choose this game over Starcraft II on a nearly daily basis. The multiplayer is amazing, and the game is incredibly balanced. Unfortunately, the game does not have a massive online community. You end up running into the same people, time and time again.The Bad:As a fan of Red Alert 1 and 2, I found the campaign to be COMPLETELY destroyed by EA. Real actors, combined with cartoony stuff, and Tanya having blonde hair. It made me cringe. If you're looking to play the campaign, and not delve into the incredible tactics within the multiplayer... don't bother. This game is not for you. "

												Command and Conquer does it again with another great installment onto the Red Alert series. Although not as good as its predecessor C&C: RA3 continues to offer no need for builders and no worry of controlling population. Gameplay:Unlike past Red Alerts I only played about one skirmish as I did not find the AI as enjoyable as the predecessors. This Red Alert offers some interesting new teams and resource harvesting concepts which seem different than before. Like in the past Red Alert games the Russians and Allies are pretty much the same basic strategy type, while the third team offers a fresh new tactics. Similar to past Red Alerts to expand bases (when playing as either Allies or Soviets) you can build Mobile Construction Vehicles. But, unlike past Red alerts they have also added the ability for Prospectors (allied ore miners) to deploy into Command Centers which allow you to expand to nearby areas mitigating large costs. The USSR can build “Sputnik” which can also deploy into a command center. Both of these units allow for cheaper base expansion. This is different for the Japanese whose buildings are built by transforming vehicles into buildings and thus are not limited to base parameters. Campaign:The campaign took me about 21 hours to complete (that includes Allies, Russians, and Rising Sun missions). Interestingly the campaigns intertwine and in some instances you play the same missions but just as the opposing team, which I sort of liked. In the case of this game the missions are not exactly gripping, but that is the case with all strategy games. The campaign offers a great composition of actors which make you laugh, gasp, and reminisce in the old days when you first sat down and played Red Alert. Some of the missions are very quick and last no time at all while others can last a couple hours. Results:If you are expecting something just like the second Red Alert then you will be disappointed. There is only one Yuri and his revenge was an epic adventure that could only be told once. If you are interested in playing a strategy game that brings Red Alert on a new adventure then this is a game worth checking out. With an amazing intro song to boot and epic campaign cut scenes that you won't forget. Red Alert 3 really takes Westwood’s dream into action: hot babes who flirt with you throughout your entire game and keep your spirits bolstered with cheesy lines. Pros:+Great campaign with fun dialogue and amazing cut scenes.+New Empire of the Rising Sun team which brings all new tactics to the game+Campaign missions that don't just require you to continually build a base over and over again, but rather test you through a variety of scenarios.+Epic main menu music that just makes you want to jump right into the Russian campaign. +It has been 18 years and Tanya still hasn't aged over 30... a mystery? Or did someone use the chronosphere?Cons:-Its not Red Alert 2 (that game already existed, if you want that game you may want to go find the disk from your shelf)-Some campaign missions can run rather long, while others last about 10 minutes. (Some missions took me up to three hours). -Poor movement AI can cause units to not exactly act how you want them too.			"

												A good C&C game and a good entry into the Red Alert Franchise. The campy FMV cutscenes filled with 'B' Actors are amusing, the units are varied and interesting and the game is fun to play. The difficulty curve is a little wonky mission to mission, where one mission will be frustratingly hard and the next too easy. It's not quite as good as Red Alert 1 or 2, but is still worth playing.			"

												Best RTS on Steam!Pros:+Nice graphics that still look mighty fine even after all the years+Energizing soundtrack that changes according to the battlefield situation+Reworked and well thought-out resource system that promotes base expansion+All the factions are all fundamentally unique and don't have a single similiar unit+Really good in-game voice acting+Clear and understandable interface+Co-op campaign!+Action-packed battles that require both macromanagement and microcontrol!+Gamechanging unit abilities! Not a single ability is truly uselessCons:- Somewhat poor unit pathing on particular maps (Not all)- Fair share of abusable bugs, like a harvester passing through an ore node- Singleplayer campaign is so easy that can be cleared by a one-handed blindfolded monkey even on ""Hard"" difficulity (seriously)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The game CAN be played in MULTIPLAYER, even though the official servers closed.

												7 out of 10 Red Alert 3 is a decent, yet confused real time strategy game.  Good:  1. I love that you have proper movies in between missions, even though the acting is over the top.  It fits fantastically with the less than realistic game.  The game is worth playing just for the videos. 2. Interesting units. Land, air and sea.3. Good balance between factions. Bad: 4. Every unit has one, and only one, special ability. It works better if some units have no special abilities and others are spell casters with lots of abilities. 5. The game is confused.  Red Alert and Red Alert 2 were amazing old style slow strategy games.  Those games were all about careful resource management - not unit management. RA3 tries to find a middle ground to a faster pace and more focus on unit management.  As result it falls in between, succeeding at neither style. Ugly:6. the psychic Japanese girl never features in any video. O how I which Steam would give as Red Alert and Red Alert 2.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: I have played this game extensively, but not on Steam.INTRODUCTION:Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 is a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game serving as the third installment of the popular Command & Conquer series.  It features a rebooted story and a brand new faction called 'The Empire of the Rising Sun'.  However, unlike its predecessors,  Electronic Arts who acquired Westwood Studios, the original developers of the game, produced Red Alert 3.  It is one of the last few remaining franchises who use live action cutscenes which the series is known for.Players once again take the role of the unknown commander who leads either the Allied Forces, the Soviet Army, or the newly resurrected Imperial Armed Forces to ultimate victory.Red Alert 3's story starts with the Soviet Union in complete collapse after the events of Red Alert 2.  In an effort to stop the USSR's defeat, surviving Soviet leaders use a time machine to go back in history and erase Albert Einstein in order to prevent him from developing Allied technology.  Upon returning to the Present day however, they discover that without Einstein, nuclear technology was  never developed.  With this turn of events, this meant that the US never bombed Japan and the Empire never surrendered during World War 2.  Now the Empire has risen once more and poses a new threat to both the Soviets and the Allies prompting the hilarious line by actor Peter Stormare as Dr. Gregor Zelinsky: “We now have...two mortal enemies?” PROS:+ Colorful visuals and very nice graphics with good use of Physx technology+ New 'Empire of the Rising Sun' faction is fun to play featuring highly advanced, extremely versatile, very expensive, and unhealthily suicidal units (ex. Tsunami Tank: “HA! Give us a good death”  Imperial Warrior:  “Death before defeat!” Shogun Battleship:  “Ramming speed!” Yari Sub:  “We're taking you with us!” + Fun campaign for all 3 factions+ Hilarious, Hammy, Cheesy but overall good voice acting+ Humorous and entertaining Tutorial+ All units for all factions now have secondary abilities+ Co-op campaign+ Very nice Music and SoundsCONS:- The very colorful art-style that could cause headaches for some people- Some low polygon models, low resolution shadows, and poor textures can be seen here and there- Short campaign for each faction- Story is shallow and uses way to many cliche elements from the previous Red Alert 2- Occasional pathfinding problems- Balance issues with some of the units- Some outstanding bugs that was never fixed (for some reason, changing the graphics quality and  resolution at the same time MAY cause a crash)- Despite EA's vast resources and use of big name actors like Peter Stormare and George Takei, I can't help but feel that they were not able to live up to the standard of Westwood.- Broken multiplayer on Steam (No idea if it works in Origin)CONCLUSION:GREAT RTS GAME.  Although it does not fully capture the magic of Red Alert 2, Red Alert 3 still delivers a great fast paced experience for RTS fans looking for a quick fix.  The campaign is fun with a story that is easy to follow but uses a lot of cliche plot elements.  The Soundtrack is excellent and the over-the-top, hammy, and cheesy voice acting are very entertaining.  Multiplayer is also fun if you're looking for a casual RTS experience since the AI does pose a challenge on higher difficulties.  In addition, new game mechanics such as the secondary abilities and the new faction spices up the action.Now we come on whether or not I recommend this game.  If you're in this for the single player experience, sure I can RECOMMEND this game easily.  If you're in this for the multiplayer experience, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game here on Steam because for some reason the Servers are broken so you're better off purchasing this in EA's Origin Platform.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Red Alert 3 is a game that signals the end of a series. Not because it's a bad game, it's a fairly mediocre one, but because everything that defined Red Alert and made it different from the rest has gotten completely away from the designers.The graphics has gone full on cartoon which might work for some people but for me it just makes me cringe. The science is silly as always but the units, particularly the animal units will make your sense of logic die a little. The national stereotypes are just bordering on full blown racism and the cleavage is in your face and everywhere.The biggest feature of this game is the ability to play through all the campaigns in coop-mode and while is this a great feature it is also one that dies pretty fast. You can't just buy it and boot it up and expect there to be coop partners available.All in all, it's not a terrible game, it's just not a very good one either. All the things that made Red Alert a special game has been completely ruined.			"

												Took me very close to 6 hours to redo the soviet missions after sooo many years! This is still my personal favorite red alert game of all time. The graphic is still good! the Rock'N'Roll music is still awesome.The over acting of all the actor and actress is still awesome and this is still definitly a great game!Not many game can withstand the test of time like this game. It greatly saddens me that multiplayer is no longer available and like many other good studio and game serie. EA absorbed it and discarded. There hasn't been a red alert game after this one and it greatly sadden me.Since it's still a great game I will come back to it from time to time to replay it.9.5/10 for a game that has made it's mark in the video game history.

Posted: September 12, 2014
												Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 is a real-time strategy game and obviously the follow-up to Red Alert 2. While I absolutely loved Red Alert 2 I can't say the same for this title.First, there are some things Red Alert 3 does well. The storyline is as cheesy as it comes and that is what fans expect and love. It is also great that the game has actors like Tim Curry, George Takei and David Hasselhoff, who really seem to enjoy performing the B-movie-like storyline.However, Red Alert 3 has many problems compared to its predecessor. The units have a cartoonish look to them and look like child's toys. Many of them look so over the top that it is just ridiculous. Also, the weapon's effects and sounds don't convey any impact, further reinforcing that impression.The gameplay itself comes off as very hectic because units cannot take any damage, no matter the unit type. Even the biggest tanks and ships give off the impression of being made of paper. They get destroyed within seconds leaving no room for actual micromanagement. The problem is that the game wants the player to micromanage since every unit has some sort of special ability. There is not much room to use them however and I would have preferred not having them at all except the toggled abilites. The units' AI is also pretty bad. If the enemy has a slightly longer range they will refrain from retaliating and just get destroyed. Anti-air weaponry is extremely underwhelming in this game. Often building turrets don't seem to make no sense at all. Even if you have a solid turret setup there is just not much use in defending since there are so many units that can destroy your base from huge distances. If the enemy uses aircraft they will still destroy your base because there is no defense that will keep them from destroying at least one target in every run.Red Alert 3 features a computer controlled partner in every campaign mission. This partner can be replaced by a human player and while I appreciate the idea of making the whole campaign able to be played coop it just doesn't work. The computer partner is highly unreliable in its performance. In some missions it will basically win the mission by itself with you struggling to keep up with the pace and in some missions it will be literally useless. During the last mission of the Rising Sun campaign my AI partner was actually unable to even defend its own base. When I didn't continually sent units there my partner would just be annihilated within a few minutes. All of this while I had my own problems, being hammered by airstrikes, superweapons and ground troops.The campaign should come with a trigger warning (pun intended) because all missions are heavily built around triggers that you most of the time cannot see coming. However you need to be prepared for them because if you're not you have basically lost. There is no reaction time since the game is fast and units and buildings cannot withstand any damage. It's bad design if you can only win by being able to see into the future. If you have run your head into the wall a few times you will know the triggers and it basically becomes a minigame of avoiding those. One of the worst examples is from the Rising Sun campaign. At one point you will be confronted with a huge enemy fleet and have to hold out until your battleships arrive. When they arrive it is still not enough to destroy the enemie's base but you absolutely need to destroy all their shipyards. Why you ask? Because the AI will start producing an indefinite amount of aircraft carriers and since anti-air turrets are horribly weak you will lose.Red Alert 3 is not a horrible game but is has so many shortcomings compared to its predecessor that I cannot recommend it at all.P.S.: If you liked the Tanya from Red Alert 2 you will be severely disappointed.More reviews here "

												This game is awesome. The actors are great, they all seem to be having a great time and not taking it too seriously which is the perfect tone for this game. The gameplay is incredible, action packed, fun, and classic Red Alert fun. I found this to feel similar to Red Alert 2 which isn't a bad thing at all in my opinion. The graphics look great, the bases are fun to build and the challenge starts to kick in during the campaign. So far I've only played though some of the Soviet Campaign (which they recommend you play first. But it's the best Dr. Frankenfurter as the Premier of the Soviet Union~ What more could I say? This game is great. If you liked Red Alert 2 I don't see any reason you wouldn't like this.			"

												Once, in a match, I saw this Allied Rocket Trooper, stuck under the water, but still being able to fire rockets.I had around 6 Shogun Battleships blow him to wonderland. Unfortunately, the water shielded him from the explosive barrages. Then a soldier gunned him down.I am questioning the Shogun Battleship's firepower...But on the bright side, I had an Attack Dog that took hardly any damage from running past 3 Armageddon Tanks who were firing at him.  Who let the dogs out?Canines are invulnerable! (Then they get one-shot by infantry units)8.5/10 Dogs & Bears with Anti-Tank fur coats, and troops turning into Mermaids to avoid artillery barrages --- what more could you want?EDIT: Of course, the enemy AI cheats by being able to launch strikes at your base without sending a sighting-unit over, which Human commanders must do (i was building a little infantry army so i can para-drop them and the Soviet AI launched a badger-bomber strike there, killing them all instantly, with NONE of their units at my base to reveal the shroud - this happens in every playthrough; beware!)...

												All the same it is a pity that Westwood is now not, but part 3 is not so bad.The game has distinctive features that distinguish the game from other strategies.*the game can actively build and defend the base.*interesting maps and their structure.*New super weapons, and there was a table of improvements in the game ""generals"".*the game has a story, and he is not boring and even an interesting and exciting finale.*new game engine, all miss the old but it is a step in front in terms of graphics.* each country has its own type of animation and the construction of buildings.*a lot of stereotypes, of course a lot, it's the mother of his Red Alert.8.5 / 10 - with vodka game is excellent, I recommend this.

												The last good C&C game, fun, easy to learn and hard to master.The cartoony graphic's may seem  weird, but they are really well made, and very detailed. It's basically good ol' C&C with addition of water combat and few improvements, worth to check out even if you are into older C&C's.If you wan't to play online, you will have to download C&C Online where you can find a lot of server's with active players.https://cnc-online.net/ "

												Red Alert 3 is an interesting RTS. However, besides the cooperative mode it doesn't add anything even remotely new. It's still solid, the production values are high (gotta love those scenes with real-life actors), but the missions could use more creativity. If you're looking for some innovation, or at the very least, a modest twist in your RTS, you're not going to find it here ...  it's a big, loud and crazy RTS game.

												This is my favourite Command and Conquer game besides Generals: Zero Hour. It has great acting in this game during cutscenes With some very well known actors but onto the gameplay it's just a like any other command and conquer game but it feels so fresh and new but keeps that old command and conquer style which I really like. Campaign is very good played it over and over again, and some of the mods for this game are EXCELLENT. For example there is a mod that allows you to play with C&C generals units or there is one that adds more units and constructions from red alert 3 uprising. So I would say this game is a must buy for C&C fans because we won't be getting one anytime soon since the new generals game was canceled would have been great with frostbite engine :(			"

												Highly recommend for anybody who liked Red Allert 2.PROS: - Graphics - Story and cutscenes with A class actors like J.K. Simmons and George Takei  - Great atmosphere. Funny, with stereotypical nations and amazing music  - Has RA2 feel to itCONS: - AI is not very bright, both enemy and own units(they get stuck all the time)  - nations and units are very unbalanced. - battles are quick, you will be more relying on reflexes than strategyFeels like Warcraft 3, not like it's predecessor. Very confusing for RA2 players at first, so many changes. It took me some time getting used to it. Overall great game. "

												I don't know if it's because I'm getting older and RTS games just no longer appeal to me, or if this is just a bad game. Though I'm leaning toward the latter. The combat in my opinion was a step back from RA: 2 and generally just felt awkward to deal with. Also the games presentation/UI came across as being really dated. I bought the game heavily discounted and still feel like I wasted my money. I'd recommend dusting off your old copy of RA: 2 and giving that another go instead.			"

												This is, to my mind, the best Command & Conquer game out there. Some complain about the blatant fanservice with respect to the use of well-edowed female actrices in the hammy videos, while others believe that Red Alert 3 has gone too far with respect to the silliness inherent in the series (i.e. the use of war bears by the Soviets and the mecha-inspired units in the army of the Empire of the Rising Sun). To me, all that stuff is simply silly fluff that shouldn't be taken seriously. What should be taken seriously is the gameplay. The game is a refined version of the Command & Conquer style of real-time strategy game: a simple economy (you build powerplants to power your structures and harvest ore to get money to buy more buildings and units) with an emphasis on the spectacle of battle. Units are fragile, so expect many of them to be destroyed more or less as soon  as you encounter enemy forces. Hard counters are used, which means that some units, for example, have no defences against air units, or are weak against certain types of infantry, and so forth. This means that reconaissance is as important if not more so as in other RTS games. Red Alert 3 is more micro-heavy than most of the other games in the series. Each and every unit has a toggable special ability (hotkey F), and use of these special abilities will prove essential in most battles. Combined with the speed at which units move and their fragile nature, this means that games can get very hectic, very fast. It's for this reason that I mostly avoid multiplayer: I know that I won't be good enough to compete anyway. Instead, I stick to singleplayer and it's loads of fun. The game has three factions and each of them gets their own campaign, with each campaign consisting of nine missions each. The different factions are the Allies, the Soviets, and a new third faction especially developed for this game, namely the Empire of the Rising Sun (essentially Japan). The Allies emphasize their air power, while the Soviets field relatively sturdy ground troops and can spit out a lot of units. The Empire is a high-tech faction with specialized units (remember: F is your friend!) and probably the most difficult to play by newcomers. The leaders of each of these factions are played by well-known actors: Vincent Pryce, Tim Curry, and George Takei, respectively. I've put many hours into the disc version of the game before buying it anew on Steam and do not regret a single minute that I spent playing the game. The campaign is entertaining and can also be played fully in co-op mode. If you don't have any friends, an AI will take over. The AI sometimes really helps out during missions, but more often than not simply forms a distraction that the enemy AI will occupy itself with while you build your base and reinforce your army. If the campaign is not your cup of tea, you can always play skirmishes against the computer or go online (there is a replacement out there for GameSpy, so the online component does still work, thanks to the fans).

												Isn't as addictively fun as Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge, but, you know what? It's still fun, and it's different enough from other CnC games (in a good way, unlike CnC 4) to stand out on it's own. Like, there's a pretty interesting balance between naval and ground combat that doesn't make either feel like an afterthought, and the campaigns, while campy with pointless fanservice and mindnumbing writing, offer diverse scenarios.Now, one thing I really hate, it has lots of unnecesseary micro. Not only is the game full of hard counters so you have to order around units so they wouldn't get owned by their counters while concentrating their fire onto weakest targets, pretty much every unit has it's own gimmick special, be it a special attack or alternative fire mode, so the amount of unnecesseary micro is unberable. Red Alert 2 kept it way more simple, and if unit had several firing modes you wouldn't need to switch between them, meanwhile here it's not even Starcraft or CoH levels of micro. Worst offender is the new third faction, Empire of the Rising Sun. They have probably the most of alternative modes due to sizeable chunk of their force being transformers like a machinegun mecha that switches into a fighter and such, and you can't switch back for some time like you get with, say, Starcraft 2 vikings, so it's rather annoying.Units in general are pretty cool, even if there are some familiar ones like Natasha Volkova not only sharing the cyborg's from Red Alert 1 name but also being pretty much Yuri's Revenge Boris crossed with GLA's Jarmen Kell. IFVs are exactly the same too, but they are light ATVs and not paper-thin armored vehicles now. Tesla Troopers, despite having an AoE paralysis alt-fire mode, are exactly the same slow knuckleheads as before. The more unique units are alsothe more bizarre ones, say soviets have APCs that instead of deploying troops fire them out of a circus cannon just to have them land with parachutes, Allies have helicopters equiped with freeze and shrink rays (the first just paralyse and weaken affected targets, meanwwhile shrink rays make units punny, squishy, squeaky-voiced but also fast), and Empire has anime schoolgirl psychics, katana infantry, obligatory mechas and even more obligatory ninjas!Now, visuals! Units are absolutely cartoony and bright, which is forgiveable considering general tone, but Soviet aesthetics are attrocious. They have some sweet designs like Sickle, but their heavy armor and structures are butt-ugly and look more silly than threatening. Some structures even have those Kremlin towers slapped on, like in RA2. Except it worked in RA2 because red brick buildings with towers did look like Kremlin, and RA3's towered soviet buildings look like turtles with erection! One thing that's actually gorgeous is the sea, which makes sense considering you get as much naval action as ground. Oh and soundtrack is great. They had Klepacki write only the Hell March but this other composer seems to be talented, too.Other stuff worth mentioning: there are no permament upgrades you research like in Generals or CnC3, instead you get experience points in battle that are then redeemed for special abilities and upgrades, which can be quite a game changer. Also there is co-op but to be honest considering the fact campaign isn't really difficult while playing on your own with a dim-witted AI companion, I wouldn't expect it to be a challenge for two players, plus most of the time it's just ""Player 1 takes on ground forces, Player 2 takes on naval forces"". Uprising standalone expansion has some actually challenging missions but ironically lacks in co-op functionality.Overall I could recommend this even for die-hard CnC fans, unless they're not fond of dense and campy setting or hate micro, and it's definitely a must-try for anyone interested in an enjoyable and accessible RTS.

												An underrated RTS gem that's just plain fun. I can understand why C&C fanboys might dislike it; it doesn't take itself seriously whatsoever. The Allies command Dolpins with sonar pulse weapons, the Soviets have zeppelin-like Kirov Airships, and the Empire has frickin' Warriors with beam katanas. The units, story and cutscenes are all over-the-top ridiculous but it's highly entertaining. The gameplay is as intense as ever, and the cell-shaded graphics are beautiful, especially the crisp blue water. The difficulty scaling is very good; even though I was once Masters in SC2 I went Easy mode for a nice, relaxing playthrough. Medium isn't too bad if you want to play missions a couple times. Overall this game is just excellent in every aspect.			"

												Out the gate, nothing but enthusiasm. I was a HUGE fan of the original Red Alert and the Aftermath expansion. (Not Counterstrike though.) RE2 was enjoyable, but too comical for my liking. Still, replayed it about 2-3 times. THIS however? This game can go die in a fire. The graphics look like an imitation of Dark Reign 2, and the entire game system apes Blizzard's.Previously EA used a left-click system, with centralised Barracks and War Factories (where multiples increased the speed of unit production), as well as a long, but simple, unit selection menu. Now even the power meter is gone. EA, you killed the RE series with Generals, now you are only torturing its corpse.			"

It's a really nice touch, and gives the game a really unique taste. Although it can be finished quite quickly, so if you're only interested in the campaign missions, don't expect that much game time.			"

												I want to make a note, that I've only played RA3 for about 6 - 7 h when writing this ""review"".I can see a fun game in there somewhere, but one major thing really kills the gameplay for me; at least during th solo campaing, and that is the shared economy. I really hate that. Since the AI is always building stuff you can't save up money for things to build, and you are ALWAYS short of resources because of this. It is really frustrating! I was looking forward to having a full co-op campaign when I bought this game, but I was not ready for that design decision.Otherwise I've been surprised about how well this holds up as a sequel to RA2 and YR. And it is fun that we finally get a main campaign that focuses on the Sovjet side. Sure, previous games have always had the sovjet campaign aswell, but that was not the main story. And having such a great actor-rooster adds to the experience.The amoun of bewbs (or cleavage) this game shows can be discussed. The twelve-year old inside my 25 year old body is happy, but the game would have been just as good (perhaps better) without it.So how does the game feel then?Basically this game is a mixture of the previous C&C titles. You've got the familiar units, all though redesigned, from the RA-series with addition of new units. You've also got the micromanagment system from RA2, which was lacking in the Generals-series; waypoints and hold-fire and stuff like that. Then again, some controls and features from the Generals series have found its way in here. It is really odd to see units and gameplay first feeling like generals, but then also feeling like RA2. I'm not sure I'm all that fond of the mixture yet.I'm sure my view on this game will change as time goes by. And if I manage to get online I will add that experience to this review later on. Will I recommend this game for new players? Well if you have RA2/Yuri's Revenge and you somehow manage to play that online then stick with that game, because it is more fluent than this. At least in my humble opinion.If you don't have anything else, I can surley see this as a viable option. And for 5 dollars on steam it is worth it.			"

												Awesome! Great addition to a great franchise. One of the games that pioneered high production value cutscenes and live action performances that elevate the experience to a new level.I found myself laughing at the enemy taunts (which of course were presented by seasoned actors and performers giving the game that often missing ""social feel""). Classic RTS game play with three completely different play styles for each give it a high replay value. Add skirmishes and it will keep you playing long after the campaigns are done.Recommended for fans of the franchise or lovers of RTS and strategy genre. Great graphics, great performances all around and an engaging if not over the top plot with the feel of a big budget hollywood production. I only ever write a review if I feel strongly enough to do so and this is one of them for certain. Looking forward to future titles carrying or expanding upon the tradition that Westwood studios so boldly started when it had the Dune franchise. Command and Conquer rocks! I can't say enough about the use of live action performers and great voice talent as well. It just gives so much life to the whole experience.Highly recommended.			"

												In my opinion, this game is NOTHING like RA2. I don't know if I'm being biased towards nostalgic memories or it's true but RA2 is just so much better. This game is still fun nonetheless, it just doesn't have the RA2 vibe, at least for me. Would I recommend it? It's a fun RTS, it still has all the RA2 units (♥♥♥♥ Kirovs) and they added some new stuff, they also have models acting.			"

												Everyone will tell you that this game is a continuation of the wacky shenanigans that happened in RA2, but I really don't remember the game being that wacky and silly. Case in point, in Yuri's Revenge, there was a building that ground up troops for resources all while using slave labor.Mind you, this was also a game where you fight dinosaurs and hollywood stars were actually commandoes, but I can also say that with the combination of frank klepacki's unapologetically metal soundtrack combined with equal amounts ridiculous and awesome units and set pieces, RA 2 worked on a level that couldn't be replicated.That being said, RA3 is in no way the game that anyone was looking for. See, what sets RA2 above other RTS games is the idea that a gamebreaker should be countered with a gamebreaker. Just remember the chronotroops and the psychich commandos, its a game with glorious power creep that encourages you to out-do your opponent.That being said, not only did EA make a pathetic attempt to balance this game, nothing feels as crazy or nearly as fun. Or as balanced.A focus on naval warfare means that Rising Sun in theory should have an advatage, but with no viable anti-air until at least 2nd tier dock/factory, and to be honest I never used it. Everything feels squishy and underpowered, and nothing is as interesting as it was in RA2, and although Klepacki's soundtrack is fun, its not nearly as engrossing as it was in his other works.If you're really jonesing for a CnC game, get tiberium wars/wrath of kane.

												Laughable, non-sensical, preposterous, absurd... and worth every minute. It's like one of those films that are so bad, they're good again. The storyline is melodrama extreme, with some awesome cut-scene performances (Tim Curry's final appearance in the Allied campaign the cherry on the icing on the sponge cake!) There's nothing serious about this game, with bears, dolphins and robotic samurai all playing their part. Three excellent single-player campaigns, with the bonus of the entire game being co-op friendly. Didn't bother with multiplayer, so can't comment there.			"

												Lot's of CnC fans like to hate this game.  I love it.  It has, along with the expasion Uprising, some of the highest replayability of any game.  I have around 1000 hours logged in this game - all fun.  The three different mechanics for bas building can be confusing.  However, once you learn them... especially Rising Sun... you can do amazing stuff.I honestly think CnC fans who didn't like this game didn't play it enough.  I have gold on every commander's challenge on Uprsing, and you learn exactly how to manage each unit to win that.Awesome.   My greatest disappointment in video games in that there have been no CnC titles (ignoring CnC 4, of course) in about a decade.			"

												So it's one of the few good EA titles on Steam, and it's not saddled with some other atrocious DRM. As for the game itself, it's a super colourful, campy fun time. The campaign is three factions long, each with their own ways of playing (the Empire of the Sun units probably require more micro), not to mention the fact that there's a naval component to factor in. Coupled with a good variety of traditional RTS mission styles, and you've got a really lengthy campaign for its genre, before even setting foot in MP (SP only review, no experience with matchmaking, connectivity, etc.)But let's be honest though, you play this game to see Tim Curry yuck it up as a Soviet Premier, among other standouts like J.K. Simmons, Jonathan Pryce, George Takei, the Nature Boy Ric Flair (Uprising expansion) and a requisite lineup of pinup females. It's an anachronistic, yet heartfelt throwback to C&C's heyday during the 90s FMV trend, which is super appropriate given the time-travelling shennanigans this B-movie cooks up for it's stupidly fun plot.

												This, this is what RTS used to be... Starting from C&C, going to red alert... They ended up ruining the series thanks to EA, I have been a fan from moment 1. If you don't know the series, spend the couple of $ to find out about this expierence... The game is brilliant, with a friend it's even better, there is no official online gaming platform anymore, but there is a 3th party platform that keeps this functionality alive.This is the last of the C&C series that came quite decent... After this EA completely ruined the series while the original Westwood developers fleed across the world and became succesfull elsewhere.Game is rated a 8/10 due to the lack of multiplayer support.

												I would not suggest this game to anyone who was a fan of the original Red Alert/2/Yuri's Revenge or even C&C Generals, EA and whatever is left of Westwood is long gone and dead.  This game does not have an enjoyable campaign, the units are basic and boring, and it is not fun thus defeating the purpose of it being classified as a ""game"".  The campaign is flat out dull and boring, the witty cutscenes that went hand in hand with good gameplay are no longer there, EA has seen fit to simply have bad acting encompass their bad game design just so they can say ""look we remember what RA used to be too!""  The units are boring and made out of paper, the fun general powers from C&C Generals make a return but with None of the fun or innovation that the previous title put into it.  Factional units are cut and paste from each other with only some different looking models and alternate modes being the variation.  The units in general show the worst signs of AI that I have ever seen in ANY RTS title or game that I have played PERIOD.  They are extremely near-sighted; they always fail to return fire unless you give them a direct order and will just sit there getting blown away by everything.  Speaking of alternate unit modes, this game tries to do something different and fails utterly, the only thing that these abilities do is further complicate the most BASIC C&C formula and further hamper the gameplay and fun factor of the title.  Even when you have them built with attack at will rather then defensive they will consistently neglect to defend themselves even when the enemy unit is right on top of them, it is babysitting of the highest order and a huge failing of the “game” and its developers.  The “future” has shown that any C&C title past Generals or maybe the earlier 3D C&Cs have been a complete failure as fans continue to drop the titles in favor of something less driven by greed and fake innovation.During the campaign you can either have a coop human player, if you can keep connection with EA’s trash servers (another quality sign of EA) or you can be aided by the in game AI, which is semi competent enough however the kicker is that for an RTS game you and your coop player share ore resources, which is absolutely ridiculous and a really poorly thought-out mechanic.  On the subject of the campaign again I will clarify further that it is one of the most boring three faction story mode that I have ever played let alone failing to bring me any joy from playing it.  I have to push myself in order to go back to it and attempt to finish it that’s how I consider the story mode and the game in general, boring and a CHORE, no game should ever make the player feel that way!  I am very glad that I never got this game when it came out for the full price and even then $10 for a 2008 title I still feel ripped off and the price proves that EA will never stop being a money grubbing parasite. To add to this, Steam needs to change the description of this game since as of now the Gamespy servers have been shut down indefinitely so the online Coop and multiplayer are no longer a functioning entity of this title.The music of C&C has always been memorable this is especially the case with the Red Alert series.  However in RA3 they have yet again gone away from being GOOD and simply moved to the most repetitious garbage that I have had to listen to repeated through the ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.  You will hear a single song for the entirety of each an every single mission within the campaign as well as the multi and skirmish section, not ONCE is the famous Red Alert song played at any point within the game short of the menu, that is yet more proof that there is no longer a Command and Conquer series of RTS games at all.  They have simply screwed up on the entire game, which amazingly enough extends to even the music score which is unbelievable.  I am saddened that this title got such higher praises then I feel that it should have, as if the fans were so hopeful to the possibilities of the new EA Westwood titles that everyone seems to have given this game a pass regardless to how bad it truly is.  I feel sorry that the younger generations after me will never again know how good C&C titles used to be and that based on this, my last C&C title that I will buy, we will never see the good days again.

												C&C: RA3 is one of those very much so rare games that even though all competition from newer RTS-titles, still have managed to remain just as fun to play at the current as back when they were initially released. With this IP, EA Los Angeles introduced to us (the players) one of the very best of gaming-experiences ever crafted, let alone one which one could ever have asked for. EALA gave us players lots of additional features and tools both advanced as simple that made and still makes this game from the bigger rest.The Developers gave us the very best, with features such as the fantasticaly simplictic hosting-system of which still runs as smooth as ever and in which one didn't need to set up a entiere f*****g home-based server in-order to do so.The RA3 Worldbuilder map-editor which was and once again still remains one of the simplest and most time-saving/conserving map-editors ever to have been introduced to the gaming community.The Brutal smart-AI's,.. although admittedly not being the hardest nor smartest in all of gaming history, did give us quite a ride with their smart and uncountable use of tactics which they 'occasionally'' deployed with great cunning fighting alonside or versus the players.The SuperWeapons, even if 'yes a bit anoying'' did by fact bring us that underlying sense of fear of imminent destruction and the feeling that the favors might swing to your opponents side in any number of seconds. It made for a crucial part of the RA3 playing mentality.They gave us a truly unqiue set of factions whom opperated in very distinct ways from one another and of which employed different tactics for the various of tasks.Lastly, they gave us the Replay, one of the first in-whole trully so good theater-modes as far as RTS-IPs' are concerned.Now, too finish off this way too overly extensive review of mine I shall end by proclaiming in-accordance with personal opinion, that Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 most-probably am one of the very best game-IPs' to have been crafted in reccent memory. -:""Spoken In The Common Man's Langauge; It Would Be Fair To Considered It My Nr.1 Favorite Game Of All Time.""(Rating: 11/11)			"

												Solid gameplay, good campaign, and intriguing units. This truely is the sequel to red alert 2 with its querkyness and all. Although this game does not take itself very seriously it is massively fun to play for hours on end. Strategy is key in this game where you have many options of assault and you are able to take research and development in different areas to see what is effective. You will soon learn after playing the strengths and weaknesses of each faction and just how to play as each. This game decides to mix naval air and ground battles just as in red alert 2 but it is done better as you have the worry of being snuck up on by enemy fleets, or bombed by bombers.This game is great and I enjoy it more than many of the other command and conquer games out there. Definitely buy this and if you enjoy the campaign or just single player battles but wish for more units then buy the expansion pack it is worth the money if you don't mind no multiplayer which really is a shame.

												Sometimes the soul of a person, or a game, is laid bare in a single moment. In Red Alert 3, there is a Soviet general with six stars per shoulder, dozens and dozens of medals and a coffee mug decorated with Soviet iconography. In one mission briefing he gravely warns that ""Our enemies are thrusting deeply into Mother Russia's tender nether regions."" It only gets better when the Soviet Hammer Tank exclaims ""It's hammer time!"" and moves to engage. The best thing about all this is that the actual gameplay follows suit, being both fast-paced and relaxing. Graphical style is very gonzo and bright and fits the subject matter perfectly, as does the gloriously nonsensical soundtrack. Red Alert 3 is silly harmless fun that has not aged a bit in five years.			"

												There are two things in particular that make this game: the humour, and the co-op. Truth be told, I haven't played through either of the previous Red Alert games, so I wouldn't know how this is as a sequel. However, on it's own, this game is very fun, especially if you play through it with a friend. Not a lot of RTS games offer co-op throughout their campaign, and it was very welcome as co-op is guaranteed to improve any game. The comedy of the game was also great. I'm not saying it's particularly hilarious, it's just that it's an RTS that doesn't take itself seriously, which again, not a lot of RTS games do. It does have it's moments though that are genuinely funny, especially from the live-action performances of Tim Curry, George Takei, and JK Simmons. The story is also appropriately absurd and great if you don't want to take yourself seriously.Gameplay wise, there are much deeper RTS games to play besides this one. Again, don't dismiss it because of that, it's still fun, but if you are looking for a very strategic RTS, this isn't the one. Not to say the strategic element is completely lacking, the three factions all have their own play styles which can translate into having to alter your strategy depending on who you are playing as and who you are fighting. All three factions can also build on land, air, and water which also have their own strengths and weaknesses. Water is also prominently built into each map, so navies are actually quite useful, another thing that not a lot of other RTS games do. Like I said before though, the gameplay is good, just not great.Great game if you like RTS games and want a loony experience with one of your friends.			"

												I just recently purchased this game again on this steam account, I have the Complete collection on another PC, and have played this game for thousands of hours since it's release date, as well as other RTS series like Starcraft, AOE, Empire Earth however this is one of the Greatest RTS games I've ever played, though personally not as great as C&C: RA 2, which to me was the most enjoyable, but currently is not supported through Revora's online Multiplayer* system.The Campaign story is Cannon from RA:2 but is in a way that if you haven't played RA:2 it won't negitvely impact your experience, it is funny and gripping, especially if you get caught up into the moment when you play through, and you have the choice to play solo or co-op** The GameSpy servers are long gone, so if you want to do any online matchmaking with any of the features you will need to look up Revora's C&C Online.The game is well designed, with Land Air and Sea Combat, Good diversity between factions, unit promotions, unit microskills (activatable abilities), Support Abilities (Faction based abilities available to you).The existing Multipllayer community on Revora is small but active (and skilled)If you are not familar with playing RTS in online multiplayer, especially during the 07-11 era when the RTS E-sport scene was at its peak then do not get too upset if you go over to Revora your first few times around and you get crushed, they do have some great people over there.Great Soundtrack (Hellmarch is amazing), Good UI, Challenging AI, lots of maps, and a lot of Youtube content if your looking to see the game played before you make a purchase.If you are new to RTS games, or are a long time RTS fan who never played RA:3 I suggest you do, I also personally suggest you play RA:2 if your able to play LAN games or are satisfied playing against the AI.

												Let me start by saying how much i loved Westwood Studios and their Command & Conquer  franchise. I was introduced to it on the Nintendo 64, with Tiberium Dawn(Or the original or those of you who don't know.) Red Alert 3 manages to nail the so cheesy it's good feel that the C&C series is renowned for. I love the live action cast, and there is great fun to be had in this game. The units are diverse as are the Factions, the Empire of the Rising Sun has units ranging from GIant Robots to Psychic School Girls, where the Soviets are more docile. Soviets are slow and powerful and the Allies are the most well balanced. Each vehicle has a special ability. This game feels like C&C and it is very fun, even if it isn't of Westwood stature. I highly recommend this game. My only irritation is the lack of buildings and new units. I'm looking forward to picking up Command & Conquer 3 and latter on Age of Empires III! So until then, this should hold me over! Try the demo if you're sceptical!			"

												As a sequel to Red Alert series is currently the latest one, which is quite a masterpiece of quality! Each faction unique, each arms increased their skills, increasing the game's difficulty and maneuverability, to say the least not as RA2 as little maneuverability. I respect the game screen Needless to say, very shocking, really appreciate open full effectsIn short, I think Red Alert 3 as a game in itself is a good quality, and enhance the competitive, there are operational, strategically, but also balance, Nishiki tribute, tribute CNC series!

												The B-Movie acting in the campaigns that you expect from Red Alert makes the fun, dynamic, and interesting campaign levels even better. The acting is funny and the effort that they put into the story for the campaigns make it even better. All 3 factions are well done and balanced giving multiplayer a great feel. It is not ""Which faction is the best?"" it is ""How can I play them to my style.?""The abilities that are included in your troops make it very interesting; such as the bullfrog transport and the various EMP abillities for Soviet tesla troopers. It makes the game more dynamic and fun, as you never know when your buddy is going to rain down a couple dozen squads of Soviet infantry into your poorly walled in base. In RA3 you never know what is going to happen next.I at first was playing on ""Very Low"" graphics for some reason, and I was still blown away at how much fun I was having; but then I changed it to ""Ultra-High"" and was even more blown away; the lighting effects, shimmering of water, lighting bolts, command abilities, lasers, and bullets, all combine in firefights to make it look absolutely spectacular.

												Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3 (C&C: RA3) is very similar to EA's recent Tiberium branch of the Command and Conquer series. Utilizing the same engine, C&C: RA3 provides identical gameplay with the same trademark live-action cutscenes. The story is fun and diverse, but players from the Tiberium series are going to feel that it is all too much the same.			"

												Red Alert 2 still remains the best C&C game. There, I said it. No turning back now. I had high hopes back when this was first released. But the talking vehicles (in the tutorial) came across as forced and childish. The graphics are beautiful though, and the implementation of co-op is a nice feature. But it just can't beat RA2. I'm not even sure if it tried. All in all, it's a pretty good C&C game, and strategy game in general. It's way, way better than C&C4, that's for sure. So if you have to choose between those two, make sure you pick this one.[Rating: 75/100]			"

Posted: December 5, 2013
												TL;DR Review:Red Alert 3 is a beautiful, terrifically fun game that also does some interesting things with the RTS genre.Long Review:The Red Alert series has some defining aspects - alternate histories, time travel, trained animal units, psychic powers - but its most obvious trait was the cheesiness of its cutscenes.  The Red Alert developers realized that trying to do ""serious"" FMV for these games usually ended up producing something nigh-unwatchable, like Command & Conquer 2.  So they decided to just turn the cheese knob until it broke off, and Red Alert 3 continues this tradition with pride.  It combines time travel and crazy inventions and Tim Curry to make a wonderful, fun mess of a storyline.  And the best part is that the actors are into it - they understand that the scenery here is meant to be eaten.But look past the cheese (and cheesecake) and you'll find a fun, very playable RTS.  The three sides all play differently, with the Russians being the simple bruisers, the Empire having the coolest (but most difficult to use) units and the Allies having the most useful commander powers.Plus, the game has co-op.  The ""single player"" campaign is actually designed to be played by two people at once, each controlling a different commander.  Since co-op multiplayer is the best multiplayer, it was nice to see this finally come to the RTS genre.  And don't worry - if you don't have anyone to play with, there are nine different AI commanders to help you out, each of whom has their own play style and personality.  As the story progresses and you move to the next campaign, AI commanders that used to be your allies could become your enemies and vice-versa - an excellent touch.The game is also beautiful, with some of the best water I've ever seen. Models are detailed, textures are rich and of good resolution and special effects are excellent.In short, Red Alert 3 may have disappointed fans who were eagerly awaiting the next ""real"" Command & Conquer, but if you take it for what it is it's a blast.Plus hot chicks.

												I played RA3 for about 4 years on and off, Its a solid and well polished RTS, by biggests cristisms are that the online servers got killed off when Gamespy went under and EA did nothing to replace them,Another minor issue, this game has a problem when running duel or mutiple monitors, your mouse cursor wonders off on to the inactive display, so you have to unplug your second or addtional monitors which is a pain in the rear.Common invalid complaints about this game are: a) 'its too 'cartoony' but that trend was really started by RA2.b) 'RA2 YR was better ' No it wasn't it was a laugh, but the balance in the RA2 YR was freaking awful,  it became a one faction joke of an RTS in multiplayer, Everyone just played as Allies, because Soviets were usless if you didnt rush in the first 5 mins, and playing as Yuri was just 'cheap' no strategy needed, just steal all the enermy units or boomer rush. In RA3 all 3 factions are very well balanced indeed. And you cannot spam your way to victory with only one unit type.c) 'too much micro managment' - Basically translates as 'the game is too hard for me.'RA3 was the last good C&C game to come out of EA LA, highly recomended if you can live without multiplayer out of the box.

You can play it deeply, lovely if you like Real-Time Strategy renge of game. I think you should add this game in your library without any hesitation. Playing this version is more detailed rather than old titles. Also Skirmish, Single Player, Campaign and LAN or multi types of game is very enjoyful. On the other hand, I hope all Command&Conquer titles must be on Steam as 17 titles. This game is classic for all time, top ten, hall of fame for pc gaming in my opinion. Also, Red Alert titles are better than Tiberium series so choose this game, firstly. :)			"

												Dear lord I miss the days of old. Back in the day when you saw a beatiful day outside. You could hear the children playing and laughing. Then you'd close the curtains because they were disturbing your RA3 match. The days of old when there were no other games than CS and RTS's to distract you from doing something productive.Well I might actually say something useful in this too since I decided to spend time writing it in the first place...The game features three factions: The Japanese Empire, The Allies, and the Soviets.Each of the three factions bring a unique playstyle to the table. As the Japanese have a very mobile force capable of moving individual buildings all around the battlefield (ps Japan ♥♥♥♥ing op nerf plz) they do lack in some things where for example the Allies have great air support but lack in land units that the Soviets can bring to the table.Overall even though not greatly balanced it's an interesting asymmetrical RTS with a cool theme and creative units.What it lacks in depth it brings back double in hilariousness and general nonsensical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I give it a good ol' thumbs up!			"

												+ uses the updated version of the Sage engine, the one that debuted in Generals: the effects (especially the water effects) look stunning+ has a similar script that Red Alert 2 had: they toned down the seriousness of the very first game and instead included some funny dialogues to help with the cheesy storyline+ ambitious casting, perhaps the best in the entire series with Tim Curry, Peter Stormare, Jonathan Pryce and J.K. Simmons just to name a few+ inclusion of offshore battlegrounds: almost every building can be built on water; this gives way to newer tactics+ finally, a 3rd faction we can choose from: the Empire of the Rising Sun is an instant favourite thanks to the unit variation (plus George Takei!)- ore fields were removed: we now have stationery ore mines that are nice but cutting of the enemy's' resources now is not as important or effective as it used to be- campaign could have been a little longer: while there are 9 missions with each side completing the first 4-5 does not take very long- the game desperately tries to show something new with the inclusion of the naval warfare: this is not necessarily a problem but throughout the campaign there's too much emphasis on it - mediocre coop integration: while playing all 27 levels with a friend is pretty cool, playing solo is pretty difficult at times due to the dumbed-down A.I. that is not always helpfulTo summarise: for me the number 2 will be the essential Red Alert title but this one was also pretty neat back in 2008. Running it on modern PCs can be a tad bit difficult - thanks to the uploaded guide available you can find some fixes for the game.			"

												This game is going offline here pretty soon thanks to EA dropping support for the ""less than 1%"" of their playerbase across over 50 of their titles. Regardless, this is a RTS game that would still remain fantastic to play in singleplayer OR co-op with a friend, as everything does work with Hamachi and if you have a disc version, Gameranger works too. The game has an extensive list of tutorials that for the most part a seasoned C&C player can entirely ignore and figure the new stuff out themselves, but as far as features go, this game is the closest thing to a Westwood C&C styled game that has come out since their demise. No squad system, extreme countering-style units, extreme diversion amongst the factions (the fast-paced allies, the turtle-heavy soviets, and the...asians), diverse base construction (finally bringing walls back) and a ton of lighthearted and extremely amusing missions and dialogue from units and the campaign with rocking music featuring Tim Wynn, James Hannigan, and of course, Frank Klepacki from the westwood titles helping to soundtrack as well. That said, the campaign is absolutely fantastic by ANY standard - FMV cutscenes that add up to somewhere around an hour in length and use top notch actors such as J.K. Simmons and George Takei.As far as how well this game can bring in new players to the series, it's extensive campaign and the fact that 1 of the 3 campaigns (Soviet one) is almost explicitly designed to ease players into the gameplay makes this a FANTASTIC entry point for newcomers. The tutorial itself consists of 6 amusing tutorials that really don't feel tedious despite totalling about an hour in length to explain the game mechanics, and are entirely skippable for anyone who's familiar with certain aspects of C&C or basic RTS controls to either see newer features or try to figure it out themselves. And for those not particularly happy with the soviet campaign style of easing players in, the allies campaign as well as empire campaign are notably more difficult right off the starting line and clearly designed with veteran players in mind. The campaign endings are lackluster so don't expect anything amazing, but the story throughout each campaign is rather intriguing. And yes, I keep going back to the campaign - that is really where the most work went into this game, clearly. The campaign at all points in time gives you an AI partner of a certain personality, each personality having a different playstyle. If you don't want an AI partner, it's possible to have a friend play with you instead in co-op, replacing the AI partner. The AI isn't particularly bad, however, and you are capable of issuing 4 basic commands (Strike area, strike target, plan (build up and launch) attack, don't attack) to your AI companion in an attempt to order them around like you would with another player.As far as skirmish goes, it does provide a lot of replayability as once again, you can call in these AI personalities to fight with or against you. Likewise, in multiplayer which will be limited to LAN-based hosting services or just straight up REAL LAN if anyone still uses that, other players can join you and you can still add AI or remove them at will. The limit to 6 players at maximum, however, is upsetting, and the map editor for this game does not work with the steam version as far as I can tell, but there's already plenty of community maps worth downloading and playing.For a $20 asking price, you are more than getting your money's worth. Compared with the considerably less westwood-like C&C 3 Tiberium Wars game asking $30, you are far better off getting this game and will undoubtably have more fun with it alone or with friends and it is by far the best entry into the C&C series as a whole for new players.

												The C&C Red Alert series is a francise that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Wacky unit types and off-kilter performances by cutscene actors help bring a bit of humour to the brutal business of war.It hasn't quite got the wide range of tactical options achieved in Command & Conquer: Generals, and the single player campaigns do feel a little short, but you are treated to 3 individual factions.Oh, and for the hormonal teens out there - there's a fair amount of cleavage in every cutscene.

												Gotta love the Grandaddy of RTS games. While ""Westwood"" studios, the creator of the original Command & Conquer games may be no more, there legacy lives on in this game and other. Give it a whirl. The live action cut scenes make me laugh, but I love Tim Curry and George Takei from ""Star Trek"" so I'm biased. This game isn't as serious as ""Command & Conquer: 3 Tiberium Wars"" (my favorite of the whole series) but it's fun and it's expansion. I bought them on STEAM !!CHEAP!! and you can get em too. And you should.			"

												I have been a Command & Conquer fan ever since I first started playing Tiberian Sun. Since then I have playes all the C&C games and I absolutely love them. Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 is absolutely no exception to that. For those of you who like the 'core' RTS games (read: RTS as it should be not the new style like C&C4) I think C&C: RA3 would be a must have. It contains a great story and tons of humor. Don't miss out on this one. Good luck Commanders!			"

												This game is going offline here pretty soon thanks to EA dropping support for the ""less than 1%"" of their playerbase across over 50 of their titles. Regardless, this is a RTS game that would still remain fantastic to play in singleplayer OR co-op with a friend, as everything does work with Hamachi and if you have a disc version, Gameranger works too. The game has an extensive list of tutorials that for the most part a seasoned C&C player can entirely ignore and figure the new stuff out themselves, but as far as features go, this game is the closest thing to a Westwood C&C styled game that has come out since their demise. No squad system, extreme countering-style units, extreme diversion amongst the factions (the fast-paced allies, the turtle-heavy soviets, and the...asians), diverse base construction (finally bringing walls back) and a ton of lighthearted and extremely amusing missions and dialogue from units and the campaign with rocking music featuring Tim Wynn, James Hannigan, and of course, Frank Klepacki from the westwood titles helping to soundtrack as well. That said, the campaign is absolutely fantastic by ANY standard - FMV cutscenes that add up to somewhere around an hour in length and use top notch actors such as J.K. Simmons and George Takei.As far as how well this game can bring in new players to the series, it's extensive campaign and the fact that 1 of the 3 campaigns (Soviet one) is almost explicitly designed to ease players into the gameplay makes this a FANTASTIC entry point for newcomers. The tutorial itself consists of 6 amusing tutorials that really don't feel tedious despite totalling about an hour in length to explain the game mechanics, and are entirely skippable for anyone who's familiar with certain aspects of C&C or basic RTS controls to either see newer features or try to figure it out themselves. And for those not particularly happy with the soviet campaign style of easing players in, the allies campaign as well as empire campaign are notably more difficult right off the starting line and clearly designed with veteran players in mind. The campaign endings are lackluster so don't expect anything amazing, but the story throughout each campaign is rather intriguing. And yes, I keep going back to the campaign - that is really where the most work went into this game, clearly. The campaign at all points in time gives you an AI partner of a certain personality, each personality having a different playstyle. If you don't want an AI partner, it's possible to have a friend play with you instead in co-op, replacing the AI partner. The AI isn't particularly bad, however, and you are capable of issuing 4 basic commands (Strike area, strike target, plan (build up and launch) attack, don't attack) to your AI companion in an attempt to order them around like you would with another player.As far as skirmish goes, it does provide a lot of replayability as once again, you can call in these AI personalities to fight with or against you. Likewise, in multiplayer which will be limited to LAN-based hosting services or just straight up REAL LAN if anyone still uses that, other players can join you and you can still add AI or remove them at will. The limit to 6 players at maximum, however, is upsetting, and the map editor for this game does not work with the steam version as far as I can tell, but there's already plenty of community maps worth downloading and playing.For a $20 asking price, you are more than getting your money's worth. Compared with the considerably less westwood-like C&C 3 Tiberium Wars game asking $30, you are far better off getting this game and will undoubtably have more fun with it alone or with friends and it is by far the best entry into the C&C series as a whole for new players.

												Eigentlich kein schlechtes Spiel aber was den Singleplayer angeht ist es ein wenig langweilig. Die Kampagnen sind viel zu kurz und leider auch viel zu einfach. Dafür sind die Änderungen sowohl bei den Alliirten als auch bei den Sowjets super und mit den Japanern wurde eine komplett neue und ziemlich vielseitige Fraktion in das Spiel integriert. Der einzige wirklich ernste Kritikpunkt ist das schlechte Balancing, so ist die Heldin der Japaner beispielsweise viel zu stark. Die Filme sind dafür wieder ganz große Klasse auch wenn das meiste sehr vorhersehbar ist. Eine (eigentlich) gute Fortsetzung, welche aber im Singleplayer ruhig etwas mehr bieten könnte (Länge und Schwierigkeit) und welche für den Multyplayer eine bessere Balance nötig hätte. Fun macht es aber trotz allem.			"

												If you loved the Westwood Studios games, and played the legacy of Yuri through the culmination of Red Alert 1 and Red Alert 2.  You probably waited, chomping at thebit for this release.  After the debacle that was Command and Conquer 4 you may have even thought ""You know,. C&C Red Alert 3 might be better, I loved Red Alert but I didn't really like C&C, so maybe this is the same kinda thing.""  You would be WRONG...  This is the same thing, the same terribleness, not only that but it suffers from consolitous.  It really wants to be a console game, but it's not.  By using the Red Alert name, and hot chicks in the previews + cutscenes it atempts to trick us into thinking it's just as awesome as RA1 or RA2. So if you like being frustrated, and can't wait to waste money on this atrocity, you won't be dissapointed.			"

8/10Recommended PurchaseIf you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!ProsVarietyIn RA:3 there's 3 playable factions,the Allies,The Empire of the Rising Sun,and the Soviets. Each faction has it's own powerful commander-like unit. The allies have Tanya,a demolitions specialist that can one shot most ground infantry and can sneak inside vehicles or buildings to one shot them from the inside with C4.Tanya can also use her special belt to warp back in time to regain lost health.The Reds have Natasha,the greatest sniper in the Soviet Army,and she uses her sniper rifle to line enemies up and shoot through them all at the same time.She can also paint vehicles or buildings with a laser and have a bomber come by and one-shot them. The Empire of the Rising Sun has Yuriko Omega,a badass psychic in a schoolgirl outfit who can use her powers to instantly take a unit out of the fight permanently.She can also use her AoE attack and instantly kill units around her. Every faction has their own unique units and almost all of them are super fun to play around with. The allies have these helicopters that can each freeze one enemy unit and keep them there indefinitly stuck in cryostasis until the helicopter is destroyed.Each faction feels unique and varied and this makes the game incredibly more interesting and fun to play.FMV


Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3 
A Screenshot of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3

In case you didn't know,before games used incredible CGI cutscences they used FMV (Full Motion Video). These were played with real actors and personally I think they look way better than the cutscenes of today but that's besides the point. The FMV scenes in RA:3 are superbly done and add so much to the atmosphere of the game,making it feel significantly more real. These scenes actually make you understand the characters and the situations better and that helps out the gameplay and the story both.General PowersEach faction has a singleplayer-only set of general powers. These powers can sometimeseffect battles greatly. These powers include things like setting up small bombs as the allies,to calling in drone kamikaze squads as the japanese, or even making it rain satellite debris as the reds. These powers can seriously give you an advantage by ambushing units when they're least expecting it or unveiling a secret group of cloaked units.ConsStoryThe story in this game is weird as can be. It involves Russia losing a war with the allies and then going back in time,killing Albert Einstein, and then coming back to a world where the allies are in a stalemate and a new faction of Japanese fanatics has emerged. Seems interesting but it's executed very poorly as the game could have made this work and turned it into something great but instead decided that they would make the game less serious and more funny and silly. The dialogue is so predictable sometimes and at other times the accents of some of the characters begin to fall apart and as you would expect,the game suffers greatly from it.MissionsMost of the missions in this game are actually pretty alright but there are a few,about halfway through each campaign where the game shoots up in difficulty. For example,one of the american missions puts you against the army of a rogue president whos incredibly well dug in and you're timed to break right into the middle of it to try and race him to a launch facility.Missions like this are never a good idea to put into and RTS game and much less to have both terrible missions and an insane difficulty spike.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming "

												Even though the multiplayer was officially shut down earlier this year, its still a fantastic LAN party game to play with mates, probably one of the best RTS's ever made, lots of variation in the units/races with lots of fun to be had in multiplayer skirmishes.Highly reccomend the RA3 Upheavel mod, which adds the red alert 3 uprising units into the multiplayer of the game for even more fun.(The multiplayer can still also be played over a VPN such as Tunngle, Hamachi or Gameranger)			"

												It's easy, Red Alert 3 is just as cheezy, fun, tactical, over the top, outrageous and fun (yeah that's twice) to play as you could hope for.Brilliant fun game, and the Uprising DLC adds a very challenging but rewarding ""challenge"" system to the game + you can play with one of the anime girls which should obviously please to certain gamers.So yeah that's 3x fun in total.

												Despite the seemingly lack of hours, I've completed the game around 2 times plus on different difficulties. Just happened that I repurchased this game off steam recently. I would say that this game is rather well developed in terms of PvP but still lacking in terms of storymode. Ai is still pretty much predictable and the trademark win by numbers is still prevalent in storymode. It is considerably more interesting for PvP. However, I would argue that PvP still lacked depth compared to other rts such as Starcraft 2. Still good for the price. A worthy investment if you have spare cash to throw in hope of finding a decent game.			"

												Command And Conquer: Red Alert 3 AKA C&C RA3 is a game based on stratagy. You must build your base, then build up a force to attack the opposition. It is single player and Multiplayer, so you can play with friends and by your self! Sure, this game is only for windows from steam, but if you have a windows computer, this is worth it to buy. There is also a campaign which I recommend you play as you can play as the Soviets(Russia), The Allies(America) or the Rising sun(Japan). This game is a complete update from the red alert series. I Guarentee you will like this game if you like war stratagy games.			"

												I will start with the dislikes and move on to the likes (not in any particular order): 1. No multiplayer2. Units have very low health and you cannot do much before they are destroyed3. Co-commander is mostly useless in single player campaign4. Skirmish is a slugfest5. SHARED ECONOMY IN SINGLEPLAYER. Your co-commander builds useless♥♥♥♥♥♥and sends them into sucidal charges. 6. Lack of maps and skirmish customizability7. Graphics looks like a cartoon8. You cannot zoom out very much9. Campaigns are easy to finish and a short10. The Japanese campaign is a ♥♥♥♥ING CHORE11. Cheesy acting12. Support powers are overpowered13. No restriction of superweapons in skirmishGood:1. Hotkeys are easy to use and are very useful2. ALL units are well though out and balanced3. Good variety of gameplay and mechanics in each of the factions4. Graphics for this old of a game5. Special abilites are well though out and take skill and timing to properly exploit, not to mention thier usefulness 6. Easy to play, but hard to master7. Pretty balanced between all the factions and their units, minus support powers8. Good variety in singleplayer campaign missions (different objectives, playstyles etc.)9. Many approaches to completing an objective or mission. 10. Combining units, powers, and their special abilites are VERY cool to use and are effectiveOverall, I did not like this game as much as the second one, but it is still one of my favourite games.			"

												After having played Red Alert (1996) and Red Alert 2 alongtime ago, I would have to say that this one is a great successor because It shows us the fictitious modern day advanced war technology of each playable faction that we can use against the enemy of each opposing faction, this game packs a thrill and high end 3D strategy action, I'm happy I got this awesome successor to the Red Alert series at such a price because it is such a steal. Grab it while you can before Jan 30th!			"

												Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 is the 15th game in C&C series. Published in 2008, by EA.The story stared when Lieutant Cherdenko, General Krukov and Dr. Zelinsky from the Soviet travel through the time to the past to become alliance with Albert Einstein to make the Allies weakened and automatically make the Soviets is the winner in this war. But instead accidentally removed Einstein from the time and from this world. And they come back in the present. From what they have done is leading to have the third faction, the Empire of the Rising Sun, is going to dominate this world. The battle begins between the three great powers. This war called ""The war of the three powers"".Pros:-Three factions have their own specific style.-Very balance between three factions.(The things like C&C3 will never happen like hordes of Mammoth Tanks, Zone Troopers and Juggernauts are overwheilming you and you are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥e-d) -Different base building style.(Dem Japanese scatter their base around the map)-Co-op campaign that you can play with your friend. Only in this C&C.-Your beloved units from past games are here.(Kirov Reporting) -In skirmish you can choose commander for each facttions. Each commanders have their own playstyle(Bots only).Cons:-Short Campaign playtime compared to other games.-In campaign your bot sometimes useless.-No 4v4 skirmish-Unfair tech tree levelling. Soviets only have a single super reactor/tech lab, advanced units availble for whole base in the map. Alied required hightended/max clearance for each MCVs/outposts to unlock advanced units(If your MCV is fully upgraded but if your outpost doesn't upgraded yet, production structures that outpost covered still not unlock advanced units). Empire is the worst, you need to upgrade EACH of the production structures to unlock advanced units.Conclusion: It's a great game. Worth the money. If you want everything balance, this game is for you. "

												This game is muy fun, muchachos. I used to get laid very often - you wouldn't even imagine the poontang that swarmed my offices. I mean, if you saw that, you would probably say, ""Wow, really?!?!?"" Anyways, that, my job, and my dog (it starved to death) are all gone because I was playing this game. I've put on 250 pounds of 'muscle' and haven't showered in like 2 months. If you want to become addicted to a game and fight for the glory of Communism in the virtual world - praise Marx - then this game is a must. Also, wear loose-fitting pants so as to allow your pee pee to extend to great lengths upon experiencing the goodness of this videojuego. If you don't have a pee pee and are therefore a woman, get back in the kitchen and get to work! Ha! Man, I'm good.

												Don't let the campy plot and roster of B-list celebrities fool you, this is the best entry into the post-ra2 CNC scene to date, it continues TibWars' attempts at reintroducing classic CnC mom n' pops formula of MCV's and harvesters, but also learns from generals' attempts at being fun or thinking out of the box. All of this sprinkled with Esports aspiratons, that are anything but unwelcome. If you're planning on buyign this, get CNC-online, for everything else there's  mastercard  gameranger, tunngle, hamachi, garena and the like.

												Since EA took over westwood the quaility of the C&C series has been on a decline and this is another example of a game made bad. it feels like EA is milking the money cow, starting the game with a time travelling story copied from RA1 with a slight twist where there is a new enemy in the form of the japanese. This combined with over the top cheesy dialogue and bad acting makes almost every moment of RA3 cringeworthy. while cheesy and bad acting is staple of the C&C series its used sparingly, the developers decided to take it a notch up and put it everywhere. pair this with bad taste (the japanese defending pearl harbour from the allies) one just cant help but question the idea behind the game.Gameplay mechanics have been changed a bit, now instead of having harvesters going for ore, we have deposits where we can build refineries right beside it. our harvesters need only move a very short distance, which totally eliminates the old strategy of economic harassing. the game economics has moved towards something like dawn of war where its critinal to capture ""strategic points"" to ensure a large economy. the factions are now full of ""over the top units"", allies have helis that shrink vehicles, soviets have cannons that shoot ""cannonball men"" (paratroopers) and the japs are full of stuff copied from animes (mechas and teenage girls). to some it might feel cartoonish but it can be a matter of tastes.the biggest drawback to the game play i guess it the ""forced"" co-op and the wildly spiking difficulty levels of the single player campaign. you must play with a computer beside you, which sometimes the ally computer player totally decimates everything on the map leaving you to attack the enemy base with 5 tanks and win. other times it cant hold its own leaving you to baby it, which spoils the game.the spiking difficulty is also another that spoils the whole experience, while i do understand that games use cheats to provide some degree of difficulty to the player. i found this to be used too often, even in medium the AI has almost unlimited resources and almost instant production capabilities. pair this with the uneven difficulty across the campaign, you'd quickly have certain missions where its near impossible to pass and those that are almost not impossibel to lose, right after each other.all in all, i felt that RA3 was cheap idea of generating some revenue. it has nothing about ""gaming"" to it and more on selling the brand which is RA. some might like the over the top stuff or the new revamped economics system, but i dont i heard that multiplayer is good but i have not tried it yet. for now considering what i have been through i give it a 4/10			"

												Game is great. I recommend it to everyone.Gameplay: Gameplay is great, three different nation with different playstiles and superiorities in air, land and sea. Three unique commando's in each side. Graphics are very good and in a perfect sync with the general ambiance of the game. Also the voice acting of the units is well suited and feels like every unit in the game has its own personality.As for the scenario, I don't want to give spoilers but let me say this: scenario is that when the Soviets started to lose the war against the Allies(US), they use time-machine and go kill Einstein so the nuclear weapons are not made. This eventually leads that Japan doesn't get hit by it too. So the Empire of Rising Sun(JAPAN) is our 3rd nation. 3 different campaign mode for 3 nations. Campaigns are well made, forces you to use different units and tactics everytime and there are bunch of unique things happen in scenario mode which are not present in the skirmish. Also the live-action videos in scenario mode with this cast is awesome (just Gemma Atkinson alone is more than enough). The different play-style of different AI generals makes game more stable to play solo too.			"

												This game is very attractive and smooth.....the textures of the human units are pretty pathetic but apart from them the game looks and feels fantastic....especially the water....and the environments.... A really good Command and Conquer game, which is just an all round fun RTS with cool looking vehicles and weaponry.... and it's got NAVY...HELL YEAH...great addition.... It's also interesting to see how World War II would have changed with Russia being the oppressing force using Nikola Tesla's inventions with Tim Curry from Scary Movie II as the Russian Military Leader and it was great to see George Takei from Star Trek as the Empire of the Rising Sun leader....  Without Albert Einstein assisting the Western Forces, Russia became the supreme power of the world.... I give this game a 7.5/10 It loses points because the human units look really crappy and they run like they got something in their tail pipe and also the animal units really irritate me.... Dolphins and Bears???? Really??? Apart from that...it's awesome!!			"

												Despite the extremely bad acting, their attempt at using models for T&A for gamer ratings, and annoying voice acters with poor lines, this is actually a very fun game. I especially like the co-op campaign aspect, but Multiplater skirmishes are great as well. I highly recommend the Red Alert series to anyone who enjoys a good, old fashioned RTS.			"

												Great RTS which is pretty easy to learn, but you can even micromanage every unit. I think C&C generals/zero hour was more fun doing skirmish, but I prefer this one due to the graphics. I played this on LAN, guarenteed entertainment!""Armageddon is here""			"

												This game is very attractive and smooth.....the textures of the human units are pretty pathetic but apart from them the game looks and feels fantastic....especially the water....and the environments.... A really good Command and Conquer game, which is just an all round fun RTS with cool looking vehicles and weaponry.... and it's got NAVY...HELL YEAH...great addition.... It's also interesting to see how World War II would have changed with Russia being the oppressing force using Nikola Tesla's inventions with Tim Curry from Scary Movie II as the Russian Military Leader and it was great to see George Takei from Star Trek as the Empire of the Rising Sun leader....  Without Albert Einstein assisting the Western Forces, Russia became the supreme power of the world.... I give this game a 7.5/10 It loses points because the human units look really crappy and they run like they got something in their tail pipe and also the animal units really irritate me.... Dolphins and Bears???? Really??? Apart from that...it's awesome!!			"

												J. Jonah Jameson was trying to blow up Moscow with a giant laser built into Theodore Roosevelt's head on Mount Rushmore, which wasn't good at all, because that would destroy my peace treaty with Doctor Frank N. Furter, whom I desperately needed on my side to help me defeat Lieutenant Sulu.Red Alert 3 is an RTS game, set in an alternate timeline after the Soviets went back in time and rewrote history (again) by murdering Albert Einstein. It’s even more ridiculous than it sounds, and serves as a worthy sequel to my all-time favourite RTS, Red Alert 2. It’s fun, campy, and often hilarious, while still serving up slice after slice of the Command & Conquer we all know and love.There are three campaigns to be played through: Soviet Union, Allies, and The Empire of the Rising Sun. Each campaign consists of 9 missions, and it took me about 23 hours to beat them all. When you’re done with that, there’s custom Skirmishes and the Uprising expansion to play through.Between missions you'll be treated to good old FMV sequences starring well-known actors, including a couple of surprise cameos. These serve to convey the story, relay your mission objectives, and make you snort Pepsi out of your nose, especially when Tim Curry or J. K. Simmons is speaking.The soundtrack is a blast, and Frank Klepacki, the musical genius behind the rocktronic compositions for the original C&C through to Renegade, returns once more for three tracks: Hell March 3, Grinder 2, and The Red Menace, which steal the show above the rest of the game's music. Pity he didn't compose the entire soundtrack.But RA3 suffers from two flaws: Co-op, and hand-holding. These two elements work together to steal away your freedom. Each mission is designed to be played with a partner, but since EA have shut their servers down, you’re stuck with AI co-commanders. And before each mission, you’re given a step-by-step battle plan, telling you to go here and do this and move there and capture that.Gone are the days of freedom to approach a mission in any way you see fit, which would allow for multiple replays and different experiences. Now you’re stuck with every step laid out for you, and an AI blundering alongside.I used to find immense enjoyment in taking my time to complete a mission, as I slowly crept up the map, expanding my base, capturing all the enemy’s buildings, and then crushing him at the end. That’s no longer possible. Missions are too structured and linear, and my co-commander is always running ahead, blindly sending in troops and mucking up my strategy. There were moments when my co-commander completed objectives without me while I was busy elsewhere. Why even bother playing when an AI is gonna do the work whether you want it to or not?Then there were other missions when my co-commander failed abysmally at his task, and I didn’t have time to swoop in and pick him up before failing the mission. These were the hardest of missions, and it felt nice to have to actually work to complete them, even if there were only a few.But at the end of the day, I had so much fun playing this game that I couldn’t help but forgive it for its shortcomings. Red Alert 3 is glorious and zany in all the right ways. What it lacks in strategy and challenge, it makes up for by simply being awesome, and it’s a fantastic throwback to past Command and Conquer games.Now if you'll excuse me, 'I am escaping to one place that hasn't been corrupted by capitalism—SPHACE!'TL;DR: Forced co-op can be a nuisance, and there’s too much hand-holding, but Red Alert 3 is great fun nonetheless.

												Not even George Takai & Tim Curry could save this dud, and that's saying something.The cartoonish units, the gaudy art, the absurd physics, the boring story line that casually retcons the entire series thus far out of existence (and for what?), an entirely dumbed-down experience and a new record for gratuitous bimbos makes one thing perfectly clear:The developers of this game have zero respect for you, dear gamer.  They think you're a boob obsessed simpleton who embodies every negative nerd stereotype to be disproven over the last thirty years.  By the way, give us your money.A sad, depressing end to a once entertaining series.  Will only make you nostaligic for RA2 and Yuri's Revenge.  Go play them instead and try to pretend that this turd was never made.			"

												One of the few RTS games that managed to pull of naval warfare correctly. Naval warfare is a rather big part of the game, but it doesn't feel tedious and it doesn't feel like you are missing anything on the more sea based maps. Additionally this game nails co-operative play better than any other RTS game I have played. The missions are very well structured for co-operative play. For example on one map your ally is expected to defend an island while you go out and attack the enemy, and on another your base is in the water while your allies base is on land, and you are expected to perform a naval assault while your ally does a land assault. The music in this game is also pretty great, but that is to be expected from a Red Alert title. The unit designs are neat, from armored bears to tranforming mecha. This is a game that doesn't take itself very seriously and probably turned out better for it.			"

												Red Alert 3 is a fantastic game but it doesn't hold a candle to its predecessor, Red Alert 2.The Co-op is extremely fun and the multiplayer is intense. The FMV cutscenes return featuring George Takei, Jonathan Pryce, Tim Curry and J.K. Simmons (You may know him as Cave Johnson)The campaign is fun, fluid and will keep you hooked till the very end, especially if you bring a friend along for the ride. Visuals are highly saturated and full of color, fitting the games unique style. Frank Klepacki returned to compose the music and it does not dissappoint.If you're looking for a great RTS experience look no further, Red Alert 3 is for you.  9/10-----------------------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEW7.5/10 - Its Command & Conquer yet higly un-optimized. Great Multiplayer. Story is shakey.But hey. Hot women :D			"

												Great, fantastic, marvelous game, killed by EA when Gamespy went down. Steam is not very accurate about ""Singleplayer"" mark, lan works, but online and coop are down (forever, sigh). I am not recommending it because there's absolutely no point in buying it and paying EA for absolutely nothing. Without online and coop it's worthless, it's the same thing as downloading pirated game. Lan and Campaign work on pirated ones too.You know what is hilarious though? When I played RA2 on Origin (got it for free there), I was asked by Origin ""what can we do to make the game better?"" and I just rofl'd. EA didn't give a damn about RA3 and they are asking what can be done to RA2.			"

												It's one of the best RTS I've ever played, better than Command&Conquer 3. CNC3 is a little bit more serious than RA3 and the environment setting is a bit more depressing, very much similar to fallout 3. On the other hand, RA3 is more relaxing while playing for the environment is way cozier than CNC3 and the background music is relaxing as well. However, it doesn't mean that RA3 is dull for players who intend for intensive actions, background music can change from time to time depends on the battlefield conditions. The tactics in RA3 is more than CNC3 in my opinion, for each unit can have a special ability. For example, spy has a special ability to bribe the enemies and make them fight on your side so you can either kill em or bribe em.			"

												As a fan of Red Alert 2, I was pretty hyped for this game. When the reviews came out, it was clear it wasn't the same experience as before, so I held off purchase. But when it came to sale for the low, low price of €3, I couldn't resist picking it up. It can't be a bad deal for that price, right?Wrong. The inclusion of an Allied AI commander clearly supposed to carry the single player campaign in absence of a multiplayer buddy just doesn't work. It's frustrating to have a lot of your fun depend on a dead weight ally. Single player campaign play is frustrating, and only really worth it for the FMV cutscenes. The casting choices are great, including the awesome George Takei as the Japanese Emperor. But, on that subject, the faction of Japan just doesn't feel right in Red Alert, and tries to steal the spotlight from the established factions in a way that just doesn't work. Red Alert's campy plots and cutscenes thrived on its mock Cold War feeling.From a technical standpoint, it's a fine game. Units are diverse, mechanics are solid enough. Undoubtedly the strength of the game is in multiplayer, which I haven't tried. But it just doesn't feel like it's a proper Red Alert game. Plainly put, I wasn't having fun with this, and rarely have I been so disappointed in a purchase.			"

												Not a bad game. Finally we have more than 2 factions. Each faction has its own strong and weak sides. Even different building system. Visual side of vehicles is not perfect. Too ""cartoonish"". Previous parts of the series had better vehicles.  I mean you saw those units? Bear? Dolphin? That is too much. Humor you say? Yes, it is good to have humor. Problem is - we have too much of it. Good cutscenes, but ending is very short. Unique special unit for each faction, unlike RA1 with Tanya for both factions. To be honest, i like some things in C&C3 more. Serious campaign for example. Smarter AI. Infantry that spawns as group, instead of one soldier. Why do you need one soldier? He`s not Superman. Unit upgrade system. I hope if next part will be released, it will be more serious and will take best things from C&C3 and Red Alert 2.			"

												There is far more enjoyment with C&C 3 Kanes Wrath. This is just horrible with Windows 8.1 and new hardware. I had troubles with options on grahpics, let alone the poor gameplay and comparing with C&C 3 Not even worth 5 dollars. XD Played this years ago and it was more fun somehow.			"

												I've played so much Red alert 2, but this?And just before I start I'd like to state that I've had a fair share of both wins and losses, and that I'm trying to be as nice as possible...ugh, I can't stand it, it's just not fun to play, and this isn't nostalgia or anything, this is my genuine feelings about the game. They tried to simplify the game by giving the player less units to use but this only complicates things by giving them special abilities which if you don't use effectively you will get wasted (and if you're like me you'll keep forgettting you have them) and to top it off you've also got other abilities you can use which yet again not using them will surely make you lose easy peasyThen you've also got to manage your own base, pile up a nice attack and defense force all while you make sure money is coming in and you aren't being bombarded by aircraft (which got a stupidly good power creep due to anti air becoming weaker than a flick on the nose) all this piled together is just not fun, or satisying when you do eventually win. I just felt like I had the worst micromanagement session ever. Sure the other C&C games have lots of micromanagement, but there it was fun because things felt balanced, you weren't under this constant stress of needing everything immediately but only being able to get one thing. It's just, I don't hate this game, but it's just not fun for me...Only really good part was some of the new units are pretty fun to play around with, and although the game is a massive stress-out for me, I never felt like the game was unfair (except when the AI blatantly cheats bringing over aircraft faster than I can even lay out anti air defense...)If you have RA1 or RA2, play them instead (HELL RA2 with 7 Brutal AI on a non-Free for all game is more fun...)

												Known issue: there is a good chance u will not be able to play on the online service, with a person who is on the same LAN as you. This means no campaign co-op.  U can still skirmish vs. AI on LAN, and I would think u could both play independent games online, just not together. :|Beyond that, this is a ""good but definitely not great"" C&C, and while it has its fun moments and arguably some of the best graphics in the series, the gameplay definitely hints at the totally-broken, excessively-micro-oriented,""hey-guys-let's-ruin-the-franchise"" direction that EA eventually perfected with C&C 4.

												What a disappointment this was!After the first two in this well renowned franchise, I would have thought that they built on this with pride and style. To the contrary, in spite of the excellent graphics, it feels like the plot and gameplay interface was rushed. For my taste, considering the first two games and their respective plots, this one is completely too far to the other side of the border.If I didn't wait so long to download and install this, I would have definitely tried to ask for a refund.6/10			"

												This is where EA lost it and screwed it up. I know the Red Alert series has always been kinda goofy but this just went way over board. I just couldn't take it seriously, everything about the game was a horrible joke. I honestly really hope westwood which is now petroglyph games buying the series back. With that horrible display EA did with the new generals games and the "" we are not making the game you guys want, so F**k you guys we give up"" Ea is just gonna let the series die.			"

												gamespy is gone so that means you're gonna have to use game-ranger for online purposes as for the game itself, after 8.5 years it's still holds on the gameplay, the strategy and even the graphics they all look fantastic the voice acting is poor and cringy (typical American studio) but it's funny enough to do it's job i would recommend buying this full heartily			"

												Isn't as addictively fun as Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge, but, you know what? It's still fun, and it's different enough from other CnC games (in a good way, unlike CnC 4) to stand out on it's own. Like, there's a pretty interesting balance between naval and ground combat that doesn't make either feel like an afterthought, and the campaigns, while campy with pointless fanservice and mindnumbing writing, offer diverse scenarios.Now, one thing I really hate, it has lots of unnecesseary micro. Not only is the game full of hard counters so you have to order around units so they wouldn't get owned by their counters while concentrating their fire onto weakest targets, pretty much every unit has it's own gimmick special, be it a special attack or alternative fire mode, so the amount of unnecesseary micro is unberable. Red Alert 2 kept it way more simple, and if unit had several firing modes you wouldn't need to switch between them, meanwhile here it's not even Starcraft or CoH levels of micro. Worst offender is the new third faction, Empire of the Rising Sun. They have probably the most of alternative modes due to sizeable chunk of their force being transformers like a machinegun mecha that switches into a fighter and such, and you can't switch back for some time like you get with, say, Starcraft 2 vikings, so it's rather annoying.

												I'll be honest: I bought the game because I loved C&C: Red Alert2. I saw that the reviews were not so good, still I thought that the game couldn't be so bad, being a new version of such a great entertainer.I was completely disappointed. The only good things are the videos, all the atmosphere of C&C: Red Alert2 was lost. It's just an average RTS... Well, I think that it actually is below the average now. The units are futuristic, but in this way they lose the grip with reality... I mean: it was fun having anti infantry yaks and anti vehicle migs, it was fun having to build the airfields and everything. It was fun having to give support to the battlecruisers in order to avoid having them sinked by the submarines or the migs. All those units looked realistic in some way, even the crazy tesla coil. these new buildings and units look like they have no link with the real world. It's like they tried to make the game cooler and cooler, but they overdid it and it has no cool anymore.I'll go back to play the Red Alert 2, it's way more entertaining			"

												Gameplay:Red alert 3 oversees an interesing  transition from RA2, incorporating numerous alternations to the gameplay that allows the game to be more tense as the designs shift more to what you will see in a serios RTS-- most prominently, ore becomes a confined resource which cannot be harvested exponentially by cramming your build order with harvesters. Units can be categorized into anti-infantry and anti-armor. Main battle tanks may be terrifyingly effective against armor yet at the same time they require five to six shots to kill some of the most cheapest infanty, which indeed is hard to grasp at first. As such, attacks emphasize on the cooperation of different units spamming only one type of unit would not bring you anywere. Micromanaging becomes vital through the concept of 'crushing levels' where infantry are subject to be crushed by incoming tanks while tanks are subject to be flattened by even bigger vehicles. Several secondary abilities and attack formations of the different factions also heavily rely on micromanaging.The single player campaign is also incredibly entertaining. I loved the cutscenes shot in real person. The humorous plot is mildly funny and worth a laugh.Graphics:Absolutely brilliant special effects with breathtakingly beautiful water. Personally I prefer the rather vibrant hue in RA3 instead of  other CNC games or Starcraft. Antialiasing options lags the computer more than smoothing out the edges, however the game does not suffer from antialiasing issues much even without AA turned on.Annoying bugs:The pathfinding system is a total mess.Sometimes units would take a full round trip around the building it just came out of before heading anywhere else.Units getting stuck on the road for no reason.Highly expensive naval fleet would randomly be stuck on the shoreline, becoming virtually worthless.Units would line up and move single-filed, slowing each other down.Nanocores of the Empire unable to deploy and stop en-route for no reason on certain mapsEA:The experience for the game would be much smoother if it wasn't published by EA. RA3 had great multiplayer potential as with the introduction of the competitive aspects to the game. However, the servers in charge of hosting RA3 online closed down and there has only been a community supported server ever since, and the popularty of the RA3 community has been ever plummeting since. You won't find as much players nowadays as compared to when the gamespy servers were still online, and as a result matchmaking is almost impossible due to the tiny amount of players still playing the game.Overall, the Red Alert 3 is a great game that could be great fun to play no matter by yourself or with others. However I certainly don't think that it is worth this price due to EA's unresponsible attitude towards this game. Buy it if you have some spare money to have fun with, but it is not on the must-have list.			"

												Its♥♥♥♥♥♥ An RTS made with consoles of the time in mind. Not as good as RA2.Cool setting ofc just like 2 but the gameplay and AI is awful. Way to much stuff can go over water aswell as the balance is terrible. If the AI cryocopter and AA jet spams you are basically ♥♥♥♥ed and thats where I stopped. I only played this for the story but its not worth grinding.The 3 factions don't really play much diffrently if at all, unlike 2. And the diffrences that are there are very minor. 2 was just a better game in every way.The AI cocommanders are hugely inferior to the enemy to the point that all they are is a punching bag for the enemy AI until you get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together. Its a terrible and boring design that ends up making every single mission feel just about the same later in the game excluding big set peice missions.Why did they force micro managing into this game? RTS that make me worry about every single units secondary weapon is just stupidly annoying and clumsy.Only good thing is the story and cinematics. Its gameplay is awful, clumsy, and not fun. Not fun having to play Pearl harbor and the enemy spams cryocopters. You can't even do anything. Its♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I purchased Red Alert 3 after having fond memories of the first Red Alert, with Counterstrike and Aftermath add-ons. I've also played and thoroughly enjoyed RA2 and Generals however this title just didn't feel right, the controls felt off and constuction mechanics felt iffy as well. If your a veteran C&C player like myself you'll probably already have this one but if your new to the series I'd definitely recommend you stay clear of this one and opt for one of it's predecessors. I got this at 75% off so I'm not too bothered, however if I had paid full price I'd be kicking myself.			"

												I'm a pretty big fan of the Command and Conquer franchise, so I was very much looking forward to finally playing this, albeit years after its release.Unfortunately, while playing this game, all I could think about was how much more fun the campaigns of previous installments were, particularly Red Alert 2.The first Red Alert featured faceless pixelated troops that you'd throw en masse against your enemies. The second one took a completely different approach, with individual units being rather personalized and potentially extremely powerful (even GIs were a menace at Elite veterancy) and allowing you to wreck enemy bases with just a handful of units in the right spots (I remember being able to dismantle most bases in campaign mode with only 3 Legionnaires). The third installment seems to fit somewhere in between, but loses something to both. "

												THE BEST real time strategy war game ever. Period. Even after all these years this is stll a benchmak. Controls are flowless, the IA is great (and may be too smart sometimes especaly on skirmish mode). Sound is great and graphics even for todays (2016) have nothing to be ashamed on. Red alert 3 is by far the game I played probably the most along the years. There nothing like the original , and this is the original. If you like strategy war game you must own it.  "

												Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT Buy this game!!!It is Bad where to start.........Well first the ""single player campaign"" is really just a Co-op game meant to set EA's precedent of ""we're sure when you wanted to Play single player campaign you really want a multi-player game and you don't really care about the story"".Oh and now you cant even multi play this game anymore, the one thing that people said made this game playable.Well here you go buy a BROKEN game people. Support a way to rip you off go ahead,Second you CANT start as the allies until you play through the USSR first.Another thing where they just go back and remove Albert Einstein and the Only True thing that changes is that the USSR is winning the war from RA1 and japan somehow now has robots? WTF... Then where is Stalin here and where is Kain? (Yes Kain is in RA1) where are the Leaders of the USSR, Because I know Albert Einstein, had NOTHING to do with Stalin getting power.Also now that Albert Einstein is no longer exsists to remove Hitler from the Timeline what happens here? They ignore all of these things and also where is Yuri? This story line makes NO sense here it just throws out the all these people and events even though they are Part of WHAT MAKES Red Alert What it was and IS.next the Units are too damn cartoon like and clunky, I mean the Allied tank is a damn destroyer that drives on land your joking...... STUPID, STUPID STUPID, What were the EA developers thinking when they made this game, or better yet what the heck were they smoking.Oh and in skirmish mode you cant play 1 vs 1 against AI or a human player you need to go 2 vs 2 minimum this means that if there are 2 humans playing you need a bot on each side.Now the ONLY good part of this game is the movies and even then they are not that even good (but they weren't super HQ cut scenes to begin with).This game for Classic C&C Players is an Insult, but for new people to this series may like it, and I guess that is what EA wanted, But by making it like this and disregarding the past (IE the story) of the previous games and changing the game play the way they did was disrespectful to the story and to the fan base of this franchise.Again just dont buy this game. this game is broken, if anyone says buy it they are trolling you, or want you to waste your hard earned money as they did by buying this garbage. For the price of this go get a GOOD GAME. like company of heros 1 or Command and conquer 3 there is one Without the Red Alert3 tag.			"

												This game sucks. I've played for 60 mintues. FOV is terrible. Seriously, wtf??? You can't zoom out at all to see anything useful. It's hard to see any of your units. Nothing is intuitive. Buy Red Alert 2, it's way better. WTF EA, how hard is it to improve over the previous games?????  Any money you spend on this game is a waste! You're zoomed in on the tiniest aspect of the game. It's practically impossible to find any of the units you actually want. Seriously, despite all the graphical limiitations for RA2, it's 100x better than this. WTF EA how do you ♥♥♥♥ up an RTS this bad???Anyone doubting me: Play this game for an hour. The entire time you will be frustrated by the controls and your view over the map! C'mon EA, this isn't hard. 2/10. Terrible. Terrible Terrible. Don't buy this!!!!!! Find Red Alert 2. Old graphcs but a way better RTS and much more fun to play. To reiterate: DON'T BUY RA3!

												The desperate leadership of a doomed Soviet Union travels back in time to change history and restore the glory of Mother Russia. The time travel mission goes awry, creating an alternate timeline where technology has followed an entirely different evolution, a new superpower has been thrust on to the world stage, and World War III is raging.

												Generals way better than this crappy game. I had enough of cheating AI, useless allies AI doing absolutely nothing, and being a Starcraft-wannabe gameplay style. Plus almost all the units in the game are useless against anything and all you have to do is spam a specific OP unit to win the game. I really like the Command & Conuqer Series, but Red Alert 3 is not my cup of tea and won't be playing this crap ever again.			"

												I begrudgingly give this game a hesitant one thumb up, and mostly due to nostalgia. While I’m glad that the feel, atmosphere, and gameplay of RA3 remains true to the series, the gameplay feels exceptionally old. I can only suggest this game for people that enjoy VERY frantic, micromanagement heavy RTS’s – where your attention is constantly and absolutely split between no less than four different points of interest. A combination of wrist-tiring unit micromanagement along with trial and error is the only way to make progress in the campaign. That is very frustrating and exhausting, causing me to uninstall the game after playing only half of the game. The developers should have focused on FUN rather than sheer volume of “crap going on at the same time”.			"

Good cinematicsAn amazing soundtrack. Look up 'rock and awe'  cons:Bad balancing. (allies have no real AA, among other things.)Generally not fun gameplay. Hard to explain this one, it just doesn't deliever compared to the older C&C games.

												This game is an utter dissapointment for all C&C games. The co-op/co commander aspect is a joke. As a gamer who typically plays alone, I hate it. I tried using my starting units to blow up the co commander's base so I wouldn't have to see them and it didn't help. They constantly drain bank and offer little to no help except cannon fodder that uses up resources. IF the resources were not shared, it would be considerably better. I had to stop playing the game. It is utter garbage.			"

												Please read this review till the end cause steam only have 2 button recommended and not recommended. First and foremost if you looking to get nostalgic on this game, DON'T. Apart from the soundtrack and few live action this is almost entirely new game since the construction of each fatcion is different(and also most unit have ability) different types of upgrade etc. Several hours in and I felt disspointed in the level of camera zoom provided as some unit are too small and when I try to zoom in to select a unit it just wasn't close enough, To add to my dissapoint ment is the left clicking order issue( seems to deselect the unit everytime I auto left clicking too fast) and guess what? This totally ruins my expactation in my 1st campaign and the main menu is just...... too bland, just look at Ra2 main menu back when westwood is in charge of it, this look like some fresh graduate design it on flash. Other than this I have nothing to complain as I have only few minutes in. Oh, no online server too( you should know that game usually retain their online content on official server for at most 3-4 years(unless they have big loyalist which this game lost) or someone jusy make a private server. Not reccommended for old nostalgic player. But nonetheless it's a good rts(not great). Totally recommended to get when it's on sale for 85%			"

The story is a joke and the acting is horrible, much like T3 but at least that game had usable unit mechanics while RA3 felt completely wrong.

												Possibly the most disappointing sequel I've ever played.  I was a massive fan of the original C&C, Red Alert and Red Alert 2.  When I saw that Red Alert 3 was availabkle, I was very cautious as I was not a fan of the Tibrium Wars engines and the AI.Sadly, this game is rather easy to complete with a very ""dumb"" AI; but the real let down is that it has somehow lost the magic of the first 2 Red Alert games.  I purchased this in a full C&C collection pack and sadly I won't even bother to play the expansion pack.			"

												Red Alert 2 and Generals were significantly better but this product shows us why we don't see any more C&C games.  If you wish to play this ""RTS,"" I suggest you wait for a Steam sale.  Though addictive, this almost-arcade style game is an exercise in frustration and futility.  The gameplay is like Whack-a-mole with lots of micro-management of dozens of units.  The game starts off advising you to begin the Soviet campaign.  What you're not told is that the game is unbalanced in favor of the Allies.  You not only have to defend against the Allies but against a rogue general who weasels your resources from the get-go.  During the Von Esling Airbase level, you begin with over a $100,000 but the rogue general comes in and takes it all.  You’re left with a large base but no way to defendant it but you work frantically building defensive pieces at a ridiculously slow snail’s pace.  The game opens the water spigot with information overload and gladly tells you that you have ""insufficient funding"" from which to build.  This is the point I started to question whether the game was worth it.  If the player is willing to resort to short-cuts by defeating the general before ordered to do so, Update: I should have mentioned that the game should take the dedicated new player 5 or 6 hours to complete a campaign.  My major rant, the Von Esling Soviet round forces you into taking a short-cut in order to beat it, i.e., take out the general first thing.  That’s when it stopped being an RTS.  I tend to replay rounds attempting to lower completion times but like I said, this arcade game is addictive but after “Generals”, a huge let-down.  Again, I ask myself, is the price worth it?  Meh.  Prior to purchasing this game I'd strongly recommend (assuming it’s not on sale) perusing the Metacritic user-reviews.  IMHO those are the ones that count and have this game rated between 6.5 and 7.  “Crap-fest” is a poor choice of words (my bad) but be advised most of the Metacritic complaints pertain to inadequate balancing and AI.  There are lots of complaints about RA3 being more of an arcade game than an actual RTS.  To quote Coach from Left4Dead 2, “I gotta agree.”  If this game drops below $20, I'll gladly go thunbs up!  Happy Steaming…			"

												I would rate this game 1/5 starsI've always been a fan of the C&C series, but when it comes to the Red Alert subseries, the childishness and immaturity of it is just too much to bear. Even if you don't care about the campaign, you're still going to put up with goofy units and their stupid voices and cartoonic gameplay experience. Red Alert 3 might as well be a game for children, it is so silly. For the hard of hearing or those who disable the obnoxous sounds that come with, you'll find no comfort in the more-of-the-same style of gameplay. There is nothing innovative about this game that makes you go ""wow, I'm really glad I bought this game instead of a competing game from a competing series""			"

												Over complicated units, fluctuating difficulties, inconsistent AI makes this a difficult game to love. Which is unfortunate, given that I have a soft spot for the C&C line and wanted to like it.Just feels like money being milked from a cash cow. And it is one of the few games I stopped halfway and never finished. And even at times when I wanted to play, I opted instead for a custom map over the campaign.			"

												With poor AI (ally AI often struggles to really do anything), lackluster story, uneven pacing, difficulties in getting to run under windows 10 and a clumsy implementation of unit balance (too many specialized units, uneven coverage of units such as decent anti Air)  skip this old rts unless you like restarting missions due to bugged victory conditions or you're a die hard fan of the red alert series and old real time strategy.

												Although not a big fan of C&C-type mechanics, I pretty much enjoyed this game's attempt at rejuvinating the Red Alert sub-series when it came out. Although it did so honourably well on the storyline and the characterization of each faction, this game unfortunately has, in my opinion, a serious balance issue. The most notable of the latter being the ridiculously massive range and damage advantage of Japanese battleships, capable of destroying a base with near impunity.			"

												I know everyone will call me out as biased, especially since i have barely played red alerts 1 and 2, but i LOVE THIS GAME, the action is the fast brand that i have always liked from my strategy games, the new lighter feel was not all that bad in my opinion, it is extremely balanced and moddable with a bit of effort (Shock Therepy Mod) to me, if you hate the feel of this game, go back to red alert 2YR, which i also like. the only real problems being the AI in Skirmish, and the multiplayer community is small. I had alot of fun in this, loving the campaign and all the mission twists it brings. In short, you dont need to reminisce of that old RA2/YR/1 you used to have, because if you havent noticed it was just as campy and wacky at points. This is just the logical extreme of it.			"

It is so much fun since there's no solid optimal strategy for every match, and each player can really set themselves apart.  The story is a bit cheesy but good, and the visuals are quite nice. The multiplayer's also pretty solid, and you can create/play on maps, which is nice.I would recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of the genre, or want a game that's kind of like a cross between sci-fi, military and alternate history.

												Probably the last playable RTS from C&C with still nice looking and modern graphics. The game was modified slightly with harvesters easy to protect and faster to get money but the game overall is still reminding old times that I miss so much. Three unique factions with unique campaign with professional actors as cast during cinematics between missions add another great fun to watch and play this game. Tim Curry ftw!			"

												One of the best RTS titles in the genere combining live action cut scenes , colorful animation, and intresting base managment this is a title worth every RTS fans time. Units for each of the three factions feel unique and mostly useful and the ability to build most of your base on water and the land makes for some intresting base building mechanichs. The story being mostly zanny and almost cartoonish in its sterotypes, does come across as fun. The real fun however is the action and combat itself with each side having access to multiple units each with unique parameters and abilites that allow for many combos and playstyles to take center stage. All in all C&CRA3 is a standout from the genre and shouldnt be missed.			"

												Although not a big fan of C&C-type mechanics, I pretty much enjoyed this game's attempt at rejuvinating the Red Alert sub-series when it came out. Although it did so honourably well on the storyline and the characterization of each faction, this game unfortunately has, in my opinion, a serious balance issue. The most notable of the latter being the ridiculously massive range and damage advantage of Japanese battleships, capable of destroying a base with near impunity.			"

If you've played Red Alert 2 and you loved it, you will be THOROUGHLY disappointed by the plot that makes absolute no sense and the incredibly dumbed down gameplay.

												RA3 sets its sights firmly on bringing a smile to your face. The mood of the game is enjoyably goofy and nowhere is this more evident than the completely gratuitous sexy women who practically cavort for your pleasure.  The game mechanics are no less entertaining with loads of odd military units like attack dolphins, armored blimps, and football talking troopers.  Unfortunately the units aren't quite so devastatingly useful as RA2 offered, -it's a rare thing when a single, properly managed unit can land the blows to win a game, and more's the pity.  Furthermore the superpowers are a little more niggly to obtain and less brutally satisfying.The game plays out much more methodically than RA2 or C&C3 did so that you will have to spend more attention on individual unit tactics rather than massed forces.  This makes the game less friendly to ""turtle"" game tactics but grants a feeling of earned superiority when you finagle the most out of your limited resources.Lots of fun, in short.  :)			"

												Though I've logged only 4 hours on this game, I am quite familiar with Red Alert 2 and other RTS games. Simply, EA has destroyed what was once a great franchise. The units themselves are woefully balanced with some units being destroyed instantly. The difficulty of the game is quite frustrating considering that the game itself is poorly scripted, as there are multiple bugs. I've had problems with units failing to complete their movement due to poor pathing. Some units will just stop if their path is momentarily blocked. Siege units are insanely powerful while infantry and many other units are simply irrelevant. It seems that the Soviets in particular lack any sort of meaningful anti air units as the Bullfrogs and MiGs have light armor values and can be decimated by units of other regions. Flak troopers may be cheap but without any ability to traverse water, there is essentially no sufficient anti air. The Scorpion unit of RA2 was completely removed, which were some of the best anti air units that the Soviets had at their disposal.In addition, the campaign missions seem to be poorly designed. Just recently I played a mission in which the Soviet player had to assassinate the Emperor of the Rising Sun with a single Conscript. It seemed as illogical that there were areial units flying that failed to notice the enemy Conscript. As the mission continued, my base was assaulted by a wave of enemy tanks before any sort of player could mount a resistance force. The missions are boring and uninteresting. The acting and writing is subpar. The unit AI seems almost idiotic and inconsistent with some units agressively pursuing enemy units while other times standing their ground and just letting themselves be defeated.In sum, I was wholeheartedly dissapoointed at this game. EA has (unsurprisingly) ruined another franchise. Just play RE2, which I still do. It may be older but at least it was well made in comparision to RE3, a♥♥♥♥♥♥game.			"

												Pretty much the same as the first two games. Most units now have some secondary ability and there's a bit more emphasis on water based combat but otherwise the same rules still apply: find a unit that fits your style and then build a lot of them, hit the enemy with your special powers and then go mop up. Can't speak for the multiplayer since that seems to be dead. Overall, a nice little game with relatively simple mechanics for the casual RTS fan.			"

RA2 was great and all you needed to do was devise a new comeback for the villians.. the Comp AI was little too hard on the easier settings (i have sceen videos and it makes my head hurt to see the harder difficulties)...i understand if you would buy just because of the cast but ultimately it didnt have the same feel as the older games in franchise... almost half-put together in a rushed manner...

												I reccomend Red alert 3, now i won't review the gameplay or anything else related to that since you can find reviews for thoose elsewhere, Many people who are nostalgic for Red alert 2 and the games before automaticaly hate this game since it changed alot from the original concept, and for the better since it added many new mechanics and overall i really love this game with it's superb campaign and multiplayer, Now many people know that gamespy shut down, well that means you can't play online right? wrong. there are over 300 people who play red alert 3 multiplayer via cnc online, you can google that and download it, it's really easy once you download that's it you just go into red alert 3, click on multiplayer and register. So try to ignore the reviews made by ""Veterans"" who are nostalgic of the old games and try to install this if you want to play multiplayer. if you're a newcomer into the series i highly reccomend C&C Red alert 3 to be the game you start with since it clears things up.

												I've played pretty much the entire C&C series, and this is in my opinion by far the worst game in the franchise. Structures and units feel huge and ""clumsy"", which makes controls feel bad, and overall gameplay is badly influenced by this. Maybe I could have given it more time, but compared to it's predecessors, which I have been enjoing since I was a kid, this just doesn't feel right.			"

												The Command & Conquer series were a huge part of my childhood, mainly Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge, and while this game definitely has lost alot of its classic elements from back in the day, the amount of improvements it has made is finaminal. Pros:-Three different campaigns you can do at your own pace and difficulty-Numerous units on sea, land and air (something that alot of RTS games don't have)-Online Multiplayer-After over 100 hours, I haven't found a single bug or glitch, besides occasional character movement around corners and water.-Skrimish mode, where you can practice your strategies on AI's -Babes, telling you what to do in the videos as you try to impress them throughout the game. Lmao.Cons:-Mediocre Graphics, not nearly as fancy as the videos.-Pretty dull story mode-The acting in the videos isn't too great, but what can you expect, right?-Costs alot when it comes to money (and time haha)... but it's worth it, in my true opinion.All in all, when comparing the factors I look for in a game, the pros heavily outweigh the cons the way I see it. Again, this is only my opinion, so if you can immerse yourself in another World War 2 story-mode game, then good for you man, I'm glad you enjoy it. 9/10 Better than minecraft on all fronts. Edit: Also, I adore the light humor sprinkled across this game, especially the Tutorial. The best part of the entire game is when the tanks get in the drive-thru line to get burgers....			"

												The story is worthful but the multiplayer is just another unbalanced C&C from EA games. This game is nothing like the epic RA2. oh and it is nearly dead anyway....where should i start from? red alert 3 is so casual and unbalanced it is only about who blobs more it does not matter what units u combine. there is a lot of micro options but no one uses them everyone just goes for blobing since it is easy win. there is a new army called Rising sun this army has nothing in common with the other 2 factions and it is super easy to play with it, your ground units can conver to air units and become either anti air or anti ground unit.bring a combined army of jets + tanks + infantry + ships + everything and your oppenent comes with only dogs and he wins you. this game is that stupid. it is only about who blobs more...who am i? i am 9 years veteran company of heroes 1 player who took part in almost all tournaments and made it 3 times to semi finals (what is company of heroes 1? a game that i dare to say it is the most skillful and microful and balanced RTS ever made to the date in 2006 and so far i have not seen a single game which can challenge coh1) and before that i used to play Red alert 2 a lot when i was younger. so this review is from an expert RTS player. and it is so funny to see how RTS super casual players defend red alert 3 and claim this game has ""skill and balance"" just like CoD players try to defend their children casual game versus other shooters.do NOT waste your time and money over this garbage this game is totally dumb probably the worst RTS game i ever player after company of heroes 2. if you want it that hard just buy it for single player because it really worths for the story and completely ignore its pvp mode.

												If you're looking for an experience like Red Alert 2 then you're not going to find it here. The framerate is locked to 30fps, there is no support for 1080p. The story line is good, however. Follows on with RA1 and RA2's cheesy theme. However because you're locked to 30fps, with no real way of unlocking it, and because you can hardly zoom out so you are constantly stuck very close to map, and not to mention the units being incredibly sluggish, I cannot recommend this game.

												So, Red Alert 3. This game has always been one of my favourite stratagy games, and it also introduced me to the stratagy game genre, but enough about me and more about the game. The best parts about this game are probably the micro-managing and the differences between each faction and how to win with each faction, and also the greenscreen cutsceens are so funny! However this game does have a few issues which do have to be mentioned one of them being you can not zoom out! You may think that this is a poor thing to complain about but when you want to micro-manage a whole army you need to be able to see them, another issue is the pathfinding of troops, this can be game breaking sometimes, it doesn't happen regularly but when it does it can be VERY frustrating as your troops can't get past something or the enemy AI can't seem to move when they get attacked, but again only a minor issue. Now the biggest issue is multiplayer, enjoy not having it when you buy the game because you can't play the base multiplayer as the servers are down (Damn you GameSpy!) But there is an easy solution which is Revora and all you need is in a video which i will link now

The downside to this game is now that Gamespy is shutdown, the online servers are too, but you can set up a LAN network with Hamachi and still play with your friends.

												Great game, I've been playing it on and off for over 4yrs. The only issue I found was that they patched the game multiple times and now its a nerf version of what it once was. Allies and Soviets NEED to have a plenthra of low level cheap units or you won't win (turrets are wicked expensive). EA made it so unless you have 4 or more ore refinaries you can't reasonably create a battalion of tanks. It makes the game so much longer and harder because the AI just makes tons of various troops automatically and spreads them across the maps in seconds (way faster than humanly possible). Its cheaper to build a nuclear weapon in the game than it is to have 25 helecopters. Definetly don't buy just download a Unpatched version online. On unpatched Ver 1.0 Hard, I beat the game in a month. This version i cant get through half of the campaigns on normal.			"

												Right off the top I'm going to say that the story and live action cutscenes are absolutely abysmal. I have no respect for any of the actors and as a result I'm lost in a story with no coherent reason to progress, or even exist. However, the game mechanics, the controls and the actual graphics all work very well together in perfect blend of RTS perfection. Fans of the franchise will be pleased to hear that it plays very much like Red Alert 2; skirmish mode is back, as well as online which are both incredibly addictive. Building a massive army and tipping the enemy over like a pawn is one of the most satisfying feelings in gaming. Apart from the live action garbage, and a few minor bugs I've encountered, this is a perfect gaming experience. 7 / 10			"

												It's the good kind of cheesy. Pretty sweet soundtrack, and actually pretty hard. I never finished any of the campaigns, probably because I'm terrible. My strategies were pretty much make helicopters, and steamroll, and when that stopped working, I stopped playing the game for 2 years. Each race is pretty different though, lots of cool things to play around with. If you don't mind playing an RTS that isn't Starcraft, this is worth a try.			"

												One of the best RTS titles in the genere combining live action cut scenes , colorful animation, and intresting base managment this is a title worth every RTS fans time. Units for each of the three factions feel unique and mostly useful and the ability to build most of your base on water and the land makes for some intresting base building mechanichs. The story being mostly zanny and almost cartoonish in its sterotypes, does come across as fun. The real fun however is the action and combat itself with each side having access to multiple units each with unique parameters and abilites that allow for many combos and playstyles to take center stage. All in all C&CRA3 is a standout from the genre and shouldnt be missed.			"

												Red Alert 1,2 theese both are very good strategy games and has very nice moment at my childhood. Red alert 1 was my first computer game. And it was very important for me. I never truly care about any other Command and Conquer game. Red alert was the only thing for me.  Gameplay and controlling was easy. Game storyline was very good and cutscenes was an awesome red alert classic. When we come to Red Alert 3 lots of people dissapointed. Because they think the game lost its old soul. But in my opinion they were wrong. All i see was improvement of old games without losing its soul. Better commanding. Better cutscenes.(With lots of beauties from mother russia, england and japan :)  ) Very nice new units and improvements to the old units from previous games. Balanced and fun increased nations to play with increased numbers. This game still rocks! Too bad that gamespy is down and we cannot play it multiplayer. :(			"

												What a game!!! Might be old but it is solid good. You won't be overwhelmed with impossible tasks to manage. The factions are fun and they are all different. The quality of the graphics are good even for today's standards. The campaign is entertaining and long, so you get to play it from each of the faction's perspective (Russia, Allies and Japan). You can put 2 or 3 hour in this game and you won't end up exhausted. There is one caveat. This game is single player only, even though it has a menu option for multi-player, but it won't work. I guess the game is too old and EA had to free-up servers. If you ever get done with the campaign, there is a pretty good skirmish menu against the computer. In my opinion there is good re-play value in this game for the buck you are paying.			"

Setting rally points for your units is unnessiarly difficult, there are NO shift commands, so you have to micro your units incessivly, and even when you do your infantry get flanted (literly) by enemy vechicals. Everything but the gameplay here is amazing, which is such a shame. If you can get a friend and are looking for a dumb, casual Co-Op expierence, pick it up on sale. Otherwise, I can't recommend.			"

												This game definitely could've been polished more. Although I throughly enjoyed the campaign story, as I have been waiting for the sequel since RA2:Yuri's Revenge, its multiplayer proved to be a bit weak and unbalanced in the begining. As any modern RTS games do, they did make several patches after the release to balance the game, but by that time too many players already left and it was too late. It's sad because it had so much potential, but only half of it bloomed. I do recommend this game just for the single player campaign(especially if you were a fan of RA2), but if you're looking to play online, I suggest going to some other RTS game unless you got a lan-party.My score: 7/10			"

												Not a terrible 3rd title in the Red Alert trilogy...   I was an OK fan of Red Alert 1. Then I became a HUGE fan of Red Alert 2. In fact I consider Red Alert 2 the RTS title that got me into RTS gaming.  I had high expectations with Red Alert 3 when it released. Was I impressed initially? Honestly, no. I was a little bit disappointed with the game and really didn't like the Empire faction. I thought it was pretty damn cheesy. I mean this is coming from a game that is loaded with cheese. But really, I preferred my mind whack job faction of Yuri from Red Alert 2. At least they had some Soviet in their style. The Empire faction gives up too much cornyness with their robot units that carry samurai swords and whatnot. I understand it's the theme, but let's be realistic here. You wouldn't be winning a war with swords in Red Alert.  For me, Red Alert 2 allowing you to choose from real world nations after picking either Allies or Soviets kept a more realistic approach to the madness and you could feel a lil more attachment to the story. Red Alert 3 is all over the place. BUT, not all is bad in the game.  I still do love the gameplay and minor enhancements they made. The graphics looking stunning even right now with the current gen games out. The Soviets and Allies are still great looking and have some really awesome units. Who doesn't love building a mass of Dreadnoughts to rain down dozens and dozens of missles? When the damage flies, it flies.  As I got this game on a cheap Steam sale, I figured why the hell not, and I'm happy for it. I stuck mostly with skirmish game matches where I could just have quick fun of building my base and laying waste to my opponent.   Where I didn't see much in this game initially upon launch, I found late in it's life thru Steam. At this point I recommend the game, but it will never be held to the standard I had with Red Alert 2.			"

Uninspired gameplay, units, mechanics. Long gone is the subtlety and tactics of Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2. Almost identical design to Tiberium Wars and Starcraft 2 with literally none of the enjoyment or quality. Point, click, point, click. Almost no purpose having hotkeys when the game is this basic.

												One of the few games I truly love. The game have a pretty funny story and not very serious at all. As an Age of Empire 2 lover I also want a change of pace and fight with something like tanks and laser cannon rather than bows and swords. And better yet, fight by commanding an army of robot! The unit types in this game counter each other to the point that a lowly infantry can withstand a blow from the main gun of a tsunami tank (but not its tread of course). The King Oni shoots laser beam from its eyes are vulnerable to infantry (yes, infantry) without its secondary ability. King Oni can finish off buildings and armored vehicles and blow them up to oblivion, but gaze that scary glowing eye of yours at a Conscript, for example, and congrat comgrades, experience how lame you can be.It pretty much like rock paper scissor. In short : the unit strengths and weaknesses are enhanced, and heavily amplified. Get the right units and you will raze their base to the ground, get the wrong ones, and totaloo, your base will be razed to the ground, oh and your pride as a RTS strategist, too, if you have any.The pace of battles is very fast for me, the outcome of combat is decided pretty quickly, and you better put your godlike microskillz to use, else, screw micro managing, just right click your way to victory.The differences of three forces: Allies, USSR, and Japan Empire are very diversified. The Allies has Air superiority, the Japan Empire, of course, master of the sea. Finally the USSR prefers to fight on land (yes, LAND WARFARE) basically if you confront them head on, and they are not hindered by your navy or air force, then you are dead my friend; the Red army will mow you down, they loves using brute force.There are lots of tatics and tricks that can be used, thanks to the special ability of some units.Joking aside, to be honest, I bumped onto this game when it was on sale and it was the best bargain I can get with just $5.

												Having not played many of the other Commander and Conquer titles or the other Red Alerts games, I can only judge this game on its base RTS elements. In basic form it is a fairly typical RTS game where you do your recourse collecting, base building mixed with constructing defences and units, all with the goal of using superior might to defeat your enemy. The game features three very diverse and unique factions with units that all have a unique ability and properties allowing for some fun and chaotic mayhem on the battle field. I find this game really enjoyable to play and would recommend anyone to who likes fast paced, typical RTS style and is on the fence about buying it, to give it a try.			"

												What a game!!! Might be old but it is solid good. You won't be overwhelmed with impossible tasks to manage. The factions are fun and they are all different. The quality of the graphics are good even for today's standards. The campaign is entertaining and long, so you get to play it from each of the faction's perspective (Russia, Allies and Japan). You can put 2 or 3 hour in this game and you won't end up exhausted. There is one caveat. This game is single player only, even though it has a menu option for multi-player, but it won't work. I guess the game is too old and EA had to free-up servers. If you ever get done with the campaign, there is a pretty good skirmish menu against the computer. In my opinion there is good re-play value in this game for the buck you are paying.			"

I personally to enjoy the music and humor this game has, but that's a personal oppinion. There are so flaws however, The artstyle is to cartoony for my taste and in EA infinite wisdome they have disided that ou bearly get any funds to work with, this does inprove gameplay as you are forced to expand however is also gives you no option whatsoever to just have some fun and not really play serious.Overall a good game with it flaws, I would advise picking this one up during a sale			"

												The game I'm sure was once great, and the new integration of multiplayer co-op through the campaign added a new and fun way to make your way through the scenarios. However EA had previously hosted the online servers through Gamespy, which has since December 2013 been shut down. EA has not produced an alternate hosting solution for Red Alert 3, and it does not seem like they will as this is not a Madden game or a Battlefield game. Therefore you are stuck playing the single player campaign missions with an AI co-op partner, which sucks eggs. So like other reviewers have stated, the single player alone is not enough to carry this game, and one must engage in the multiplayer aspect to truly appreciate the new mechanics. But since EA isn't hosting the multiplayer anymore the game is no longer worth playing.http://answers.ea.com/t5/Command-Conquer-The-Ultimate/Command-amp-Conquer-Red-Alert-3-Experiencing-Login-Issues/td-p/1557593 "

												Right off the top I'm going to say that the story and live action cutscenes are absolutely abysmal. I have no respect for any of the actors and as a result I'm lost in a story with no coherent reason to progress, or even exist. However, the game mechanics, the controls and the actual graphics all work very well together in perfect blend of RTS perfection. Fans of the franchise will be pleased to hear that it plays very much like Red Alert 2; skirmish mode is back, as well as online which are both incredibly addictive. Building a massive army and tipping the enemy over like a pawn is one of the most satisfying feelings in gaming. Apart from the live action garbage, and a few minor bugs I've encountered, this is a perfect gaming experience. 7 / 10			"

												Good fun, but I really want to zoom out more. The graphics are pretty and all, but it's hard to get a fair sense of how much destruction you're causing with such a limited view. In Generals you could zoom way the hell out and it was awesome because then you could maximize large scale strategy, but in this game the strategies have to be much tighter in order to win. Multiplayer is♥♥♥♥♥kick and campaign is fun (mad campy, but that's kind of the point). There is some tight music as well, Frank Klepacki is a god.			"

												I already have 219 hours logged on this game, would you think I would spend that much time if I didn't like it? Haha, this is a great game that I would happily suggest to other people, out of 10, I'd say maybe a 8/10, it has it's flaws but really the good outwieghs the bad, bringing a unique Sea Arsenal for each class which never seen before in Command and Conquer changes the game quite dramatically.

												Not a terrible 3rd title in the Red Alert trilogy...   I was an OK fan of Red Alert 1. Then I became a HUGE fan of Red Alert 2. In fact I consider Red Alert 2 the RTS title that got me into RTS gaming.  I had high expectations with Red Alert 3 when it released. Was I impressed initially? Honestly, no. I was a little bit disappointed with the game and really didn't like the Empire faction. I thought it was pretty damn cheesy. I mean this is coming from a game that is loaded with cheese. But really, I preferred my mind whack job faction of Yuri from Red Alert 2. At least they had some Soviet in their style. The Empire faction gives up too much cornyness with their robot units that carry samurai swords and whatnot. I understand it's the theme, but let's be realistic here. You wouldn't be winning a war with swords in Red Alert.  For me, Red Alert 2 allowing you to choose from real world nations after picking either Allies or Soviets kept a more realistic approach to the madness and you could feel a lil more attachment to the story. Red Alert 3 is all over the place. BUT, not all is bad in the game.  I still do love the gameplay and minor enhancements they made. The graphics looking stunning even right now with the current gen games out. The Soviets and Allies are still great looking and have some really awesome units. Who doesn't love building a mass of Dreadnoughts to rain down dozens and dozens of missles? When the damage flies, it flies.  As I got this game on a cheap Steam sale, I figured why the hell not, and I'm happy for it. I stuck mostly with skirmish game matches where I could just have quick fun of building my base and laying waste to my opponent.   Where I didn't see much in this game initially upon launch, I found late in it's life thru Steam. At this point I recommend the game, but it will never be held to the standard I had with Red Alert 2.			"

												pretty solid rts, some people may be offended by the stereotyping but it was just in there for comedy. and the main appeal is the gameplay not the story (even though sometimes it can be pretty amusing comedy wise). The three armies are all very different and unique, each with there own gimmicks and units that are both visually appealing and easy to tell apart on the battlefield. The graphics are pretty good for a 6 year old game and the environments all look colourful and lively, it's not overly complicated to learn but there are many different ways to win a battle.  My main 2 complaints are the lack of online servers and the fact you can drain the land completely of reasources in longer matches and have to resort to fighting with what units you have left already built. other then that, good game			"

												One of the few and best RTS games on Steam that I enjoyed and recommend.Red Alert 3 comes with solid gameplay,fun and well made storyline and decent graphics even after 6 years.I used to play Red Alert 2 back in the day and I feel like RA3 is a worthy succesor.I really enjoyed atomic weapons in RA2 but due to the storyline those are unavailable in RA3.Kinda disappointed but the game still offers a wide range of global weapons.The battles are flashy and also easy to look at.The units feel responsive and easy to maneuver around even if you have a large number of them.The game offers tons of single player content with storylines that will for sure keep you playing the game.I absolutely like the fact that Command and Conquer games have actual actors playing in the cinematics and in-game instructions.Another reason I really enjoy this game's single player mode.In conclusion RA3 is a must have RTS on steam even after 6 years after release.

												The Command & Conquer series is one of the best among strategies and Red Alert is with Tiberium Wars the best series. After amazing Red Alert 2 I was sure I wouldn't be disappointed by the part three. And I was right, many interesting and great looking buildings to build and units to fight with. The campaign could have been better, but isn't bad at all, the worst parts were actually the cinematic ones. In my opinion best strategy game to play online.""Given enough time, any man may master the physical. Given enough knowledge, any man may become wise.

Most units now have some secondary ability and there's a bit more emphasis on water based combat but otherwise the same rules still apply: find a unit that fits your style and then build a lot of them, hit the enemy with your special powers and then go mop up. Can't speak for the multiplayer since that seems to be dead. Overall, a nice little game with relatively simple mechanics for the casual RTS fan.			"

												I had a lot of fun games played in this so am giving it the reccomend despite a few real key drawbacks. Love building bunkers and hunkering down with a force to mow everyone as they came into the kill zones i built. The three empires build their buildings very differently. Japan is great at the start but it needs to double build everything by building an easily destoyable vehicle that rolls out and then goes to insta build that building somewhere. If you are on them as this is happening they are done. The main drawback to this game for me though is the superweapons. So super that all you really need is to build them first and you win. Dont need to uncover the fog of war since the maps are such that you know right were they built everything and just hit that spot without scouting it first. Then you roll in with a handful of choppers or tanks to mop up. If not for the superweapons i probably would have kept playing the game with a buddy a lot longer and enjoyed the challenge a lot more.			"

												Sadly this game won't even run for me.  The 'splash screen' shows and thats it.  I sat for 15 minutes with the splash screen up just to make sure the game wasn't loading.  I have tried everything I can, going so far as to install C&C online launcher to see it that would launch it but to no avail.  So yeah, I have yet to actually play this game as it will not start on my PC and sadly many many others are having the same issue with being unable to play the game.			"

												Pretty much the same as the first two games. Most units now have some secondary ability and there's a bit more emphasis on water based combat but otherwise the same rules still apply: find a unit that fits your style and then build a lot of them, hit the enemy with your special powers and then go mop up. Can't speak for the multiplayer since that seems to be dead. Overall, a nice little game with relatively simple mechanics for the casual RTS fan.			"

												This game could have been more and it could have been worse. For the most part, the game is a soild RTS game. However, I find the AI partner to be rather bothersome. The co-op action wasn't a bad idea but I personally don't want to have another AI commander using up my resources and giving a false sense of security. Besides the issue of co-op the only thing left is the use of sex to sell. All commandos are women, this wouldn't be bad but they are just dressed like sex objects. Which if you like that kind of thing you'll be happy to know you get plenty of it. I liked the RA2 commando for the Soviet Union rather than the newer one. So if you like the series, you may want to check this out, buy on sale.			"

												The Red Alert branch of the Command and Conquer games has always been close to my heart. It was the very first Red Alert that got me hooked up on computer games. Since my childhood days, the series has changed a lot and adapted new ways presenting itself. Red Alert 3 has adapted a cartoonish look, but still holding onto the important things that made the series so good. It's not perfect, but it's fun and you can share that fun with a friend. The new co-op installment is an amazing idea brought alive. Every campaign may now be played with a friend of your choosing. Red Alert 3 as a game might not revolutionize the RTS genre, but it is worth your attention especially when not coupled with a full price tag of a new game.In conclusion, it's not perfect but it is enjoyable, and that ultimately is what games are about. Definitely looking forward to Red Alert 4.			"

												One of the few and best RTS games on Steam that I enjoyed and recommend.Red Alert 3 comes with solid gameplay,fun and well made storyline and decent graphics even after 6 years.I used to play Red Alert 2 back in the day and I feel like RA3 is a worthy succesor.I really enjoyed atomic weapons in RA2 but due to the storyline those are unavailable in RA3.Kinda disappointed but the game still offers a wide range of global weapons.The battles are flashy and also easy to look at.The units feel responsive and easy to maneuver around even if you have a large number of them.The game offers tons of single player content with storylines that will for sure keep you playing the game.I absolutely like the fact that Command and Conquer games have actual actors playing in the cinematics and in-game instructions.Another reason I really enjoy this game's single player mode.In conclusion RA3 is a must have RTS on steam even after 6 years after release.

												Is this the best C&C game? No. Is this game as memorable Red Alert 2? No. Yet when this game goes on sale for $5, then it becomes very much a worthwhile purchase. To clearify - the game's story isn't bad, I personally find it to be fairly solid (although nowhere near as good as RA2) the campaign is has a decent length. The gameplay although fairly familair to veterans of the C&C franchise is a bit slower than that of the previous titles. In this game resources are gathered from a resource node - in eariler titles the way of gathering resources was to build refineries around a resource field. This change both slows the game while simultaniously makes the need for early expansion greater. But what this system allowed for is the advanced naval system. The system allows for a base to be built on either land or water - an interesting and surprisingly functional mechanic. But before I conclude, the biggest issue with the game is (this may or may not be resolved after this review is posted) that the multiplayer is not functional. When the game first launched it featured a co-op mode for the campaign (can be played singleplayer without a problem) but due to gamespy shutting down, there is no way to play multiplayer with anyone (LAN may be the exception but I have never tested it) Ultimately for $5 on sale, this is not a bad game to grab otherwise - I'd recommend either waiting or getting RA2.

												Red Alert 1,2 theese both are very good strategy games and has very nice moment at my childhood. Red alert 1 was my first computer game. And it was very important for me. I never truly care about any other Command and Conquer game. Red alert was the only thing for me.  Gameplay and controlling was easy. Game storyline was very good and cutscenes was an awesome red alert classic. When we come to Red Alert 3 lots of people dissapointed. Because they think the game lost its old soul. But in my opinion they were wrong. All i see was improvement of old games without losing its soul. Better commanding. Better cutscenes.(With lots of beauties from mother russia, england and japan :)  ) Very nice new units and improvements to the old units from previous games. Balanced and fun increased nations to play with increased numbers. This game still rocks! Too bad that gamespy is down and we cannot play it multiplayer. :(			"

												I can like this game and I want to love it.  There are so many good things that I feel I have to give it a thumbs up but.....If you plan to get this to play offline skirmish and want to do so from time to time with a friendly AI with you, just something to relax and play around with some very silly units...I havn't raged so hard at friendly AIs since C&C3.  I set both my friendly AI and the enemy AI to the same level but for reasons I can't understand the game will make it so the friendly one will act brain dead.  We're over midway into a skirmish, the enemy has just built their super weapon and it starting to make some tier 3 units.  My friendly has (if I'm lucky) just started to make some tier 2, has no defences and not much of anything else.  The rest of this game is more or less fine.  It looks like RA2 with better graphics and has a story as silly as the acting of the people telling it to you much the same as the one before it.			"

												This game is so fun and is so beautiful for game made in 2008. This is one game that is in my top 5 best games of all time,(in my opinion), and is going to stay there until someone can make game that is better. I highly recommend this game because when u play with or without your friends it is so fun. I have actually owned this game a really long time ago but have never bought it on steam until now. So. I have been playing this game for almost 6 years.			"

												An entertaining RTS with fun, amusing factions, though I find the slow territory-expansion method of the Allies incongruous with their otherwise adaptive and improvisational tactical approach. Coupled with their pedestrian musical motifs, I find they're the faction I least like playing. (As the Soviets or Japanese Imperials, you are serenaded by choirs as you storm the enemy base!). And the fact that the AI is immune to the fog of war is plainly evident and abused when playing in skirmish mode. Other than that, a great game!			"

I could go on and on...For 10$, this is a good deal for a good RTSThe standalone expansion ""Uprising"" is more of the same with a few more units and campains (some really challenging ones), but that one has NO multiplayer or LAN, so just go for this and if you want more units, download a mod from Mod DB. Only buy Uprising for the added campains and challenges (or for a discount, just not 10$)			"

												I've been playing Command and Conquer since their first game with GDI v Nod, and it was great. Red Alert was better. Red Alert 2 started pushing the envelope and now 3 has taken it all the way. Full scale B movie has been reached.With that said, the gameplay is fairly solid, though I'm not certain about the co-op campaign (provides an AI if you want to play alone) but even that works quite well. Not what I expected, but not unenjoyable.			"

												Although not a big fan of C&C-type mechanics, I pretty much enjoyed this game's attempt at rejuvinating the Red Alert sub-series when it came out. Although it did so honourably well on the storyline and the characterization of each faction, this game unfortunately has, in my opinion, a serious balance issue. The most notable of the latter being the ridiculously massive range and damage advantage of Japanese battleships, capable of destroying a base with near impunity.			"

												One of the few and best RTS games on Steam that I enjoyed and recommend.Red Alert 3 comes with solid gameplay,fun and well made storyline and decent graphics even after 6 years.I used to play Red Alert 2 back in the day and I feel like RA3 is a worthy succesor.I really enjoyed atomic weapons in RA2 but due to the storyline those are unavailable in RA3.Kinda disappointed but the game still offers a wide range of global weapons.The battles are flashy and also easy to look at.The units feel responsive and easy to maneuver around even if you have a large number of them.The game offers tons of single player content with storylines that will for sure keep you playing the game.I absolutely like the fact that Command and Conquer games have actual actors playing in the cinematics and in-game instructions.Another reason I really enjoy this game's single player mode.In conclusion RA3 is a must have RTS on steam even after 6 years after release.

												I reccomend Red alert 3, now i won't review the gameplay or anything else related to that since you can find reviews for thoose elsewhere, Many people who are nostalgic for Red alert 2 and the games before automaticaly hate this game since it changed alot from the original concept, and for the better since it added many new mechanics and overall i really love this game with it's superb campaign and multiplayer, Now many people know that gamespy shut down, well that means you can't play online right? wrong. there are over 300 people who play red alert 3 multiplayer via cnc online, you can google that and download it, it's really easy once you download that's it you just go into red alert 3, click on multiplayer and register. So try to ignore the reviews made by ""Veterans"" who are nostalgic of the old games and try to install this if you want to play multiplayer. if you're a newcomer into the series i highly reccomend C&C Red alert 3 to be the game you start with since it clears things up.

												A good RTS in all regards, in my opinion, but lets go over it step by step.There are three factions available, all with their own unique play style, and sets of weaknesses and strengths. Compared to Red Alert 2, the differences are more stark, and it goes from units to base-building styles. In addition to that, every faction has 3 different AI's, with their own play-styles.If you're looking for a ""serious"" RTS, I'd suggest looking elsewhere, but RA3 is quite light hearted and cheesy(in an appealing kind of way), especially when it comes to acting and outfits in the campaign videos. Overall, it creates a feeling of a B grade movie from the mid 2000's, again, in a good way.As for issues, I would say that the balance is a little off, and the Empire gets slightly preferntial treatment, compared to the classic Soviets and Allies, but it's quite easily circumvented, as the effectiveness of your chosen faction is dictated by your own skill, and knowledge of each unit's strengths and weaknesses.If you're looking for a fun, light-hearted RTS that doesn't take itself all to seriously, flavor-wise, but at it's core, is a well made game with different levels of depth, go right ahead, buy it, you won't regret it.

												The third installment in the Red Alert universe is the best one yet. Combining all the classic elements of its predecessors that made those games great; Red Alert 3 is an RTS done right. Among all the usual fare like Campaign and Skirmishes, there are also lots of battles to be faught online and new experiences to be had in single player with the live action cutscenes. Let's face it guys, the acting is really corny. But who needs good acting when you've got jugs? Lots of jugs. In fact, if you are a fan of jugs you will want to buy this game whether or not you're actually into RTC. But seriously, there's a lot of content to be experienced in this, and its expansion which can be bought separately. I personally really enjoy the new Empire of the Rising Sun faction, as it adds a modular twist to the usual units we're used to seeing and thus changes up the game significantly. Graphics wise it runs very smooth and on nearly any system these days. The art style is one of a more lighter-hearted nature. But then again, that goes hand in hand with the direction of the game and the universe. Red Alert has always been the more cheeky, sci-fi cousin of the Tiberium and Generals universes and stands alone as a unique and interesting one at that. THe pacing of the game is fantastic, the audio is pretty decent (especially the music) and the gameplay is sublime. If you're a fan of any of the C&C games in the past, ESPECIALLY Red Alert, you owe it to yourself to check this game out.			"

												Great except for one fact that completely ruins the fun for me. I have played several of the C&C games starting from the original DOS game. C&C: Red Alert 3 has added some interesting things to the gameplay. However, what I find the most fun in the game is that after I have created a big army, I'll attack and wreck the enemy. But in this game, by the time I'm happy with my army, the co-commander has already done all of that and I'm left with no fun. At least with my playing style, I'm just left defending my base at the beginning and then at the end destroying or capturing one enemy building. Might work alright with a human co-comanner.			"

												I can like this game and I want to love it.  There are so many good things that I feel I have to give it a thumbs up but.....If you plan to get this to play offline skirmish and want to do so from time to time with a friendly AI with you, just something to relax and play around with some very silly units...I havn't raged so hard at friendly AIs since C&C3.  I set both my friendly AI and the enemy AI to the same level but for reasons I can't understand the game will make it so the friendly one will act brain dead.  We're over midway into a skirmish, the enemy has just built their super weapon and it starting to make some tier 3 units.  My friendly has (if I'm lucky) just started to make some tier 2, has no defences and not much of anything else.  The rest of this game is more or less fine.  It looks like RA2 with better graphics and has a story as silly as the acting of the people telling it to you much the same as the one before it.			"

												I remember my first game of Red Alert. It was in RA2 and I was the South Koreans. I got completely crushed by the Soviets. Something about how diverse all the troops were made me want to keep going and unlock their true potential. I practiced RA2 and the Yuri's Revenge expansion pack until I became a master, able to take on 2 brutals at once.One day, EA published RA3. I was so excited when I saw what it had to offer. I got the disk version and started right away. I was overwhelmed by all the new changes, like amphibious buildings and secondary abilities. It felt like I was that complete noob again.A couple years later, I retook my master's status here and mained Empire of the Rising Sun. I then bought the Steam version recently during a sale so my Steam friends can see that I play games other than TF2. This game is so visually and auditorily amazing, and it is probably one of the most balanced RTS's I've ever played. I enjoyed the campaign thoroughly and find that all of the maps are very balanced. TL,DR: 10/10 would get rekt by army of century bombers again.			"

												C&C: Red Alert 2 is my childhood and I think it's the first PC game I have ever played. Red Alert 3 isn't that bad aswell. Some of the singleplayer missions are pretty difficult which makes it much enjoyable to play.			"

												I'm sure this game is fun if you can manage to get the CO-OP (Multiplayer) working.  But in my first hour I encountered game breaking bug, after game breaking bug.  Specifically if the Ai is in control of an ""Objective unit"".  They will often freeze on the map, refuse to move, and you are unable to complete the mission. It requires you completely restart the mission and redo everything.  On that note, I can't recommend this game.			"

												Im a huge RTS fan, aswell as a C&C fan. Games like this one formed my early childhood. I played them so much when I was small, its really nice to rediscover them. i really suggest this game as it kept me infront of my TV for days, and it keeps doing it on PC.			"

												It's fun for a while, but the unit AI creates lots of painful moments. Unlike Generals, their reach seems unusually small so be prepared to lose units that are picked off by attacking enemies with   the rest of your army just sitting there thinking ""yup, sure glad that's not my tank that's just being ravaged""			"

												I can like this game and I want to love it.  There are so many good things that I feel I have to give it a thumbs up but.....If you plan to get this to play offline skirmish and want to do so from time to time with a friendly AI with you, just something to relax and play around with some very silly units...I havn't raged so hard at friendly AIs since C&C3.  I set both my friendly AI and the enemy AI to the same level but for reasons I can't understand the game will make it so the friendly one will act brain dead.  We're over midway into a skirmish, the enemy has just built their super weapon and it starting to make some tier 3 units.  My friendly has (if I'm lucky) just started to make some tier 2, has no defences and not much of anything else.  The rest of this game is more or less fine.  It looks like RA2 with better graphics and has a story as silly as the acting of the people telling it to you much the same as the one before it.			"

												I remember my first game of Red Alert. It was in RA2 and I was the South Koreans. I got completely crushed by the Soviets. Something about how diverse all the troops were made me want to keep going and unlock their true potential. I practiced RA2 and the Yuri's Revenge expansion pack until I became a master, able to take on 2 brutals at once.One day, EA published RA3. I was so excited when I saw what it had to offer. I got the disk version and started right away. I was overwhelmed by all the new changes, like amphibious buildings and secondary abilities. It felt like I was that complete noob again.A couple years later, I retook my master's status here and mained Empire of the Rising Sun. I then bought the Steam version recently during a sale so my Steam friends can see that I play games other than TF2. This game is so visually and auditorily amazing, and it is probably one of the most balanced RTS's I've ever played. I enjoyed the campaign thoroughly and find that all of the maps are very balanced. TL,DR: 10/10 would get rekt by army of century bombers again.			"

												It's fine, but really the C&C series stopped being worth it after the first few games. All of more recent ones are just graphically superior rehashes without the same gameplay. Overall, would recommend for fans of the series. For hardcore RTS fans, look elsewhere, this isn't for you.			"

C&C: Red Alert 3- Solid gameplay- Not one glitch recorded, personally, since playing.- Live action sutscenes can be cheesey, with hints of casual racism and sexism, but honestly one of the reasons C&C is a nostalgic and well remembered title.- Campaign tiers are immediately unlocked allowing access to all three nations from the get-go.- Although there is an unified arc to each scenario each ending is unique  meaning you dont have to complete campaigns in any order, However I would recommend starting at the Soviets if you are new to the game and its mechanics.In conclusion,A nostalgic blast from almost a decade ago that still lives up well to its modern counterparts. I bought the game on sale, that being said I would buy it for the Steam RRP. Will be eventually purchasing the DLC pack to see what else this Gem has to offer.			"

												This game is great, but far from perfect. The game's tutorial tells you everything you need to know but leaves you to discover extra information. The way it does the tutorial is great, and adds a little charm and induvidulaity. After passing your tutorial you can do a campaign. These campaign asre challanging, with varing diffulclty and have many funny charms to them. A lot of the time this game captures you and keeps you playing, with is interesting play and fun campaigns. However, The 'easy mode' is absurd. They bumble about with charm, elegance and grace of a walrus with no limbs. Overall, if you ike strategy and funny gameplay, I would highly recommend this.			"
