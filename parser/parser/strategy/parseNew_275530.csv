												UPDATE 7/19/2014:Some major improvements from the devs, controls are much smoother, AI not getting stuck as much, resolution control and a few tweaks and fixes. Much closer to the original game, especially with the removal of the video borders.A few recommendations based on Zod Engine and the orignal to the devs:-Game pause needs to be improved, should pause within game while still allowing you to issue orders. Original game allowed in-game pause like this.-Multiplayer is really a must, you're on Steam, use their in-built matchmatching. Orignal game had multiplayer, Zod Engine has multiplayer, you should have multiplayer.-Consider 2-click scheme option for select unit and issue order.-Please improve the menus, still terrible.-------------------Original Posted on 4 Jul @ 6:07pm:Low resolution, terrible menus, no multiplayer, very awkward controls. I thought I'd support a classic I enjoyed, but honestly, just go on Google and type in Zod Engine to get a way better implentation for free, with multiplayer support, better controls, and even a linux release, and for some reason far better looking textures and full-screen high-res support.The developers really lost a chance here because there is still a crowd for this game and they really blew it with this pathetic release. They couldn't do better than a free release.I want my money back, thanks for butchering my childhood!			"

												I don't normally write reviews, but for this ""remake"" of a classic game i feel i must.Initially everything looked great; the original graphics, the same play mechanics, even the same levels along with promises that we'd have a level editor and that the Devs would ""look into"" getting the missing levels from the classic Z95 expansion.All was bright and rosy until August 2014; the last time the devs appear to have done anything in response to the Steam PC community beyond try and sell a copy to a Mac user.We were promised patches and fixes to the issues reported by users ""Soon"" and ""In a week or so""Non cameOver a year later in late September 2015, still nothing from the devs.The game works, the game is optimised for tablet (I.e. Non PC Users) but still has many of those bugs reported prior to August 2014 going back to release. Its controls are still clunky, we don't have a level editor or the Z95 missions, we still have stupid bugs like Toughs and Pyros not being able to destroy buildings. The pathfinding is still worse than the original and so forth.But the devs have their game on the mobile market where they can make their money from impulse buys and people who don't care about the game beyond a 10 minute tap fest on their slates and won't moan too much about bugs and oddities.All those promises to the PC users and the Steam Users have not been acted on, no patch ever materialised and the devs have been missing in (non-)action since August 2014.Don't buy this game, support the original and locate a legit copy on ebay or amazon or somewhere else, then use the WinXP/Vista/7 launcher to run it. You'll enjoy the game a whole lot more than you would with this shamble of a remake, plus you'll have the Z95 editor, mods and improved controls, all the things you won't get here.Support this type of game by not buying this remake and going for the original.Buy the remake and you are only supporting cash grabbing devs who only seem to care about mobile compatibility and ride along on a string of broken promises and non-communication with the PC community.

												Great game, bad port, abandoned by the developers. Like many other Steam ports, this is not an upgrade, but downgrade.Please don't give them money until they make a proper PC port, not iOS/Android port with broken UI and AI.UI is made for touchscreens, painful to use.Pathfinding and unit AI are still atrocious, units will stop and refuse to move for no reason, plan crazy routes, get stuck in broken bridges instead of making a detour, walk straight into a wall, refuse to shoot, etc. etc...During cutscenes sound will temporarily disappear. Music could use some improvements, sometimes it is very repetitive.Screen scrolls slowly for some reason, with much lower framerate than it should have. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2D game, should've been 1080p60p on 10 years old PC!and finally:NO MULTIPLAYER which the original game had!			"

												Despite this one of my favourite childhood game. I would hesitate to recomnd you to grab it on Steam unless you are fan of the game. Good:- In game graphic, very nice same old one [still looking nice] all the funny animation is there [try to leave your robot for a while and it will have some unique animation based on the map or surrounding object]- The unique RTS gameplay where you capture the flag to control the point and if the point contain factory it will produce you selected unit preodically. Bad:- Terrible interface. It's not like original game also. Seem like a port from mobile game.- No multiplayer. As the AI still supid as it was before, multiplayer is how I play for more challenge or sneaky tactic fun.Mixed:- Path finding is still same♥♥♥♥♥♥as it was before. [Those who have no expreience will find it frustrating but old player will know how to issue order properly]- Same CGI between mission. [Well it's like my Dad game so yeah pretty bad]ps. I would actually suggest those who love this game to play Zod Engine[zod.sourceforge.net] instead [both who interest and those who love the old game]			"

												""Z is... the fastest, funniest, most frantic, feature-packed action-strategy game you'll play this century!"" Is this true? is it hell! this is a complete lie.Z is one of my favorite childhood memories sitting down playing this after school with my big brother on our playstation 1. Back in the good old ays this game was absolutely great and it's the reason I got into strategy games. I'll be honest, I saw this game and instantly payed for it to try and re-live some of my youth and it is very similar to the way I remember it being (although I now hate my brother lol). The slight changes they've made to make it control better with the PC aren't all that great, it gives you a few tabs at the bottom to select all units of a certain type to save you dragging boxes around all your units (which I still did anyway). the game plays just how it used to and is a great blast from the past, however... is this a good port? no, not at all. the resolution is appauling in this day and age and to actually get the game working I had to mess around with my monitor to actually see anything. Personally I will put up with this just because I'm such a huge fan of this games and have great memories with it, but advising this to someone who wants to play a competant strategy game would be very difficult.So on that that basis I can't recommend this game and am giving it a thumbs down. the game itself is great fun but it's severly let down by the amount of effort put in to making this run on a PC. Unless you're like me and played this when you were younger and just want to have a little bash on it without searching in your attic for your old console and disc then yeah it's not a huge price to pay, but I won't recommend it to anyone else unless they do some serious work into making it more PC friendly and if they do I will edit my review accordingly.thanks for reading x			"

												One of the most disappointing and sloppily made remakes I have played in a very, very long time.Suggested to wait if they really fix and update it (they won't). If they do, I will fix and update my review as well.While the original Bitmap Brothers game was fantastic, the new developer TickTock Games managed to butcher most aspects of the game they touched.I did not want to believe the negative reviews but unfortunately they are right. Even though the developers claimed they might fix some things and add the much needed multiplayer After the first 3 very minor updates there is still a long list of issues before this can be recommended.They first made a mobile version and then just put it on Steam without any significant changes. This leads to several frustrating aspects, especially in all the controls and functions from the original game not working any more (repair stations etc.)The language localization that was taken from the original game is good but everything they added is worse than Google Translate.>About the original gameIn a time where RTS was mainly about first gathering resources and building a base, The Bitmap Brothers made something radically different. Instead of resources you capture the sectors of the map which have factories and facilities already on them - the only resources are time and the sectors you hold - the more you control, the faster your units are built and then send to destroy the enemy fort (by attacking it from afar or sneaking any unit through the front entrance to sabotage it). In the beginning of the match you will have to race your opponent to capture sectors or sometimes empty vehicles or artillery that are scattered across the the map. You can even try to snipe the driver out of vehicles and then capture them yourself.With a simple gameplay and a set of about 15 units the game offered still amazing strategic possibilities.So whether you are a fan of the 1995 MSDos classic or only just stumbled upon this: Do yourself a favor and look for the original open source remake Zod Engine (multiplayer) instead, because what TickTock has done to the game is not worthy of Commander Zod.

												Hi there!I loved and played a lot the original ""Z"" back in the year 1998, I wanted to like and love this version but..This port is damn buggy i think. I play it only for nostalgia and the achievements. I know, the original wasn´t perfect, but this ""new"" version is some sort of thing you wouldn´t like to see..I make it short. These iteration of ""Z"" has not much in common in many important things and ways with the original release:- no short cuts on keyboard- cheating A.I; for example you got more attacking units being offensive vs. 1! enemy but you still loose the battle in a mystical way- annoying automatical ""group- binding"" or ""unit- binding"", that means units are automatically grouped and you have all the time to disgroup manually, very confusing and uncomfortable, leading to unit losses and time loss in navigation- stupid menu- navigation and general ugly, no original layouts- different interface to original, not almost as comfortable as known before- unbalanced gameplay in difference to original- bad♥♥♥♥♥controls in contrast to original- strange unit ""reactions"" like non- shooting, non- walking, long-way- taking- general bad pathfinding..- LEVELS MISSING!and so on...I am sure I forget some bad things. I don´t want to nitpick.Really.. I love the original ""Z"". I wanted to love this to..This stupid mobil- port ist to often unfair, annoying and bad done in general. Shame!!! Frustrating! Lame!			"

												This game is really tough to judge in a fair manner. The original Z was released in 1996 and became a cult hit for its twist on real time strategy.However, this here is not that game. It's the PC-port of the (2011) iOS-port of that game and it shows! You can even find the files for the iOS manual in the Steam folder and the tutorial still tells you to tap the screen.Much of the original gameplay is still there and enthusiasts of classic real time strategy will find much to like here. The biggests downsides of the porting are however a less intuitive and more complicated control system (which can cost you seconds giving orders in comparison to the original) and a messy UI that fails to give you vital information quickly.While I still love the game itself it is a far inferior version to the original game. This version doesn't even include the 10 extra levels from the Win95 Expansion. So if you're interested in Z, better get Z95 off amazon, ebay or somewhere else.			"

												An awesome game and cult classic from 1996 gets butchered on a mobile port and from there, comes to PC. Missing animations/sounds, game modes, clunky interface, some crashes here and there.. you get the idea. But, a big part of the ""fun factor"" of the original game still remains present in this ""port"". Only recommended on Sale, specially if you lost your original Disc from the original game, or perhaps you want feel some nostalgia. Otherwise, stay away. Or just stick with the original game with is far far superior than this release. Oh! And the devs or whatever is in charge now of the franchise totally abandoned this title,  I saw some activity on the Z:SS but that's it. Totally radio silence.Your choice. 6.5/10Note: While I give a possitive score of 6.5 (because after all you can still have a little fun) I will give the game a thumbs down. This is not the treatment you give to a classic game or to any port for that matter, at all!			"

												I enjoyed this in the 90s and this is still a really good game but it has a few bugs which are somewhat hampering gameplay:1. Units or vehicles get stuck behind rabbit holes or small obstacles which as far as I used to recall they used to go around or destroy. 2. Troops tend to be unwilling to get in APCs, which makes building those a huge gamble as you probably can't use them.3. Pyros and toughs won't attack buildings as they used to, which is another tactical limitation.4. vehicle route AI is pretty poor - part of the fun of the game was always the fact that troops and vehicles could be a bit dumb, but again this seems worse than previously.5. Repair facilities don't seem to work.It's still pretty good but I'm a bit disappointed by these shortcomings. I would be grateful if there is a patch that has been developed.I am glad to be playing it again but I think a new player might find the bugs quite frustrating. If they were fixed I would have no hesitation at recommending this game.EDIT:It's over a year on, and the developers seem to have given up on this game and not fixed the bugs. The bugs make playing the game beyond a certain level extremely difficult if not impossible.I signed up with Steam solely in order to play this game, and I'm afraid my experience has made me  a little wary about buying other games on Steam.

												My childhood destroyed...I don't how it's possible to re-release a game 18 years later and actually make it WORSE than the original, here are my complaints:1. The controls, they are absolutely terrible, the mouse feels clunk and unresponsive, WASD doesn't scroll the screen and you are forced to drag and move like if this were a mobile game(oh wait, they ported it from MOBILE), the shortcuts from the old game don't work and you have weird situations like when the game autogroups a bunch of units; you are stuck with them grouped forever because there is no way to delete the group.2. The UI, original one was perfect, it gave you the exact amount of information needed. Now, I don't know why, they REMOVED things, WHY? Why would you remove anything?? And the minimap is useless, im playing at 1900x1080p and its the size of a pea, may aswell just remove it. They have remade things that were just perfect in the original.3. I play in English but also tried German and Spanish just to check the translations, and they are TERRIBLE, totally broken, the spanish one even has Italian words and sentences...4. HD Graphics? you on crack mate? they are just the same as the original (nothing bad) but don't just lie... and how is it possible that you can't change the resolution, when then again, YOU COULD IN THE ORIGINAL.TLDR: This game is a DOWNGRADED version from the one released in 1996.

												Good to see someone put some effort in making a re-release for my all time favorite game, Z or well known as Commander Zod.levels are exacly how i remembered them, not sure if this is a upside, new challenges has not been added, the upgraded version of the orginal Z also had 40 levels instead of the 20 in this release.Hud and Gui are exacly the same as i have on my i-phone, when disabling music cutscenes are soundless too.Mouse pointers have no indication or what they are going to do when you click, it could be move, destroy a bridge when not intended or attack your own factory.. fix please ?And worse of all, there is no multiplayer while zod engine and even the orginal Z that was made for DOS and early stages of windows did have those options.Upside still is you can change your resolution, menu's are horrible, scrolling speed is terrible, when you have multiple screens the mouse simple goes out of your primary monitor while playing, meening the game minimazes.an real improvement would be the ability to add your own custom campagnes or those of others.So, map editor like in the orginal version ?So in a nutshell:Pro's-------- Old fashion action you remembered.- AI seems to be less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then in the orginal versions.- Dificulty control- Worth buying even through there are allot of things / features they have to fix and add.con's-------- Horrible menu's / game controls, slow and mouse pointer dont indicate your actions.- No multiplayer, this is a real downer for me, and is a must in Z !- Direct port from mobile version, they have not took the effort to mask it up, since all the images / files are present in the pc version.

												Oh boy... where to start... The game itself is awesome. Bitmap Brothers did a great job on that 1996.Sadly this is not a PC remake, but just a mobile platform port with all the limitations of a mobile platform... It just doesn't feel right to have an UI, designed for a Phone or a Tablet on a PC.Horrible controls for PC. AI bugs especially with path finding (worse than the ones in the original game). etc.There are huge problems especially with Infantry Units' movement and firing. Also the Toughs' projectiles seem to be buggy compared to the original game.Unit AI is kind of weird. often Infantry Units get stuck near objects. When near enemy units often only one troop member attacks. The other ones are just walking around.Cursor selection and utility needs some improvements. Especially with turret guns. Often you make a robot leave a defensive turret by accident. Also you took away the possibility to make a rotating defensive turret keeping watch towards a direction of an approaching enemy, because you no longer can give an attack order out of the turrets range. This is taking away a lot of power from turrets. This was never a bug in the original game!It was a good micro management feature!The lack of a multiplayer is somehow disappointing. Even the original game had one in 1996(!).I know my review sounds harsh. But I am a software dev myself and I grew up with games like Z.Don't get me wrong. I think the idea to do a Z remake is great and I respect your attempt to do so. But a mobile platform port won't do the trick for a Z audience.In Conclusion it is definetly a nice game to play on your smartphone or a tablet while being bored, travelling by train, sitting in a bus or something similar. But it's just not right for a PC experienced Z audience.If you want to have the real Z feeling, get the original game and emulate it.Or even simpler, get the Zod Engine. It is basically a 1:1 remake of the old Z, with better controls and a working multiplayer!And it is free!The Developer of Zod Engine did it alone.You should`ve hired that guy.Edit: After further testing I found out there is a bug with tanks as well. If you give them an attack order with 2 enemies in it's range it will always attack the closest one, no matter wich one you told him to attack.And at least alter that UI a bit...			"

												For something that is supposedly rewritten from scratch, this version of Z is awful strange. On my PC it locks into the weird 1280x1024 resolution, with no option to change it, to switch into windowed mode, or to change refresh rate. There are no options to speak of, asides from ""music ON/OFF"" sort of garbage.The ""area circles"" around units flicker. Scrolling is about as choppy as the original, or worse. There's no multiplayer. The menues are minimalistic.It looks like a very lazy port on technical level, a cynical cash grab. You may be better off running the original in an emulator - at least with DOSBOX  you can set your own resolutions and scaling options.			"

												Genre - Sci-Fi RTSThis game is from the mid-90s and by a company called Bitmap Brothers. Games they produced already on Steam include The Chaos Engine and Speedball 2 HD. At the time they made very cool games that were both dark and comedic at the same time. This game sees you capturing territories with robots in jeeps and tanks whilst defending your fort. The animation is cute and it is actually quite challenging to get through the levels. There is only the story mode though and no multiplayer but it is still fun and stays true to the original. The way you move your troops reminds me of Cannon Fodder. This is where my my main criticism comes as they haven't moved with the times. Path Finding is not great and you have to click on each unit individually to move them, which leads to frustation when you notice them getting stuck on things as you are fighting on multiple fronts. Great for the oldies, but probably not as good for the youn 'uns. Now when is Cadaver, Gods and Xenon 2 getting on here?			"

												The original Z... is not this Z. This Z looks right, but plays very wrong. As a result, it can't be recommended. Z was like the quintessential Real-Time Strategy game... You don't need to build structures or gather resources or such. Instead, you simply capture territories, and you get whatever factories that territory has, and those factories makes the units. There are different units: the grunts, the snipers, and they can capture vehicles, stationary guns, and so on. Z, when it launched, which was way back in 1996, was a revelation, proving that you don't need to make things too complicated for a fun RTS with bazillion build queues and unit trees and special abilitities, and whatnot. The main draw was the ""AI""... If you run a unit next to an empty vehicle, it will ""capture"" that vehicle. If you put unit next to flag, it will capture the flag without prompting. This severely cuts down on the micro-management, freeing you to allocate the units and coordinate the attacks. While this game looks like Z, and feels like Z, it doesn't PLAY like Z. The units vary from smart (on the initial levels) to dumb<bleep>. On the early levels they do pick up grenades and vehicles and static guns  and flag automatically, but in later levels they simply stop doing so, when those objects are clearly in sensor radius. The units also get separated easily (when you have a group of 3, they end up widely separated and impossible to cmmand). Inadvertant groups like accidentally grouping a tank and a couple infantry can't be separated, which often result in destruction of empty vehicles, when you clicked on infantry, then empty vehicle to capture it, only to see a vehicle also in the group open fire on the empty vehicle, destroying it. The game also seem to have lost the ability to scroll with keyboard and/or use more than one mouse button at a time. In fact, this feels like (and probably is) a port of the MOBILE remake of Z, aka ""Z Origins"" All in all, this REMAKE of a classic, is not the classic, but a pretender.			"

												""Z"" is a game about fighting terrible controls and user interface, as well as training your pro-gamer APM skills by managing braindead units with some huge pathfinding issues.I can't remember whether the original DOS version of the game had similar issues, but this mobile port is just awful. It's not just unintuitive touchscreen controls that ruin the gameplay, but also the aforementioned buggy unit movement will certainly test your patience. The fact that the game is really, really slow just emphasizes this issue even more.And to be honest, the game itself isn't that great either. Nostalgia glasses off, the core concept is quite original for its time, and the artstyle really has a lot of charm, but when you think about it it's all about rushing early with initial units to get as many territories and abandoned vehicles as possible. The more territories you own, the quicker you produce units. There's little to no way of making a strategic comeback if one side owns way more territories than the other.Plus, the game is SO SLOW. Perhaps it's the increased FOV that makes it more noticeable, but it takes forever for units to move across the map. To the point you sometimes wonder whether they're moving at all. The irony is, it's also the shortest campaign I've ever played in an RTS, finished in about 3 hours.Just don't bother. Even if you enjoyed the original game you'll only end up annoyed by the terrble user interface and horrendous pathfinding issues. Not to mention, a lot of the original content has been cut from this version.			"

												Do not ever buy this game. I am a huge fun of Z. But: - path finding is worse than ever (the biggest reason why I hate this version)- map is too big or we somehow really get used to see as the old version- mause cursor is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by color and when army is picked, it distracts the attention easilyI still play DosBox of Win95 version, don't buy until they fix those big issues.

												Great disappointment.Game is a clear port from the mobile version. Because of that majority of interface feels out of place, being intended for touch screens in the first place.Beside of that, AI and pathfinding is worse than in the original, which wasn't great in the first place. At least in it units weren't moving back and forth while being shot at! Snipers are currently completely useless - they are easily taken out by mounted guns with shorter range. Why? Because snipers keep on moving closer, instead of shooting from maximum range.APC are often useless as well - 2 out of 3 times APC gets ""broken"" after unloading units from it - can't move it and can't load any units into it. I could go on. There is one big plus however - it motivated me to find DOS original game and play it in DosBox. Still playable, great experience,			"

												Not a very good port of the Original game, but at least it's cheap.I have a very long history with Z. It was the first RTS I ever played and the first one I completed. Quirky characters, very fast-paced gameplay and a good sense of humor will entertain you. Too bad the campaign is still so short and it doesn't include Multiplayer. Avoid it, if you have the Original - or you want to play Multiplayer, because there're far better solutions and that includes the actual Mobile version this game was ported from. If you just want a little humor and the old cutscenes, go for it!			"

												EDIT: they fixed some of the controls, now the left mouse button give the orders, and they give the option to choose if you want this way or the way it was before the patch, but the others problems are still therei loved this game when i played it in my win 98, 15 years ago... and i loved playing it today, it's a great game, and i think everyone who likes rts must play it. It's funny (90's fun =D), it's make you use your brain and deliver that satisfaction when you finaly explodes the fort on some level that you had to play for 50 times...but dont'y buy it yet!this version have at least 2 big problems:1st- the controls... are just weird... if you keep playing, you get used to them, but they need to be fixed. Especialy the gun placing system, and the cursor, which looks broken, it's the windows cursor all the time, but when you order an action, it turns to the game cursors, like a little hand saying no, or a circle aim... doesn't seems important, but i ordered a tank to destroy my own factory by accident because of this (MAYBE this cursor thing happens only in my pc, i'll try to find out)2nd- the pathfinding system... it's kind of broken... not a much of a problem for us players, because we can instruct the robots to get arround manually, but the AI can't... they simply gets stuck if you destroy a bridge. And this doesn't happened in the older pc version, if i remember well. If you expects a challenge versus the AI, in some levels you'll have none. And this problem scares me, cause i think the dev's ported it, and this bug looks more 'depper' in the game... i don't know anything about game coding, but i think it can't be resolved without some digging in the code, i'm not sure if the devs are able to do that, and even if they have autorization to do that.also, multiplayer would be greatall in all, wait to see if they fix the problems, they did a great job so far, maybe they'll fix these =)(sorry for bad english)			"

												I played this game back in 95' when it first came out and loved every second of it. I would highly recommend to buy this one on sale. Unfortunately, the user interface and menus do not hold the same nostalgia as the old one did. Although this ""new"" version of the game sort of kills the nostalgia for me, it still delivers the game I knew back in the day. The menu went from looking like a war game to a kids game (my biggest issue so far besides multiplayer missing). The cut scenes alone in the campaign make this game worth it. The cut scenes were outrageous back in the day and were using language not known to many. Getting yelled at by Zod constantly will bring players back to watch more scenes. The actual gameplay consists of an RTS territory capture sort of game. Certain territories allow for buildings to be capture which produce either vehicles or units. Vehicles and sometimes gun turrets are by territory capture flags that definitely the player wants to get to first before the computer does. The more territory a player owns, the quicker their units build. The point of the game is to destroy the enemies fortress. These fortress themselves build units but are limited in what they can manufacture. They may add defensive turrets (gatling or rocket) to bolster defense. More manufacturing options open up as the player progresses. There are robot and vehicle type units. Some robot units include grunts, psychos (rapid weapon firing) and a sniper unit. Vehicle units range from jeeps, light tanks to heavy tanks. Some maps will have jeeps and tanks placed around certain territories. Robot units must enter these vehicles whereas a unit is manufactured to drive the vehicle at the depot. Buildings cannot be placed freely in this game!I would say buy on sale as it is an oldie and it's definitely worth the cutscenes and the gameplay (on sale may I add)! Back in the day, this game would easily deserve a rating of 8! Due to it's age and this dumb concept of porting it from the iPad :RATING : 6.7/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C Overall  C+ "

												I originally purchased this game when it was released in 1996, and it quickly became one of my favorite RTS titles of all time. Z eliminates most of the tedium that usually comes with RTS games, choosing to focus on tactics and management of assets. The gameplay is relatively straightforward. Each map is divided into territories, which the player must capture. Territories contain assets like factories and radar stations. The more territories a player controls, the more quickly their factories produce units. More powerful units require more time to construct. Players must marshal their forces and constantly keep them moving in order to succeed.I was very excited to see this classic title released on Steam, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the RTS genre, robots, and irreverent humor.

It's great to get in the mood again. And if you still like it, even despite the aforementioned downsides - go and get open source Zod Engine[zod.sourceforge.net], which even has multiplayer :)			"

												This game was one of my better memories with gaming while growing up. Obviously, in 15-20 years, standards have gone up, and there are more expectations on games now. However, most older games still have some magic that make them fun to go back to. I was looking forward to this release to go back to Z.Unfortunately, the Z here stands for Zero magic.It's unplayable with the mouse (have to click on the very top of a unit or menu button to select it), if anything but the esc works for the keyboard, I haven't found it, and there is no controller support.There are plenty of negative reviews already for this game, and I don't want to kick someone while theyre down, but I couldn't recommend this to strangers, let alone friends.

												Well, it is the same game as original one (good old 90s :) ).. This could be a good thing and a bad thing. It could be good, because original game was revolutionary in its time (I was kinda bored from c&c and warcraft battle) and still there is not a game like it. It is still fun to play, robots and their communication with you is hillarious. Bitmap Brothers take on RTS game is different and with this kinda gameplay you really have to think strategic to win every level.. Every decision is crucial and makes a different..It could be bad, because I kinda feel tricked when developers don't add anything to this old games. They could at least work on cutscenes, make it hd or something.. They don't add any new thing to game play and it is kinda hard to play in high-res. Robots are too small and mouse arrow is too small to micro-manage everything. You have to select units everytime you need to give them orders. Menus are out of date and not very user-friendly. Also it would be great if you can select the level you want to play (like in red alert 3 or warcraft 3)In conclusion, it is still a great game for the ones who played the original one. It has this nostalgic effect and you enjoy every part of it.. If you didn't play the original one but curious about this one, wait for a sale, so that you don't feel like they are trying to scam you. To enjoy this game be positive and don't try to take the game very serious..			"

												Back in 1996,  I remembered purchasing a retail copy for $50.  Unfortunately I had to return it because my 486 pc couldn't run it.  Now 18 years later,  Z arrived on Steam platform for a sale promo under $6.  I decided to take a stab once more and see what I missed in this classic.  After a few hours of gameplay,  I'm sadden to wasted my money.The AI in this game was infuriating to say the least.  I'm playing on Medium difficulty and had to retry multiple times to beat certain levels.  The computer AI cheats by have better ""luck"".  One time my lone heavy tank was dueling a lone enemy jeep and guess what?  My heavy tank's driver got sniped and the jeep came out victorious.  Another time I noticed the enemy light tanks shot twice as fast causing me to lose the battle which I shouldn't have.      Pathfinding for your units was horrible.  Instead of taking shortcuts,  they prefer to take long routes to their destinations.  Frequently, they often got stuck on obstacles such as white billboards, cliffs, and buildings. Sometimes they never follow your orders.  For example,  I ordered my toughs to blow up a factory but they couldn't comprehend.  The controls were awful as well.  Everytime you issue an order,  the selected unit get deselected.  Sometimes mouse clicks don't respond.Lack of options didn't do the game any justice.  Changing the game speed and video resolution would have been nice.  Game speed felt running at a snail's pace.  The video resolution was probably defaulted at 640x480.  At the replay level on the main menu,  I can't seem to figure out how to play beyond level 5.  Another problem I had were the movie cutscenes.  Not only the visuals didn't age well,  the material wasn't humorous at all.  The story didn't make much sense either.  Most of the cutscenes were played the repeated same scened just with slightly altered dialogue or terrain.  Lazy and lame!Until the developer fixes the game with future updates, it receives  a 4 out of 10.			"

												Broken game. They took original control system (where you select and command units with the same mouse button), which is very outdated, but worked well, and adjustet it (for touch screen?). For example: a) counter-intuitive scroll direction b) no context icons (because touch screen does not know you finger position?). This means you do not know in advance if you will move selected unit or select another close one.c) also due to high resolution its much easier to missclickFor example if you want to send reinforcements: you select a unit, make stupid-scroll to fight area, then click to move... insteed of moving you select fighting unit, you are forced to move it, scroll back, try again, scroll, click, wrong, move fighting unit, counter-intuitive srcoll, select, scroll, try again... In EVERY battle i played i managed to send reinforcements only after all my fighting units where dead. Not funny, not what Z is about.Besides controls the game has every improvement you could dream about for classic Z (resolution, english version available, difficulty levels, and much more). But does it matter? It will be easily the best game you ever played... in case you control your PC with some kind of touch-pad and your monitor has resolution under 640x480. In case you use a mouse: please dont buy and give developers some motivation to make a version for conventional mouse-keyboard-PCs.			"

A big problem appears if an infantry-unit is selected and you drag the cursor over a box of grenades to pick them up (or detonate it with a big mess, if the unit already has got grenades) because the mouse cursor doesn't show you if the infantry-unit will pick it up or detonate it (what normally destroys the infantry-unit also)-Placing a ground-mounted gun is very fiddly and not intuitive (I think because of the touchscreen conversion)-> NO MULTIPLAYER !!!Conclusion:The main negative aspects are huge control-problems and a missing multiplayer mode. If an update fixed those problems (and the other smaller ones) this game would be GREAT, but in its actual state I cannot recommend buying it.			"

												I currently wouldn't recommend the game. I loved Z since I first played it on the PS1 ages ago and I still love it.But this steam version is a bad port from mobile, missing a lot of functionality, still lacking multiplayer and there haven't been any updates in months. Also no word from the devs in months about wether they'll keep updating or not, but currently it looks like they abandoned it, only being interested in a cash-grab with a below average port and getting people nostalgic about this game to buy it.If the devs actually come back and fix some issues, add more functionality (I mean the audio options amount to ""music: on/off, sound: on/off"", come on...) maybe even add multiplayer and/or level editor, I'll recommend this steam version.As it stands, I would rather recommend you to find yourself an original copy of the PS1 or PC version, or look up DOSBox (or portable version of Z) or for possible multiplayer look up zodengine.Edit: The length of the game might also be of concern to some people. As it stands I have around 4-5 hours into the game and fully completed it. Of that, around one hour (maybe more) was spent idling in the menu, although I think it might not have correctly tracked my time, so maybe 1 hour was lost as well.Anyway, the game is rather short, unless you keep failing at the missions. (For some reason I beat every level on the first try, despite having quite some difficulty whenever I tried the older versions, a few years back, but maybe that's subjective).The game lacks the extra missions that the former PC version has (I think they were in that version) and as mentioned above, neither level editor, nor multiplayer. So take into account that this game might only last you 3-8 hours or something along those lines, depending on how ""good"" you are at the game.			"

												I think I can rate this as 50/50. It's really amazing stuff that old games are rereleased in remake versions BUT... yeah, there are always some buts. I should probably start with positive thing and being able to play once again this good old game on modern machines without (probably) any problems is cool. Old players will have some nostalgia attack and maybe there will be new players who will discover what really was ""on top"" many years ago. Saying something about the game itself would be rather pointless, since stuff like ""TWENTY LEVELS FULL OF ROBOTS MAKING BOOM AND BANG WITH EACH OTHER"" wouldn't grab many attention. If you are curious about old stuff just try it and play it - amazing atmosphere on every each of planet, accompanying by funny movie cutscenes and some strategy is what makes Z great.BUT since it's a mobile version, people will have negative attitude toward this game. They changed so many things, made some of them really annoying. They changed main menu for really ugly looking one - to be honest, it would fit for 90% of mobile games. You can't tell it's Z, there are big button everywhere and big annoying ""X"" in upper corner. And this ""X"" is also when cutscenes are playing. ""Look at me, I'm just some poor mobile port"", it's screaming on every move. UI also became something that's really annoying, and there is even stuff you won't probably notice since it's placed in very strange positions, like the number of units. Controlling you units is sometimes also hard. And, which is really important, where is multiplayer option? I guess since it's not in mobile version, because it wouldn't be made on mobile, we won't see it on PC. Really sad. Mobile edition didn't even get an extra missions or ZEditor.I got Z for cheap, so I'm not that much mad. Releasing once again a old version of Z, or some kind of REAL remake, would be amazing but hardly to pull. If you want to have it on Steam, if you want to get some nostalgia, if you really don't mind that's a mobile port - grab it. I had fun but not as much as I would have while playing the original version of Z.			"

Thus unplayable.I would like my £4.99 back, this game is unplayale as the mouse pointer is seemingly randomly offset (although weirdly the x to quit isn't), I reccomend downloading the Zod engine rather than this tripe.I played the origonal back on my 486 and yeah the AI was not amazing and the blue guys were at a ditinct advantage but it was an amazing RTS. I was really looking forward to playing this and alas I can't. There is no apparent fix for the problem and the developer doesn't seem to give a rats behind.			"

												Can't recommend it the CGI cutscenes have dated over the years but the music is to loud to understand what they are saying in them, the gameplay is slower than the PS1 and this is an issue because the units AI is also bugged because they just go in the wrong direction to get to the point I tell them to go to and if they don't do that they go the longer way round resulting in my losing the base or units in the area.There's also a bug in the menu when your in game I turned the music off which then turns off the sound in the CGI scenes but I dont think this is the current devs fault just how it was done from the original devs, shame really as I am a big fan of the PS1 if these things cant be fixed then I'll give it another try.

												One of my all time favorite RTS games! Simple touches like tanks obliterating basic infantry in one hit and lighter vehicles trying to avoid incoming fire on their own. A lot of little touches that still make this game playable today. The aggressive play style you need to adopt to capture territory is the cornerstone of more recent RTS games such as dawn of war and company of heroes. The lack of resource gathering in Z also deserves special mention, capturing territory also captures factories which churn out units after a certain amount of time elapses; this means you can concentrate on the fight rather than gathering minerals.

												Just don't buy this. It's perhaps THE worst port I've ever played. It's been ported from a mobile device version of the game and the interface and controls are plain awful and the game is riddled with bugs, some of which game breaking! It also suffers from having poor resolution and a pretty slow frame rate. Also, the difficulty levels, although adjustable are simply laughable. It's been dumbed down and made as poorly as possible. If you want to play Z again properly, albeit, without cutscenes, download the Zod Engine. It's free and it's an excellent open source version of the game that is better made and runs far better than this. This game should be removed from Steam for being such poor quality. Such a shame as it soils the good name of Z and Bitmap Brothers!			"

												Needs improvement, but it's very similar to the old Z. Similar (if not identical) gameplay, same videos, sounds, music, levels, etc. Most reviews are brutally negative, and although some have good points, others are missing the target. Controls: Yes, indeed, they are weird, but I got used to them very quickly. You select units with left-clik and give orders also left-clicking. When you give an order the unit is unselected but I think the original Z did that too (but not Zod Engine). Orders can also be general, so units will automatically attack, pick up grenades, etc. Right-clicking is used for dragging and creating complex units of different soldiers, vehicles, etc, like in many RTS games you use ctrl + number. It's not true, however, that they stick together forever. If you want to select a unit inside a ""army"" right click that unit, and then you can issue normal orders just to that unit. You can also click an icon in the botton of the screen (looks like two robots) and that will eliminate the complex unit.Oh, if you want to attack the ground (to destroy a bridge, building or just shoot random animals) ctrl+left-click. Improvement: You should be able to pan with wasd or movement arrows. Also, although I don't have much of a problem with them, if you could change controls to be more like a normal RTS that would be an improvement.Zon Engine: Many people have compared this game to the free version Zod Engine. ZE is amazing, but it's a multiplayer experience and is suited for that and for people who like tinkering. Playing with map_list & default_settings you can create almost a new game with your friends, but it's not an engine for new people to Z. In fact, I still don't know how to savegame in ZE (I think you can't) and the original videos aren't there. Heck, even if you lose, you go to the next map. If you want multiplayer (and editing and tinkering) ZE is not only the best, it's the only alternative. However, if you want a single player experience similar (or identical) to the original game, this is pretty close.Other problems: (1) Language. Spanish doesn't work well. Sound is OK, but the menu is in some language I thought was italian but now I don't know if it even exists (easy- > fácil -> ¿Fécil?). Hints and descriptions seem to have been translated by a machine.(2) Better resolutions would be a welcoming improvement but I don't any problems about that and widescreen works well for me.(3) Very minor: Achievements. They are not good (build that unit, finish that level, etc.) but I guess Z doesn't have room for much improvement in that regard.(4) Editor: That would be amazing.(5) Expansion: ZE has the expansion, 11 new levels.

As a kid how could you not love oil swilling robot soldier dudes and as an adult how can you not appreciate the old school vibe, quick simple gameplay that favours all out aggresion and savvy pathing of troop types for satisfying victory in double quick time?

Totally unplayable, not ever remotely enjoyable. I've played flash games with constant flashing effects that use much less cpu and they still feel 10x times lighter and more beautiful.

												This is one out of ten games to take with you to a lonley island. I hesitated not a minute to spend a few Euros to get this game back one my PC, though I still own the Win95 (or was it even DOS)version on CD. It was great to see Captain Zod and his Robots again. One is just in time right back in the middle of the game. Trying hard to capture the sectors before the opponent will in order to get a little advance in production. You don't have to bother with the errection of buildings, but just have to capture those already on the map. They produce new units. They do it the faster the more sectors you own. There is nothing more satisfying than to capture an enemy sector just seconds before a new unit leaves the factory. On the other hand it's deeply frustraiting to loose a sector at that moment. After all- It's still a great game even after all that years and worth every cent.			"

There are 20 levels in the game along with 5 more levels for multiplay mode so in total 25 levels made by bitmap brothers (originally). My point in this dicussion, a while ago I've downloaded a modded version of the game which had additional 20 levels made by the fans of this game! it was impressive!

												Heya!I'm so happy Z has been fixed and released to Steam! I've been looking all over for a fixed Z to play on Windows 7 etc. I grew up with this game so I really appreciates this! Thanks a lot! I have a few fixes/issues you may not have been able to fix yet. All units with explosive weapons aren't able to destroy those small animal houses. Instead they're trying to move next to it and gets stuck. Another issue is that sometimes when robots are trying to fight a gun especially, only one of them are shooting, the rest are just moving on the spot. Another is when you build something and you click on that building you'll have to click ""Ok"" to get that little window off. Last request/issue I can think of now is that you can't press ""Space"" to unmark a unit or check current action if there's one. You always have to target a unit or click on that little icon down the left corner to get to that action. I hope you'll look into it and find a way to fix it. At last I also have two questions. Is there any possibility that there will be a map editor and a multiplayer mode so you can play against/with friends and other people?Best Regards!Tegge			"

												Current reincarnation of Z leaves mixed feelings - old fun cinematics, fast paced gameplay and not that bad AI, but as you play more, many of irritating bugs and moments arise. I'm not sure if those issues were present in original Z, too much time passed since then, but nowadays, unresponsive and clunky controls and slow scrolling drives you mad. Developers really should start to understand that PC and Pad's touch interfaces should be completely separated. Units absolutely love to get stuck in terrain, units' pathfinding skills sometimes simply amaze in their stupidity, and balance is totally shifted to vechicles.Not sure if its worth to buy it at full price, but if you see it on sale, and you are feeling nostalgic, or you'd like get aquainted with old classics, or simply have some lighthearted and quick fun - buy it.

												Bought the game dirt cheap when it was on sale. First time I played it when i was 8 or 9, so, it was a retrospective for me. To anyone who hasn't yet been introduced to this game, i'd suggest you to look away if:- you want as tactical RTS game as C&C, AOE1. This game is slow-paced and doesn't require much hassle and wits to be on top of the game.- you despise college humour from the 80's or consider the movie ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" as a total moodkill. Those cutscenes really set the mood by having these kinds of puns.- you don't like seeing cassettes or hearing some repetitive MIDI tracks ingame.- you hate repetitive levels. There isn't that much of story waiting to be unfolded in this game.Can't say that it's a bad game: it's just mostly about the nostalgic value.  "

												Z was overwhelmingly mindblowing game when it was out in 1996 with its unique tactic mechanic, stylish graphics and hilarious humour. I played it on PS1 in 97-98 or so and had genuinely great impression. In fact, Z was one of the most adorable games of my childhood.It was the reason I have bought it on steam and, looking ahead, I don't regret about it at all.- Yes, they broke unit controls a bit while porting, but any human being still can handle this and I accept it like a part of game mechanic.- Yes, menu navigating is frustrating, but you are not gonna spend your life in menus, ain't you?- Yes, you can switch the game to original funny french language without losing sense of the game and return english any time.- Yes, lots of vehicles, buildings and infantry to capture or to blow.- Yes, it's still good old Z.I can strongly reccomend it to all, who played it in 90-s to refresh memories, and simply reccomend it to everybody else in order to get to know to immortal classic.

												Z is a Real Time Strategy game from 1996, the same year that Diablo and Quake 1 came out, and the Steam release was not a “remastered” or HD version. You get the same game from almost 20 years ago. All the same, Z was never about the graphics, it’s about rapid blitzing to control the map in what is essentially a real time strategy capture the flag game.Z doesn’t really have a story in its campaign. The opening cut scene (all of them actually) is of 2 idiot robots piloting a small space ship around following the instructions of Commander Zod, who is sort of like a drill sergeant robot commanding the red colored army (the enemy is all blue robots).  The cut scenes don’t really have anything to do with the gameplay; they’re just there to add some comic relief between the levels since frantic blitzing can be stressful. In fact, the cut scenes actually repeat themselves several times throughout the campaign, with only minor differences such as background (snow, desert, etc.)In each level, you and your computer controlled opponent start on opposite sides of a square map divided into a rough grid. Each grid has a flag and possibly some sort of unit production factory. When you touch the flag with any of your units, the grid block becomes yours and the factory automatically builds units for you one at a time. A very important note is that the more grid blocks you control, the faster units get produced. This means that you should always grab the flag, even if you can’t hold it, because during the short time you own it, all your other factories are producing slightly faster and your enemy is producing slightly slower. Also, if you manage to capture a flag right before the enemy’s unit is finished building, the unit will come out of the factory on your team, the build clock does not reset. To win the game, you don’t actually need to control all the grid blocks, you just have to destroy the enemy fort, which is a very large factory on the opposite side of the map from you. Of course, if you control the whole map, you’ll be pumping out units fast enough to squash the enemy easily while they have to wait 10 minutes for a measly grunt unit. As for the types of units you can build, there are about 15 all in all, including some base defenses if you would rather turtle in your territories than go out capturing new ones. From my experience though, all you really need are light tanks and toughs (missile infantry). Pros:+Nostalgia! I played this game close to 20 years ago and only ever got to try the shareware. I finally got the chance to finish it. +Some humor, not much, but it helps with the repetitive gameplay. The rapid deployment and almost total focus on offence prepared me for future games like Company of Heroes, where you need to attack, attack, attack. Cons:-The game is damn old, and the graphics are terrible. It’s hard to tell the infantry units apart until you click on them and see the name. Also, the game seems to run at a flat 15 frames per second (just guessing).-Also related to the game’s age: The controls are clunky. Everything is controlled by the mouse left click button. The map scroll is very slow so if you need to move your vision around the map, you need to click on the mini-map or it will take forever.Overall, if you remember Z from the good old days and always wanted to play it, now’s your chance. The game has about 25 Steam achievements and they can all be very easily obtained in one “easy mode” play through. But if you have backlog and a list of games you’ve been wanting to try out, leave Z until later on your list.  "

												The game is a joke. Not only it runs in zoomed low resolution mode, it has low FPS and mouse movement is slow and erratic (17 max fps and cpu load over 50% is unacceptable for such game). Totally unplayable, not ever remotely enjoyable. I've played flash games with constant flashing effects that use much less cpu and they still feel 10x times lighter and more beautiful. Probably a bad port or not optimized. +1 point for starting, +1 point for not crashing while playing, nothing more.Verdict: Avoid at all costs. [2/10] "

												Great strategy game from the 90's (just over 18 years old at the time of writing) that's still a lot of fun to play. I originally owned Z on the PlayStation many years ago but fancied trying it again since it's release on Steam.Took me around 11 hours to complete with each mission taking about 10-15 minutes, so it's ideal for short gaming sessions.The game has some small issues with unit pathfinding & command execution but it takes nothing away from what is a charming & classic RTS.

												Great game but badly ported. Doesnt have any key bindings and has tiring slow mouse controls. Slow scrolling speed and selecting more than 1 unit in a box automatically groups them which can be quite annoying if you want them to spread out.Poor AI and lacking in common sense, some units prefer to use the main roads rather than make bee-lines to the destination or targets. Its a good game with a bad♥♥♥♥♥attitude but if you really want to play Z I suggest you play it on a ps1 emulator and either use a joypad or keyboard.			"

												This is a re-release of the classic RTS Z. The game has no base building. The way you build an army is by capturing territories, which control factories, and the factories automatically produce units on a timer. There are no different races either, it's pretty much a robot army civil war. The game is known for its tense pace and high difficulty. Finishing this game back in the day was something to really brag about in the schoolyard. You need to move fast and intelligently pick which units to send where and against what. Bunching up your entire army early in the game and just going from flag to flag will lead to certain defeat, so you need to split each squad, jeep and tank and choose which territories to grab first and how to proceed from there. This makes the gameplay feel very dynamic. Each map of the campaign plays very differently as well.Things to be aware of: There is no multiplayer, only a campaign (which is however very well designed). There is no skirmish mode. It runs on Win 7 just fine. They have not reworked the resolutions, so during gameplay 60% of your screen is covered by black bars. They have added difficulty selection, which was not there in the original version. Scrolling the map feels a bit sluggish and weird sometimes. The controls are right click to select units/group up units and left click to make them move/attack (might feel a bit confusing if you are used to Blizzard controls). You cannot rebind anything. Conclusion: Z is considered a classic for a reason. It's a very tense and challenging strategy game which plays great even today. This is a reissue, not a remake, it works well on modern operating systems, but don't expect anything more. However, I think that for 5 euros it is definitely worth getting and playing through the campaign, so I will give it a thumbs up.			"

												This game is great fun, but it's clearly a port over from the Mac touch screen game. For the price, it can't be beat especially for a 19 year old game.  Missing is the multiplayer function, which needs to be added.  Also in the original Dos version of the game you could select units with the left mouse button and quicklly send them to a rally point, now its on the right button which feels just weird.  All in all with some minor fixes and if multiplayer is added, this game will be an RTS contender.			"

												Mixed results.They clearly used the original content and didn't try to re-vamp it or anything. Personally I think that is good, it is very close to the original, however, you can clearly tell that it is a mere port from the IOS version, it handles almost exactly like it would as if it was on a tablet. This can make clicking and scrolling a bit annoying from time to time but overall I think they did a good job.Really happy to see a classic brought to the forefront. Unfortunately the game is way way shorter than I remember. Finished all 20 missions in like 2 hours max, roughly 7-10 minutes per level (on easy)There are a couple of graphical issues such as incorrect portraits (Phychos having lasers portraits and vice versea) but otherwise it runs fine. Although the AI/path finding seems to be a bit weird when trying to cross terrain with little rocks or stuff on it, most of the time they just pass over it which is intended but sometimes they refuse to move as if they are stuck in the mud.Fun game, brings back the nosalgia feelings as im guessing it was intended. 7/10 worth playing but only if you can get it for say $5			"

												Z has to be one of the best computer games ever made. It has good gameplay coupled with a sense of humour. I loved it when it came out and bought the Platinum edition way back in 1997. It cost $79.95 and came with Z X-tra, Z T-shirt, Z keyring, Z pin badge and a Z mouse mat. Good value in those days. I've just bought it on Steam for $5.59 and played through the first two missions and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This version is still a lot of fun and I don't really understand why so many people are complaning about it. I have a 27 inch monitor and the graphics look fine to me. I nearly didn't buy it because of the bad reviews here but I'm glad I listened to my inner self and bought it. It really doesn't play or look that bad considering how old it is. As for The Zod engine, sure it's free but I don't think it has been updated since 2011 and it doesn't have the humour that Z has. (I might be wrong about the Zod engine but I can't find any update after 2011). There is no multi player as on the original Z but the single player campaign is a blast, I always play it on the hard setting and it is very hard to beat some of the later levels. Recommended.			"

With the addition of easy achievements and Steam Trading cards, what's not to love about it!Z is about Red Vs. Blue robots in a ""Capture The Flag"" style conquest, with buildings automatically building units on timers. Battle on different planets, and that's about it. Funny humor is also included.My only major complaint that there is no keyboard controls (at least that I can see) and the new UI is from a Mobile Port, but it's still the same game that I know and love. People complain about the AI path finding, but it's exactly the same from what I can remember.

												Es una review complicada, la verdad.Z, publicado en 1995, es un RTS frenético que rompió con los esquemas clásicos en su momento, y sigue siendo innovador hoy en día (es posible que Dawn of War y Company of Heroes sean lo más parecido).El concepto básico es muy sencillo: Comenzamos con unas pocas unidades (infantería y vehículos), y el mapa está repartido en áreas controladas por banderas. Las unidades pueden capturar estas áreas, y en ellas hay edificios que nos permiten construir más tropas con las que poder superar a nuestro oponente. La velocidad de construcción de las unidades depende directamente del nº de territorios que controlemos, por lo que darse prisa y cubrir el máximo área posible (sin esparcirse demasiado para evitar dejar huecos en la defensa) es fundamental.Yo ya había jugado al juego en su momento, y en general esta versión (una adaptación de un port de iOS según parece) es fiel al original, incluso añadiendo doblaje en castellano (desactivable, phew).Desgraciademente, esta versión ha introducido muchas cosas que resultan confusas y que, a menos que la memoria me falle, no estaban en el juego original, y creo que lo han roto, motivo de que mi review sea negativa:* Han optado por un HUD flotante, mostrándose por encima de la pantalla, en lugar del típico marco que tenía el clásico. Esto no tendría nada de malo si no fuese porque el minimapa ocupa tanto espacio en pantalla que los edificios y unidades en la zona inferior derecha de la pantalla quedan totalmente inutilizables a menos que ocultemos el minimapa. Error garrafal, se hubiese solucionado añadiendo un poco de borde fuera de la zona de juego para poder seguir haciendo scroll por ejemplo.* La IA de las unidades a pie está muy rota. No es sólo que se atasquen si la ruta es complicada (probablemente esto lo hiciesen también en el original), ¡es que la unidad líder de la patrulla ni siquiera dispara por muchas órdenes directas que le des! En un grupo de 3 unidades, sólo 2 dispararán, en un grupo de 2, sólo una, y si sólo queda una, pues adios muy buenas. Esto hace que los tiroteos con las unidades a pie sean una tómbola. Afortunadamente esto no sucede con los vehículos.* Sólo se usa un botón del ratón (por ser un port de ios), y por lo que he visto no hay manera de deseleccionar una unidad a menos que sea eligiendo a otra o dandole una orden (se deseleccionan tras darles una). Es posible que esto estuviese en el original, pero en cualquier caso esto ha provocado decenas de órdenes de atacar un edificio propio, cuando lo que quería era elegirlo para cambiar su producción.En resumen, el juego sigue siendo tan original y frenético como siempre, y ha envejecido bien (excepto los videos), pero la adaptación/remasterización ha introducido errores que entorpecen la experiencia hasta el punto de romper el juego.

Trying to spread or acquire empty vehicle when You have grouped Your troops - good luck with that... Much annoyance and headache material. Could fix bridge only on the first mission when Crane was introduced. Last troop running for an empty Heavy Tank, which could save Your game, ooh, empty Crane on Your way to HT - gets in the Crane automatically, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ troop... You will actually have to struggle to play this game.

												Z is an old school RTS(RealTimeStrategy Title) which can still be fun, if you're ""retro-affine"" and have no problem with old graphics and one or two gameplay slip(like a non optimized control-setup).Con:+No base building. I see it as a pro because it's not generic in its approach and manages to do something different in a good fashion: You have to build/order units(since here your time is your resource) to occupy more buildings on the map which either can order different or more units or have another positive trait for you. The one who does it faster has an advantage. From my experience some Warhammer games have the same system, so experience its ancestor!+The Visuals still hold up in my point of few. Sure it got old but its style is coherent and presented in a funny and enjoyable way.+The mini-skits in between each mission. They range mostly from funny to hilarious and the only downside is the horribly small resolution(since they are rendered) and repetitivity(since there is only a handful of unique situations).Con:-Repititivity: Since there are only that many different units and about a handful of different planets it gets stagnant really fast, especially if you want to play through it in a couple of sittings(which is possible).-Sometimes it's just too easy, although it can be enjoyable for some to annihalate your foe.-There is always just one different player, so just 1v1. -The price! I mean sure it can be enjoyable for a couple of hours but that's no reason to charge nearly 10€ for it! Especially since the game is about 20 years old... So in the process you pay more for the achievements/trading cards... -.--It's too short, I think I played through it in about 5 or 6 hours. If they charge for it they could atleast add a couple of modes/more levels or units or mechanics. Ideas/Final statement:Either charge one € or two if you just add a DOSbox for steam with achievements or add new content. It feels like a ripoff at full price, even if it can be quite enjoyable.Although I liked it quite a bit I can't give it a thumbs up, since not everyone who likes RTS is going to enjoy this, too.Thanks for reading!

												I read the negative reviews, and like everyone else I'm luke warm about a tablet port of a great game wihtout proper consideration of the needs of PC owners.Having actually bought it I can tell you that enough of the original ""fun factor"" remains for it to be worth it though. I dare say if I went up to the attic and found my CD copy from the 90's, ran dosbox or equivalent, sorted out the drivers and set the XMS memory allowance up properly I could have a more authentic experience.  However, much as I may be nostaligic about the ""good old days"" of DOS gaming the reality is that I'm just not going to find time to do all that these days, being maried with 2 children and a full time job.As a way to relive a bit of my youth, albeit slightly flawed, this is worth the money to me.

Dear General Zob......for a nostalgic feeling it’s just about worth it for a trip down memory lane. Z in general successfully attempts to show that real-time strategy can be done differently. I personally played it back in 1997 on PS1. For those who have never played Z, it's unfortunately a bad port from the original and they should search for the better free port called ""Zod Engine project"" with Multiplayer.Z The Game For PC Official Gameplay Trailer HD

												This is a poor mobile port of an old pc game.IntroductionYour purpose is to capture territory to build infantry and vehicles so that you can destroy the opposition's fort.  Territories may contain factories, radars, or repair stations.  There are no resources to capture, so units are continuously made after a few minutes.  The more territories you capture, the faster the units are made.Gameplay depth consists of destroying and repairing bridges, destroying buildings, destroying terrain walls, having infantry cross water, and placing turrets.Vehicles consists of jeeps (which can shoot out infantry in vehicles and turrets), light/medium/heavy tanks, APCs, and missile launchers.Infantry consists of grunts, psychos (slightly upgraded grunts), toughs (anti-vehicle), snipers (anti-infantry and anti-turret), pyros (upgraded psychos), and lasers (upgraded snipers).Turrets consist of gatlings (anti-infantry), guns (anti-vehicles), howitzers (long-range guns), and missiles (double fire power).Points:- You give orders on a one-at-a-time basis.You select units, give an action, and the game then deselects the units.  Units do not stay selected after giving orders.  You can not deselect units unless you are giving orders or selecting other units.  This gets troublesome when you try to select a building right after selecting a unit or if you change your mind.- Selecting multiple units groups them, and the only way to ungroup is to not click on one of the units, but to click and drag to select one of the units.There are no control groups.  Your only other option is to cycle through your units.- A.I. pathfinding is poor.Units can get stuck on small dens on the terrain.  In the original pc version, these were destructible, but here they are not.  Units may also sometimes take longer routes around obstacles instead of taking the shortest path.  I think they are prioritizing roads over rough terrain.- The feedback/tutorial is inadequate.The game says that you can destroy buildings and bridges, but it does not say that you had to click on specific parts to do so.  You can destroy the opposition's fort, but you have to click on the tower bit.  It also does not tell you that you can enter the enemy's fort to blow it up.  To destroy bridges, you have to click on the edge, or you will get the wagging finger of denial.  There are no issues for other buildings though.- Clicks are not responsive in the menus.This might be a result of the game being ported, but you have to click at a certain speed to have the game read it as a click.  Luckily, there is no issue in-game.- The resolution breaks at 1920x1080 fullscreen resolution.The other resolutions are fine.- The same cutscenes appear before and after every level.They are skippable, but they are pointless.  There should at least be an option to disable them.+ The only good thing is the humorous death dialogues.ConclusionWhile the original was a decent game, this steam version suffers from a lot of quality of life issues.  This is a result of both being a mobile port and being an old game.  While the concept is decent, this game really needs to be updated to be able to be played well today.			"

												Oh, good-old Zod. Takes you back in time, when hard drive space was still measured in megabytes and the game industry was not only about graphics...The game itself is a true masterpiece. But this port is terrible.First of all, it lacks mouse pointers, the abscence of which will often cause your units to damage facilities instead of interacting those for repairs or changing production.The other thing is the interface itself, which is finger-oriented, though I just can hardly imagine this port being really playable on phones, tablets or just touchscreened laptops.But the worst is the AI, which is just incredibly dumb. The shown generated waypoints look fine, but the units themselves can't even handle going around buildings quite often.This game surely brings back wonderful memories, but then they get stepped on with a dirty soaked ugg of modern gaming industry.P.S. If you love quality old games - do bother playing the original version (VIA DosBox or whatever).			"

Wrong! but alot of fun all the same the game has widescreen surpport  looks very nice at 1900x1200 plays very smooth the sound and voice acting is very good for such an old game This is Z how it was ment to be played....ONE issue i have is no volume control as i use USB powered speakers even on the lowest voulume it is very loud and no way to change it in options byt for £3.99 it is a steeal Grab yourself a bargin			"

												Z was initially released by the Bitmap Brothers in 1996, and overshadowed by the titans from 1995, Command & Conquer and WarCraft II. Back at that time, Real-time Strategy games were still trying to break new ground and each was trying to innovate in its own way. Which meant exciting games with their own spin on the formula... but still a lack of an established ""great user interface/RTS controls"".Z innovated with a map divided by areas to capture, and no base building. The unit factories are pre-determined on the territories, meaning that no two maps will play the same.An usual RTS goes like this: gather ressources, build an army, conquer. In Z, the player has to start by quickly capturing territories and key vehicles around to provide the next reinforcements and establish dominance on the map, and be attentive to any hole in the enemy defenses. Some games can go very quickly with a Blitzkrieg leading to a snowballing advantage and victory within 5 minutes, while some games can lead to a standoff where both armies will have to build up some firepower.The result is a very gripping and dynamic game, in which every single tactical decision counts. Without base building, the player is directly in the action. There is not much of a story to talk about, but the atmosphere of the game is quite endearing with robots commenting on the action or talking to the player (also with each type of robot having their own AI, from stupid to clever, reflected in their in-game decisions), very nice and bright graphics, and many cutscenes. Overall, Z is a unique and fun RTS, that only suffers from controls that are a little bit outdated. The interface is not great, and it can make the player feel like the computer has the advantage to be able to be everywhere at once.However. As much as I like Z itself (and not the terrible sequel, Steel Soldiers), and being able to play it on modern systems with a high resolution, this port is technically bad and plagued with issues. The AI can be worse than the original with robots getting stuck in position (especially if a bridge is destroyed), the scroll speed is so slow that I ended up using only the minimap to navigate (WASD or arrow keys would have been my preference for movements in a specific area), the interface has not been improved (really a pain to scroll through all the available units that a factory can provide until choosing the one we want, there is no rally point for factories and no queue order whatsoever) and there are still the clunky old RTS controls that were so imperfect before StarCraft, the menus are terrible (don't forget to save when you start a mission, I was not able to scroll down in the mission select menu), there is no multiplayer (for multiplayer, check out the open source remake named Zod Engine). The only substantial addition, besides the resolution, is the possibility to select a difficulty level.I find that Z is a great game that would have deserved a better port, and controls more suited to modern standards. I am very mixed on this recommendation...			"

												Seems ppl are to used to the flash and stars in thier eyes when buying games these days, this game was made like 15 years ago  i think, and you are moaning about some bugs from the port, pfff guys, just click exit then restart that lvl not hard and not like it takes more than 5-15 mins to complete a given lvl on this game.The bugs are not server wide in the sense that everyone wont get them, i have not got a single bug since playing, the clicking of units will take abit of getting used to but other than that ive found this to be the same game it used to be, and i only played the demo back all those years ago and i played that demo * 1 lvl * about 100+ times, i didnt play the game till another 5-8 years later, or atleast i tried to after paying £20 to buy the pc verson that didnt work :( In short, buy the game if you loved the first version, if there is bugs who gives a crap they can patch those out in no time, and lets be honest its £4.. i didnt even blink when i see that price i honestly expected it to be about £10.I played 3 hours last night, 3 hours after i was ment to be in bed, and it was so worth it!

Cons: > No ability to control volume of the sound and music ( Only Turn Off or On )> Pathfinding system feels somewhat broken> Movies Have no sound? when you turn off the music > Feels like a Smart Phone Game Conclusion: I don't feel let down or overwelm either.. It would be nice to see it having Multiplayer and more controls in the menu like volume control or even to change resolutions.It gets a 7.5 / 10 from me, it's one of the those games you can pick up and play!

												Clearly this version of Z has some subtle changes from the 1996 version. However, even though Z doesn't have an upgrade for Hi-Res graphics and resolutions. Z itself is still fun.  Forget about what the others say here as this game with or without much needed upgrades is still a blast to play.  Clearly, this version of Z is a port from iOS versions but I like what I see even though some control freedom has been taken away.  Once you understand how Z operates it's easy pickings as you play through the campaign and laugh at those cheeky cheesey comedy cutscenes.  Who needs multiplayer?  Back in my day Z was fun for it's campaign not it's MP mode.  Yes, an MP mode would have been nice but it's very understandable why it's omitted here.  Z is highly recommended here if you're looking for some great single player fun with some extra cheesey comedy added.			"

												Classic Z in all it's original fast-paced territory conquering glory...though not quite.Wonky, bewildering, iOS inspired controls and interface seriously let it down. If a more robust, modern control scheme were implemented, at the very least, then I can give this a more enthusiatic recommendation. I'm fluctuating between recommending it and not. Z is one of those classic games worth experiencing. But...those controls, man. Those controls...***However! Since the recent update, Z is now more playable. Okay, so it's just an inversion of the existing control scheme, but at least it feels more familiar and not like playing twister with my fingers, being too used to modern mouse-mapping and all. Prattling aside, Z is an enjoyable game. Played it before? Play it again. Never played it? Check it out. You might just enjoy it. The overall classic gameplay is still here; fast, relentless combat and territory control requiring you to be constantly alert. The moment you switch off is when it all goes wrong. Even the music tells you so! Whether battering your foe to smithereens or suffering sustained losses, the music adjusts tone and tempo. The only other game that immediately comes to mind with contextual music cues based on how you're doing is Red Alert 3.With the arsenal balanced equally between player and enemy, it becomes more a case of skill and (in some cases) luck. Random factors can ultimatly lead to success or failure. Such as the probability of your tank shell hitting that enemy tank before he does you in. Or taking your precious Heavy Tank on a rampage against a squad of meek infantry, only for the driver to poke out and get himself nailed by that out of reach Sniper, leaving the tank free to be captured. Thinking of sending that lone Grunt against that Medium Tank? Pfft, no way! He says. It's that kind of charm and random, unpredictable gameplay elements that makes Z shine. And sometimes frustrating.Unlike most RTS games where your infantry are sworn, come hell or high water, to attack whatever target you tell them to, Z gives you the finger reminding you: soldiers can be cowards, or jackasses...even if they are robots. Sometimes the AI (no pun intended) can struggle with pathfinding, or not quite do what you want them to do. It functions more than it fails. You don't need to always tell the robots what to do, if you tell them to go to point A, they will have the good sense to attack any enemies along the way...sometimes.Singleplayer is enjoyable enough. The jokes kinda feel outdated, but I still get a grin out of the quips produced from the FMVs and in-game scenarios. General Zod, would you mind blowing that HQ up to heavy metal and a machinegun please? Thank you. If a patch for multiplayer (and/or skirmish) is added in a future update, or *shudder* DLC...then it'll greatly extend the longevitiy of this release. At the moment, I struggle to see myself playing beyond the campaign otherwise, same to any other players.From a technical aspect, the retro chip tunes, remixed slightly, unless my hearing is failing me, don't feel out of place. But some more graphics customisation options wouldn't go amiss. Higher resolutions maybe? The interface looks amateurish as well - it could do with some TLC. What was wrong with the classic interface? What works on a tablet, won't necessarily translate as well onto a desktop PC.I'm sure this classic title can only get better if the developers keep true to their word. But for now, I can enjoy Z again, and so should you!			"

												Pretty classic game, an excellent take on tug-of-war.  Unfortunately, the control system seems to have been taken out of the mac version, which makes reacting quickly annoying as hell. Like... REALLY annoying.  It's the one thing that almost makes this a 'do not recommend'.Controls aside... If you liked the original and want a blast from the past that just works without having to♥♥♥♥♥♥around? Yeah, buy this one. If you loved the original to the point of being willing to download pirate/modded copies and♥♥♥♥♥♥around with them, then avoid this version because it'll make you spit blood.			"

												I feel like I've been transported back in time.  To the days of yore, when people had to know MS-DOS commands or pray to god that their family bought a PC running Windows 95.  Sure it's a port, but damn it's still a good game.  Some people spent 1996 playing much more famous games that came out around the same time.Games like: Civilization II, Duke Nukem 3D, Pokemon Red and Green, Resident Evil, Mario 64, Crash Bandicoot, Metal Slug, Super Mario RPG, Quake, NIGHTS into Dreams, Star Ocean, Daggerfall, Command & Conquer Red Alert, Tomb Raider, Donkey Kong Country 3, Area 51, or Diablo...I spent most of my year fighting alongside Zod.Fun fact:  1996 is the same year Valve was founded.

												Alright were to start off I have always LOVED the Original Z form Bitmap Brothers and is STILL my favourite game of all time and still have the disk :DThis remake I don’t think is too bad but there are some things I think the original has done so so much better. -The map feels really in your face I know you can minimize it to the bottom right but if you click the X it really should stay minimized unless you want to bring it back up again possibley in the menus.-The Massive X’s I know that this was sort of a port to PC from handhelds and tablets but I think you guys should at least clean it up and make it more Z’ish or maybe even remove them all together. -The X’s during cut scenes should be removed surly by pressing space or escape should be enough to end the cut scene and get straight back into the action.-The screen before the battle I feel should go back to the original.-Id really like to see the original main menu be brought back and updated if possible-The green buttons on the bottom left might be best to change them to the original and maybe even the menu  button instead of having it as a pause.-When pressing the pause button to bring up the menu I’d like to still see the game not taken to a different page kind of what the original did.-Gun placement should I also believe needs to be redone by having the gun you are trying to place becoming the pointer.-Guns if you select and want them to focus on a target far away should be brought back like the original.- I’ve noticed that the light tank seems fires from the hatch instead of the turret. (jeep,  medium, heavy so far seem to be okay haven’t go far enough yet to see the mo missile).-The players AI units don’t seem to be very smart (snipers, toughs, grunts) the rest seem to be okay so far.-Buildings if destroyed seem to have lost their  textures.Some Features id really like to see: Level builder and be able to share your maps on the steam workshopMultiplayer is a MUSTThats all i can really think of so far			"

												UPDATE #2 (August 15th, 2014): The game has seen mayor improvements since it first lauched. The controls have been improved a lot, the graphics look better. and the game now plays a lot more like the original. I can now safely recommend this to everyone. Thanks a lot to the dev team for sticking to this port and listening to the fans.UPDATE #1 (July 11th, 2014): Played the game with the first update. The control scheme has improved now that the mouse buttons have been re-mapped.Still needs to improve the pathfinding though, robots and vehicles will often take slow or impractical routes when you give them an order. They drive into buildings and sometimes this makes them easy targets during combat.I'm thankful for the team working on fixes. Hopefully, the experience will keep improving.-----I've been waiting for someone to rerelease Z on computers for a while. This is one of those games I spent entire nights playing as a child, even if I was terrible at it. It's really nice to see it again after so long.Nostalgia aside, this port needs some work. Right from the start you notice this was ported straight from some tablet version. The mouse basically acts as a finger, which means clicking and dragging with the left button is interpreted as scrolling the map and menus. This can be cumbersome in battle, as some left clicks won't register correctly. In a frantic battle, this may cost you some units. You need to use right clicks to select several units, but you can only give commands with left clicks. The controls could use some fine-tunning for a better experience.I'm also having some weird video glitches. Whenever I select a soldier for the first time in the map, their status pop-up appears and the entire screen goes black. I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but it's very annoying. I have to play with those pop-ups disabled. The mini-map works, though.Finally, I'm disappointed there's no multiplayer enabled. As a kid I couldn't play online, so I missed that part of the experience. Hopefully it's not too late to add that feature in a patch? Otherwise this game will run out very quickly.So, in conclusion, Z is as good a game as always, but I'm hoping this port gets some attention to make it better on PCs. If you're not willing to deal with the quirky controls, you might have to hold on until it gets fixed.			"

												It may have been OK five hundred years ago when it came out, but the only people who will enjoy it now are people who have already played it before and are looking for nostalgia. The screen scrolls up and down very very slowly so the only way to jump around the view is by clicking the mini map. It was also void of any challenge, or fun for that matter. I completed three or four stages with almost no effort. I don't see why this is considered a cult classic. More like the half eaten chicken sandwich that the homeless guy finds in the dumpster and has for dinner along with a quarter of a can of pabst blue ribbon he finds in the alley but drinks anyway despite the risk of aids because he doesn't care because it was his raging alcoholism that lost him his job and family and put him in this position in the first place.

												This game is a classic back from 1996. For me personally it brings back memories!The objective of Z is to destroy your opponents Command Fort or killing all the enemy units. The Unique RTS style game is created because you build no actual buildings (you can place turrets around your zones). The game is focused on you capturing and holding zones down for unit production. The more zones, the faster each of your zone buildings will produce. Be carefull though as if the enemy capture before the unit is built they get to have it!The game is fun to play put does have some pro's and cons from the original Z and from other RTS games.Pro's:- It is a classic!- Easy game style- Mission guides for the start of each mission- Unique RTS- End game progression steps up difficulty and adds more unit types- Blowing grenade stacks up and seeing debris destroy stuff. more games need this!- Difficulty settings can be increased to make it harder- Achievements and badgesCon's:- The units seem to spread out way to much (over the original)- Some units will just stop on a wall and not move till you redirect them- Blowing bridges up and having a unit on the other side will glitch the CPU to have units on the other side of the bridge doing nothing. This also never happened in the original- Units will travel by road even when it is not the fastest or most direct route- Limited replayability- Units can be stuck in the enemy fort and not blow it up- Right click? what is this... - No unit groupings via numbers you click and drag which auto groups unitsOverall alot of the Negitives are because of the era this game was made verus the current RTS. I will continue to love the game and still play it!			"

												I was happy to see a update of this game, being a big fan of the original back in the DOS days.  It looks just like the original, the only real problem is the horrible controls.  Scrolling around the map is a pain, and there are no keyboard short cuts (eg. M = move, TAB to select next unit, Delete to remove unit from group etc.) all mouse movements are pretty much exact opposite of what comes naturally.  The ""inverse controls"" are only worse.  The controls are so frustrating, they take away from the gameplay, it's a shame really.Please fix controls and it would be recommened, until then I wouldn't buy.			"

												What an absolute blast from the past!  I remember playing this many years ago and I absolutely loved it - when it came to Steam I snapped it up straight away and wasn't disappointed.  Yes, there have been a few niggles with the AI as I believe the whole codebase had to be rewritten, but what game from that era was perfect?  The devs did a very good job working this game into what it is today, and I love it just as much now as I did then.			"

												A classic RTS but direct port from iOS. Unique strategy gameplay and humour is good just like the past old version. However the ported game has it's problems. Poor controls as you are entitled to a few keyboard buttons and the mouse. There is no way to customize your controls. Scrolling the map is difficult and organizing the units are troublesome. There is also path finding issues. However, the game is still enjoyable despite these drawbacks.			"

												This brings back some good memories. Used to play this day in day out with friends.... The good ol'  days.Can't recommend this game to new players, but If you played this game 18 years ago.. it's worth a shot for old times sake.			"

												Got the game, played level one, level two is a black screen.Clears local content and re-installs, still a black screen even when trying to load saves/first level.Loved the game as a child, but this isn't what I grew up playing so I wouldn't recommend it. Like others have said? Go with the Zod engine. You'll enjoy it a lot more.			"

												Laser up Grunts just Run away its to Tougth to recommend this Howitzer if your a Psyco then you might just Jeep at the chance to feel as if your eyeballs are being Gattlinged out of the back of your skull. But Based on my opinion I'd rather get ran over by a Tank and shot with a Missile Launcher.Than attempt to play this, just another money grab here folks. [BAD Port]This was the first ever game I completed on PC way back in the day, The Original is a Master Piece along with the likes of Chaos Engine [Amiga], Now they where some classy Bitmap Bros. ReleasesBut like many others on here this is a terrible port.You CANT group Units,You CANT make units go to specified location on build,Com is artificial inflated on difficulty, U fire same number of shots, the coms just gona keep chugging away.Units get stuck and don't attack one another.NO multi-player SERIOUSLY????[Killer in this day and age shows the level of programming and lack of dedication,The Original game came out in 1996 so show we don't have the same quality of game creation as 19 years ago [Head Shake] how can this be?

												My critisms to the game...[FIXED] 1. The mouse controls are backwards. [FIXED]This issue has been fixed with the latest update. There are some minor sensitivity issues... but I can forgive those.[FIXED] 2 . The videos are stretched in a widescreen-styled box. [FIXED]This issue has finally been fixed with the latest patch.[FIXED] 3. No video settings of any kind. [FIXED]They have added video settings in with the latest patch.Please fix these issues as they are really hindering this port.[UPDATE]With the mouse fix... I have updated my review. But I still can't recommend this port to anyone. I also have to add one more issue with this port.4. Lack of multiplayer.Now I'll admit I may have only played the multiplayer 20% of the time when I played this game originally. But I still liked to fire it up every now & then. The current lack of multiplayer really effects any sort of recommendation. Why was this cut when the game on steam is being touted as the definitive version? If a bunch of fans can create a multiplayer port for free like the Zod Engine... then surely a professional studio should be able to do it as well... right? Currently... besides this game... I have the Zod Engine installed. Multiplayer works great on it & I enjoy a small match every now & then. Either way, if this port is not going to have multiplayer, the word 'definitive' should be removed from the description as it is a false statement.[UPDATE 2]I have updated my review & most of problems I have had with the game have been fixed. The game still lacks the all too important multiplayer & the extra levels from the Z95 edition of the game to truly be called definitive edition. But even with all that in mind... as it stands now... I can recommend the game now. The developers have been really cool about listening to user complaints & such.[UPDATE 3]After a good length of time, I decided to go over my review of the game. I love the singleplayer portion of the game. Always have. But the lack of multiplayer & the extras levels in the Z Expansion (Z95) really hinder this game a great deal. I believe that after this length of time... the devs will not be adding either. That's unfortunate as this game really needs these two elements & it looked like the devs were going to as they were really responsive during the begining. As such, I've changed my recommendation to no.			"

												It's great that I can play 'Z' again on Windows 10 but there are some omissions that prevent it from being a faithful re-creation and some new additions which some have not been implemented that great. So the game itself, which the base formula remains untouched in this re-release- Brilliant RTS with a different formula compared to other RTS's out there especially for when it was released. There's no base building instead however,  you capture territories around the map with each territory containing one of the following: Vehicle Factory, Robot factory, Radar or nothing. There's no currency, instead, units are created by time, when the countdown reaches zero, the unit appears out of the factory, the more territories that you control the less time it takes to create a unit. As the game advances you gain access to more powerful units but the more powerful ones take more time so it's a case of trying to balance your army, do you wait longer for the more powerful units or build quicker weaker units?The effects are nice with explosions going off each time a vehicle is destroyed or some of the scenery is destroyed. The vehicles are nicely animated with each unit having its own distinctive look, my favourite is the Heavy Tank. There is some comedy in the game but the game was originally made by a British company called the Bitmap Brothers (Chaos Engine) so some may not get the jokes or the humour.Now the re-release. The menu has lost its rustic charm, the original had this metal rust dashboard but now it has been replaced by a bland image and dull plain grey buttons. There used to be an announcer which would praise you or even taunt you when you were losing, that appears to now have been removed. The minimap has been replaced by a very intrusive map located in the bottom right corner which covers a large portion of the screen, mimising it down presents really really tiny minimap which is too small  to effectively use. The UI has been changed which looks like something tailored for touchscreen users, a lot of charm has been lost. Maybe one good additon is inclusion of different difficulty levels, the original may have put a lot off because some stages were quite difficult, some even lost on the very first level.If there was any other easy way of playing Z on modern systems I would not recommend this version but as it stands, if you're feeling nostalgic or just want to play a cheap great RTS then pick this up.

												I bought this game out of nostalgia. There is nothing here but that. This is a RTS without the base building. Instead you start with a HQ and need to take the other areas with factories/Radars/land. In the beginning they are all neutral but as you conquer one side your opponent conquers the other. Soon you will be entwined in a hug with no happy ending. One huge flaw with this version of the game is the fact that to move around the map you must use your mouse against the edges. That is crazy. In the beginning it’s just slightly annoying but later on it will kill you. I’ve lost because I couldn’t look around fast enough. I can’t see what’s going on and it takes forever to get backup because of this. Another player mentioned that you can use the smaller map in the corner for fast ""traveling"" your gaze upon the battlefield. The map is small though and it does not work as well as the map in say Age of empires. The areas are not that big either so the function to use the keyboard for navigation is really something this game should have.The game has no story to talk about and the variation is in how the map looks, how much harder your enemies are and what units you can train. There is not much here but without the major map flaw I might tell nostalgic people to get it. Now I must tell you all to keep your distance.I must admit though that the nostalgia is strong with this one.			"

												Oh my god i am young again. For everyone who thinks it is just a port from the mobile version, wrong. Z is a stone old game  i remember it playing it when i was 5 or 6 and i am 27 now and even back then the game was not that new back then. There is little to no story and the game can be brutal and unfogiving with not a big chanche of a comeback once you fall back but it is still a buch of fun. Matches are short and fast enough so that it don't feel to punishing when you lose and it has great variety of units, besides it is almost truly balanced since both sides have the same forces and many maps are mirrored. If you in for some old school strategy fun with hilarious cutscenes you could do far worht then spending 7 € on this game from the past			"

												Small and fun tug o war rts where your buildings produce units automatically and your mission is to capture territories to conquer buildings, produce more units (grunts, snipers to steal vehicles, jeeps, tanks, defense guns and more) and overwhelm your enemy. Not sure if mobile port.It's fine but the graphics aren't spectacular (if you care about that sort of thing).			"

												Fantastic and nostalgic strategy game from my youth. there is some small changes to the gun placements and spawning units around the forts, otherwise its all the same. Im hoping for frequent updates though, there is still some content missing with addional maps, multiplayer, original menus and some minor things that needs to be attended, for example the responsive mouse coursor. I will forever love this game			"
