Early Access Review
								This game is NOT new. Divine Souls was originally supposed to be released in 2010 for the North American and Europe regions by a small game hosting company named Outspark. This is the same company that held on to ""Fiesta Online"" for several years before discarding it and letting a new unknown company have complete ownership of it. Divine Souls was supposed to be an action RPG that would rival ""Dragon Nest"" and ""Vindictus"" which got few people (including myself) looking forward towards it. However, the game was mysteriously canceled for release and the dicussion forums for the game were completely deleted. There was no word given out for why this happened, but it did. It's cancellation left me disapointed but then I went to play Dragon Nest and forgot about this game.Now 4 years later I see it on Steam as ""EARLY ACCESS"". Early access? It's been four years since this game's disappearance, what happened? Four years ago they planned to release this game in this stage? Honestly Divine Souls is terrible. It's as if it was supposed to be made in 2005 with it's sloppy controls, terrible animations, outdated gameplay and awkward battle system. It claims itself to be in early access but there's no way of improving something that was originally planned to be released at this stage. This horrible stage.Basically Divine Souls is a game made for the year 2005 that was supposed to be released on 2010, dropped midway through development four years ago and just got picked up by some indie team who got it on Steam somehow. We all know ""Omer from MMOHUT.com"". Go watch his video review for this game which was made during the actual release date.			"

Early Access Review
								As far as I'm aware of, this game has been released before under a different publisher. However, a move to a differen publisher doesn't exactly save a game. This was an interesting and unique concept for MMO's a couple of years ago, having action based combat rather than your tab targeting and going through your row of hotkeys to cast spells, etc. Here, we see combat in the same style of Vidictus or Dragon Nest. The game also operates in the same style (go to hub, grab quest, go do dungeron until quest is done). You'll create your character from an extremely limited selection of four classes and then, again, from a very limited selection of clothing and hair styles to pick (usually all of it just being a recolor). This is 2014, and most MMO's will provide you the tools to make your character feel different from everyone else, but here once I popped in game I couldn't really tell me apart from the others. This isn't even the worst sin the game has to offer. I mentioned earlier that the combat is action based, rather than tab targeting. Seeing as I've played plenty of Vindictus and max leveled numerous times in TERA, I would consider myself a fan of the style. However, here, it feels really clunky. Poor animations and boring links between your attacks and skills make for a boring game. Action combat should be a fluid expierence, but here it feels like a jagged mess. Nothing flows together very well, and everything just feels ""meh"". I felt like my attacks had no impact on the enemy and that's just not good game feel. For those who really care about asthetics, the graphics are subpar and the music is perhaps the most generic I've heard in an MMO. There's nothing here that should hold your eyes or ears. Overall, this is an expierence you can pass up. There are plenty of other MMO's that provide a much better, fluid, and well thoughtout expierence.			"

												Figured I'd give this game a try since I enjoy Vindictus. Huge mistake on my part. They bog you down with only 24 inventory slots start. Theres zero autostacking when it comes to quest rewards. Things like the ui and combat I can live with(I have seen worse). Just feels like they want you to pay to not be burdened within the first half hour of the game.			"

												If you like redundant battles with no patches, updates or oversight go for it. I'm thinking they were trying for Vindictus a bit with their dungeon modes to complete quests but failed utterly, which is a real shame because this can sometimes be a fun game. The lack of a community, friends being unable to add you to their friends list or dungeon party make the game play pretty unexciting. You go back into dungeons over and over as the completed quests continue to be quests (but at different levels). They have an Auction House but who knows what really happens to items you post. They just sort of disappear, never to be heard of again. Play Vindictus, Tera or even WoW for goodness sake and skip this one.			"

												I did not have any expectations for this game.  I am aware it's not technically a brand new game.It is however a FREE Third Person Action MMORPG with a ton of equippable items and a huge emphasis on combination attacks.  The combinations can get pretty intense but it's all spelled out and even has a UI that displays different buttons you can push to continue a combination.  Anyone who is familiar with combination fighting games should have no trouble understanding the mechanics of Divine Souls.  The mechanics themselves are also pleasantly fluid and it's easy to engage in battles to unleash a punishing flurry of attacks.  The special ""charge"" attacks are devastating.The RPG element is very big as well and there are seemingly hundreds of missions (a primary story and tons of side-quests).  The voice acting is humorous but it gets the job done (there are text subtitles).  RPG features include crafting, enchanting, upgrades, an auction house and supports both multi-player and single-player battles.  The graphics are not cutting edge but are still smooth and because of this I can run the game in it's supported 1920x1080 resolution with no frame loss.Overall the game is easy to pick up and start having fun right away. I am level 27 right now.			"

												It's a relic; a game abandoned thrice times by developers and publishers. Even when it initially launched it was allegedely ""revolutionary"". The only thing revolutionary was it was the lack of polish and clunkiness of its controls.I tried playing it multiple times when it was picked up by other developers, only to find that it literally never changed. Do NOT bother with this trash title. It has failed so many times it's on the same level of WarZ with the developer incompetence.			"

												Dated visuals.  Tutorial didn't work.   Mamy character customization options look the same.   Movement is too fast and control is sluggish.  Had to navigate through about 7 menus and access about 4 different areas before being able to fight a small group of enemies... then had to navigate to another area..  (too much navigating/loading new areas).    Gender locked classes, uninteresting classes.  In total this seems to be a mediocre game not worth much time.			"

												I wasn't expecting much but still I was really disappointed. I know it's not really new game, Divine Souls was probably (because I'm not sure) released earlier than Vindictus but still... character runs really strange, fighting against mobs is really stiff and voice, or voices, of NPCs are really bad. Graphics feel even older that a game from 2010 and sadly, it's pretty much empty. Don't know what about higher levels but Steam charts show, at the moment I'm writing this review, that there are ONLY 6 PLAYERS PLAYING THIS GAME. Sure, maybe it's not 100% accurate, but even if it's few times the number, it's still really low. I'm not sure if I will ever want to play it again, there pretty much isn't anything that would encourage me to do that. There are more interesting Multi Massive Online games on Steam, games that are more fitting for that genre than Divine Souls.			"

								Ok, I'm being honest here and as somebody who usually doesn't play many games I don't high-set standards. But I can at least say that at the current stage it should have not been released yet. The concept isn't all that bad, but the way it's been worked out until now is very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and grubby. The way it is right now it's not at all enjoyable. Perhaps I have pretty high expectations BECAUSE I don't play much, but to me it's common sense that when I turn the camera my character walks into the direction I'm looking. And the one character type I chose to play was not only (as actually expected, but not hoped for) somewhat oversexualized, but even the way she walked was completely ridiculed. The character designs were standard, and had very slight to no variation (it's not that hard to make the differences in color a little more significant, now is it?). Well, I was about 2 minutes into it until I decided to quit because it wasn't fun to me. No fun to look at, no fun to play. It was just clicking through the combos and trying to keep myself directed towards the enemy (I already know the phenomenon of the camera going into weird perspectives that make fighting very difficult, but it's still annoying).Having that said, I'd like the developers to put a little more effort into it. I even skipped the introductive narratation because the voice actor was clearly an amateur and didn't even use a good microphone. Apart from the fact that it wasn't interesting to me, but maybe that's just me.Overall it just lacks the passion you should put into your own game.			"

Early Access Review
								Edit: After getting bored with my current games, I am going to put more time in this game, if only just to write a better review.Edit 2: From what i have seen now, there are more combos than what I had originaly thought, but you mainly have to look down at the button option every 5 seconds to make sure you don't miss your chance at a combo.Also: I have gone into 2 differnet dungeons right now, and have played both twice. Both game me 1337 exp every time, not sure if the game is just doing that, or if that is just ""Luck"". Will write more when I find out.This game just didn't seem that well made to me. The Voice acting seems rushed (In the intro you can hear the guy taking deep breaths, and also many skips within that intro can be heard), and the Tutorial also seems rushed. There are 2 ""Types"" of tutorials in this game, and only one is useful, but it is the one almost no one will see.At the start of the game, you move around, kill things, look around, kill more things, grab their loot (On which the game doesn't even tell you want it is/does), and then go to the main City. And that is when the Non-usful tutorial ends.The useful tutorial is only displayed as tips on the bottom of your screan that you have to click on in order to see what they say, and even then, about 90% of the time nobody reads them.When you enter the main city, a window pops up saying to go talk to someone (I think, all I remember is that it says to press T to talk to people). The person you talk to gives you a very generic quest; go here and kill X amount of baddies, and I will give you X reward. In this case, you have to kill around 10 goblins. Now, the only way the game presented players to kill said goblins was to enter a dungeon. This wouldn't be such a bad Idea if the options to make a dungeon weren't available right away. I found myself kinda wanting to choose other options, only because they were all present there for me to choose from. (What I am saying here is that they should either make the others un-clickable intill a certain level, or at least tell you in a more Direct way what they all do.) Then at the end of a dungeon, you play a game of Rock-Paper-Scisiors, that even if you lose it, you still get extra money and items.Then with the combat system, oh boy. The game seems to want to sell off ""Look at this awesome combo!"" for the combat. All I had to do to kill everything in my way, was left click 4 times  in a row. I did the same combo every time, because it was also the ONLY combo i could do. I tried to hold the left button longer, press it faster and more times, everything! But all it allowed me to do was swipe three times, and jump above them for a smash.Also with the combat is a grabbing system, that needs to be re-thought about. You can grab anything that isn't a boss from what I have seen. But grabbing is also confusing for the point that when you grab the, you don't want to press left click, for that drops them doing no damage. You want to press the spacebar to deal any damage with the grab.Then with the character creation... none. You choose what class you want to be, and if you want to be a Femail prest, or a male Mage... then you are out of luck. The genders are locked for the classes, which leaves little room for customising. The hair options you can choose from are Pre-colored, so even when changing the hair color option, you will still have the tink of Purple/Pink/Whatever that certain hair style's color is. When ""customising"" your clothes, you only change the main color of your shirt, pants, gloves, and shoes.The story also seems kinda bland, just read this: You are part of a nation (which one I am still unsure of, but I think Vermont) that is trying to save a captured War-Hero from terrorists.... What? You wanted more story? Well that is the jist of it from what the game is willing to say at the start. Now I will say that story's like this are common for games like this, starts with something very simple, then works it's way up. (See every Final Fantasy game) But really, a fallen country now has a Terrorist group that is planning on bringing the country back from the ashes by... kid-napping the person who helped kill it in the first place? I'm not to sure what is going on in their minds, but I will let it be, since i have not played for even an hour.The countries are also wierdly names. There is Syria, Vermont, some other country that I couldn't be bothered to remember, and Growl (Or ground? The voice actor seems to say both in the intro).All in all, I guess this is a F2P game, that could get some work done on it to make it better, but for now it doesn't seem that good to me, so I would give this game a 2/10. I know there are some people who really love this game, and good for them! They found a game that they can enjoy, and it isn't even fully released yet!Thanks for reading!			"

								The game itself in it's current state can't be considered good. While I do understand it is an Early Access Game (or so it says...), the graphics in this game reminds me of something from 2000 - 2004.Good points about the game:- Surprisingly Fluid combat- Interesting attacksBad points about the game:- Dated graphics- Unattractive UI- Missing many key features for online game (Chat channel filters, linking items into chat e.t.c.)- Overall not very appealing to people who are used to fast paced combat like myselfI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, in it's current state because there are better, and more entertaining free to play games.

												As a dungeon cralwer it is straight up bad. I do not recommend.If you care about the reasons why:Gameplay wise it would be alright with a party. The naritive is bad. The Audio is bad. If you care about graphics; Those are bad too. The mechanics are clunky. The anime style isn't bad, but most anime style games let you customize your character more than how your face looks. Choosing the color of your hair and skin would have been alright if the color actually changed much. If you click black hair for example its like a dark grey with a white sheen. The combo system and fluidity of attack chains is all it has going for it and even that is bad. So, 1 point in four areas: 4/ 10			"

								So uh, it's like vindictus/C9/dragon nest, exept with bad graphic, choppy animations and not very fluent gameplay. Attacking in mid air makes you stop completly and landing also makes you stop, wich means a lot of time wasted on only a single air attack. Talking to an NPC made a bunch of voices fom the same NPC to play at the same time, resulting in a bunch of old men talking to me at the same time...Classes are gender-locked, with the usual girls shoot-guys hit cliche and girls are 50% boobs on your face, so don't expect anything unique on the character side. Also, character customization limited to hair style+color, pre-made faces and the color of your underwear, wich is actually an outfit.			"

								This game is pretty amazing people compare it to vindictus but i really dont see any resemblanse besides the dungeon system. the gameplay it self is fast paced and straight forward which makes for an easy gameplay experience. the only thing i would probably change is probably to add more classes but its early access so i dont think any of us should get too picky about whats going on in the game since there still working on it. but overall id give it a 10/10 jsut cause its one of the best f2p mmos ive played in a while. atm there is no pay to win which is also a reason i love this game caue i know how much pay to win mmos ruin the gameplay . so definetely check this game out and try it for yourself.

Now keep in mind this i only my oppinion who nows maybe this is your Game right here! But in all honesty and im sorry Company/Develpoer who made this but this just better games out there, and to me theres no enjoyment i was just playing, there wasnt any fun or anything to make me want to come back to playing this when i was done for the day.

												1 word to rule them; Disappointment.4/10 overall.Storyline.I felt as if the people who made this game did put in work for things other than the artwork.Like the overexplained or verbose introduction.  I appreciate the effort for the storyline, but spending so much time on narration is very distracting and detracts from the experience. There were also a lot of lapses where I either could not pay attention to the story (it actually did get that boring) or there were some things omitted from it.Storyline: 6/10There was definitely one there, but it was too long.Female characters. Girls with boobs.At character creation, I noticed how the four classes given do not have the option of changing gender roles. An odd approach, nothing to really yell for, but it surely has its weaknesses.They lacked variety. You have the mysterious D-cup, the happy short big-chested girl, the silent one with big boobs... No kinda of variety in chest size or anything.The boobs were implemented very well, but in shape and volume. They lacked motion.The motion is did see, during the first cinematic for the Striker class, was slightly interesting at first, but became insanely repetitive. The really flirty motions weren't too bad, but they looped every half minute or so, so then focusing on the dialog becomes boring.Also the shading of the chest in the character selection screen. Why are their breasts so dark when the light is coming from a high angle? They're not even wearing anything to cover them...Female Characters: 3/10I don't know. Study one of the VAs you guys got to work on the game. I'm sure a high payraise would do the trick.Combat.This one's a pretty troublesome part. I got my hopes up for some great 3-Dimensional combo chaining from the tutorial-- that little box of colorful icons looked pretty damn amazing. The stamina part felt pretty well implemented, the controls felt fairly intuitive, it's almost like the developers were real connoisseurs for MMOs and RPGs. And then I went into my first dungeon.Some pretty bad ♥♥♥♥ing went on in there. Maybe starting the first dungeon on Hard was not the best descision if I weren't experienced at MMOs, but it was completely ok. This pretty broken combo chaining got me through the entire dungeon easy: Clicking my left mouse button. Amazing huh? In terms of raw damage output, it might not have been the strongest, but with the fact that it costs absolutely zero, you heard it, zero stamina, this combo broke the damn game.But hey, combos are pretty damn hard to code. Not like the ♥♥♥♥ing ranged hitboxes. Literally the only threat for me was the ranged attackers. That tiny♥♥♥♥♥fireball maintained the hitbox of an actual character. Hmm... Sounds like reused code for hostile entities. It really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so I tried starting as the Mage. Literally broken.(Also it gets annoying that EVERY. SINGLE. ATTACK. has some knockback except on bosses. That's why M1 works.)Combat: 3/10Look into the code some more. Add some tweaks that might make the game challenging.Art overall.I mean, I talked about the girls before, but not the rest of the game.The art style used here is certainly amazing, but attention is drawn away to it by some other parts of the game.8/10Animation.From what I watched of the introductory cinematics, someone either didn't know how to animate smoothly and realistically or just got lazy with Ctrl-V. There was literally an image of some demon slowly panning into a screen of an ungodly color. Talk about top-notch animation. So many ways today to do it a lot more smoothly.Also bringing up my point from the previous animations of the female characters. They lacked any situational animations. The least you could do is make them have a different loop while talking from when they just stand there looking nice.Animation: 2/10Controls.Like combat, I got my hopes up for this too.It was cool, using Alt to change from mouse controls to non-mouse controls, something I first saw in Smite.The ideas were indeed there, but the execution failed pitifully.The default binds are so annoying. I spent a bunch of time reconfiguring the combat binds only to find out that I overwrote some of my Inventory and Skill shortcuts. Not to mention that the Skill keybind has the same ♥♥♥♥ing bind as some of the combat ones. It's bad for people who care what they do ingame.4/10This post is too long. ♥♥♥♥ me.Overall:Concepts- 7/10Execution- 1/10Boobs- PresentStoryline- 4/zzzzzUninstalling this.			"

Early Access Review
								Although I'll keep playing this game and probably grind to the max level, I wholeheartedly cannot recommend the game in its current state. All the impatient folk who quickly get frustrated should not download this game. So ... here's what I think developer should fix ASAP - and I mean ASAP! - Animation-cancelation MUST be implemented. Basically, if you're knocked down you're probably dead. And, since once you start the attack animation, you have to go through it, if some enemy accidentally flanks you (AI is pretty bad, so it won't be on purpose), and knocks you down it's ... gg. Even if you see it coming. So, roll should cancel all the animations and take the priority.- Better animations in general. Yeah, they look cool and stuff but ... they're too rigid. Jump + attack animation barely looks animated actually. Even if there are a lot of combos, animations seem too clunky, even for MMO. I know it's possible to have fluid animations seeing as several games have already done it, especially in dungeon-crawler style of MMO games.- Crashes / loading times. During my short gameplay of this game, the game crashed at least 3 times for no reason. As an Early Access game it's understandable, but developers should work on this as a priority. Even animations can wait. And then the loading times ... each time I go back to the main hub (and you have to, to turn in quests), I have to wait like a minute of a damn loading screen. Game's graphics and scale DO NOT justify such lengthy loading times. Also, game is filled with loading times. Each time you want to leave a certain area you'll be welcomed with a loading screen. Hell, there are loading screens in-between dungeon parts (by the way, if you're going to separate dungeons into parts, at least don't rehash the exact same locations. Thanks). So, yeah ... fix that.- More zoom out. I know this seems like nit-picking but it's really bothering me. Camera is too close to the character. I just like if they gave players a bit more options, everyone could find their own style. And mine is to zoom out a bit. - More character customazation. What we have right now is pretty much bare bone, and seeing as this is Early Access I know it will change, but I just wanted to point this out.So, for all of you out there who get quickly frustrated by some bad design, glitches and stuff like that, I cannot recommend this game. It's still too rigid, animations don't flow the way you want them, game is extremely punishing to the point that if you get knocked down in the group of enemies you ain't getting up. Some combos look cool, they have a dude that wields scythe (which is always a HUGE plus to the game - I freaking love scythes) etc. but until they fix some key things, I cannot recommend this to a casual gamer who just wants to have a couple of hours of fun. Cheers.			"

								I don't feel like there was much to this game at all. Hardly any customization to the characters, the classes are gender-locked, it crashes every 3 dungeons or so (And I am running on a Razerblade laptop with an Nvidia card), and there is really no difficulty to the game. I admit it could be fun for some people, but as someone who has played a lot of MMOs such as Aion, WoW, SWTOR, C9, Tera Rising, I just don't feel like it compares to those. My cousin and I got bored of it as soon as we were level 9, which actually only took us less than an hour because the game loads you down with extra XP items and the combat was too easy so we were going into the dungeons on max difficulty right off the bat. So overall, I don't really feel like this was an enjoyable game.			"

												All in all when i started the game i expected an intresting and original time waster but what i got was so much different. When i started up the game i needed to register to enter the game so did , and the instant moment i registered it asked me if i wanted free coins or something , and i beleave that indicates mini transactions , That is already not that cool for an mmorpg but alot of them use this type of thing so i can't be mad at that , so i continued and entered the game what i got was dissapointing to say the least , i know people might of did alot of work for this game but i can't say they did do a good thing since the graphics of the game look like they are taken from a 2007 game , the character designs were intresting but intresting realy can't pull out a very short character creation page , you pick your character out of 4 presets and then slightly change it , he's hair type and face  , all of the color options are more or less of a lie because they change the color of your clothes , hair or skin only slithly , as i went further into the game i got a strange and confusing tutorial , since i expect my games to throw me into the game and let me think of what to do myself the tutorial realy cought me of guard. So in the end i decided to skip it and go for the game , i entered a so called raid , and spammed my attack button as much as i could untill all of the unintresting enemies were gone , i reached the first boss with my character screaming the usualy two second preset yells , YEH Eh YEH EH , as he keeped on hitting the creatures , the boss had one of the worst enemy designs i have ever seen , all i could do was sit and say... oh look Kobolds... as if i haven't seen them in other games... I beated the boss and deleted the game. I was dissapointed because i didn't realy expect anything but a minnor mmorpg but i got even less than i bargened for , You can try Vindictus it executes everything this game is trying only better.(But it has the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ microtransactions). Thank you for reading if you did its only an angry rant of a dissapointed gamer.			"

												Before you judge me for recommending take a min to read my review. The game is seriously boring with a ridiculously long and boring and horribly voiced intro that will have you banging your head against a wall. The graphics do suck but that just means basically any computer can play it. The only reason I recommend it is because the game would probably be way better with a group of friends. Also the combat is nice fun and fast paced and feels more like a console game then a mmo. So I recommend this game but only if you are playing a with a group of friends.			"

Early Access Review
								The game doesn't feel responsive at all, everytime I attack there's a delay of half a second before the enemies get hit and the hitboxes are random as ♥♥♥♥ when the enemies are down, most of the time my attacks won't hit them at all even when I'm right next to them. It's really annoying! Also, the UI is a mess, everything's zoomed in to the point I almost suffocated. When new windows popup they overlap and I can't even read what they're saying. I understand this is Early Access but I feel they should pay extra attention to their UI. Trust me, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing mess!That's about all I have to say regarding this game, it didn't convince me enough to keep playing for longer than 15 minutes. The first dungeon kept spawning the same 3 type of mobs every single room, there's no variation and the different types of mobs are the same textures but with different colours. It's just not satisfying at all when you have to defeat the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over and over again with little to no variation and having a combat system that's dumbed down to spamming mouse clicks. Don't take me wrong, the game isn't awful...it works I guess...You could even say I'm biased because I don't particularly like this type of MMOs but it's free, so...			"

Early Access Review
								This game's combat has potential, but that's sadly the only positive thing I can say about it. It's character creation is very minimal(which in some games can be okay). But in a game where the 4 classes each have specific genders assinged to them(ex:slashers can only be female and brawlers can only be male) it doesn't work. No matter what resolution you have, it always seems stretched and low-res. The color pallet for the game is really, really bright. It's so bright to the point where it started to hurt my head. Last of all, the voice acting for npcs is better then the voice acting for the cinematic, in which you can actually hear the narrators breath hit the mic. I one again state that this game has potential, it just needs A LOT of development.			"

Early Access Review
								Started off with an error that took me 30 min to solve, the fix was rather easy though. But yeah. This game looks meh, plays not fluent enough and feels weird because of it. I played this before it was on steam about a few years ago and that publisher gave up on the game or something. I miss so many combos because I have to focus on the combos and the mobs are hard to hit.I got to lvl 28 ish before they took down the servers.Pros :- only 1.8GB downloadcons :- Skill combos are timed too fast.- skill hitboxes for multiple enemies suck, hitting them is too hard.- any ping over 60 will make you unable to use any combo because of the timing.- You get lost rather easily as a new player.- A lot of crashes with no real fixes yet. ( ""beta"" I know )- You have skills and combos but the skills have no synergy.- Animations are not fluent and do not give clear view wether you even hit your target.- The blocking skill for slasher is tricky to aim. I would rather have it block at the direction I'm looking at instead of the character's POVIt's early access but what does that mean? I've played the exact same game 2 years ago and see no improvement in graphics, gameplay, hitboxes, and more. I'm not pleased with this game at all. It's been in development for too long and this game is already outdated before it goes out of beta.			"

												Pros : One of the most beautifully rendered and visually stunning games Ive ever had the pleasure of playing. Unique and engaging crafting system and player economy system. Easy to level with challenging quests, side quests and minigames. Unique and innovative combat and character skills systems. Ability to purchase in game content that aids in raising skills or earn similar content with your own in game time and effort.Cons : The game is a little complicated to learn to begin with. One cannot simply dive in and understand the systems without going through the tutorials and I highly recomend reading the wiki and watching the tutorial videos that are available. The open pvp system is really kind of a let down for me, it encourages targeting of new and lower level characters by those who have higher levels and for my tastes really hurts the new players over all experience. While I applaud the ability to earn decent equipment and skills through time and effort. I still find that the real game perks lean toward those who pay for the vip status. Not so much that I would call it an outright pay to win game but enough to hinder some of the gameplay for me and make leveling a bit of grind.Over all I love the game. There is still a lot for me to learn about it and the team is developing new content and recently brought a new server online as well. If you love adventure RPG's and dont mind taking the time to learn the new and innovative systems then Divine Souls is definately worth trying.			"

								Originally, I wanted to give this game a chance because it got a few negative reviews; however, it simply just doomed itself with issue addressed in the following thread -http://steamcommunity.com/app/300040/discussions/0/34095131882102544/Basically, despite even shall you activate and bound the close-beta key to your account, despite you have registered an account with the official site ... your login with this game will always be ""wrong password"", even after you reset and change the password on the official website.  Not to state the fact the official website always is down for a long period of time.I do not understand why STEAM is even allowing this ""unplayable"" game to be placed on STEAM ... ""Early Access"" games would have bugs and issues which is understandable; however, ""unable to login with legit account"" is NOT even a game ""bug"".  Sorry to say ... this game cannot be played at all [don't take my word for it, the thread above says all].			"

								----This is not proffesional review, and just shows the opinion of a player, please, ignore it if you look for a proffesional one, thank you-----Launched, and already done with this game, and regretting that i upvoted it on greenlight.What's so bad you might ask? Hmm, lets see. Maybe only that there is only one server up, that has a bad ping for a few countries. What is wrong with that? Oh, maybe you never played fast games so you don't know... Well i explain,each attack:one second of waiting for it to get registered and get hit nor attack. Thats really not nice, i played alot of slashers, and trust me, responce time is VERY important.Second thing that i really didn't liked... Class Genders? Really? Why not to let players choose for themselves which gender they want, and not to bind it for class.Third: Very low quality of videos that tells the story. I play on full HD monitor, and those videos... They are just soapy and squary.Thats really it, however, i reccomend this game for people who live in the US, Because, they will get a nicer respond time for sure and (hopefully) will enjoy the game.Thats not a bad game, really. Respond time kills it thats all....(I'd wish Rusty Hearts was alive instead... Sigh.)			"

Posted: January 3, 2015
												where do i begin with this game, first of all i want to say this game is atrocious the developers make no attempt to add any kind of creativity divine souls is a mish mash of ideas from different games thrown into one horribly designed mess. graphics: the games graphics for a 2014 mmo are horrible the sliders in the gaphics options don't seem to have any effect on the detail of anything besides your character and even then the difference is neglible at best. the game has AA but it doesn't do anything even with it maxed the games textures are jagged and low res level design: the games dungeons from what i have seen are linear straight lines with no real effort put into it they all feel copy pasted, lazy, and downright forgettable. all of the dungeons are small corridor like paths with no attention to detail in the slightest.monsters/boss fights: this is the worst part enemies in this game are mere cannon fodder that only serve to slow you down from completing missions and the only purpose they have is to make the game grindy. the ai in this game is so bad that the monsters will just charge you with no real strategic fighting styles just brainless mobs charging right into your line of fire until they die. monsters have no identity and have no variety just reskinned mobs with brainless ai suicide bombing you until death because they are so weak and pittyable they couldn't kill you if they wanted to.the tutorial in this game is as basic as it gets it shows you how to fight and thats it, they go into no detail how to access your menus, how leveling up works, or any other useful information that you may need to know. if this game has any interesting features they are lost to the player because the developers make no attempt to tell you anything besides how to turn your camera and fight.your character has 1-2 combat abilities that you spam until you win, you never feel like you are advancing because from the very moment you start you have a massive advantage over your enemies each character has 1 move that is insta win mode all you do is left click mouse until you win and occaisionaly right click to dodge attacksleveling up seems pointless and i have no idea why they even bothered to add a level up system to begin with because you have no upgrades only thing you get when you level is more health, stamina, magic pool so you can spam more for longer.  dying is literally never a problem every mob makes sure to drop you plenty of mana/health to sustain you. the sad part is you don't even need it i made it through 3 of the first dungeons without taking any damage at all because the ai is so braindead it couldn't hit me if their lives were depending on it ( and it is).  all in all the game is a lazy cash grab by amateur developers who shouldn't have quit their day jobs go back to working at wal-mart and leave game deveolping to people who have a real passion because from the moment you start you can see how many cut corners/ lazy mechanics, and blatant pay to win cash grabs it has the fact valve allows these types of horrible games on steam is a real shame 0/10 would choose cancer over playing this again			"

												When I first started it the narration seemed like it was from someone who has never done voice acting. When I got to character creation I was a little sad to see class decided what gender you were. Fighter is a male, slasher is female, Mage is female and priest is male. Also it kinda bugged me that the priest has a scyth. Always imagine priests with staffs. I guess its new but I can't blame this game since it's still in its beta.			"

								Divine Souls is not your typical MMORPG.

The enemies are a bit interesting...I guess....But its a hack and slash and you will find it fun to beat the crap out of the creatures around for no reason....TRUTH...I feel awful now.....I'm a horrible person......EDIT - They havent updated it in a while, its basicly a dead game, I still recommend it though.

								2004 called and it want's it's game engine back. No really this looks godawful. Don't be fooled by the ""o it's a f2p what do you expect?""s out there either. There are plenty of f2p games that look better than this and plenty of ones that don't have the greatest graphics, but still at least manage to make their toons look like human behings. If you loved the look of the original Gunz your going to love this game. I didn't actually play it so maybe it has good mechanics ( I dobut it) or something, but seeing as how I wanted to empty my occular cavities to end the pain of looking at this I just uninstalled and made this warning for others. ""Worry not, the tutorial will guide you through the game’s basics"" I had no arms or legs for this part. Also it required me to go in and install physx in order to get the game to turn on.			"

								Divine Souls is not your typical MMORPG. The combat is okay, and the voice acting makes you want to explode all over the place.But what this game truly excells at doing, however, is getting you to uninstall it.Seriously, this is the best uninstall simlulator since Sonic 06 on my Xbox 360, but I can't burn it this time. Oh well, if I could it would have been perfect.10/10 would uninstall again. (420/10 if I get physical copies to burn)			"

								Divine Souls isn't terrible, but it's nothing special, either; there's limited character customization, limited possbility for character design, and finally, this would PROBABLY make a better anime or manga, than an MMORPG, because if you're more into MMOs for good storyline, this is for you. As for an action RPG, this game is okay; it's gameplay is too predictable, the classes are gender-only, and the possibility of what you can legally do with typical free MMOs is LIMITED; though the controls, camera, and designs aren't bad at all. My advice? You'd probably have a little bit of more fun, from games from ""GOG.com""; this even includes the free ones! Otherwise, if you've experienced better games, and you're a gamer that's after deep gameplay, you'd probably be bored out of your skull, when you play this too much. For effort, I give this 5/10, saying that this game is nothing special, but it's certainly better than ""Rumble Fighter"",  in which some annoying snobs that play that game are TOTAL JERKS who take the strategy of ""lagging"" too seriously. (If ""lagging"" in battle is against the rules, then I'd be having MUCH more fun, by playing the game ""Need for Speed: Underground"", because at least you don't have jerks who nag you, for strategy.)

I can't think of any. Free to Play wouldn't be it because it has your typical limitations of these FTP gamesWaste of hard drive space and download bandwidth.			"

								As I said when I reviewed Legends of Aetherius, it's better to just download Vindictus and play that instead. The difference here is that Dragon Nest or Rusty Hearts would be a better choice, since the only major difference between this and the latter is a full-360 camera and a host of barely-explained mechanics noted only in a long starting quest around the single town I've seen almost halfway through the game. The combat is something both previously-mentioned MMOs have done better, half the time the game doesn't detect me hitting the ""organize inventory"" button, and just now after playing a bit, it didn't detect my possession of an item that apparently unlocks actual crafting, since instead of having a system you use yourself, it seemed to be a good idea to instead drop a few NPCs in that same town, give them recipes for items to increase their level...and nothing else until they level, apparently.Say what you will about Diablo 3, but at least leveling the crafting NPCs in that game wasn't their only function at the start.

								Game will need some work and I have hopes for it.  Played for a few hours to see what it was like.  Need a bit more difficulty and controles need a bit more refining.  I was pleased to see an option for a game pad however it doesn't work like it should.  When I started playing it seemed ok, no initial bugs though there was a bit where it was near impossible to invite someone.  I was hopeing for something that resembled an old Devil May cry game with hack and slash type gameplay however it wasn't up to par.  Graphics were...D+ at best when compared to others games around these days.  I will give it a thumbs up for this style game attempting to go multi player and with hopes that it will work out its bugs in due time.  Oh If they managed to fix the issue with the odd gamepad controls I will be more than happy to come back as a casual gamer . :3			"

												Game review: -Although the game only has 4 characters (Fighter, Slasher, Mage, and Priest) Its unique game play and the colorful skills are eye catching.-Divine Souls seems like it has a lot to offer with the in-game play; Items, rarity, enchanting, dungeons, party system, difficulties, item crafting, item dissembling for the crafting materials and much more! It is definitely an eye catcher and its unique style is worth of giving a shot to. With just over and hour of the game play I can see where the end game content can be fun and rewording, as well as challenging.-Game graphics are realistic and very sharp, something not many MMOs have going for them.-Controls are set for an Action RPG as the Divine Soul is, which allows you to actually kite the mobs and not just sit around waiting for the skills casted to end.-The main city is is vast and quests are everywhere!-Game tutorial and the beginner quests do an excellent job explaining the game basics allowing you to get to advancing your character almost right after finishing them, which doesn't take long at all.-The game has virtually no lag or delay which makes the game that that much more enjoyable. Not having to worry about those two little things is every players dream and this game offers both of those small but very important features.-I'm liking what I'm seeing right now. Its basically not your generic fancy MMO because of its unique combat style.-Overall I would rate the game ★★★★½☆  just from quick experience in it, I'm sure my opinion will change as I keep playing the game and explore more of its content, both solo and teamed up with other players.-Also for the final note, I would definitely recommend it and if you're liking my review, give it a shot,you will enjoy it as did I.-I will post some game play reviews on my YouTube channel, and if you would like to see them make sure to Subscribe @ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS98nZ-NgZPPVqXzA0cmDjAAdditional information:-Ok first of all after installing the game I've ran into a Problem.""PhysX installation fail""After Clicked ""OK"" It sent me to the page where I can install the new drivers for my specific Graphic Card.-After installing the new drivers, restarting the PC, still did not help, same result.BUT...!! I've found a solution to it.Fallow the next steps to ensure the success in playing the game!•Step 1: C:\Program Files (x86)\NVIDIA Corporation\PhysX\Common•Step 2: Copy the 8 files in that folder. (Copy all you see.)•Step 3:C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Divine Souls•Step 4: Paste the files you've previously copied.••Extra Step: If this did not work and you still got the same error go to http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.13.1220-driver.htmlAfter installing successfully, fallow the step 1 through 4 again and enjoy!-To login the game you use your Suba forum login and you create the character.If you do not have Suba account simply go to https://subagames.com/ and fallow the simple steps in making your new account.-Enjoy the game!-VashBOG™			"

								What can I say about ""Divine Souls""?  Other than they are other games out there than this, I will say this game is intriguing.  If you're a fan of the MMOs and hack-and-slash genre, and if you're also looking for more games other than Onigiri and Elsword, then this is a game for you.  The downside is that the voice acting is too mediocre.  I'm not saying they are bad, but they can do better than that.   Overall, I will recomend this game for the fans of these types of games.  Now, don't take my word for it, this game can't be as good as you think, but it's a fun experience for MMO fans.			"

								On the outside it looks like a poor man's Vindictus clone, but once you start to play it, you quickly realize that a poor man would have been able to create a much better game.  The graphics are clunky and outdated, the controls feel awkward and uninspired, and the game feels like something that should have come out ten years ago.  I love finding games where attacking doesn't involve cycling through skill buttons while your toon hacks away automatically, but this feels so much more tedious than  just pushing a few buttons that I can't recommend it to anyone.

												We need more games like this. It's similar to rakion in its animations, I like the idea of an actual skill based MMO. I also like how one of the skills for a fighter is called ""Deimos"" lol. It's very addictive and fun, and most importantly, it's easy to learn and get used to (a problem with a lot of new games). It's pretty addictive, doesn't require a supercomputer and I can easily see myself replacing pristontale with this game. Didn't think I would like this game but I will be investing a lot of time in it for sure :)DaPurpzzz			"

Though I haven't gotten into the game yet and it is in beta I feel these things should be the first things that should be fixed. After I did get my account set up, I could connect to a server. Despite restarting the game another two times. In other words. 4/10 so far. I'll update this after full release...Maybe			"

								Needs alot of work, revamp on the quest system so it isn't so repedative, a rebalance on combo to skill damage, going from barely making a dent with normal combo's to screen wiping an area with the first basic skill is a little rediculous. Needs a little more thought put into the difficulty of stages as well as a fix for questing, i enjoy challenging myself in games, nothing bothers me more then running through a stage on a harder difficulty only to find out the quest i'm on is actually locked to a specific difficulty. The difficulty spike between easy and normal is a little ridiculous as well, not so much for regular enemy's, they didn't change for difficulty ;however, there was a midboss halfway through the first stage that was able to take me out in less then a single combo, so again circling back to a balancing issue. For shop keepers, i found it a little frustrating that i had to close out the shop window in order to change items that i wanted to sell, it doesn't allow you to freely place items in the sell window and remove them. The voice acting in the game is also very poorly done, shifting between cutscenes and having my volume suddenly spike to loud music and a grating screeching voice is hardly well coded or written. As it stands now i would not recommend this game to anyone; though i do see potential. I do not feel this game was ready for a prerelease and would strongly suggesting pulling back and rethinking everything you've done so far.			"

												I played DS (Divine Souls) the very first months of its open beta, I haven't played any more duo to the huge list of bugs, empty server, mostly were russians spamming the world chat and some major bugs such as determined equip would crash your game when joining a dungeon. I remember the staff being nice, they would replay my tickets if not the same day, the day after. There's a ton of quests, can't remember the level cap but guessing 40-50 back in my time and also for those who like to craft and have lot's of space, you have 4 kinds of craft (if not mistaken) cooking accessory weapon armour and each character you have, has its own inventory and you can also have your own guild with whatever char you own and use guild storage to store your mets or whatever, The game is fun, if you find the dungeon boring, lure all the mobs and exterminate them. The combat-style is quite slow, true, but you can perform air-combo skills. There are also some action-reaction or whatever it's called for some bosses, during my time they weren't working so we had to dodge, no idea about now.Just give it a try and beware of the plastic hair and pale faces.

												Divine Souls offers a gameplay experience never seen before. It blends an action RPG and MOBA into one MMO! Everything from the dungeons to the wave defense mode to PvP are all played with the same combo-based direct controls. Plug in a gamepad to enjoy it like any console game – for free!Choose from one of four individual classes, each with their own specialized weapon and role to play. Delve into dungeons to defeat bosses and progress the story, solo or with a party! Create a guild and engage in PvP against other guilds, and join in on the Battlefield! There are always new and exciting ways to enjoy Divine Souls.- Standing Out in the CrowdA  wave of free to play brawler games have made their way to market recently. Dungeon Fighter Online may have been the earliest, but it was quickly followed by Dragonica Online, Fists of Fu, and several other titles. While all of these games had more action oriented gamplay than the traditional MMORPG template offered, they seemed years behind in terms of graphics and technology. Well now Divine Souls rides to the rescue. Not only does it offer fun bash-and-dash stage progression, but the interface and visual presentation are up to date. Divine Souls uses a familiar fantasy setting (though it does have some steampunk elements), but the visual style is realistic rather than anime inspired or cartoony.- Not So Many SoulsDivine Souls entered beta testing in July 2010 and makes use of Outspark’s new O+ launcher.  The game has a wide range of supported resolutions and graphic options which is surprising considering the relatively small client size of 1 GB. There is currently one official server, broken into two parts with each serving a different coast. Each coastal server has multiple channels and can be scaled up with additional channels as needed. Character creation is a bit less impressive. There are three classes to chose from, Mage, Slasher, and Fighter. The classes are gender locked, but there are three empty class slots which means additional classes are planned in future updates. Appearance customization is pretty bare. Players chose from a small selection of face and hair styles. A full color pallet is available for skin and hair color. The character designs themselves look realistic, I was particularly impressed by the knees on the female Mage. I don’t recall any other game ever attempting to make a knee look so realistic.- Take ControlThe game starts in a tutorial zone, but players can leave at any time by hitting escape and confirming. Divine Souls allows players to switch between two alternative control schemes by hitting F5 or F6. Keyboard shortcuts are available to navigate the interface, and even to interact with NPCs, but players can bring up the cursor by hitting the ‘alt’ key. The need to manually switch the cursor on and off can cause some confusion, but is necessary to maintain the third-person-shooter like gameplay in Divine Souls. There’s no auto attack here, instead players click on the left mouse button to perform standard attacks. A variety of other keys are also involved in combat such as the space bar (jump), and ‘E’ (grab/hold.) Hitting these keys in certain sequences leads to combo attacks. Players can view a list of the combos their class can perform by hitting ‘K.’ The combo list is reminiscent of fighting games like Street Fighter, players who can memorize them and properly utilize them will be much more effective in both PvE and PvP. Luckily, its entirely possible to progress by spamming the standard attack.- Persistently InstancedDivine Souls makes heavy use of instancing. Cities, camps, and other locals that stock quest NPCs and merchants make up the persistent world where players meet and greet. Portals are scattered across these locations that open up regional maps and allow players to enter the dungeons, or stages, in that area. There are dozens of stages available but players will find themselves repeating them many times. Quests help speed up the grind and offer a sense of progression, but the best way to stomach the repetition is to find other players to group with. The level requirement for each stage is displayed on the map, but each stage comes in three difficulty modes. Players must clear a dungeon on easy to unlock medium, and clear it again to unlock hard mode. The persistent city plus instanced game world model was first championed by Guild Wars but stage based MMORPGs like Lunia and Divine Souls have done a great job adopting it for their own purposes.- AoE is EffectiveThe best part of Divine Souls is its gameplay. As soon as the game begins players will have a chance to try out the combat system by attacking a group of portly goblins. As mentioned earlier, attacks are performed by hitting the mouse buttons and certain keyboard keys. Players pan the camera simply by moving the mouse which gives the game a live-action feel often lacking in MMORPGs. Players won’t simply be trading blows in Divine Souls. Each attack must be aimed and enemy strikes can be dodged. The developers may of gone a little overboard on the hit radius of player attacks. Hitting multiple opponents with a single attack looks cool, but being able to knock down everything in front of and to the sides of you reduce with a single attack reduces the game’s difficulty considerably. Its not uncommon to go through some of the earlier stages on easy or medium without suffering more than a few glancing shots. The crazy AoE attacks definitely add to the ‘arcade’ feel, however. Even low level bosses require some strategy, and more evolved tactics and team work are required in the later stages. Fortunately, it doesn’t take long to clear a dungeon. Stages themselves are broken down into a series of rooms connected by portals, players must defeat all enemies in a room before moving on to the next. Loot mechanics are designed to keep the action rolling, players simply hit ‘R’ near gold or item drops to automatically pick them up.- Combo Breaker!While new player will spend most of their time playing solo or cooperatively through the game’s PvE content, Divine Souls also offers a lobby based PvP system. Cities have arena buildings which open up a lobby where players can join or create rooms. There are four PvP modes (Deathmatch, Survival, Capture the Flag, and Break Into), and each mode supports up to eight players. By default, PvP matches normalize the level differences between players. A similar system is used in games like LaTale and ensure that player skill rather than time spent grinding determine the outcome of a battle. Players can turn off this feature and experience more uneven combat if they desire. Fighting against other players is much more difficult than fighting against the not so intelligent AI. Spamming the most simple combo won’t cut it. Players will have to learn multiple moves and when it is most appropriate to use each. Most player vs player bouts are team based, either 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4. This means an element of teamwork is also required. Divine Souls keeps track of many PvP statistics such as wins, losses, rankings, and a player’s ‘PvP Point’ which serves as their rating. How well the PvP scene will develop remains to be seen, but Divine Souls is definitely the most exciting Outspark release since Fiesta Online!Final Review:Divine Souls is a fast paced action MMORPG that has great visuals and genuinely fun gameplay. Repeating instances can get frustrating, but Divine Souls makes it easy to switch between PvE and PvP to keeps things exciting. The game is pick up and play friendly, but the combo system requires dedication to master. If you don’t mind the heavy use of instancing, go try Divine Souls.			"

												Divine Souls F2P MMO Review by Dionysis Spinos (for grabthegames.com)      Time for another review guys! This time I chose to review a F2P game that was added to steam really recently and I found it pretty good in my opinion and really worth checking out! Divine Souls is a MMO game created by GamePrix and published by Supa Games. Divine Souls is not simply a MMO game it combines a lot of different game genres and aspects. There are RPG elements, strategy aspects, dungeons and a lot of other things that make Divine Souls a really unique indie MMO game! Let’s start our review by the graphics. The graphics of the game are good in general, the game plays in all PCs without any issue but you shouldn’t expect amazing graphics or something like that…they are ok and can satisfy pretty much every taste and pc, so I would consider this a more positive than negative aspect of the game! As far as the music is concerned, the game has some really good and satisfying music and background sounds that makes the game more attractive to the players but unfortunately I cannot say the same thing about the voice acting. The voice acting in this game is really mediocre and sometimes annoying. As far as the game itself is concerned, it features 4 characters/classes Fighter, Slasher, Mage, and Priest. Each character has a really unique set of skills and weapons. Also, I shouldn’t forget to mention that weapons have different rarities like every MMO which is another aspect I generally love in MMO games. What other things I liked you will ask me! I liked in this game the fact that the quests are pretty match everywhere…so there is no way to get bored in the game. Also, the quests are really generous in rewards too and most of them have some hard bosses to find. Furthermore, the game features a really well designed crafting aspect…that will really help you during your journeys on the Divine Souls World! Other aspects that I generally liked in this game is the main city and all the worlds/places design. I should also mention the fact that the game features guilds, party system and some really detailed with videos tutorials and beginning quests that I found really helpful and fun! Last but not least, I totally recommend this game to everyone, I liked it, the community and the devs are really friendly and they are ALWAYS there to help you in any question or whatever you would like to ask. So why not try it out? It is F2P as well!Verdict,7,5/10			"

Early Access Review
								The first impression I got of this game was not so great. The voice acting and sound design was messy and garbled most of the time. The music score itself held up pretty well, but that seems to be where all the good sound design went. The combat is simplistic, but it feels a bit too simplistic. Games like Vindictus and even Onigiri have more combat depth than this. Normally I'm not one to complain about graphics, but the graphics look messy at times, especially the character design. You could honestly find better graphics in games back in 2009. While I can see the potential this game has, it has a long, VERY LONG way to go before it even comes close to it's potential. I would like to keep an eye on it, but for now it's not even worth the download.			"

												The game has ""anime-like"" graphics which is appealing to people who like such. The overall graphical look of the game is impressive, background sounds and music is decent. The items (weapons etc.) can be upgraded, well-made and with decent drop rates. There are currently 4 characters that you can pick according to your desired game style, whether melee, support or long range. The gameplay is similar to ""Rohan"" and in terms of how it looks, but Divine Souls in my opinion looks better, has better co-op system, has BETTER QUESTS and better experience gain therefore faster leveling.Although there are currently 4 playable characters, all of them are highly customizable. But unlike Rohan, you cannot change all genders (ie: you cannot pick a male slasher)The game is very appealing and highly recommended. The graphics are sharp and very decent.			"

												DISCLAIMER: I'd love to give this a neutral feedback, but there's no such option.This is not a game for everyone. Not for me at the least. As such I can not give it a positive feedback. But first - the good.This is a free game, and I've seen worse of these. It's an MMO, so you socialize probably (haven't gotten that far).  Seems to have a good development team backing it up. I can not comment on the story and game-play too much since I couldn't last.Now the bad. NO CONTROLLER SUPPORT. This is a huge deal breaker. With games like DMC managing perfectly with a controller why didn't the developers make it so that you can play this with a controller? It's the perfect style for it.Also, the animations are unbearable for me. The mere way the characters move is so unnatural, even for anime based drawing style. The graphics and mechanics are lacking at the least.The register/signup buttons do not work and the UI is terrible.CONCLUSION: I can not recommend this game, but I can not discourage you from trying it either. You might love it or hate it, good thing is it's free and you have the luxury to do so.			"

YouTube™ Video: Divine Souls Early Access Impressions (as of 8/18/14) 

			Views: 140		

			So I saw this game in early access on stream and it said it wanted some feedback. So I decided to do a stream on it and this was what ended up happening.		

This was my impressions of the game as I streamed it live on www.twitch.tv/seiichisinThis is very much a game I would like to see improved, but it really really does need a lot of work. In the current form that it takes I cannot recommend this game but giving it some time I think will help improve a lot of the systems already in place. I didn't make it very far into the game, but there was a lot of early stuff that confused me and made me unwilling or wanting to continue playing. You can see everything in the video and such. Note to the developers: Please remember the video I posted was done live, there is no editing or anything to remove any part of what was streamed. Both the good and the bad was there, and I hope you at the least have someone sit down and watch it all the way through as I do believe you have a good game hidden somewhere within here.			"

								Lets start off with graphics. If this game was released back in the 90's, it would still be a lower end game. Mechacnics are slopy, same with the animations. For the tutorial, i was a magicle floating head and weapon.  The first dungeon was even worse.  The enemies could not hit me, even when standing still.  And the boss would get knocked back at the end of every combo, not giving him a single chance to attack.  This pattern repeated for the first 30 or so levels. Over all, only play this game if you want to take a walk down memory lane on how bad games in the 90's where.  Other wise move on to other games like Tera, or Bless.			"

								I have not played the game yet, but I would recommend it cause of the vidieos I've seen. I like the gameplay action and fighting combos in the game real time fighting. I like real time fighting games and I also noticed that there seem to be a couples system. I'am a man who got a woman named EveEmpressw as my girl and a couples system would be perfect for people like us to unite and fight together. I also love the outfits the girls wear in the game, perfect eye candy for guys like me. :3 This game maybe new and not known to many users but I already see it's going to be big. I know it's gonna be a hit looking forward to playing it and making up moves and combos and loops and pvp matches. Games like these would always draw a crowd cause the system is simple to pick up and get into as far as I see and a simple system won't turn away users just starting off in the game, discouraging them.Will wait for the game to come out XD gone for now and will buy my time. Guess I'll continue playing Elsword until this game is up and running. XD out that is all.  "

												It is with displeasure that I do not recommend this game because it has the foundations of what could be alot of fun, however it is incredibly boring trying to perform combos on monsters that often do not recieve your attacks even though you see your weapon clearly hit them and incredibly poor graphics for 2015, I reached level 15  and then played for a further three days, trying to immerse myself in the game; but with the buggy gameplay at the moment I found it hard to stay amused. (I would add that the block function is completely useless as you are hit-stun for long enough after a block that you can't dodge the next attack)			"

												Divine Souls is a decent brawler that can be compared to Dungeon Fighter Online.  The game is old, but still fun to play if you enjoy similar games.  I'd give the game a 6/10 based on gameplay alone.Overall, it's a decent time waster and has controller support, but it's held back by the  Korean Fatigue Point system, limited inventory space and the almost nonexistent player base.  Three hours are more than enough to burn your daily Fatigue Points and you only get 24 inventory slots of which potions/quest items occupy at least half.  The game is basically on life support since I only saw three people in my entire time playing and two of them didn't speak English.Divine Souls is worth the download if you're desperate and want to kill half an hour, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a primary game to play.

Combat is clunky, skills and animations are dramatically bad, voice acting is not even there (only in cutscenes while being performed terribly), and it was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get it to work since i had to copy+paste some files from my nvidia folder to the Divine Souls folder myself (don't know why). oh yeah, and when i wanted to shut off the game just crashed on me. It's pretending to be an awesome action styled mmorpg, when in reality it's a poorly done dungeon hack&slash game. The only thing i really liked was the artform, but there are tons of mmo's out there abusing the anime/manga style as well, so play that. A good alternative would be Tera online (since that's a real action mmorpg), or for the more realistic gameplay TESO (i know the hate about this game, but from a TES/MMO lover's perspective it's a really good game).

												TL;DR It's slow, the game is very choppy, only for people who can look past the poor graphics and animationsI tried to like it. I really did. It's a lovely MMORPG, with all the right elements and all the right components to be amazing, it's just all the components have been given their share of the effort and now the game is just an amalgamation of lesser bits that add up to one mediocre blob. There is no one single problem, it's just you run into something every minute or two that makes you go 'Urghh....'I would say don't knock it until you've tried it, but I've tried it, and no thanks!

Early Access Review
								This game is rather pathetic considering other Action-oriented combat games. Vindictus, Tera Online, Onigiri, Neverwinter. Any of those games are better than this. If you're looking for a better version of this game try ""Wizardry Online."" If the PVP in SOE's game isn't your thing, try to download Dragon's nest. It's the same game, but Dragon's nest is just better. Anyway; The combat in this game is iffy, and lacks fluid motion. The dodge does not interrupt your attacks or really function as a dodge as it should in these kinds of games(No frames of invulnerability), the timing on your combo is too quick with no real momentum or 'feedback' of hits(Feels and sounds like your just slapping them with a cardboard weapon), Damage seems far too low vs enemies so you'll be using the same combo up to 4 or 5 times on one enemy or group, and it uses awkward controls for skills, sprinting, grabbing, and interracting. I picked this game up, and promptly put it back on the shelf. I have never done that so quickly, before.TL;DR Old school gender-lock class-bases hub-based hack-and-slash RPG. With MMO aspects. Horrible voice over for every little thing, Intro and some npc's have -horribad- voice acting void of emotion. To make matters worse: What really counts in this kind of game is not there. The combat movement sucks, no ability to 'stall' attacks as the timer reset between attacks is non-existant.My Opinion; It sucks, it's bad, and since it's free, I hope you really don't spend money on this. It feels like an alpha of an old, old game (And it is a very old game. Meaning this is as good as it gets...) Pros- Hub-based dungeon grinder for old-school fans- you can... party with people and suffer together?- Easy combat - Just spam your left-click (Regular combo) until the thing you stun-locked dies.Cons- Outdated graphics- 4 gender-locked classes- 4 hair styles for each 'class'- Blocky, unresponsive combat, dodge does not interrupt or give frames of invulnerability, hard to change direction when attacking, limited combos- Bad voice overs in intro cut-scene/NPC voice-overs- Annoying voice over announcing when you can move to a next area, when a quest was completed after you hit the quests 'complete' button, and etc.- No, as in none at all, customization of Player-Character beyond the 4 hair styles.My Advice; If you're looking into this type of game, here are a few; Dragon's Nest VindictusNeverwinterWizardry OnlineTera OnlineOnigiriPhantasy Star Online 2 + English patch(Unless you know Japanese)Or... WARFRAME (Space ninjas with swords, guns, and puppies- no Joke, real puppies that grow up into vicious murdermutts)			"

Early Access Review
								Despite being in early access this game just falls way to short to ever have a long life ahead of it. let me list everything that is wrong with this game. A the graphics look like a very badly designed N64 game. take Daikatana for instance. it looks that bad. its not visually appealing at all. against other newer games of its type and not of its type like say Raiderz or Onigiri. or an even better example ArcheBlade the game really doesnt appeal at all compaired to those games in visual or game play. also the fact that the naration sounds like this game was made in someone's basement. just poor poor quality overall, definetly no stamper thats for sure. now for gameplay itself its actually not THAT bad. the combo sistem is solid and fluid but while graphics arent everything, it should still look GOOD for what it is. take back in the NES days you had Finalfantasy wich was blocky and pixalated as any other Nes game but it still looked good for what it was and how the graphic were then. Legend of zelda as well even if link looked derpy when he held up an item he got in a dungeon. he still looked good. creating a character in this game gives you a false sense of security that maybe the game wont look like horrid♥♥♥♥♥♥ (excuse my language) but after getting into the game it just looks like someone vomited textures on a super smash bros fighting polygon. if this game was made and released on the N64 as i said. i bet it would have been a very high rated game. however today...i give it an E for effort. good game play but everything else is done so poorly that the gameplay simply cannot make up for it. if you want a good Moba game play Dota2 league of legends or try one of the newer ones like Dawngate. if you want a good action pvp game go try out Archeblade its free on steam as well. thats all i relaly have to say on this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥that had potential to be gold.  sadly i think the golden goose was very sick on the day this hatched.

								Pros: Free to playCons: Poor graphics by today's standards, clunky interface, awful default control setup, stuttery combos, weak creature AI, very poorly translated.I thought I'd give the game a try as it's a free-fighting combo-style dungeon crawler that you can solo or party up for - at least that's what the game is made out to be. Unfortunately my experience made me wish I'd spent my time doing something else. The combos are weak to say the least, there's no free flowing from one combo to the next, and your character is largely unresponsive while perfoming a combo and shortly after it. The creature AI is very poor, with groups of mobs generally simply charging at you while you pummel them - the creatures with any special moves or combo attacks are few and far between (and they simply spam the same move over and over).The interface wouldn't have been out of place in the early 90s with very little customization possible (can't even move some windows around ..eg stash tabs, conversation windows etc), but in today's era this is simply unforgiveable.To crown off everything, the translation in most palces is pigeon-English at best, and at worst I wouldn't be surprised if the translator used Google.Overall, a very poor game even if it is free to play, and one I wouldn't recommend spending time on unless you really, REALLY like the genre.

								I played the tutorial, and i played a little more. But i just couldn't keep playing, the first thign you notice is that is apaprently has upper and lowercase problems with the password when ou loging in. We i finally did figure that out and managed to log in you are presented with just a few choices for your character. Next to the horrible graphic for a game in recent years i seen more choices in way older games that even looked better than that, also missing the ability to change gender of each class... Now while that is still a compromise i could live with, next thing is the voice acting, it is horrible it's starts with the intro and just gets worse as the NPC's ingame keep saying the same thing everytime you interact with them, and apaprently they used the same voice actor for the NPC and the charcter i created, which was confusing and annoying all the same. The interface isn't really helpful either as it just looks stuffed, especially once you picked up missions.Getting to the gameplay, it's anything but smooth, it's rough and you often can't move/look about at all because for some reason it's in the ""arrow mode"" and you can just move that around, it is very bad while in combat. And while it supposed to let you play with a gamepad, it doesn't, i tried to use my Xbox360 controller and another one, neither would work. The only good thing i can say about this game, the combat system when fighting monster is okayish.Now i played alot of MMO games, Amazing to good, and bad to horrible, and i can say this is one of the worst i ever played. So i do not recommend this game at all, there are more fun MMO's to play and better looking as well.			"

(Example you've just killed the first set of monsters in one area if you're in the area where they spawned then the mobs pretty much kill you before you can do anything.)The character voices are VERY buggy (Example you're talking to one of the NPC's then quickly press the close button, on some of the NPC's the NPC voice overlaps, the same goes for talking to one then switching with another NPC.)Players tend to solo more than party, which kind of sucks because there's no socialism in game unless you're selling things			"

Wether its terrible leadership or lack of experience in doing rollouts or product development. With all of the install errors I got and fixed and still can't play the game. Its a NO GO Houston. I have run companies who have developed and released software on mass scale, and to a mass market. You need to focus on communication, and right now, you have failed on that. So I would recommend focusing on the customer as well as the product, or you will have noone there when the door opens, and all of the hype you created will die. And you will have to pay for new hype, bad decision.			"

								I've read from another review that the graphics were ""old"" and had no idea what they were talking about because from the screenshots it looked pretty good.  Buuuuut now I see what he is talking about.  The graphics are not too appealing but one can live with it if the voice acting for the characters didn't sound so crappy and cheesey that it's laughable.  The gameplay is decent, and slighty fun, but I can't stand hearing the bad voice actors grunt and shout everytime I click the mouse button to attack and/or use a special ability.    If you can get past how cheesy this game looks and sounds then great!  Go for it.  But I like to play a action game where I'm not laughing at how cheap it looks and sounds...			"

												This is you typical Hack and Slash grind MMO, it doesn't seem like they put much passion into the game and from the way the things are layed out it doesn't sugest much.  character classes are gender locked , very little custimisation of character available which is esentialy  a few  colour changes of certain pieces of clothing in 4 spots an a coupe of presets.I really wanted to like this game and tried to, but sadly could not as it got boring real fast. The story is mediocre, and vague at most, graphics and voice acting is not that great either.  "

								Wants you to create a separate account, but the ""Create Account"" button doesn't work.After looking up the game's website you'll find a signup form and have to pray that it's legit and not some scam to collect player login data for the game.Wants a player name, an email address and a password and tells you to expect a confirmation mail.Once you figure out that there won't be an incoming mail and log in with those credentials, you get a server list, but no channels and you'll be unable to preceed any further!While looking up answers to that problem I came across several warnings that it's run by a company that intentionally unbalances its games to goad people into a Pay2Win situation.Uninstalled it again. Good riddance!			"

								These are my personal pros & cons of Divine Souls, I'm sure that there are more, and that our opinions may vary about this game, but I personally find this game amusing, even with it's flaws. I would still recommend playing this game!ProsThe gameplay can be enjoyedEasy mob killsControl settings are easily manageableNo need for megaphones or having to pay for use of extra chat tapsConsCan crash at any timeGraphics should be updatedCharacter creation kind of outdated and lacks a lot of things needed, such as colorization for hair templatesMonster spawning for higher difficulties is a little too fast. (Example you've just killed the first set of monsters in one area if you're in the area where they spawned then the mobs pretty much kill you before you can do anything.)The character voices are VERY buggy (Example you're talking to one of the NPC's then quickly press the close button, on some of the NPC's the NPC voice overlaps, the same goes for talking to one then switching with another NPC.)Players tend to solo more than party, which kind of sucks because there's no socialism in game unless you're selling things			"

								I played the tutorial, and i played a little more. But i just couldn't keep playing, the first thign you notice is that is apaprently has upper and lowercase problems with the password when ou loging in. We i finally did figure that out and managed to log in you are presented with just a few choices for your character. Next to the horrible graphic for a game in recent years i seen more choices in way older games that even looked better than that, also missing the ability to change gender of each class... Now while that is still a compromise i could live with, next thing is the voice acting, it is horrible it's starts with the intro and just gets worse as the NPC's ingame keep saying the same thing everytime you interact with them, and apaprently they used the same voice actor for the NPC and the charcter i created, which was confusing and annoying all the same. The interface isn't really helpful either as it just looks stuffed, especially once you picked up missions.Getting to the gameplay, it's anything but smooth, it's rough and you often can't move/look about at all because for some reason it's in the ""arrow mode"" and you can just move that around, it is very bad while in combat. And while it supposed to let you play with a gamepad, it doesn't, i tried to use my Xbox360 controller and another one, neither would work. The only good thing i can say about this game, the combat system when fighting monster is okayish.Now i played alot of MMO games, Amazing to good, and bad to horrible, and i can say this is one of the worst i ever played. So i do not recommend this game at all, there are more fun MMO's to play and better looking as well.			"

								I really can't recommend it. I spent around 50 minutes trying to get it to run: psychix (sp?) error, then a login error, then everytime I picked controller option is booted me back to steam and then when I finally GOT into the ACTUAL GAME (I did the tutorial with mouse and keyboard and found having to the Alt button to switch my mouse function confusing to me), I got to the hub and fiddled with the settings to get my controller to FINALLY work and realized that  A) I couldn't rebind the keys, B) the game didn't acknowledge all my button presses (there was a move that I just counldn't get even thought the corect button combinations), and C) it took me another 10 minutes to get the game to acknowledge that I wanted the DEFAULT settings back.I will give this game another shot given that it is early access and a F2P game, but right now I would have been PO if I had paid money for it.

								Despite being in early access this game just falls way to short to ever have a long life ahead of it. let me list everything that is wrong with this game. A the graphics look like a very badly designed N64 game. take Daikatana for instance. it looks that bad. its not visually appealing at all. against other newer games of its type and not of its type like say Raiderz or Onigiri. or an even better example ArcheBlade the game really doesnt appeal at all compaired to those games in visual or game play. also the fact that the naration sounds like this game was made in someone's basement. just poor poor quality overall, definetly no stamper thats for sure. now for gameplay itself its actually not THAT bad. the combo sistem is solid and fluid but while graphics arent everything, it should still look GOOD for what it is. take back in the NES days you had Finalfantasy wich was blocky and pixalated as any other Nes game but it still looked good for what it was and how the graphic were then. Legend of zelda as well even if link looked derpy when he held up an item he got in a dungeon. he still looked good. creating a character in this game gives you a false sense of security that maybe the game wont look like horrid♥♥♥♥♥♥ (excuse my language) but after getting into the game it just looks like someone vomited textures on a super smash bros fighting polygon. if this game was made and released on the N64 as i said. i bet it would have been a very high rated game. however today...i give it an E for effort. good game play but everything else is done so poorly that the gameplay simply cannot make up for it. if you want a good Moba game play Dota2 league of legends or try one of the newer ones like Dawngate. if you want a good action pvp game go try out Archeblade its free on steam as well. thats all i relaly have to say on this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥that had potential to be gold.  sadly i think the golden goose was very sick on the day this hatched.

Early Access Review
								This game is rather pathetic considering other Action-oriented combat games. Vindictus, Tera Online, Onigiri, Neverwinter. Any of those games are better than this. If you're looking for a better version of this game try ""Wizardry Online."" If the PVP in SOE's game isn't your thing, try to download Dragon's nest. It's the same game, but Dragon's nest is just better. Anyway; The combat in this game is iffy, and lacks fluid motion. The dodge does not interrupt your attacks or really function as a dodge as it should in these kinds of games(No frames of invulnerability), the timing on your combo is too quick with no real momentum or 'feedback' of hits(Feels and sounds like your just slapping them with a cardboard weapon), Damage seems far too low vs enemies so you'll be using the same combo up to 4 or 5 times on one enemy or group, and it uses awkward controls for skills, sprinting, grabbing, and interracting. I picked this game up, and promptly put it back on the shelf. I have never done that so quickly, before.TL;DR Old school gender-lock class-bases hub-based hack-and-slash RPG. With MMO aspects. Horrible voice over for every little thing, Intro and some npc's have -horribad- voice acting void of emotion. To make matters worse: What really counts in this kind of game is not there. The combat movement sucks, no ability to 'stall' attacks as the timer reset between attacks is non-existant.My Opinion; It sucks, it's bad, and since it's free, I hope you really don't spend money on this. It feels like an alpha of an old, old game (And it is a very old game. Meaning this is as good as it gets...) Pros- Hub-based dungeon grinder for old-school fans- you can... party with people and suffer together?- Easy combat - Just spam your left-click (Regular combo) until the thing you stun-locked dies.Cons- Outdated graphics- 4 gender-locked classes- 4 hair styles for each 'class'- Blocky, unresponsive combat, dodge does not interrupt or give frames of invulnerability, hard to change direction when attacking, limited combos- Bad voice overs in intro cut-scene/NPC voice-overs- Annoying voice over announcing when you can move to a next area, when a quest was completed after you hit the quests 'complete' button, and etc.- No, as in none at all, customization of Player-Character beyond the 4 hair styles.My Advice; If you're looking into this type of game, here are a few; Dragon's Nest VindictusNeverwinterWizardry OnlineTera OnlineOnigiriPhantasy Star Online 2 + English patch(Unless you know Japanese)Or... WARFRAME (Space ninjas with swords, guns, and puppies- no Joke, real puppies that grow up into vicious murdermutts)			"

There is no one single problem, it's just you run into something every minute or two that makes you go 'Urghh....'I would say don't knock it until you've tried it, but I've tried it, and no thanks!

												This game is so... interesting. On launch, AVG tells me the game is in fact a virus. Although I don't think this is true and played the game anyway, that's something to note.The gameplay: challenging dungeon crawling, excellent for playing with friends who have a high tolerance for the games shortcomings.Leveling: Fairly quick.Voice acting: Mute your game, you'll love it 10x more. The grammar is also terrible.Features: Simplictic, which for some people is good. I like simple games, and the mechanics of this can't be discribed as anthing else.To play or not to play: There are better things out there for sure, but if you want to laugh at a game, and spend a few hours having fun, this isn't the worst game ever.

Main quest has long and boring dialogues. Running in town is scary, lack of original dance as well (there is only Gangam Style). Unless they do really huge update, it is not worth playing.			"

												There's alot of potential for the game to be great.I can see myself playing it if developers improve the content further.I love the fighting mechanics. (skill combos and such)Love how you can click an NPC and your character runs to it.Very user friendly interface.The equipment upgrades are pretty nice from what I've experienced.If you like grinding and trying to equip the best in-game items you'll most likely enjoy the game.Of course if you like PVP aspect of MMO's you'll like this as well.Plenty of quests to do but gets repetitive after awhile.The voice animations could be better but its solid for what it is.Gender lock character classes might be an issue but if you don't discriminate then it should be no problem.At the moment it seems like the point is just to do the quests and have your items be as good as possible,but then again it's only in beta. That being said I can see myself playing the game more in the future. "

												I'm another one that would prefer to give a neutral option to this game.  There isn't enough to completely hate it, but not nearly enough to love it either. I do realize that the game is in open beta, so we'll see how the development continues. Like most I'm fairly impressed with the graphics, and the usability. I'm not a huge fan of PVP and while I do participate, I look to other elements to keep my interests. There are an abundance of dungeons/stages/instances in the game...but you will find that after time they start becoming rather repetitious (PVP can break the monotony of it). With that being said, in order to develop other areas such as crafting you need to grind them, several...multi...ok a lot. At this time, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of interest on the players behalves to get into the areas of crafting. This is pretty evident when you get into the broker and see the lack of materials (perhaps due to do the amount of grinding) or crafted items for sale.  They are pretty invensted in PVP right now. The crafting process is pretty straight forward, but the amount of work you have to do to get the materials just doesn't seem to make it worth while. Meaning, that when you have probably gotten enough of said materials you are rather advanced in the game and have no use for the items that you have finally worked to create. I will say hoever, that the crafted items are and can be better than those earned in the game. Another thing that hinders this process are the space limitations of you backpack and warehouse storage. There doesn't seem to be a way at this time to expand these spaces other than paying to do so. This leaves you with having to constantly tweak and toggle, and give up a lot of things and missed opportunities to earn money in the game. (Level 20 offers a work around for this but defnitely not ideal). I'm assuming over time these things that I have mentioned will change and improve *finger crossed*My ONLY MAJOR GRIPE with this game is the Fatigue system. I am definitely not digging this at all. Every 24 hours you are given for lack of a better term ""Juice"". The juice is used up for every instance you visit. Once your juice runs out, your ability to gain experience is diminished. You can still do the dungeons/stages/instances, just not at full earning capacity. I don't know who thought of this...but by gawd just eliminate it. It's annoying. "

												This is a third-viewing angle RPG with non-target play. It’s hard to newbie to play this category. But when you’ve acquainted with it and had a good control ability, I’m sure that you liked it. In general, this game has a good graphic and sound, low requirement for your PC and almost no lag. You can move through targets, destroy or jump over impediments, so you’ll never be trapped. However, navigation system is not good, and it made you move around. I think you should control your character to jump over impediments or take a short road when you’ve acquainted with maps.Skill system is so various. It’s divided into 4 types:-Basic Attack: no consume any types of energy, no cooldown, use by left-click.-Combos: use chain of function keys, consume stamina and no cooldown.-Active Skills: learn in Skill Master, consume mana and have cooldown.-Divine Skill: depend on your class, consume Divine Gauge ( you have 3 Divine Gauges ), no cooldown. Gauge will be increase whenever you do damage or be damaged.Because this various, it requires players must be proficient in controlling and using all of skills. If you have high controlling, using skills ability, you’ll be a nightmare in battlefield. Beside it, you must have plan for your skill points, because you have more skills at high level, but low skill points. And one thing about Active Skills: when you upgrade your skill to lvl3 and higher, you can be fail in upgrade skill and consume your skill point ineffectually.Character’s Stats (depend on your class and you can’t change it):STR: Physical attack power and the amount of weight you can carry.DEX: Critical damge and critical hit rate.VIT: Determines your maximum HP.INT: Magic attack power.MND: Determines your maximum MP.Classes:-Fighter: physical class, lowest basic range, highest STR and VIT so have highest based-physical damage and HP, can be a good tanker. Fighters have many knock-down skills so can tank many mobs although have lowest basic range.-Slasher: physical class, average basic range, have many AoE combos, highest DEX and crit-increasing skill so have highest crit, can be a good killer in both PvP and PvE.-Mage: magical class, highest basic range and based-magical damage, many Active Skills with high AoE and range. Although Mages have melee combo but slow animation with less knock-down combos so melee is a weakness of Mages. Mages usually play hit and run.When Mages have tanker in party, Mages can deal a huge amount of damage.-Priest: hybrid class, average basic range, all stats are average too, many skills to damage to targets who are knocked-down. Priests have greater physical damage than Mages and greater magical damage than Fighters and Slashers. Equipments for Priests have highest physical def, magical resistance and crit resistance and Priest is the unique class who has heal. So Priests are very important in a party, and can be a formidable enemy in a PvP battle.I see many players got a trouble when they killed boss at map. I've played all 4 classes but I've got no trouble when I killed boss. You should play hit and run, observer boss's animation. And then, you move to left, right or back boss's side to deal damage on boss.If you want to show your controlling skill, creative thinking ability and your responsive, you can’t ignore this game.-DiemDe from PT1-			"

												The narrative of the game was horrible.  The create a character was just changing the color slightly and a bit of the hair style, but nothing to really differentiate yourself from others.  It's not really a game I would play again nor recommend, but I am sure there are those who would enjoy it.  Good luck to those that do.			"

												pros: what I liked about Divine Souls would have to be it's plot and skill setup...it's like with each button u press u flip, shoot, and slash ur way further into the story. cons: what I disliked in the game is probably the char design...it seemed as if everyone had some kind of wierd passed...I mean for as cool as it is but how many times have you ever seen a priest swinging around with a scythe.

												The beta has barly changed the game what so ever, its still boring and the combat sucks and i bet the armour system is still♥♥♥♥♥♥to be honest i had high hopes for this update and what really upset me was the fact that i know they've added things but reducing our character lvls from 20's-50's  to 1 really upset me beause it just took all of my hours and many others and threw them out the window and i know it's to be exspected to happen sometimes but if your going to just do that you should've just set out a 48 hour to a week trial to get the reactions you wanted from people not a couple months, And the big update was a health bar are you serious? I mean really sending everyone E-mail's about it for small changes,annoying level ruduce and a health bar. I mean it's laughable really and the project for this game was hyped 4 years ago everyone was excited then boom they just dropped it and now steam picked it up and it looks like it's from 2005 i mean c'mon steam you can do better i mean vindictus came out withen the same to next year and it's AMAZING compared to Divine Souls and i mean amazing there are some down side im not saying it's perfect but it's still amazing and it's so good they dont need to make many patches anymore i mean they're now making it even better. Ok what im trying to say is steam can do way better than this if you keep it up no one will play it and i know you probably dont care cause it's a ""Free To Play"" game but just try harder thats all im asking.P.S. Sorry for any bad grammer			"

												After having spent some time within the game interacting with NPCs, choosing my character and customizing her as I please. I certainly find Divine Souls interesting, the game play is fast and flowing. I did not experience any lag or glitches. The game play is a mix of mortal combat, final fantasy and like anime all in one game. I loved having the ability to choose my character and customize how it would look, skin tone/color and face. It definitely makes the game more personalized and unique versus some of the other games that I have played. It makes your character unique and I'm sure there are more opportunities further on in the game that would allow further customization and personality in each character.the skill set of the slasher that I choose was very interesting, allowed for different combos based on where opponents were and whether you were jumping or sprinting. I will admit it takes some time to get used to the controls and how to use the camera angles to your liking, but once you get the hang of things it's a quite entertaining game. There are many many NPCs available that it can even be overwhelming for a new player, but again with longer game play I'm sure they will come in handy.I did not have the trouble with PhysX as some others did so it was a simple install and play process. I look forward to playing this more in my spare time.			"

												The narrative of the game was horrible.  The create a character was just changing the color slightly and a bit of the hair style, but nothing to really differentiate yourself from others.  It's not really a game I would play again nor recommend, but I am sure there are those who would enjoy it.  Good luck to those that do.			"

												pros: what I liked about Divine Souls would have to be it's plot and skill setup...it's like with each button u press u flip, shoot, and slash ur way further into the story. cons: what I disliked in the game is probably the char design...it seemed as if everyone had some kind of wierd passed...I mean for as cool as it is but how many times have you ever seen a priest swinging around with a scythe.

												Unforuntalely, I get ""PhysX Initialization Failed"" when attempting to start game.  A pop-up window appears afterwards telling me to go to http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/radeon_win7-64.aspx and update my video driver and Catalyst Application Profiles.   A quick check shows my video drivers to be up-to-date.A quick search online shows that this is a known issue that has been around for at least two months.  I was hoping for something at least tested.  Cannot recommend.			"

												Pros:-Decent Action Combat-Decent Connection Speed-The Scenario seems well designed (Con: It doesn't feel very deep).Cons:-Third-Party Account  *And they confused me when I realised the ID was not the name they were going to show on their forums, dang it.  * When prompted to change my forum username, it just said it did without actually doing it.-Low Graphics (Lower than what they show in the screenshots)-Poor Audio for the Intro Sequence (Sounded like they did it in parts, then mashed them together, the backround music breaks up)-Annoying Question Marks for notices to go to the help menu items.-The Auto-Walk has a poor pathfinder.-The early gameplay feels unbalanced, low difficulties are easy, but go any higher and it becomes super difficult.-They have a ""fatigue"" system(Pro: I never reached the limit [Con: I got bored first]).

												Ok.  I have enjoyed the tutorial very much.  It has pretty nice combo attacks, block/block jump, holding and etc.  I see the game has one annoying bug though.  You can't look around (move camera around) when you first spawn in a map unless you move around your character first.  Also, I thought this would be MMORPG where you would meet people in an open map, but when I entered a dungeon, I was the only player.  I saw that there was an option to join in a party before I entered the dungeon, but I would rather run around in an open map and meet people.  Other than that, it has a pretty good user interface.  I liked the town a lot.  I jump flip around everywhere.  After a few *poke*poke*poke* on a GM, she called me a s-c-r-u-b.  hehehe...good times  :D			"

Early Access Review
								This game is very old already and has artificial graphic. Today I got an email that Open Beta will start in 3 days - are you kidding me? This game is in beta 3-4 years already and nothing changes. It has many bugs, controll is sick. It is much much much worst then Vindictus. I dont know, will it be free or will you need to pay but it is not worth space on the hard disc. I am suprised that Steam decide to have neverending Beta game here. Quality of Steam is lower and lower and now I understand why some competitors appear.Summary: this game is crap, always in beta and if Steam will not stop putting here crap like this they will start loosing customers.

												ok let me make this clear this game should not be in beta it has several lets call them reiterations and none of them has worked its still has tons of problems and  the tutorial is god awfull its saveing grace is the helpscreen it dosent even tell you to hit alt in the begining to get rid of the mouse so you can actualy start the tutorial and play the game.....thats fine the worst part tho even worse than gender locked classes the horrible voice acting that sounds like google text to speech and the what looks and sounds like barely translated  text because nothing makes any kind of sence....nothing tho is worse than the buggy as hell combat....if you want a game that  is better  in every meaning of the word go play dragon nest....or vindictus...or even rift....all in all i give this game a 2/10 i gave them an extra point for trying.ill take another look at this when they get rid of the stamina bar that has no reason to be there with so few players.

												This game is so... interesting. On launch, AVG tells me the game is in fact a virus. Although I don't think this is true and played the game anyway, that's something to note.The gameplay: challenging dungeon crawling, excellent for playing with friends who have a high tolerance for the games shortcomings.Leveling: Fairly quick.Voice acting: Mute your game, you'll love it 10x more. The grammar is also terrible.Features: Simplictic, which for some people is good. I like simple games, and the mechanics of this can't be discribed as anthing else.To play or not to play: There are better things out there for sure, but if you want to laugh at a game, and spend a few hours having fun, this isn't the worst game ever.

												It is with displeasure that I do not recommend this game because it has the foundations of what could be alot of fun, however it is incredibly boring trying to perform combos on monsters that often do not recieve your attacks even though you see your weapon clearly hit them and incredibly poor graphics for 2015, I reached level 15  and then played for a further three days, trying to immerse myself in the game; but with the buggy gameplay at the moment I found it hard to stay amused. (I would add that the block function is completely useless as you are hit-stun for long enough after a block that you can't dodge the next attack)			"
