												Got this as part of the Humble Monthly BundleA very basic and sort of enjoyable old school arcade game, but given the price I can not recommend it at all, it reminds me a lot of ""Snood"", which is basically just another game like ""Bubble Bobble"", but Snood did the whole ""blocks have faces"" type of thing. In essence if you've played your typical mobile phone game or any ""PopCap Games"" games before, you get the gist of it.But as opposed to those games, this is not about placing a similar block in the right place, instead it's a puzzle where you have to match 3 blocks to get rid of them, but you can only do so with the blocks at the front. In essence you have to reverse-engineer how the puzzle was made in the first place, remove the wrong blocks and you no longer have 3 set of the same blocks in the top row for you to match.It's the kind of game I play a short session of and then never again. Seems well enoug made, but when I came in here to write a quick review and noticed the price tag, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS, jesus it's like 10 times the cost it should be. This is a throwaway puzzle game, it has no right to be priced over critically acclaimed indie games.			"

												A Trial of this game was attached to my account through a Humble Bundle code for The Bridge.  Due to the way it was set up, it's unremovable.  I tried the Steam Support automated page and it will not work with this.If they did things correctly, it would have showed up as a demo and had been able to be removed from your license history at a click of a button.  Instead it shows up in your account as a full version of the game, but there's a button in the game which leads to a place to purchase the 'full version'.When I made mention of this in the game's forum, I was immediately banned by the devs.If you want to support devs that use underhanded tactics, that is up to you.

												It is just a puzzle-oriented match 3 game.  It actually controls well, and seems polished reasonably well.  But there is nothing very interesting here to set it apart from other puzzle games in the last 15 years as claimed in the description.  Personally, I thought Triple Town was much more innovative for a match 3, had me playing for longer, and thinking a bit more about how to do better.  I'd also take Puzzle Quest any day over this which adds an extra dimention.  This is simply picking off 3 blocks of the same color in the right sequence to solve the puzzle.  At least it plays fast, easy to reset, controls well.  But overall the animation also seemed cheesy.  I usually like match-3 games, but this was a bit too boring for me.  (1/5 stars)Good news, even the trial version has trading cards!			"

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer/publisher but this did not affect my opinion on the game.Tumblestone is a match three game, developed and published by The Quantum Astrophysicists Guild, releasing on PC, XboxOne, PS4, PS3, PlayStation Vita and WiiU on July 12th 2016. The gameplay consists of your usual match 3 points but it has somehow made it more addictive and fast-paced than usual. The gameplay is also done a more uniquely too; you have to work your way up the screen clearing blocks, rather than having access to the whole screen from the start, almost in a Space Invaders fashion. Whilst the game play can be fast-paced once you get the hang of the strategies presented before you, there is also a huge element of taking things slow and planning your route step by step, with a lot of  having to go into a lot of the levels too.  The game has a well fleshed out single player story mode which will take through the different stages of the game, from beginner levels right through to difficulty levels that are just way too difficult for me to comprehend. Tumblestone also comes equipped with multi-player game modes, on top of the classic arcade game modes. Tumblestone has a very pleasing art style along with a really nicely designed UI design. I was happy to see a little of comical value inserted into the 2D graphics. The UI is so easy to navigate that it is never an issue. This is something to be said for this genre as some are quite clearly just ported from mobile devices. The colourful environments and game play features makes this game a joy to look at. It is also worth noting that there is no voice acting throughout the game, and there is a fair portion of dialogue to keep up with in between levels to progress the story. This game is hard, you will only be able to progress the first 30 levels or so if you have a real keen eye for match three style puzzles. It was an uphill battle for me to even get that far! The game’s story mode boats 40+ hours of puzzles to solve, that alone will give you an insight as to how difficult this game will get.  On top of these 40 hours from the singleplayer story, you’ll probably also want to jump into the arcade game modes and check out the multi-player gameplay too as this will be all too exciting and fast-paced!  I wouldn’t think there is too much replay ability in the story mode as you may just want to stick to the arcade modes once you finish the story, but that is fine as you’ll end up with an almost infinite amount of gameplay then. Personally I would like to have seen a more in-depth tutorial system as after the first couple of stages you are definitely thrown into the deep end, and whilst it is fairly self explanatory a little guidance could go a long way into hooking people into this genre of game. Technically though, Tumblestone is sound. The game only supports lower resolutions which was a shame, but how crisp do you want those colourful blocks? The controls are perfect too, with the game being more than possible to play either using solely the keyboard or solely using the mouse. I opted for the mouse as it felt more comfortable and led to less user error mishaps Overall, Tumblestone is one of the better match three games out on Steam now. It’s taken a huge leap above other straight ports from mobile, mainly because this has never been a mobile game. I would anticipate it will get a port later on given the amount of platforms this has already been released on. If you enjoy puzzles and more importantly, match three puzzles, then you for sure need to be checking Tumblestone out. The game comes split in two though, if you are more interested in playing the multi-player side of the game, you can get it fairly cheaply for a mere £6.99, however if you want the 40 hour single player experience you will have to fork out a little more, £18.99. Personally I would never pay that amount for a match three game as I usually only manage to get half way through before my skill level is peaked and I can’t get any further but I believe that the high production values on Tumblestone, combined with anyone with a love for this genre will get more than enough gameplay and replay ability out of it to warrant that £18.99 price tag.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												I played this title when it was given out to Xbox Live Gold members and even for free this game is a trainwreck. The art style in itself isn't bad, it's that the characters look so lazily designed, and feel so cheaply animated that it damages the actual appearance of the game. Another thing I noticed that damages the art style is that all the menu and ingame text uses some slim sans-serif font that doesn't fit the aesthetic of the game. Besides that though, it doesn't even feel like a proper puzzle game, as it feels more like a mobile cash grab than anything considering my next point. The game itself is broken up in three ways, there's the typical free version with barely any elements that you can get by either owning their other game, or having a friend who owns tumblestone to give you a trial key they generate. Then there's a MP only version that you buy for $10, and then the full version with SP and MP. Guess how much the full version costs at full price? Yep. $24.99 is way too much for a puzzle game, especially one as lousy feeling as this. I'd suspect people who see appeal in puzzle games to be able to enjoy this, but personally it just feels cheap. The price is wrong, the marketing strategy about how they forced trials on some people that I am reading from other reviews is wrong. I'm not a developer, or a marketing expert, but pushing your games onto people is never a good idea.Overall a TLDR;• Personally I find the character design lazy and boring. Large head, little body. Half circle feet and floating Rayman hands.• The fonts and character animations used contradict the overall theme of the game.• The game was split into paid MP and SP+MP, and a free version that basically begs people to buy it. The price of the game is way too high.• The developers supposedly forced a trial of this game unto previous customers of their other game, and managed to get it into their library through humble bundle to spread the games publicity.• Don't even think about getting this without a heavy discount.

												I received a free trial of this from the jingle jam bundle. This was sneakily put in with a key for the bridge and is now stuck in my inventory. The devs solution to this so far is to remove it through the store page but this also removes the bridge. I refuse to support devs that pull this kind of underhanded tactics.

												Solving puzzles consists of determining a way of clearing blocks in the correct order.  This isn't a matter of searching for longer matches amongst a sea of options, just figuring out the right order to remove blocks - it's not using the same mechanic as other match 3 games, and it's not employing the same skills.  I didn't enjoy it, for whatever that's worth.			"

												I've been playing puzzle games since I was young, but it's been quite a while since something has really grabbed my attention. I didn't think much of this when I first saw the store page, but I was so very wrong. Tumblestone is definitely the puzzle game I've been looking for.Tumblestone is a Match-3 at heart, but it goes far deeper than you might think. The premise of the game is to match like-colored tumblestones in sets of three in order to clear the board. Your character shoots from the bottom of the screen to remove the lowest tumblestone of that column. This starts off as a rather simple task, but it quickly becomes a much more complex process; even the most straightfoward puzzles will require careful planning and execution to complete. As you progress through the campaign you will unlock modifiers, which mix up gameplay by changing the rules that are used when clearing blocks. Each of these modifiers will require you to think in a completely different manner than the others. You can also enable party mode in the options which will unlock every character and modifier to be used for local play only. In short, between its single-player and multiplayer modes, Tumblestone boasts a wide range of content.The main focus of single-player is the story campaign. The store page isn't kidding around when it highlights this as a 40+ hour experience. There are 12 worlds in Tumblestone, each consisting of 30 stages. But even with 360 levels, everything feels like a unique challenge; otherwise, it wouldn't have taken me around 30 hours to reach the last world.  Each puzzle, with the exception of randomized milestone challenges, is hand-crafted in a way that really makes you think. To add to the depth, a new modifier is introduced in each world, becoming the main focus for that world. The first few stages of each world serve to get you acclimated with the new modifier. On the 10th and 20th stages, you are tested with a small gauntlet of randomized puzzles. The random puzzles being thrown in encourages you to figure out the puzzles yourself and improve your technique (rather than breezing through with a guide).  Although, if you are having some trouble, the game does reward you with a skip token from each world that is usable on any non-milestone stage. These tokens are cumulative and can be used at any point of the game. After passing your first gauntlet, modifiers from previous worlds are thrown in to stir up the gameplay even further. At the end of each world, you face off against the character of the next world in an action-packed puzzle race. Also, each milestone encounter is coupled with a story sequence that plays out with dialogue over gorgeous art stills. I was quite surprised as to how much I enjoyed the narrative; it even had me laughing out loud at times. Oh, and you can play as a sausage!In addition to the campaign, there are 3 arcade modes: Marathon, Infinipuzzle, and Heartbeat. Marathon has no time limit for actions and is all about surviving as many moves as possible on a wider playing field than usual. Infinipuzzle, as suggested by the name, is an infinite string of randomized puzzles that keep coming until you fail. This mode also allows you to select a modifier, if you desire. And my favorite mode, Heartbeat, is a fast-paced survival challenge against a wall of steadily approaching tumblestones. Each of these modes, including each modifier in Infinipuzzle, has their own leaderboard. There are also leaderboards for your overall rank and the number of quests completed. Quests essentially act as a challenge list with objectives, such as: finish a level with the perfect amount of moves, complete a certain level, or win a match against a number of bots. And, just in case this wasn't enough content, there is plenty of variety to be found within the multiplayer as well.Multiplayer can be played either online or locally with up to 4 players and/or bots across 3 match types. Battle is similar to your standard competitive puzzler where the more you clear, the more tumblestones appear on your opponents' boards. This mode is great for those who prefer traditional puzzle multiplayer. The other two modes, Puzzle Race and Tug of War, really break the mold when it comes to competitive action. Instead of fighting to knock your opponent out, you're trying to clear your board before they do. You gain a point in puzzle race by completing a full-sized puzzle before the others. Tug of war works a little differently, in that each player starts off with 2 small puzzles instead. Since they're smaller, they typically get cleared more quickly. However, to keep it interesting, another puzzle chunk is sent to your opponent once you clear yours. This mode is by far my favorite, as it has provided me some of the most intense and gripping back and forth matches I've ever had in a puzzle game. These two puzzle modes also allow you to activate any of the modifiers you've unlocked. Turning on all of the modifiers and randomizing them makes for some exciting matches as your mindset will have to change from round to round. It is also possible to customize other aspects of the multiplayer, such as how many rounds to win, or if you want everybody to have the same board or not. My favorite touch of the versus mode is that when a player wins a round, the background and music of the game change to their character's. The only downside to the multiplayer right now is there isn't a constant stream of players online. In these situations you can turn on bots--which range from pushovers to superhuman--or you can generate a friend key that allows them to play 5 matches with you per day. I'll admit that it is a bit cumbersome, but it's nice that your friends can try the online before they buy it.Tumblestone is certainly a contender for my favorite puzzle game of all time, right next to Puyo Puyo and Tetris. However, keep in mind that this game can be quite challenging. There have been puzzles that I've reset hundreds of times on before figuring them out, but it's extremely satisfying to see that final shot slow down as your clear that last block. It is also quite addictive, as I often find myself returning to the game not even 10 minutes after exiting. All in all, Tumblestone is chock-full of content that will keep you occupied for countless hours; as mentioned before, I've spent over 30 hours on the story mode alone. Being a fantastic and challenging experience, I would absolutely recommend this game to any fan of the puzzle genre, without hesitation.			"

YouTube™ Video: Tumblestone - Quick Game Review 

			Views: 4,628		

			Tumblestone is a match three puzzle arcade game that has a single player campaign, arcade modes as well as multiplayer modes.		

TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!Tumblestone is a match three puzzle arcade game that has a single player campaign, arcade modes as well as multiplayer modes.I originally found out about Tumblestone at PAX East this year, and I immediately thought of games like Bust-A-Move and AstroPop. Tumblestone looked like a great twist on the action puzzle games that I used to love so much.The campaign does have a story, and you play as a different character in each world trying to stop the tumblestones from taking over everything. I played Tumblestone solely for the gameplay, but the goofy characters, and silly story were a nice touch. The puzzles are more challenging in Tumblestone than in games like Bust-A-Move since you have a limited number of blocks to use in Tumblestone.Pros:single player campaign has a ton of content (I’ve been playing it for over 8 hours, and haven’t even gotten 50% completed yet)enjoyable puzzle gameplay, and different puzzle mechanics are introduced in each worldsingle player arcade modes and multiplayer are very fun and addicting to play; they're also great for those looking to compete head-to-head or just set high scoresdifferent modes available for up to four-player multiplayer (either online or local); you can substitute bots with varying difficulties in as well, and different settings you can adjust to make the game even more challenginggameplay feels very responsive, which is a must for an action game like thismusic is decent, but also gets repetitive (which is to be expected in an arcade puzzle game)backgrounds look appealing, and they aren’t so overly done that it is distracting to the gameplayCons:sound effects are repetitive and get a bit annoying (a separate slider for just the sound effects volume would have helped)there are not enough level skips available in the campaign if you have trouble with a certain puzzle mechanicbecause there are thirty levels within each world of the campaign, some levels may start to feel repetitive before moving on to the next worldsore thumb!! after a few hours constant playing (not really a con per se, but still, you have been warned!)You are able to unlock one level skip per world, but I don’t feel like there are enough level skips available. I love that there are so many levels, but at the same time, if you find yourself struggling with one of the puzzle mechanics in a world, you may become discouraged, and give up missing out on all the rest of the campaign. I would like to see more level skips available, even if you have to do certain achievements, or something to unlock them. Most of the campaign, you can take your time with the levels, so it’s definitely more geared to those who are looking to solve puzzles.The multiplayer and arcade modes are for those looking for more of the action puzzle experience. The puzzles are easier in this mode, since there is a greater focus on speed to overwhelm or beat your opponent. There’s definitely a good amount of replay value to be had with the multiplayer and arcade modes.Conclusion:I have been getting a lot of enjoyment out of Tumblestone, and there is so much left that I can still do, especially in the campaign. I also like how you can purchase only the multiplayer pack, or the entire game. I would like to also see a single player pack available though, so that players who only want to experience one can buy whichever one they want. I feel that the price is reasonable, as I’ve definitely gotten sufficient time played for the cost. Tumblestone is a great game for anyone looking for a fun and addicting action puzzle game.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curations here.You can also view this review on my website here.[www.azralynn.com] "

												Several reviews here have touched upon price as a primary consideration in the purchase, but for what is on offer - if you play and take advantage - there is great depth  and longevity to the game.  It is, at its heart, a match jewel game akin to those from Popcap, but much deeper.  Instead of just reactionary matching, here you MUST plan ahead to make sure that your matches line up properly and allow completion of the puzzle.  As such, it is a neat inversion of that easy click addiction; on the surface it is simple, but to advance requires forethought, planning, and keen attention to detail.  In short, it is a puzzle game with all the trappings of matching but with all the puzzling you can handle.  At full price I think it is still well worth the purchase for the single-player content alone.  And if you desire to go into competitive puzzling, there is a whole repaste of multiplayer modes.  Included in your full price purchase is a regenerating Steam key for you to distribute among friends so you can always have a multiplayer faceoff.  Quite recommended if you have some patience and enough gray matter to know you'd like to test it.			"

												So much more than meets the eye!I've watched this game grow from just a fairly straightforward puzzle race into a sprawling behemoth of a game with a fully fleshed out campaign and enough multiplayer modes to satisfy any kind of competition you could hunger for.Sure it's match 3- but one look through the modes, and you'll see that the match 3 system is implemented in more ways than you'd have ever thought it could.As a casual puzzle game, as a stumping take-your-time puzzle game, as a frenzied dash- it has aspects that will appeal to any mind that craves puzzles and logic.And the multiplayer brings it to another level.Dibs on sausage.

												Fantastic puzzle game. If you're the kind of person who is happy to be stuck on a puzzle for more than a few minutes then this is the game for you. I'm not the kind of person but I still totally recommend this game to puzzle lovers. I'm able to see that whilst this game isn't something I personally could play to completion there are people out there who enjoy a challenge and I would absolutely say this game is for you.Fantastic game with well scaled puzzles that made me think in a way I don't think I've ever thought before. The mechanics are unique but simple and once you start getting to harder levels you will start to see the finer details actually do matter.			"

I also appreciate the fact that the game allows you to gift a key to your friend so you can play coop. It is a thoughtful touch. Even if I do find it annoying when applications ask for reviews before you are able to exit. I suppose it serves a purpose in smaller companies getting more exposure in the industry.			"

												Note: This game includes a second free key to give to a friend to play multiplayer - and for this price, it should! I believe it's some kind of crippled ""trial"" key, though. Do your research.A ""thinking man's"" match-three puzzler with charming graphics and very forgettable background music. Every choice is critical, every move requires careful consideration, often forcing you to calculate two or three moves ahead. If you do something dumb, you will pay for it. I got it in a bundle. I enjoy that the animated faces on the blocks reflect their color (green is sickly, blue is sad, yellow is afraid, red is angry). It has a lot of game modes, and ""modifiers"" for even more variety. There is quite a bit packed into this initially simple seeming game.THIRTY BUCKS!? My eyes popped out of my head when I saw the regular retail price. This game is not a total revelation or reinvention of the match-3 genre, it is simply good - possibly the best in the field, in fact. The single player is more like the ""puzzle"" mode in most puzzle games, where you have to remove blocks in a specific order to solve the puzzle. I don't generally enjoy this kind of gameplay very much, but I enjoy it in Tumblestone. It's fast, it controls tightly, and it seems that there's more than one way to skin a cat with these puzzles.When, on the ""Mario 3"" style overworld map, you get to castles, it mixes the gameplay up. I will not spoil anything. The castle puzzles are random (I think), possibly procedural. Throughout the campaign, various gameplay modifications are introduced that really twist things up. In the multiplayer and arcade mode, it punishes you by lowering the ceiling if you match incorrectly, or if you paint yourself into a corner and are forced to pick a block from above the ceiling.The colorblind option is appreciated, but does not help my type of colorblindness. Telling the yellow bricks from the green bricks is difficult when they're behind the 'glass' ceiling, and this colorblind mode does not seem to affect the yellow/green blocks at all. And, once you've chosen a block, there is no way to cancel your selection. Blocks are shot out of the puzzle immediately to unlock what is beneath - so be careful (I said it was fast).I would recommend this game at $15 for puzzle enthusiasts only. $30 is a mind-bending price for what this is.Tumblestone gets a soft thumbs up from me, because it achieves what it sets out to achieve, feels fast, controls well, and is cute, but not distastefully so. I thought I would be in and out in 5 minutes, and almost was. Give it 15 or 20 minutes and you'll begin to understand. This developer also made ""The Bridge"", a brilliant puzzle platformer. So give them the benefit of the doubt, and a bit of your time, and I believe you will enjoy Tumblestone, as long as you pick it up on sale.			"

												This is a first impressions rather than a review, will update if or when I am able to complete the game. You have been warned, and it would be quite nice for Steam to let us specify such things, since they can still give some important insight.Devs: Stop asking us to rate the game when we've not even finished the first world. It's on Steam and you're asking for limited access or full price (outside of bundles, free copies and the like), and that kind of encouragement is just shady and crap.Disclaimer: I recieved this game as a part of Humble Monthly. That means I did not recieve this product for free, nor did I pay full price. I will bear in mind the price as much as possible in my impressions (currently $25).Let me start off by saying this is deceptively addictive. The controls are tight and by default you control the player with just the keyboard's arrow keys and the 'a' and 'd' buttons (QWERTY, of course). This may strike you as a bit bizarre. I can understand to a degree why the devs would choose to seperate the keys to prevent accidental frustration in later levels, but why not simply use the w, a, s, d, q, e setup gamers are familiar with?Regardless, the concept is very basic- match three, create a situation where you can clear the board. Some levels randomize, some do not. Every 10 levels you'll have a sort of 'boss puzzle' where you will get three or more puzzles on the same board with an invisible timer that will start moving the board downward (you clear from the bottom up) after a time. These can get super frustrating very quick, and all of them seem to be randomized each time you restart.The selling point of this game is that it has quite a lot of polish oft absent from these sorts of titles. Until I complete the game the jury's out on the price, but it does seem there's an awful lot of content to play through here. Would I buy it for full price? Probably not. That being said, it far surpasses its peers on the market, near as I can tell, and feels quite satisfying to play. From what I can tell the 'story' is just some cheesy humor, and I've noted a number of spelling errors.That's it for now.			"

												#Early Impressions - World 3/11 - 8 hours - 23% CompleteTumblestone is a match 3 puzzle game with an emphasis on PUZZLE. Each stage (aside from certain ones) in the main campaign is a specific puzzle that can be solved by selecting sets of 3 like colored blocks to remove those from play, freeing up opportunities to proceed to the same for the rest of the board. Each of the 11 worlds (im only on world 3 at the moment)  consists of around 30 puzzles, which means the game has about 30x11 puzzles (which is a lot obviously).  In every world, the game also introduces mechanics unique for that world. For example, in one world, there are blocks that appear on one turn and then disappear the next turn (and so on).  So the stages never get stale.  There also other game modes, including an endless mode.  Plus there is multiplayer (i havent played, but the campaign does have you play certain stages against an AI). In the end, this is a really well made game that has a lot of content.  The main downside I would see is the asking price is a bit steep for a game like this (on steam at least). But Ive payed more for simialr games on Nintendo DS and such, so I dont think its really too much. I did this in a humble monthly deal though.			"

												[FINAL EDIT: 12-29-16: After another round with the (trying hard to make this right) devs, I have decided to change this to a thumbs up rating.

This is clearly a case of 'oops,♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that happens to all of us. Thanks again to the dev team for continuing to talk this over.] [EDIT: 12-28-16: The devs have reached out to me, which is a good step in the right direction. Please see comments. My original thumbs down still stands but at least an explanation was provided. if there was a neither thumbs up nor thumbs down (sideways thumb?), that would be my current rating. NOTE: This rating does NOT reflect gameplay, purely on the marketing tactics of the company. To those also having issues, the dev has supplied everyone with this:

 ]This is one of the very few times I've written a reivew but this is so astonishing I couldn't sit back and let this be without opening my mouth and letting others know.Very poor marketing decision to tie a demo of this without the user's knowledge during a Humble Bundle promotion of their other game The Bridge. Forcing a product onto my list (and making it a pain to remove, at that) without my consent (or even knowledge) led to confusion and disbelief.In my many, many years of gaming, this is one of the more invasive forms of marketing I've come across and would advise anyone to not support this kind of activity.I, for one, know they have lost any future business they may have had with me and will be spreading this across my network.

												A really clever and unique puzzle game!I'm really into puzzle games, and it's been a while since I've played something as new and fresh as Tumblestone.The basic mechanic is very simple, and at first the game seems easy. As you progress, new twists in the rules are thrown in to the mix and you very quickly find yourself taking a few moments to contemplate each move. With a little thought, you can usually get past each puzzle board after a few tries... At least until the occasional timed or vs. AI level appears, and you have to switch gears and toss the tumblestones as quickly as you can.The game has a quirky story that will make you squint and scratch your head at bit, but most of the time you'll be focusing mastering the new rules that are introduced with each new world you explore.A great addition to the puzzle game genre, with a little more depth than your typical matching game, and hundreds of puzzles to keep you engaged for quite a while.Definitely recommended for fans of Tetris, Bejeweled, and Candy Crush Saga looking for the next challenge.And, it has multiplayer!Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of ""The Bridge"", and met the developer at GDC after playing his first game and was lucky enough to get an invitation to beta test Tumblestone.

												Full Review @ TheVideogameBacklog.comScore: Tasty!With an entertaining story, four-player hectic/friendplunchingly-good multiplayer, smooth gameplay, tough puzzles and a wide assortment of mechanics to test your brain, I can’t recommend Tumblestone enough to anyone who has ever enjoyed a puzzle game before. It’s bright, colorful and inviting which is a good contrast to the gut-punch that is some of the challenges that await you in either story mode or some of the gameplay modifiers that hinder your speed in the multiplayer. While they say that there is 40+ hours for the story mode campaign, I would like to point out that there is a heavy emphasis on the “+” there. With the growing difficulty, I’ll be surprised if I ever truly conquer this game and that’s ok with me.			"

												Tumblestone rocks! I don't normally play match three games but I love well designed puzzle games and also games to play with friends.I bought this a while ago at PAX and I've really enjoyed it. My only reget was not buying more copies for friends. It really shines in multiplayer and especially in local multiplayer. It's a match three puzzle game with a variety of modes which are all fun. It's good if you love puzzles but also enjoy them being fast paced (which is why I've described it as being like reverse tetris in the past). It's a match three game where you try to win before the other players. However, the trick is that it's a puzzle so if you do something in the wrong order you have to restart. You can be very close to being done then realize too late that you've messed up! The campaign is strong but expect some hard puzzles that will stump you right away; the difficulty gets high quickly. Rather than getting necessarily more difficult with each ""world"" it seems that it instead introduces another mechanic each world. Buy this if you want a fun, easy to learn/teach local game for playing with friends or you enjoy fast paced puzzle games to play alone or with online friends/other players.			"

												Don't trust the Metacritic score! With only 5 reviews, Metacritic has this game falsely high scored, tied with Overwatch, MGSV and Baldur's Gate. Yes, there's a nice strategy in this match 3 game, where you must plan out how to reach the top removing 3 color blocks at a time. But as puzzles get bigger, multiple puzzles must be solved in succession, and failing forces you all the way to the beginning can cause much frustration, considering there can only be one solution in most cases.The story isn't very interesting or funny, the character art and backdrops are ugly and bland, and multiplayer COULD be fun, if you and all your friends spend $25 on this lackluster puzzle game.

												I've long lamented the lack of new quality battle puzzle games in the vein of Tetris Attack and Meteos.  Tumblestone's multiplayer mode is the first thing to scratch that itch for me since Planet Puzzle League came out on the DS all the way back in 2007.  The game overall involves several stacks of colored stones (tumblestones) at the top of the screen and you need to ""shoot"" (for lack of a better word) 3 of the same-colored tumblestone in a row to clear them.  You only have access to the first row of tumblestones so you need to avoid getting into a situation where you cannot get at three tumblestones of the same color.  In multiplayer you have three modes.  Puzzle Race involves up to four players trying to be the first to clear an identical board of tumblestones.  If you get into a state where you cannot continue clearing the board, you need to reset and start again.  In Battle the tumblestones slowly move downward.  If the tumblestones hit the bottom, you are eliminated.  If you find yourself in a state where you cannot get to three same-colored tumblestones in a row,  you have no choice byt to make a ""bad move"" (where you shoot a tumblestone followed by a different-colored tumblestone) which causes the tumblestones to shift downwards several rows instantly.  The goal is to be the last surviving player.  Tug of War seems pretty similar to Puzzle Race, but involves multiple sections of smaller puzzles.  There are also a variety of modifiers available for each mode that I haven't gotten the chance to play with yet.  All of the modes require the player to balance speed with trying to plan ahead.  Battle in particular is very compelling and evokes a similar feeling to other classic battle puzzle games while also providing a pretty refreshing take on a match-3 puzzle game.I should point out that for $9.99 you get only the multiplayer component.  For an extra $14.99 you get a full single player campaign (you can upgrade at any time).  If you're interested in the game primarily as a battle puzzle game, you should know that the campaign is not a series matches against bots like it is in some puzzle games, but is instead a series of predetermined puzzle boards for you to solve.  I'm finding this pretty fun as well, but obviously it's a very different feel from the multiplayer mode.  If it doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then you should stick to the base $9.99 multiplayer package.			"

												I love puzzle games and I tried really hard to enjoy this one. The fact that you have to restart the level entirely if you make a mistake is such a poor game design decision. I don't want to do a puzzle 20x just to find a solution.A better way to do this would be giving the player 3 chances to undo a move instead of having to constantly redo the puzzles and retrace your moves. Would have been a better game for me at least.			"

												Tumblestone is an absolutely amazing game in its genre - even if you are sick and tired of the old Match3 nonsense, you'll find that this game is head and shoulders above the rest. The story mode is decent (albeit a bit overlong, for my taste) and the new mechanics that unlock as you progress will make your brain hurt as they modify how you play the game. Arcade mode is an infinite challenge that scratches the same itch as story mode, but in a less structured and incremental way.The multiplayer mode is where this game truly shines - each of the game modes are wonderful and challenging, whether you play against a range of AI bot difficulties or against friends. With both local and online co-op, the head-to-head matchups are fast-paced, intense, and will have you on the edge of your seat.I do feel the game is currently overpriced, but I'm infamously cheap when it comes to games, so take that caveat with a grain of salt.

												Tumblestone is one of those rare games that manages to be easy to pick up and play but tough to master.  It is a great party game to sit and play with a group of friends or to play on your own through the deep story mode or any of the arcade modes that just let you get into a groove and play forever.  The multiplayer has a great rubberbanding mechanic that keeps lower skill players in the game long enough to figure out what they're doing and feel like they're able to compete.  If you like games like Super Puzzle Fighter or Tetris Attack then you can't go wrong with a new take on this formula with Tumblestone.			"

												This game is great. It's simple by design, but it can also prove to be a challenge with the many modes and modifiers it has to offer.Tumblestone is a puzzle game that has you matching 3 of the same colors in order to eliminate them. Very easy to pick up game.I originally bought the multiplayer edition to try things out. Safe to say, it was a blast! Playing against other players in various modifiers and modes was great, but I got stumped many times. You can even give your friends a free code to download a multiplayer version of the game to play with you!After getting absolutely rekt in multiplayer, I decided to upgrade to the full game to fully explore what it has to offer. Story Mode is intersting. I haven't gotten far in the story yet, but it's safe to say it had me going for about an hour trying to figure out the puzzles I got stumped on (i'm looking at you 1-28). I hope to finish it soon, but rest assured, you won't be bored with the story mode. Also, by playing through it, you can unlock more modes and characters!Arcade mode is great too. 3 modes, infnipuzzle, heartbeat (i think), and marathon. All 3 are very fun and a great time killer, with heartbeat being my favorite (fast and intense mode!)Overall, I say this game is well worth it. I've barely scratched the surface, but I know I'm going to play the heck out of this game when I have the time.My only complaint is the lack of chat in multiplayer mode and the playerbase. Then again, this game did just get released at the same time of Necropolis, a very hyped up game. I hope to see more people play this!Both versions are well worth it, but I'd highly reccomend the full game to fully experience Tumblestone.Thanks for reading!			"

I can't say one good thing about this game period. I have no idea how it has such a positive rating. And the fact that only 9% percent of players have completed the first world proves how bad this game is.			"

												It doesn't ""redefine the genre"" like it claims, and several levels I've encountered are just downright frustrating and unenjoyable. In general I like the different mechanics for the worlds, the multiplayer is a blast, and the visuals are nice, it also runs fantastically on my laptop which can barely run bejeweled. I cannot stand the ""solve 4 timed puzzles in a row without messing up because they'll randomize if you do"" which cannot be skipped and are mandatory for story progression, I feel like it's needlessly frustrating and are the worst part of the game in my opinion. The story is also very cringeworthy, littered with pop culture references that are only barely relevant and will quickly wind up very dated. It's like when your dad tries to meme. The price tag is also a bit high for what it is, as I've encountered games with twice the depth, just as much if not more play time, and half the price. However it's a great thing to pick up on sale when it drops below 20$.All in all despite the frustration I think it's a great game to grab on special and will keep you entertained for hours. The core mechanics are solid and entertaining, but be ready for the bit of frustration that comes with it.			"

												I got this in the humble bundle, The gameplay is kind of meh.The story in between levels irritates me.I wanted to change W D from fast move to regular move, Game wont allow it so I have to use arrows.I finally looked at the price of this game and was horrified.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICEIt feels like a mediocre mobile game but is priced as if it is good.So what makes this game mediocre?Basically you have to remove blocks in sets of 3 by selecting 3 of that color, So if you want to remove 3 blue you select 3 blue.I love puzzle games and I love match 3 games but this game gets boring very quickly.If this game was cheap I could recommend trying it but the problem is it isn't. At this price it is a rip off, The game just isn't that fun or interesting to justify the price.If it was on mobile it would be cheap or free so why the hell is it this price on PC?Even if you have lots of disposable income I wouldn't recommend buying it at this price as it just encourages developers to over price.Get it for 90% off or don't get it at all.If you are simply looking for a casual multiplayer game I suggest you look at Tricky towers, Ultimate chicken horse and Move or die.They are all far more fun than this mobile game but they are also a lot cheaper.At some point I am going to fully complete this game to make sure my review is 100% accurate but I am not in a rush to play this bland over priced game when I have much better titles of the same genre			"

												Tumblestone is deviously clever, especially as a multiplayer game.  Easy to pick up, difficult to master - a great party game addition, ranking up there with Towerfall and Nidhogg.  In no time, my friends and I were shrieking with triumph and disbelief.  Controllers recommended.Essentially, you try to find 3 blocks of the same color, with 5 rows to choose from.  Choose wrong and you'll run out of options and have to start over (while your friends complete their puzzle)!  There are tons and tons of challenging mutators that add to the insanity.  There's also a surprisingly deep singleplayer campaign and some really competitive online multiplayer modes with a rotating challenge of the day. Much more content than your average puzzle game.The visuals are simple, but easy to read.  The characters are cute and whimsical, which is infuriating if you've just lost to your friend for the third time!  The sound and music are well done - I liked how the background art and music change depending on who just won the round.  Overall, the game's style is cute, lightning quick and effective.I recommended adding Tumblestone to your game night rotation, and also to people who like singleplayer puzzle games.			"

												I'm going to say ""not recommended with caveats"".Tumblestone is simple. It's not ultra groundbreaking, but it's interesting. It's easy to pick up and, as far as I've played, easy enough to play without getting stumped.Basically, it's kind of like Bust-A-Move, a bit, without the trajectory calculations, and then mixed with a crazy simplified Mahjong. You match three of the same color by shooting from the bottom until the board is empty. That's it, pretty much.What I take issue with, personally, is the price. This isn't god's gift to puzzle games, it's ultra simple and it'd honestly work better as a mobile puzzle game for a buck or two in the Play Store rather than a full-blown puzzle game on desktop. It's clever and kind of fun, actually, but absolutely not worth $25. When and if the price comes down, I may change my recommendation, but at its current price, I simply can't say I'd suggest anyone buy it. There are other puzzle alternatives on Steam that are just as good for far, far less money.			"

												Aesthetically ugly, almost disturbingly so, this game sees fit to start you off with at least 10 levels of the most tedious, boring puzzle gameplay you may ever experience in your life. It's quite simple - you have a stack of colored blocks, and you can only remove blocks from the bottom of the stack. You must remove 3 of the same color in a row, or else you fail and have to start over. That's it. As far as I can tell this is literally the entire game. I was bored to tears in record time with this game because the concept is so simple and the developers give you nothing to change up the formula.I only made it 10 levels in, but here's why: After maybe 15 minutes of this game, nothing new was added to the formula. Nothing changed. Every level felt as if it may as well have been randomly generated from the same algorithm. No progression, very little difficulty, absolutely nothing to latch onto. At level 10, the very first new mecahnic was introduced: basically, a glorified timer. Nothing new, just a time limit you need to complete the level under or else have to restart. And also, it comes with another neat trick: this level is three times as long as the previous ones, because you have to clear three separate fields, one after the other. Naturally, I got stuck at the very end of the third field with 6 blocks left on the board, failed, and it started me back at board one.Immediately uninstalled, hid the game from my library and thanked God that this Humble Monthly came with one of the best puzzle games I've played (The Witness), because quite frankly this game is easily one of the worst. I can't even fathom how the developers can justify the $25 price point. I'm sure there's more to it than what I played, but purely judging on the basis of the disgusting visual design, how poorly they ease you into the difficulty of the puzzles, and how ridiculously long they stretch out the most basic gameplay elements and force you to do the same uninteresting thing over and over again without introducing new concepts, this is definitely a serious contender for the worst puzzle game I've ever played.Also, couldn't help but notice that on the MAIN MENU of the game (keeping in mind, the OPTIONS menu is hidden underneath a sub-menu in EXTRAS) there's a giant option to send a Steam code for this game to a friend. Clearly, this developer is just throwing around every shady tactic they can think of to saturate everyone's Steam libraries with this game.			"

												I got this from Humble Monthly and thought to myself ""Why not?"" so I installed the game and played for a solid 10 minutes before I realised that the trailer for the game has 10 times the production value of the game itself. I mean, seriously guys? I think that the reviews from Destructoid, The Escapist and Ars Technica really show how low those reviewers have sunk (were they ever any good?) if they're saying anything positive about a game that you're selling for £18.99 with such little gameplay value or originality.Let's look at how you play the game, you use the arrow keys to move your avatar left and right and then A & D to ""move quickly"" to either side of the screen, then you can press space to fire at the Tumblestones, match three to take them off of the board and that's that. They don't move, they make stupid ""Bleh"" noises everytime you hit them and if you make one mistake? You start the puzzle again. It honestly couldn't be more mundane, I think the reason there hasn't been an ""original action puzzle game"" in 15 years is because those games had it all covered, this is essentially a worse, reversed, version of Bubble Bobble and I'd much rather play that because it's far more interesting and engaging. It's not an ""action puzzle game"" if you have to restart the level everytime you shoot one block out of order, it's a normal friggin' puzzle game, it discourages you from playing fast because you don't have any room for error.Whether the money from the bundle went towards this complete rip off or not, this game is unpolished, quickly thrown together and quite honestly, not fun! I like puzzle games too but there is so much more on the market for a fraction of the price. Small team or not, it's no excuse to push a terrible game and overcharge for them, that's just adding to the reason that people are scared to buy indie games.Avoid at all costs, it's not worth the installation time......which was all of 2 minutes			"

												This game might have a 40hour story mode, but trust me, you don't want to play it.Uninspired puzzle game with wonky controls and a dev who seems to think he's great because he's made this game all by himself. Be careful about not doing any misclick or you'll be forced to restart the whole level as there are no ways to undo what you've done.			"

												It has some fun bits to it and it has enough charm to be an enjoyable timewaster.  However, there's a ton of free mobile and Facebook games that do this kind of match 3 technique for free or with microtransactions.   The game is a nice addition from the Humble Monthly bundle but $25.00 is about $20.00 overpriced.			"

												I got this game from Humble Monthly yesterday and checked the page, I saw so many negative reviews it got me to play it. It has a very fun playstyle but it repeats so much, it's just not worth $25. But anybody who gets this for free, give it a shot, it's fairly addicting.			"

												First original puzzle game of the last 15 years? Are you kidding me?This game is certainly not what I would describe as original, and it's really not even that fun. All that you need to do is remove colored blocks in sets of 3. You can't switch to another color until you've completed a set, and that's it. It has some tacked-on Egyptian Potato-Head aesthetic, which is bizarre and ugly.I'm not sure what the deal is with this game, the designers sure had high opinions of themselves but it's completely unjustified.

												Fun little puzzle game. I could recommend this game for $5-$15 depending on how much you like match-3 puzzle games, but $25 is excessive for a this game. If you can pick this up as a bundle or on a heavy sale, it is worth a couple hours of fun.One positive thing about this game though, is that at the time of this review the game comes with a free copy of the game that you can give to a friend. That may make the high price tag a little less of an issue for some people.			"

												I'm angry right now. Not because of the game because I got it with some other good titles in a Humble Bundle. No. I'm angry with the obviously bribed critic reviews: 91? Are you trying to tell me that there are some people out there that consider a very simple overpriced connect-three puzzle game as just as good as Dishonoured or Bioshock? Of course there isn't. Read the user reviews instead: 28.The reason that the user reviews are lower is simple: they haven't been bribed.			"

												I've enjoied quite a few arcade-style puzzle games in my day, but the game mechanics in this one end up just being more frustrating instead of fun, making the entire core of the game feel more like a chore to get through than a fun experience to be had.On top of that, the writing in the story mode is really lame, with lots of healf-hearted anti-jokes and head-shaking moments.There's much better options out there if you're looking for a good arcade-style puzzle game. I'd steer clear of this one.			"

So much fun to be had.It breaks every stereotype of the genre that mobile games has built, and it does it within 2 minutes of playing it.Get the Multiplayer Starter Pack and you wont be disappointed :) strategic fast paced plays awesome with a controller/keyboard setup totally has the 'one more game' vibe :D10/10 would Tumblestone all day long.

												This in one innovative match-3 game!  Though I think twenty-five bucks is too expensive. There's a problem finding anyone online for multiplayer. I feel if the developer lowered the price of the game, more people would purchase it, making it possible to find someone online for multiplayer.			"

												One of my thumbs are up and one is down. This is a fun and strategic take on a match 3 game...actually a great game for the genre. Its laid out as a stage map but in a cyclical nature which certainly extends the game.   A casual game that makes you think and strategize at higher levels. (collapse+bubble shooter+chess).My thumbs down is actually the cost unless the game is a BEAST in its entirety...so far it plays as if it has a streamlined footprint.			"
