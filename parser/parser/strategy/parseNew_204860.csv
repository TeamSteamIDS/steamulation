												Personally one of my favourites in the series.  This is the hardest of the game, packing a variety of missions that put you in the shoes of the Penal Units of the Red Army who have to earn redemption for their crimes (or braveries against the Soviet regime) through enemy blood. The missions are essentially suicide - you get a handful of people against vastly outnumbering positions of your enemies, clearing the field for the main army, doing sabotage and reconaissance. The game uses well the advanced possibilities of the upgraded Men of War engine looking somewhat better than the original. I personally love this game particularly because it doesn't give you that much of a story. Men of War typically has bad narrative, so I like to picture it for myself as ""just another moment from the front"". People who enjoy a good challenge in strategies will appreciate this titles.			"

Men of War: Condemned Heroes - Rating: 8.2/10General ImpressionMen of War: Condemned Heroes is a pretty nice strategy game. The graphics and the textures are pretty nice. The atmosphere mostly happens in open fields, villages, cities, forests, and even other environments. The audio is pretty nice. The music is nice. In this game, the music is are stunning and dynamic. Also, the voice acting it probably the best one from the Men of War series. It’s just perfect. When the commander tells you to do something, and it tells it on the right tone, you will damn do it. The gameplay is complex, in each mission you have to accomplish some tasks, alike killing certain enemies, cleaning fields off enemies, destroying some units, reaching a point, capturing a point, etc. The story focuses of the Russian side, but not the normal one: the captured heroes’ one. The penal battalions of it. There is a total of 5 campaigns, with many missions. Many of them are pretty hard, simply because you receive 1 or 2 squads, and you have to conquer an entire enemy battalion. From where, the saying of other reviews: “Here is your squad. Now conquer me this town full of enemies.” The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and well-synthetized information. I also like the overall design of it. The controls are pretty good, except with 1 thing: the rotations’ controls of the cameras. I highly recommend you to reset them with the arrow buttons. The engines, just like in every Men of War game, are not perfect. The game has rarely crashes, and when it crashes, you obviously lose the progress of your mission. Try and save the game as often as you can, in order to avoid too much progress lose. You don't want to waste your time by restarting the mission from zero, right? The mechanics are sophisticated, being pretty nice and everything moves well-optimized. Now, I’m going to talk a little about the G.E.M. editor. Just like in every Men of War game, you have a G.E.M. editor. You can create your own battles in it. It is complex and with a various number of functions. What I don’t like in this particular G.E.M. editor: the amount of content. Compared to Men of War: Assault Squad 1 and 2, this game has less content, especially in the G.E.M. editor. But overall, the G.EM. editor is pretty nice, still. Overall, this game offers a nice simulation of the penal battalions of Russia during World War 2.Positive PointsPretty nice and well-designed graphics and texturesPretty nice audio and nice musicFun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the 6 campaigns availableInfantry, heavy guns, batteries, cannons, vehicles, tanks, airplanes, and many other units available 3 difficulties availableA pretty nice designed user interfaceSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNeutral PointsTrading cards would be a nice featureMore units would be awesomeThe editor should have more content, including being able to drive airplanesNegative PointsThe multiplayer is not alive anymoreThere are some rare crashes, like in all the Men of War games  "

												Okay,so let me get this straight,this game has mixed reviews because it is difficult?Played through the whole campagain without experiencing any bugs,maybe other's were not so fortunate.It is,bear in mind it's very difficult at times if not near impossible but portraits well with the challenges penal comapany soldiers had in the second world war.If you like and are capable of finishing heroic missions in MoW:As 1 or 2,then you are well suited for this type of game.The campagain is moderate in its length(about 24 hours) Here are some tips:>Save spam.>Use rifleman if they are availible because of their high accuracy and capability of killing an enemy with 1 shot within 25m.>Use stealth when you can,entire enemy entrenchments can be eliminated without firing a shot if you go behind the enemy and melee them.>When encountering tanks,shoot at it with any weapon,retreat to a covered position and use your AT granades.If the tank is out of range flank it with another soldier.>Special weapons such as Panzershrecks and K98 snipers can be found on some enemy soldiers.Take these and use them to your advantage.>Loot often,loot wisely.80% of the time your unit will encounter entrenched enemies clustered togather,take them out by lobbing in some granades,granades in this game have an extended range when compared to Mow:As.>Enemy is in a building and you cant kill him? use an AT granade and aim it under him to collapse the building.>Rockets(such as ones found on planes)and other explosive material can be used to make a trap and concecuantly,a big boom.

												A good game with an actual campaign unlike the newer Assualt Squad games that just have the generic missions on different maps. That being said don't buy this game if you like having tanks, there are few that you actually get to use/control. Furthermore this game seems to have the worst AI of any of the Men of War Games, infantry often times derp out and end up getting themselves killed.

												A decent (at best) entry into the Men of War series. EXTREMELY challenging levels. It is rare to start with more than 16 men in any given level and even more rare to receive reinforcement at all. The game chronicles the exploits of the penal battalions, assigned to fight the hardest points and positions as punishment. The game make you FEEL the punishment these men endured. It can be tedious and very frustrating, but the gameplay is as good as any MoW game and the levels are rewarding when you take an entire position with 8 men and your wits.			"

Posted: October 3, 2016
 -Summary- Unfortunately, Condemned Heroes tarnishes the fair name of the ""Men of War"" series.This ""game"" was not developed by Best Way, but was instead whomped up by a large publisher's team of ham-handed developers. At its best, this ""game"" is nothing more than a mod with a small amount of graphical tweaks. At its worst, this ""game"" is a bundle of bug filled, sometimes nearly unplayable missions. -Graphics- Back when this game was just announced on one large gaming website, i remember my excitement. A dozen screenshots depicted updated models of Soviet and German infantry fighting in ruined trenches, large towns being overrun with battered looking tanks, and grim winter landscapes that forebode vast, fierce battles. The idea itself also caught my interest. Instead of commanding ordinary troops, Condemned Heroes promised to unfold World War II from an entierly different perspective. Players would command a Soviet penal battalion, a unit that consisted entierly from convicts and prisoners. This was a very interesting theme, one that was barely explored in WWII games before. But as it often turns out to be, the pre-release screenshots were better than the actual ""game"" itself. It can be concluded now with full confidence, that when making their product, the ""developers"" concentrated on the visual aspect of the game, completely ignoring the actual gameplay. The first thing that catches the eye are the updated infantry models. As soon as this game was announced, this new feature was shown literally in every screenshot, clearly acting as eye candy. And indeed, if ""Condemned Heroes"" has at least one positive element in it, its the new infantry appearance. Many players will agree, that the infantry models in Men of War look very simple, and soviet infantry just looks outright horrible (not because of their historical uniform, but because in Men of War, they have the least amount of detail, except those shiny big black boots). It's no surprise that the infantry was low in detail, because Faces of War (the predecessor of Men of War) came out way back in 2006. Condemned Heroes improves this part of the game by replacing the original infantry models with more realistic looking ones. The textures of the uniforms look much more detailed and sharp, and instead of clay little figures we now command tired, realistic looking ex-cons. Vehicle textures have also been improved with more realistic ones. Tanks are covered with rust and mud. The surrounding enviorment also changed a bit, with many new textures and structure models adorning the battlefield.  -Gameplay- But be that as it may, a standalone game deserves to be called as such not only thanks to the visual content, but also gameplay (otherwise, it's nothing more than a mere mod, and those are usually free). The only two apparent gameplay differences that i saw in Condemned Heroes in comparison to Men of War is a dozen of poorly designed missions and some alleged tweaks (that are a change for the worse) within the physical parameters of the game. Specifically, heavier armor will usually explode upon being hit with AP rounds, while lighter vehicles will NOT explode at all when hit with HE rounds. This makes the game extremely annoying to play, because your damn tank (which is a rarity in the campaign, save for the first mission) instead of being damaged, will get destroyed, and thus the player is forced to reload the game. For the record, you never get reinforcements in any missions throughout the entire campaign, and will usually have to beat missions with two initial squads of soldiers. Any tank or vehicle that you find HAS to be captured and repaired, thus again contributing to the already annoying gameplay. Enemy AI isn't merely stupid, it feels like it's completely absent. Any enemy sequence or action that happens in missions is triggered by certain factors (like a completion of a secondary objective for an example). Otherwise, enemy soldiers and vehicles simply don't do anything. They just stand in place (usually trenches or buildings) and fire away, often not even aiming at your soldiers, but at your allies (computer controlled units). This gives the player a possibility to crawl and flank the unsuspecting enemy, destroying major threats like tanks and gun emplacements with grenades (if the player has patience to play at this point). Some missions are severely bugged and are almost unbeatable, and those several missions that ARE bug free still don't possess any real quality or complexity, instead being dull, boring trash that was seemingly made by a beginner mapper-modmaker. Instead of a tragic, fascinating storyline (like Soldiers: Heroes of World War II or Company of Heroes) with Stalin's political enemies in lead roles, players get a garbage campaign that has no plot value in it whatsoever. Additional content includes a useless reference about Soviet penal battalions during World War II that nobody is going to read anyways, especially amongst western players (and i can't judge them, instead of teaching the gaming audience about the horrors of the eastern front with TEXT, i suggest writing and designing a good in-game plotline instead). In short - you will not easily find an another such flawed game on Steam, and that's considering the fact, that there is a lot of crap out there.  -Audio Quality- Music in Condemned Heroes consists of about 3 tracks, 2 of which are so repetative, that it will make your head hurt. The other track played during a few winter missions late in the game is kinda smooth, reminded me of Warhammer 40k DoW's ""Outer Reaches"". The sound quality is pretty good. Most weapon firing sounds from Men of War were replaced with more realistic, dynamic firearm shots, again contributing to the overall feeling, that Condemned Heroes is more of a mod rather than a seperate game. After all, it ain't hard to change sound files.  -Conclussion- ""Men of War:Condemned Heroes"" AKA ""High Resolution Infantry & Lousy Mappack Mod"" is a kick in the teeth to all fans of the ""Men of War"" series. During all my time writing reviews in Steam, i have never ""Not Recommended"" a single game, often even ""Recommending"" games that got mixed reviews, and therefore opinions. I always try to see something positive in any game, because i respect the time and effort that developers put into its making. But in the case of this here title, i'm going to have to make an exception. Fellow RTS and Wargamers, if you don't value your money, at least value your nerves and stay away from this ""game""... Otherwise, you will just get dissapointed and will go for the uninstall button anyways.P.S: Had to go through the entire campaign of this torture of a game to get all the achievements... It was hell.

												More Men of War? Could this ever be a bad thing? Well that depends, how many times can you capture a German trench? Believe me, by the time you get to the end of Condemned Heroes you should have pretty much mastered the art of assaulting an occupied trench. Condemned Heroes can be difficult at times. Nearly every battle is a Soviet attack and as the game follows a Soviet penal unit, that means your guys are the tip of the spear. As grisly as that sounds, it's the counter attacks you have to watch out for. No sooner have you shot, bashed or exploded the last German soldier must you begin to prepare for the inevitable counter attack. I bet you wished you hadn't thrown anti-tank grenades at the PAK or MG positions now, da, tovarich? I don't think there was ever a counter attack where I wasn't just holding on by the skin of my teeth and hoarded anti-tank grenades [Hard difficulty]. You can begin to appreciate how soldiers felt in such situations when relief finally turned up and helped beat back the attackers. Condemned Heroes is a visually pleasing and tactics intensive game that's only short fall is the focus on the Penal Heroes. Yes, they are the focus of the game but again, how many times must I assault a trench line then defend that trench line. Other games in the Men of War series provide a more varied pallete of missions, Condemned Heroes should only be played by those wanting to truly test their infantry assault tactics. 7/10			"

												Actually this game is not that bad, but don't buy it if you never played any previous or newer versions of Men of War. There's no tutorial in the game and it might be confusing for new players. And senseless - there's only 2 (or so?) campaigns (with plot), quite small, and there's only Russian and German armies, comparing to Assault Squad, where player can also play for US, UK and Japanese armies.Oh, and there's pretty decent sounds and texture quality of units (even better than in 'leading' Assault Squad 2).I think Condemned Heroes is very ABANDONED. It uses GameSpy to play online, and I just couldn't sign up there (maybe because it DIED about 10 years ago).So if you want to have some fun, buy Assault Squad 2 for plot-free Skirmish missions, or Men of War. Condemned Heroes is only for collection.			"

												No where near as good as Assault Squad, the controls out of the box are junk too, not sure what they were thinking.  Very few missions, almost no mutiplayer to speak of, so there's nothing to buy you can't get better from their other titles.  I'd recommend skipping this one, because I think they dropped the ball big time.			"

												Not what I had expected from a MoW game. Fortunately I got it as a present and haven't spent any money to buy it. If you're really looking for a serious tactical (and multiplayer) WW2 strategy experience, buy Men of War Assault Squad instead.			"

												I played this game series since ""soldiers heroes of wwii"". Then play faces of war, men of war etc (some of them i already own a retail copy and buy from steam recently to support them)I mostly play story line mission and It's a quite bad game when u compare the past.Most of time, you are both out-gun and out-number, you have to get everything on battefield to complete your mission.Some of them, like AT gun, mortar, are esstential to complete mission. If you are unlucky, it will be destroy by AI (like off-map artillery, AT grenades, tanks) that force you to restart the mission.Some map are specially crafted, you can't kill enemy in a safe way such that you must fight against them at open which cause you fail. For example: grenade can throw around 20m at same height,  the distance between the closest cover and enemy is 21m. only gap to climb up the hill is covered by enemy MGs and there is no indirect weapon to kill him, no smoke, no sniper rifle. You can draw his attention by gunfire which will scarifie some unit, so he will look at other direction. At some map, load game will change the behaviour of enemy. Change patrol route, go somewhere they won't go normally, see your unit at concealment.You have to play/complete objective in the way they design, otherwise event trigger is broken, for example, reinforcement come at wrong time, no reinforcement, etcand some minor bug.So far, It's a very fun game, only some mission is broken but i have to choose NOT RECOMMENDED.

												All lies posted on the official description for the game as a story about the Penal batallions. The way it is described it is made to sound like it will be on par with Men of War or Red Tide but instead the ""campaigns"" are just disjointed loosely linked skirmishes. Oh and its the buggest of all MoW's by far.No voice acting,briefings, no cutscenes, no story arc. I was expecting an epic story of a criminal batallion trying to redeem their ways in the service of their nation complete with commisars shooting those running away. But instead it is just skirmishes and a paragraph of written dialogue with no reason to care for whats happening.Very disappointed in this game. No where near the quality of Men of War and Red Tide(which were fantastic and story linked with references to missions in both games). It should not be sold as a a multiple campaign story spanning from 1942-1945 standalone game. I gave it to mission 3 and uninstalled a long time ago. Now sitting in my ""Junk"" category of my library. A shame because the other MoW games are great. It also turns out there is only 8 missions in the game.2/10 because the engine is still amazing. Everything else is utter lies and lazy design. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I got it as part of the collection pack so my money was well spent on the other games instead.Faces of War,MoW,Red Tide and Assault Squad are superior in every way.			"

												EDITOR ONLY, STORY NOT REVIEWDI like the men of war series, and with the steam sale I decieded to buy the men of war pack evenh though I already own some of the titels via retailers. So, I welcomed the idea of playing this very Men of War title as it would feature better graphics, which is true compared to the original faced of war/men of war, not that it matters because most of these improvements either don't work(hdr won't work for me) or are too small to be noticed(the higher poly count in the models, tanks are cubical and zooming in to see the faces of soldiers is unwise during combat as it limites your situaltinal awereness). Not that I really cared because I always prefered the ability to have massive battles and ambushes via the editor rather than it looking better, which is my main problem with condemmed heroes: the editor is ruined. It is not ruined as in it is broken, no not at all. It just lists things you can place that are implacable, i.e. they crash the game once selected or placed. Not a big deal, all men of wars have had this problem, they just had it in predictable places. You could easily avoid them but here, no not here. Here they are all over the place. Look at that, gun_1, gun_2, gun_3 and gun_4, very nice except one of these will crash your game, no matter what. even if you only scroll over it: using the mousewheel to navigate the menu=crash. It gets better, as you can select certain items(be it tanks, guns or even soldiers) without crashing the game, but when you place them the game does crash. The number of units is very, very, very small. There are only two factions whith the germans having their regular number of units(less even when it comes to vehicles) and the russian have a lot more units. Sounds nice, doesn't it? Perhaps it does, but some of the russian units make the game crash, or are the same unitmodel but with a name(e.g. John) instead of ''rifleman''. The campaign itself has been untouched as of the writing of this review so I have no idea as to it being any good. Should you like the editor a lot than DON""t  BUY THIS GAME, buy the original or Assault Squad. Everything but this editorial heap of crash.			"

												Men of war Condemned Heroes... This was a very nice game that I had spent my money on and I had a lot of fun with it until it just wouldn't load or open up the game. I went to the link where steam helps you find out the solution and it didn't help at all. Steam needs people on that link to help us find the solution, not just put down some bug reports on a link and think that would help people, that is just so naive of them right? You may think I'm just another low level hater but I used to love this game and play it all the time and now it stopped working just like that. So I am sending this out to you who may be wanting to buy this game and is checking the reviews to see if it is good and I am also sending this out to the owners of steam so they will know what to change in their so called support link off of the games we all play. This is my say on this topic and I hope you can spread the word so we can fix this disaster in the making and get steam to really help us with our problems on their own turf too so they can eliminate it.

												Ugh, the worst of the two exspansions: Essentially a mission pack, but many missions are just a re tread of the same concept of ""here is 10 dudes,  go kill that AA turret somewhere behind a that blob of 200 germans"". There is also very few vehicles to avalible on missions,  which requires heavy exploting of AI controlled units (which for some reason are immortal half the time?), slowly advancing forward, pitching grenades around corners and luring tanks from their spawn. Many maps are clearly not play tested and are just frustrating to play. Writing this review after one of the  last maps, ""The fortress"". An unfun slog where there is a rocket launcher infantry in every building and you have to guide the dumbass AI tanks to a bridge on the other side. Just skip this one, play red tides if your really up for more Men Of War Missions.			"

												So, what we got here...That game, it's actually a mission pack for MoW:Red Tide. You can say that because it uses Red Tide modified engine. Looks like the game was developed in great hurry, the signs of it are everywhere. Missions are hard and interesting, but buggy. Info from in-game encyclopedia is interesting also. Overall, there's a ton of bugs, game often crashes just for using main menu. But despite all flaws, the game was a fun challenge, so I can't regret buying it.6.5/10			"

												The best mow game by farNot as challenging as red tide, it is a close second thoughEven on easy players new to the MOW series will be surpised by the difficultyIn this game you will be sent on extremely difficult, practically suicide missions. Stealth and flanking has never been more critical in a MOW game. You are sent against MASSIVE enemy forces with a tiny squad which will rarely get any reinforcements except for the occasional AI rush of your own forces if you clear out a trench  (or in certain missions, click the begin invasion button)Actually watched as an enemy machine gunner butchered all my men forcing me to attack about 7 more heavily armed enemy trenches with a single riflemanPlus, based of actual soldier's accounts of their expieriences			"

But the game is interesting and still fun to play , fast pace gameplay , behind enemy line and knock out German tanks , SPGs, anti tank guns , anti tank grenade is powerful .			"

												I love Men of War but this one is very frustrating. Most of the time you'll be using 2-6 soldiers to fight against the whole ♥♥♥♥ing German army, even though the map is filled with ""allied"" AI that doesn't even move a finger, so good luck beating the Nazi War Machine with your 4 wimpy soldiers.
